The sound asleep Zhou Mingrui felt an abnormal throbbing pain in his head as though someone had ruthlessly lashed at him with a pole again and again. No, it was more like a sharp object pierced right through his temples followed by a twist!Ouch\u2026 In his stupor, Zhou Mingrui attempted to turn around, look up, and sit up; however, he was completely unable to move his limbs as though he had lost control over his body.From the looks of it, I'm still not awake. I'm still in a dream\u2026 Who knows, perhaps the next scene will be of me thinking I'm already awake, but in fact, am actually still sleeping\u2026Zhou Mingrui, who was not unfamiliar with similar encounters, tried his best to focus in order to escape the shackles placed upon him by the darkness and confusion.However, while still in his reverie, whatever will he could summon was ethereal like a fleeting fog. He found his thoughts difficult to control and introspect. No matter how much he tried, he still lost his focus as random thoughts surfaced in his mind.Why would I suddenly have such an excruciating headache in the middle of the night?And it's really painful!Could it be something like a cerebral hemorrhage?F**k, don't tell me I'm going to die young?I need to wake up! Now!Eh? Why doesn't it seem to hurt as much as before? But why does it still feel like a blunt knife is slicing through my brains\u2026From the looks of it, sleep is impossible. How am I to show up for work tomorrow?Why am I still thinking about work? This is some authentic headache. Of course I have to take time off! I don't have to worry about my manager's grumblings!Hey, putting it that way, it doesn't seem too bad. Hehe, I can end up getting some spare time for myself!Throbbing pain inundated Zhou Mingrui, allowing him to slowly accumulate immaterial strength until he was finally able to move his back and open his eyes. He finally broke free from his reverie.His vision first blurred before it was screened by a faint crimson red. All he could see was a study desk made of burly wood in front of him. Right in the middle was an opened notebook with coarse, yellow pages. The title was eye-catchingly written with strange, deep black lettering.To the left of the notebook was a stack of neatly arranged books, numbering about eight. The wall on their right was inset with grayish-white pipes with wall lamps connected to them.The lamp had a classical Western style to it. It was about half the size of an adult's head with an inner layer of transparent glass and an exterior gridded with black metal.Diagonally beneath the lamp was a black ink bottle shrouded in a pale red glow. Its embossed surface formed a blurry angel pattern.In front of the ink bottle and to the right of the notebook sat a dark-colored pen with a fully circular body. Its tip shimmered with a faint glint while its cap rested right beside a brass revolver.A gun? A revolver? Zhou Mingrui was completely taken aback. The things laid before him were alien to him. It looked nothing like his room!While feeling shocked and confused, he discovered that the desk, notebook, ink bottle, and revolver were covered in a layer of crimson 'veil,' a result of the light shining from the window.Subconsciously, he looked up and shifted his gaze up bit by bit.In midair, a crimson moon hung high above the backdrop of a 'black velvet curtain,' glowing in silence.This\u2026 Zhou Mingrui felt inexplicably horrified as he stood up abruptly. However, before his feet fully straightened, his brain protested with throbbing pain. It made him temporarily lose his strength as he fell uncontrollably. His buttocks slammed heavily onto the burly wood chair.Pa!The pain did little. Zhou Mingrui stood up again by propping himself up. He turned around in a fluster as he began to size up the environment he was in.The room was not very large, with a brown door on each side of the room. Close to an opposite wall was a low wooden bed.Between the bed and the left door was a cabinet. Its two doors were swung open and beneath it were five drawers.To the side of the cabinet, there was the same grayish-white pipe on the wall at the height of a person. However, it was connected to a strange mechanical device with exposed gears and bearings in several spots.Items resembling coal stoves sat in the right corner of the room near the table, along with soup pots, iron pots, and other kitchen utensils.Across the right door was a dressing mirror with two cracks. Its bottom was made of wood and the patterns were simple and plain.With a sweep of his gaze, Zhou Mingrui noticed himself in the mirror\u2014the present him.Black hair, brown eyes, a linen shirt, thinly built, average-looking features and a rather deep outline\u2026This\u2026 Zhou Mingrui immediately drew a gasp as many helpless and confused guesses surfaced in his mind.The revolver in ancient European style and the crimson moon that looked different from Earth's moon could only mean one thing!C-could I have transmigrated? Zhou Mingrui widened his mouth slightly.He had grown up reading web novels and had often fantasized over such scenes. However, he momentarily found it hard to accept the situation when he found himself in one.This was probably what it meant to love afantasy <sup>1</sup> ? In a minute, Zhou Mingrui had already cursed himself while trying to make the best out of his adverse situation.If not for the still throbbing headache that made his thoughts high strung but clear, he would have definitely suspected that he was dreaming.Calm down, calm down, calm down\u2026 After taking a few deep breaths, Zhou Mingrui worked hard to stop panicking.At that moment, as his mind and body calmed down, memories began flooding him as they slowly appeared in his mind!Klein Moretti, a citizen of the Northern Continent's Loen Kingdom, Awwa County, City of Tingen. He is also a recent graduate from the Department of History at Khoy University\u2026His father was a sergeant of the Imperial Army who had sacrificed himself during a colonial conflict with the Southern Continent. The bereavement allowance gave Klein the opportunity to study at a private language school and laid the foundation for his admission into university\u2026His mother was a devotee of the Evernight Goddess. She passed away the year Klein passed the entrance examinations to Khoy University\u2026He also had an elder brother and a younger sister. They stayed in a two bedroom apartment together\u2026Their family was not wealthy and its situation could even be described as somewhat wanting. At present, the family was supported solely by the elder brother who worked at an import and export company as a clerk\u2026As a history graduate, Klein grasped knowledge of the ancient Feysac language\u2014deemed the origin of all languages in the Northern Continent\u2014as well as the Hermes language which often appeared in ancient mausoleums as well as text regarding sacrificial and praying rituals\u2026Hermes language? Zhou Mingrui's mind stirred as he reached out to rub his throbbing temples. He cast his gaze toward the table at the opened notebook. He noticed that the text on the yellowed paper turned from strange to alien, before turning from alien to something familiar. It then turned into something readable.It was text written in Hermes language!The dark ink wrote the following:\"Everyone will die, including me.\"Hiss! Zhou Mingrui felt inexplicably horrified. He instinctively leaned back in an attempt to widen the distance between him and the notebook, as well as the text on it.Being very weak, he nearly fell down but managed to extend his hands in a fluster to hold onto the edge of the table. He felt that the surrounding air was turbulent as though there were faint murmurings resounding in it. The feeling was akin to hearing horror stories being recounted by elders when he was young.He shook his head, believing that everything was an illusion. Zhou Mingrui found his balance and shifted his gaze from the notebook as he heaved for breath.This time, his gaze landed on the shimmering brass revolver. He suddenly had a question arise in him.With Klein's family situation, how can they have the money or means to buy a revolver?Zhou Mingrui could not help but frown.While in deep thought, he suddenly discovered a red handprint to the side of the table. Its color was deeper than the moonlight and much thicker than the 'veil.'It was a bloody handprint!\"A bloody handprint?\" Zhou Mingrui subconsciously flipped his right hand that had been holding the edge of the table. Looking down, he saw that his palm and fingers were covered in blood.At the same time, the throbbing pain in his head continued. Although it had weakened a little, it continued incessantly.Did I smash my head open?Zhou Mingrui guessed as he turned around and walked towards a cracked dressing mirror.A few steps later, a black-haired figure of medium build and brown eyes appeared clearly in front of him. The person had a distinct scholarly air to him.Is this the present me? Klein Moretti?Zhou Mingrui was stunned momentarily. Since there was insufficient lighting at night, he failed to see something clearly. He continued forward until he was just a step short from colliding with the mirror.Using the crimson veil-like moonlight as illumination, he turned his head and examined the corner of his forehead.A clear reflection appeared in the mirror. His temple had a grotesque wound with burn marks along its periphery. Blood stained the wound's surroundings and there were grayish-white brain juices squirming slowly within.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

Tap!Zhou Mingrui reeled back in fear at the sight that greeted him. It was as though the person in the dressing mirror was not himself, but a dessicated corpse.How could a person with such grievous wounds be still alive!?He turned his head in disbelief again and checked the other side. Even though he was a distance away and the lighting was poor, he could still see the penetrating wound and dark red blood stains.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dZhou Mingrui drew a deep breath as he tried hard to calm himself.He reached out to press his left chest and sensed his racing heart that exuded immense vitality.He then touched his exposed skin. Beneath the slight coldness was flowing warmth.When he squatted down and after verifying that his knees could bend, Zhou Mingrui stood up again and calmed down.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d he muttered with a frown. He planned to inspect his head injury seriously once more.He took two steps forward and suddenly paused. The moonlight of the sanguine moon was relatively dark, so it was insufficient for his \u2018serious inspection.\u2019A memory fragment triggered as Zhou Mingrui turned his head to look at the grayish-white pipes and the metallic-gridded lamp on the wall right beside the study desk.This was the most common gas lamp of the times. Its flame was stable and its illumination capabilities were excellent.With Klein Moretti\u2019s family situation, even a kerosene lamp was a dream, much less a gas lamp. Using candles was most apt for their standing and stature. However, back when he burned the midnight oil four years ago to be admitted into Khoy University, his elder brother, Benson, felt that it was an important matter which their family\u2019s future depended upon. Therefore, he insisted on creating conducive studying conditions for Klein even if it meant taking on debt.Of course, Benson, who was literate and had worked for several years, was not a rash person who did not think of the consequences. He had quite some tricks up his sleeve. He reasoned with the landlord to \u2018raise the apartment\u2019s standards by installing gas pipes to improve the likelihood of rentals in the future.\u2019 The landlord was convinced and provided the money to complete the basic modifications. Then, using the convenience of working at an import and export company, he purchased a brand new gas lamp which was nearly at cost price. In the end, all he needed was to use his savings and did not need to borrow money.After the memory fragment flashed past his mind, Zhou Mingrui came to the desk where he turned the pipe\u2019s valve and began twisting the gas lamp\u2019s switch.With a sputtering sound, a spark sounded from friction. Light did not descend upon Zhou Mingrui as he had expected.He twisted the switch a few more times, but all the gas lamp did was sputter and remain dark.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Retracting his hand and pressing on his left temple, Zhou Mingrui sought for the reason by rummaging through his memory fragments.A few seconds later, he turned around and walked toward the door. He arrived at the machine installation which was similarly inset into the wall and had grayish-white pipes connected to it.This was a gas meter!After seeing the exposed gears and bearings, Zhou Mingrui took out a coin from his trousers\u2019 pocket.It was dark yellow in color and had a bronze shimmer to it. The front of the coin was engraved with a portrait of a crown-wearing man, and there was a \u20181\u2019 on a clump of wheat on the back.Zhou Mingrui knew that this was the most basic currency of the Loen Kingdom. It was called a copper penny. One penny\u2019s purchasing power was roughly three to four yuan before his transmigration. Such coins had other denominations such as the five pence, a halfpence and a quarterpence. Despite the three types, the denominations were not in small-enough units. In everyday life, one had to buy several different things just to spend a single coin from time to time.After flipping the coin\u2014which was only minted and circulated after King George III ascended to the throne\u2014a few times, Zhou Mingrui inserted it into the gas meter\u2019s thin vertical \u2018mouth.\u2019Clink! Clang!After the penny fell to the bottom of the meter, the sound of grinding gears sounded immediately, producing a short but melodious mechanical rhythm.Zhou Mingrui stared at the meter for a few seconds before returning to the burly wood desk. He then reached out to twist the gas lamp\u2019s switch.After some sputtering, there was a sharp sound!A fire plume ignited and rapidly grew. Bright light first occupied the internals of the wall lamp before penetrating the transparent glass, blanketing the room with a warm glow.The darkness quickly receded as the crimson retreated out the window. Zhou Mingrui felt at ease for a baffling reason as he quickly came in front of the dressing mirror.This time, he seriously inspected his temple and did not miss a single detail.After a few rounds of inspection, he realized that apart from the original blood stain, liquid was no longer flowing out of the grotesque wound. It appeared like it had received the best hemostasis and bandaging. As for the slowly squirming grayish-white brain and the discernible growth of flesh and blood around the wound, it meant that the wound might take thirty to forty minutes, or maybe even two to three hours before it would only leave a light scar.\u201cThe restorative effects that transmigration brings?\u201d Zhou Mingrui curled up the right corner of his mouth as he muttered silently.Following that, he let out a long sigh. Regardless, he was still alive!After settling his mind, he pulled open a drawer and took out a tiny piece of soap. He took one of the old and tattered towels hanging by the side of the cupboard and opened the door. He then walked to the public bathroom which was shared by the tenants on the second floor.Yes, I should clean up the blood stains on my head, or I\u2019ll keep looking like a crime scene. It\u2019s fine scaring myself, but if I were to scare my sister, Melissa, when she gets up early in the morning tomorrow, it would be quite problematic!The corridor outside was pitch black. Silhouettes were barely accentuated by the crimson moonlight from the window at the end of the corridor. They looked like a pair of monster eyes that silently observed the living late into the night.Zhou Mingrui lightened his footsteps as he walked towards the communal bathroom with a shuddering fear.When he entered, there was even more moonlight, allowing him to see everything clearly. Zhou Mingrui stood in front of a wash basin and turned the tap\u2019s knob.Upon hearing the gushing sound of water, he suddenly recalled his landlord, Mr. Franky.As water was included in the rent, this short and thin gentleman who wore a top hat, a vest, and a black suit, always inspected the bathroom actively to take note of any sounds of flowing water.If the water gushed too loudly, Mr. Franky would ignore all of his gentlemanly traits by flailing his walking stick and striking the bathroom\u2019s door, shouting things like \u2018Darn thief,\u2019 \u2018Wastage is a shameless matter,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll remember you,\u2019 \u2018If I see this happen another time, scram along with your filthy luggage,\u2019 \u2018Mark my words, this is the most value-for-money apartment in Tingen City. You will not find a more kindly landlord anywhere else!\u2019Putting away those thoughts, Zhou Mingrui used a moist towel to clean the blood stains from his face again and again.After checking himself using the rundown mirror in the bathroom and verifying that all that was left were a hideous wound and a pale face did Zhou Mingrui relax. Then, he took off his linen shirt and used a bar of soap to wash away the bloodstains.At that moment, he knitted his brows and recalled of a possible problem.The wound was too exaggerated and there was too much blood. Apart from his body, his room likely still had signs of his injury!After Zhou Mingrui was done with his linen shirt a few minutes later, he briskly returned to his apartment with a moist towel. He first wiped the blood handprint on the desk and then, using the gas lamp\u2019s illumination, sought out spots which he missed out.He immediately discovered that quite a substantial amount of blood had splattered onto the floor beneath the desk. And there was a yellow bullet to the left side of the wall.\u201cReleasing a round with a revolver pointed at the temple?\u201d After mixing and matching the clues from before, Zhou Mingrui had a rough idea how Klein had died.He was in no hurry to verify his guess. Instead, he seriously wiped away the blood stains and cleaned up the \u2018scene.\u2019 Following that, he took the bullet and returned to the side of his desk. He opened the revolver\u2019s cylinder and poured out the rounds inside.A total of five rounds and a cartridge shell all had a brass luster to them.\u201cIndeed\u2026\u201d Zhou Mingrui looked at the empty cartridge shell in front of him and stuffed the rounds back into the cylinder while nodding.He shifted his gaze to the left and it landed on the notebook\u2019s words: \u2018Everyone will die, including me.\u2019 Following that, even more questions arose in him.Where did the gun come from?Was it suicide or a faked suicide?What kind of trouble could a history graduate of humble origins get himself into?Why would such a suicide method only leave behind so little blood? Was it because I transmigrated in a timely manner and it came with healing benefits?After pondering for a moment, Zhou Mingrui changed into another linen shirt. He sat on the chair and began pondering over more important matters.Klein\u2019s experience was still not something he needed to concern himself with. The true problem was to figure out the reason for his transmigration and if he could return!His parents, relatives, best buddies, and friends. The fascinating world of the Internet and all sorts of delicious delicacies\u2026 These were reasons that prompted his desire to return!Click. Click. Click\u2026 Zhou Mingrui\u2019s right hand was subconsciously pulling out the revolver\u2019s cylinder and slamming it back into place, again and again.Yea, there has not been much difference for me between this period of time and the past. I was just a little unlucky, but why would I transmigrate for no baffling reason?Bad luck\u2026 Yes, I tried a luck enhancement ritual before dinner today!A thought flashed in Zhou Mingrui\u2019s mind, illuminating the memories which were concealed by a fog of confusion.As a qualified keyboard politician, keyboard historian, keyboard economist, keyboard biologist, and keyboard folklorist, he had always deemed himself as \u2018knowing something of everything.\u2019 Of course, his best buddy would often mock him as \u2018only knowing a little of everything.\u2019And one of them was Chinese Divination.When he visited his hometown last year, he had discovered a thread-bound book titled \u2018Quintessential Divination and Arcane Arts of the Qin and Han Dynasty\u2019 at an old bookstore. It looked pretty interesting and could aid him in posturing on the Internet, so he bought it. Unfortunately, his interest was short-lived. The vertical script it used made the reading experience horrible. All he did was flip through the beginning pages before he threw it into a corner.He had experienced a spate of bad luck in the past month\u2014losing his cell phone, customers running away after cheating him, and mistakes at work. Only then did he suddenly recall the luck enhancement ritual written at the beginning of \u2018Quintessential Divination and Arcane Arts.\u2019 Furthermore, the requirements were extremely simple, without any basic foundation requirements.All he needed was to get four portions of the staple food in his area and place them in the four corners of his room. They could be placed on furniture such as tables and cupboards. Then, standing in the middle of the room, he had to take four steps in a counter-clockwise fashion to make a square. The first step required him to sincerely chant \u2018Blessings Stem From The Immortal Lord of Heaven and Earth.\u2019 The second step was to silently chant, \u2018Blessings Stem From The Sky Lord of Heaven and Earth.\u2019 The third step was \u2018Blessings Stem From The Exalted Thearch of Heaven and Earth,\u2019 and the fourth step was \u2018Blessings Stem From The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth.\u2019 After the four steps were taken, he needed to close his eyes and wait five minutes in his original spot. Only then would the ritual be considered complete.Since it did not cost him any money, he found the book, followed what was stipulated, and did it before dinner. However\u2026 nothing happened back then.Who would have guessed that he would actually transmigrate in the middle of the night!Transmigration!\u201cThere is a distinct possibility that it\u2019s due to that luck enhancement ritual\u2026 Yes, I should give it a try here tomorrow. If it\u2019s really because of that, I stand a chance of transmigrating back!\u201d Zhou Mingrui stopped flicking the revolver\u2019s cylinder and suddenly sat straight up.Regardless, he had to give it a try!He had to attempt a Hail Mary!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 - MelissaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 3: MelissaTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosAfter confirming his plan, Zhou Mingrui immediately felt he had a mental crutch. His fear and unease were all swept away into a corner of his mind.Only then did he had the mood to carefully study Klein\u2019s memory fragments.Zhou Mingrui habitually stood up before turning off the pipe\u2019s valve. He watched the wall lamp gradually dim until its flame extinguished before sitting back down. As he subconsciously fiddled with the revolver\u2019s brass cylinder, he pressed the side of his head. He slowly recalled his memories in the crimson-dyed darkness as though he was the most attentive viewer in a movie theater.Perhaps as a result of having a bullet pass through his head, Klein\u2019s memories were like shattered glass. Not only were the memories not contiguous, there were many spots which were clearly missing. For example, memories pertaining to how the exquisite revolver appeared in his possession, whether he had committed suicide, or was killed, as well as the meaning of the words \u2018Everyone will die, including me\u2019 on the notebook, or whether he had participated in anything odd two days before the incident.Not only had these particular memories become fragmented, there were also missing pieces. It was the same even for knowledge he ought to know. In light of the present situation, Zhou Mingrui believed that if Klein were to return to university, it was unlikely he could graduate. This was despite him having left campus just days ago without relaxing one bit.He needs to participate in the Tingen University\u2019s History department interview two days later\u2026The university graduates of Loen Kingdom do not have the tradition of staying at their alma mater\u2026 His mentor had given him a recommendation letter for Tingen University and Backlund University\u2026\u2026Through the window, Zhou Mingrui silently observed the red moon setting in the west. The gradual sinking of the moon continued until faint light glowed from the east, dyeing the horizon golden.At that moment, there was a commotion inside the apartment. Soon, the sound of footsteps approached his door.\u201cMelissa is awake\u2026 She\u2019s really as punctual as always.\u201d Zhou Mingrui smiled. Due to Klein\u2019s memories, seeing Melissa made him feel as though she was really his younger sister.However, I do not have a younger sister\u2026 He immediately contradicted himself.Melissa was different from Benson and Klein. Her rudimentary education was not completed at the Sunday school classes offered by the Church of the Evernight Goddess. When she reached schooling age, the Loen Kingdom had enacted the \u2018Basic Education Law.\u2019 A Primary and Secondary Education Committee was established and was specially provided with funding, increasing the kingdom\u2019s investment into education.In less than three years, under the premise that numerous church schools would be incorporated, many public primary schools were established to strictly maintain the principle of religious neutrality. This was to prevent education from involving itself in the conflicts between the Lord of Storms, Evernight Goddess, and the God of Steam and Machinery.Compared to Sunday school that only cost a copper penny a week, a public primary school\u2019s cost of three pence a week appeared rather expensive. However, the former only provided education every Sunday, whereas the latter provided six days of classes a week. In conclusion, the price was so low that it was almost free.Melissa was different from most girls. From a young age, she enjoyed things like gears, springs, and bearings. Her ambition was to be a steam mechanic.Having suffered from a lack of culture, Benson, who knew the importance of education, supported his sister\u2019s dreams just like how he supported Klein\u2019s university education. After all, Tingen Technical School was only considered secondary education. There was no need for her to attend language school or a public school for more knowledge.In July last year, fifteen-year-old Melissa passed her entrance examinations and fulfilled her dreams of becoming a student at the Tingen Technical School\u2019s Steam and Machinery department. As such, her weekly school fees raised to nine pence.Meanwhile, Benson\u2019s company was affected by the situation in the Southern Continent. There was a drastic drop both in profit and business transactions. More than a third of the employees were retrenched. In order to keep his job and maintain their livelihood, Benson could only accept more arduous tasks. He had to work overtime more frequently or head to places with harsh environments. That was what he was occupied with the past few days.It was not that Klein did not think of helping share his elder brother\u2019s burden but being born a commoner and having been admitted into an average language school, he felt a strong sense of inadequacy when he enrolled into university. For example, as the origin of all languages in the Northern Continent, the ancient language of Feysac was something all the children of nobles and of the wealthy class would learn from a young age. In contrast, he only made first contact with it in university.He faced many similar aspects during his schooling career. Klein nearly gave his all and often stayed up late into the night and woke up early before barely managing to catch up to the others, eventually allowing him to graduate with average results.Memories regarding his elder brother and younger sister remained active in Zhou Mingrui\u2019s mind until he turned the doorknob open. Only then did he jolt awake and remember that he held a revolver in his hand.This was a semi-regulated item!It will scare children!Also, there\u2019s still the wound on my head!With Melissa arriving at any moment, Zhou Mingrui pressed onto his temple and hurriedly pulled open a desk drawer and threw the revolver in before slamming it close.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Melissa looked over curiously when she heard the commotion.She was still in the prime of her youth. Even though she did not have much nutritious food to eat, making her face thin and slightly pale, her skin remained lustrous as it exuded the vibes of a young girl.When Zhou Mingrui saw his sister\u2019s brown eyes look over, he forcibly composed himself and picked up an item beside his hand before calmly closing the drawer to conceal the existence of the revolver. He placed his other hand on his temple, the texture confirming that his wound had already healed!He took out a silver vine-leaf pocket watch and pressed the top gently, causing its cover to flip open.It was a picture of the siblings\u2019 father. It was the most valuable item the Royal Army sergeant left behind, but being a second-hand item, it would often malfunction from time to time in recent years even though he had gotten a watchsmith to fix it. It had embarrassed Benson who enjoyed bringing it with him to elevate his status many a time, so it was thrown away back at home in the end.It had to be said that perhaps Melissa did have talent in machinery. After grasping the principles behind the watch, she borrowed the tools from her Technical School to fiddle with the pocket watch. Recently, she even claimed to have fixed it!Zhou Mingrui looked at the watch\u2019s open cover and saw that the second hand was not moving. Subconsciously, he twisted the top dial to wind the pocket watch.However, despite winding it a few times, he did not hear the sound of taut springs. The second hand remained motionless.\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s broken again.\u201d He looked at his sister while trying to find a topic of conversation.Melissa shot him an expressionless glance and briskly walked over to take the pocket watch away.She stood in her spot and pulled up the button sitting atop the pocket watch. With a few simple turns, the tick-tocking of the second hand sounded.Isn\u2019t pulling the button up usually meant to adjust the time\u2026 Zhou Mingrui\u2019s expression immediately turned blank.At that moment, a bell chimed from a faraway cathedral. It chimed six times, sounding distant and ethereal.Melissa tilted her head to listen to it and pulled the button up once again. Following that, she turned it to synchronize the time.\u201cIt\u2019s okay now,\u201d she said simply without emotion. She then pressed the top button back and handed the pocket watch back to Zhou Mingrui.Zhou Mingrui returned a smile politely in embarrassment.Melissa gave her elder brother a piercing stare before turning to walk to the cupboard. She took her toiletries and towel before opening the door to leave. She headed for the public bathroom.Why did her expression have a look of disparagement and resignation?Is it a look of love and concern for a retarded brother?Zhou Mingrui lowered his head and chuckled. He closed the pocket watch\u2019s cover with a click before opening it again.He repeated this action as his idle thoughts focused on a question.Klein committed suicide without a silencer. Well, I\u2019ll consider it as suicide for now. His suicide should have caused quite a commotion; yet, Melissa, who was just a wall away, did not notice it at all.Was she sleeping too soundly? Or is Klein\u2019s suicide shrouded in mystery to begin with?Click! The pocket watch opened. Clack! The pocket watch closed\u2026 Melissa returned from washing up and saw her brother\u2019s subconscious act of constantly opening and closing the pocket watch.Her gaze was once again glazed with exasperation as she said with a sweet voice, \u201cKlein, take out all the remaining bread. Remember to buy fresh ones today. There\u2019s meat and peas too. Your interview is soon. I\u2019ll make you mutton stewed with peas.\u201dAs she spoke, she moved a stove out from a corner. With some charcoal, she boiled a pot of hot water.Before the water boiled, she opened the cupboard\u2019s lowest drawer and took out what seemed like a treasure\u2014a can of inferior tea leaves. She threw about ten leaves into the pot and pretended that it was real tea.Melissa poured two big cups of tea as she shared two pieces of rye bread with Zhou Mingrui over tea.There is no sawdust or excessive gluten mixed in, but it is unappetizing\u2026 Zhou Mingrui still felt weak and was starving. He forced himself to swallow the bread with the tea while complaining inwardly.Melissa finished eating a few minutes later. After she adjusted her black hair that reached down to her vest, she looked at Zhou Mingrui and said, \u201cRemember to buy fresh bread. All we need is eight pounds. The weather is hot, so the bread will easily spoil. Also, buy the mutton and peas. Remember to buy them!\u201dIndeed, she was showing concern for her dull brother. She even had to repeat to emphasize it another time\u2026 Zhou Mingrui nodded with a smile.\u201cAlright.\u201dRegarding the Loen Kingdom\u2019s pound, Zhou Mingrui matched Klein\u2019s muscle memory with his. He believed it was close to half a kilogram of what he was accustomed to.Melissa did not say anything further. She stood up and tidied the area. After packing away the last bit of bread for lunch, she put on a tattered veil cap that their mother left behind, picked up a self-sewn bag used to carry her books and stationery, and prepared to leave.It was not Sunday, so she had an entire day of classes to attend.Walking from their apartment to Tingen Technical School took about fifty minutes. There were public horse carriages that cost a penny a kilometer with a limit of four pence in the city and six pence in the city outskirts. In order to save money, Melissa would leave ahead of time and walk to school.Moments after she opened the main door, she paused in her footsteps and turned her body halfway, saying, \u201cKlein, don\u2019t buy too much mutton or peas. Benson might come back on Sunday. Oh, and remember we only need eight pounds of bread.\u201d\u201cAlright. Sure thing,\u201d answered Zhou Mingrui exasperatedly.Simultaneously, he repeated the word \u2018Sunday\u2019 a few times in his head.In the Northern Continent, a year was similarly split into twelve months. Every year, there was 365 or 366 days. A week was similarly split into seven days.The splitting of months was a result of astronomical observations. It made Zhou Mingrui suspect whether he was in a parallel world. As for the splitting of days, it was a result of religion. This was because Northern Continent had seven orthodox gods\u2014the Eternal Blazing Sun, the Lord of Storms, the God of Knowledge and Wisdom, the Evernight Goddess, Mother Earth, the God of War, and the God of Steam and Machinery.Watching his sister close the door and leave, Zhou Mingrui suddenly sighed. Soon, his thoughts focused onto the luck enhancement ritual.Sorry, I really wish to return home\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It continued seven times before Zhou Mingrui slowly stood up. He went up front to the cupboard and took out his clothes.A black vest with a matching suit, trousers that clung tightly to his legs, a halved top hat and his faint scholarly air made Zhou Mingrui feel like he was watching an English drama set in the Victorian era.He suddenly muttered softly as he shook his head with a wry smile, \u201cI\u2019m not going for an interview. All I\u2019m doing is buying some ingredients to prepare for my luck enhancement ritual\u2026\u201dKlein was so concerned about his impending interview that it became instinct. When he was not focused enough, he habitually wore his only decent set of clothing.After taking a breath, Zhou Mingrui took off his suit and vest, switching to a brownish-yellow coat. He also changed to a felt hat with a rounded edge of the same color.With his outfit done, he walked to the side of the bed and lifted a square cushion. He reached his hand into an inconspicuous hole beneath and rummaged around before finding an intermediate layer.When he retracted his right hand, there was a roll of notes in his palm. There were about eight notes with faded dark green colors.These were all the savings Benson had at the moment. It even included the living expenses for the next three days. Two of them were five-soli notes and the remaining were one-soli notes.In the Loen Kingdom\u2019s currency system, soli was ranked second. It originated from ancient silver coins. One soli was equivalent to twelve copper pence. They had denominations of one and five soli.At the top of the currency system was the gold pound. They were also paper based but were guaranteed by gold and pegged directly. A gold pound was equivalent to twenty soli. They had denominations of one, five, and ten gold pounds.Zhou Mingrui spread a note and caught a whiff of the faint unique ink.This was the smell of money.Perhaps a result of Klein\u2019s memory fragments or his constant desire for money, Zhou Mingrui felt like he had instantly fallen in love with these notes.Look, their designs are so beautiful. It makes the stern and old-fashioned George III and his two mustaches appear especially adorable\u2026Look, the watermark that can be seen when the note is placed against sunlight is so alluring. The exquisite design for the anti-counterfeit label makes it completely different from those fake fancy schlocks!Zhou Mingrui admired it for nearly a minute before pulling out two one-soli notes. He then rolled up the remaining notes and stuffed them back into the cushion\u2019s concealed layer.After arranging and flattening the cloth around the hole, Zhou Mingrui folded the two notes he had taken out neatly and placed them into the left pocket of his brownish-yellow jacket. He separated the notes from the few pence he had in his trouser pocket.With all of this done, he placed a key into his right pocket and brought a dark brownish paper bag along with him and quickly walked toward the door.His shuffling footsteps slowed down from a brisk pace until it eventually stopped.Zhou Mingrui stood by the door and was unsure when he had already begun to frown.Klein\u2019s suicide was fraught with peculiarities. Would he encounter any \u2018accidents\u2019 if he were to leave just like that?After some deep thought, Zhou Mingrui returned to his desk and pulled open the drawer. He then took out the shimmering brass revolver.This was the only defensive weapon he could think of, and it was the only weapon with sufficient power!Although he had never practicing shooting, just pulling such a revolver out would definitely daunt anyone!He caressed the revolver\u2019s cold metal before stuffing his revolver into the pocket where his notes were. He clasped the money in his palm as his fingers pressed onto the gun\u2019s handle. It was perfectly concealed.Feeling secure, he who knew a little of everything suddenly had a worry.Would I end up misfiring?Being deluged with such a thought, Zhou Mingrui quickly thought of a solution. He drew the revolver and released the cylinder. He then aligned the empty chamber which was a result of the \u2018suicide\u2019 along the gun\u2019s hammer before closing it.This way, even if there was a misfire, he would discharge an \u2019empty round!\u2019After stuffing his revolver back into his pocket, Zhou Mingrui kept his left hand in there.He pressed down on his hat with his right hand and pulled open the door before leaving.The corridor during the day remained dim as limited sunlight shone in from the window situated at the end of the corridor. Zhou Mingrui quickly went down the stairs and left the apartment before taking in the brilliance and warmth of the sun.Although it was almost July, it was still considered the middle of summer. However, Tingen was situated north of the Loen Kingdom, so it had unique climate characteristics. The highest annual temperature was not even 30\u00b0C on Earth, with even cooler mornings. However, the streets were awash with filthy water and strewn junk. From Klein\u2019s memories, this was not a rare sight in low-income communities, even if there were sewers. After all, there were just too many people and people needed to survive.\u201cCome and try our delicious roasted fish!\u201d\u201cHot and fresh oyster soup. Drink a bowl in the morning and feel invigorated all day!\u201d\u201cFresh fish from the port for just five pence apiece!\u201d\u201cMuffins and eel soup make the perfect combination!\u201d\u201cConch! Conch! Conch!\u201d\u201cVegetables freshly plucked from the farms outside the city. Cheap and fresh!\u201d\u2026The mobile hawkers who sold vegetables, fruits, and hot food shouted along the streets as they beckoned the rushing pedestrians. Some of them would stop and carefully compare before purchasing. Others would impatiently wave their hands as they had yet to find work for the day.Zhou Mingrui took in a whiff of the air that mixed both noxious and fragrant aromas. As he clenched the revolver tightly in his left hand, he held the notes tight. He pressed down on his hat with his right hand while passing through the busy street, slouching a little.There was bound to be thieves in populated areas. Furthermore, this street had no lack of poor citizens who were working part time after losing their previous jobs. There were also starving children that were exploited by adults to do their bidding.He proceeded forward until he reached a point where the crowdedness around him restored to normal. He straightened his back and raised his head to look down the street.There was a vagrant accordionist busking. The melody was sometimes pleasant, sometimes fervent.Beside him were several children in ragged clothes with sallow complexions due to malnutrition.They listened to the music and moved to the beat, dancing self-made choreographies. Their faces were filled with joy as though they were a prince or an angel.A deadpan woman passed by; her skirt was dirty and her skin was dull.Her gaze appeared dull and sluggish. Only when she looked at the bunch of children did a faint glow flash. It was as though she had seen herself from three decades ago.Zhou Mingrui overtook her and turned into another street before stopping at Smyrin Bakery.The owner of the bakery was a seventy-plus year old granny named Wendy Smyrin. Her hair was completely grayish-white and she always wore a genial smile. From the beginning of Klein\u2019s memories, she had been here selling bread and pastries.Oh, the Tingen biscuits and lemon cakes she bakes are very delicious\u2026Zhou Mingrui gulped a mouthful of saliva and smiled.\u201cMrs. Smyrin, eight pounds of rye bread.\u201d\u201cOh. Dear Klein, where\u2019s Benson? Is he not back?\u201d Wendy asked smilingly.\u201cIn a few more days,\u201d answered Zhou Mingrui vaguely.As Wendy took the rye bread, she sighed. \u201cHe sure is a hardworking lad. He will have a good wife.\u201dUpon saying this, the corners of her lips curled up as she said playfully, \u201cAll is good now. You have already graduated. You are a history graduate of our Khoy University~ Oh, you will soon be able to earn money. You should not be staying in the apartment you are currently living in. At the very least, you should have a bathroom you can call your own.\u201d\u201cMrs. Smyrin, you seem to be a young and energetic woman today.\u201d All Zhou Mingrui could do was respond with a dry smile.If Klein were to successfully pass his interview and become a lecturer at Tingen University, it was true that his family would immediately be pushed up to a higher socioeconomic status!In his memory fragments, he had once fantasized about renting a bungalow in the suburbs. There would be five or six rooms, two bathrooms, a huge balcony upstairs, two rooms, a dining room, a living room, a kitchen, a bathroom, and an underground storage room on the first floor.This was not a wishful dream. Even a lecturer on probation at Tingen University would have a weekly salary of two gold pounds. After the probationary period, the salary would be raised to three gold pounds and ten soli. One had to know that despite working for so many years, Klein\u2019s brother, Benson, only had a weekly salary of one pound and ten soli. Ordinary workers at a factory did not even get a pound or, at best, a little more. And rent for a bungalow was about nineteen soli to one pound and eighteen soli.\u201cThis is the difference between earning three to four thousand yuan and earning fourteen to fifteen thousand yuan a month\u2026\u201d Zhou Mingrui mumbled to himself.However, all of this was under the premise that he passed either the Tingen University or Backlund University interviews.There were not many other opportunities. People without any connections were unable to get recommendations to become a public servant. And those who studied history were more limited in job opportunities. There was not much demand for private consultants from the aristocrats, banks, or industrial magnates.Taking into account that the knowledge Klein grasped were fragmented and incomplete, Zhou Mingrui felt awkward and guilty towards Mrs. Smyrin\u2019s expectations of him.\u201cNo, I have always been this young,\u201d answered Wendy humorously.As she spoke, she packed the sixteen rye bread she had weighed into the brown paper bag that Zhou Mingrui had brought. She stretched out her right hand and said, \u201cNine pence.\u201dEvery rye bread weighted about half a pound as differences were inevitable.\u201cNine pence? Wasn\u2019t it eleven pence two days ago?\u201d Zhou Mingrui asked subconsciously.It cost 15 pence the month before the previous month.\u201cYou have to thank the people who protested on the streets for the repeal of the Grain Act,\u201d said Wendy as she shrugged.Zhou Mingrui nodded in vague acknowledgment. Klein\u2019s memories regarding this was incomplete. All he remembered was that the core tenet of the Grain Act was to protect the prices of domestic agriculture products. Once the prices rose to a certain level, grain imports from Southern nations like Feynapotter, Masin, Lenburg were stopped.Why would people protest the act?Without saying much, Zhou Mingrui, afraid he would end up pulling out the revolver, carefully took out his notes and handed one of them over to Mrs. Smyrin.He was given three copper pence in change. Stuffing them into his trouser pocket, he took the paper bag containing the bread and headed for the \u2018Lettuce and Meat\u2019 market across the street. He was working hard for the mutton stewed with peas his sister had exhorted.There was a municipal square at the intersection of Iron Cross Street and Daffodil Street. Many tents were erected there, and clowns dressed in odd and funny attires were distributing fliers.\u201cThere\u2019s a circus performance tomorrow night?\u201d Zhou Mingrui glanced at the fliers in the hands of others as he read their contents under his breath.Melissa would definitely like it. However, how much is the entrance fee?With that thought, Zhou Mingrui went closer.Just as he was about to ask a clown with a red and yellow painted face, a hoarse woman\u2019s voice sounded from beside him.\u201cWould you like to try a divination?\u201dZhou Mingrui subconsciously turned his head and saw a woman wearing a pointed hat and a long black dress standing in front of a short tent.Her face was smeared with red and yellow paint and her eyes were a profound grayish-blue.\u201cNo,\u201d Zhou Mingrui shook his head in response. He did not have the spare cash for divination.The woman laughed and said, \u201cMy tarot divination is very accurate.\u201d\u201cTarot\u2026\u201d Zhou Mingrui was instantly dumbfounded.This pronunciation was almost identical to the tarot cards on Earth!And tarot cards from Earth were a set of cards used for divination. They just had graphics that represented different omens.Wait\u2026 He suddenly recalled the origins of tarot divination in this world.It did not originate from the seven orthodox gods nor was it an ancient legacy. Instead, it was created by the Intis Republic\u2019s Consul of that era, Roselle Gusta, more than 170 years ago.This Mr. Roselle invented the steam engine, improved the sailing boat, overthrew the Intis Kingdom\u2019s imperial rule, and was recognized by the God of Craftsmanship. He also became the first Consul of the Intis Republic.Later, he invaded other nations and placed Lenburg and other nations under his protection. He made the Loen Kingdom, Feynapotter, Feysac Empire and other powerful Northern Continent nations bow down to the Intis Republic. Following that, the Republic was then changed to an Empire and he became the self-proclaimed \u2018Emperor Caesar.\u2019It was during Roselle\u2019s rule that the Church of Craftsmanship received its first public holy revelation since the Fifth Epoch. Ever since, the God of Craftsmanship was changed to the God of Steam and Machinery.Roselle also invented tarot divination. He also established the contemporary system of paper-based cards and their playstyles. There were many familiar styles that Zhou Mingrui was familiar with, such as Upgrade, Fighting the Landlord, Texas Poker, and Quint\u2026In addition, the marine fleets he sent out discovered a sea route that led to the Southern Continent through the stormy and turbulent seas. This also began the era of colonialism.Unfortunately, he was betrayed in his old age. In the year 1198 of the Fifth Epoch, he was assassinated by the combined forces of the Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun, the former Intis royal family\u2014the Sauron family, and other aristocrats. He eventually died in the White Maple Palace.This\u2026 To recall such general knowledge suddenly made him facepalm.Could this be a transmigration senior?With this in mind, Zhou Mingrui was intrigued to see what tarot cards looked like. Therefore, he nodded at the pointy hat woman with the painted face and said, \u201cIf the\u2026 well\u2026 price is reasonable, I\u2019ll give it a try.\u201dThe woman immediately said with a laugh, \u201cSir, you are the first one here today, so it\u2019s on the house.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - RitualPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5: RitualTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosFree? Free things cost the most!Zhou Mingrui silently mumbled and decided that he would not purchase any additional services whatever they were. He would firmly refuse them all.If you are really that capable, try divining that I transmigrated here!With this in mind, Zhou Mingrui followed behind the woman whose face was painted red and yellow, stooping low to enter the low tent.The tent\u2019s interior was extremely dark, illuminated only by several beams of light that managed to seep inside. A table covered with paper cards could be made out faintly in the low illumination.The woman with the sharp pointy hat was not affected by this at all. Her long black dress glided as though it was moving over water while she went around to the table. She sat on the opposite side and lighted a candle.The dim yellow light flickered, causing the inside of the tent to appear bright and dark at the same time. It instantly added a much more mysterious feel to the atmosphere.Zhou Mingrui sat down quietly, his gaze sweeping over the tarot cards on the table where he discovered familiar cards like \u201cThe Magician,\u201d \u201cThe Emperor,\u201d \u201cThe Hanged Man,\u201d and \u201cTemperance,\u201d etc.Could Roselle have been a \u2018senior\u2019\u2026 I wonder if he was also a fellow countryman of mine\u2026 Zhou Mingrui mumbled to himself subconsciously.Before he could finish looking at the opened cards on the table, the woman who claimed to have accurate divinations had already reached out her hands to gather all of the cards together. She stacked them into a deck and pushed it in front of him.\u201cShuffle the cards first and cut the deck,\u201d the circus fortune-teller said in a muted voice.\u201cMe? Shuffle?\u201d Zhou Mingrui asked reflexively.The yellow and red paint on the fortune-teller\u2019s face squirmed together as she revealed a slight smile, saying, \u201cOf course, everyone\u2019s destiny can only be unraveled by themselves. I only serve as a reader of it.\u201dZhou Mingrui immediately questioned her warily, \u201cThis reading does not require additional fees, right?\u201dAs a keyboard folklorist, I\u2019ve already seen too many of such tricks!The fortune-teller was visibly taken aback before finally saying muffledly, \u201cIt\u2019s free.\u201dZhou Mingrui, relieved, stuffed the revolver further back into his pocket. Thereafter, he calmly reached out his two hands to shuffle and cut the deck skillfully.\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d He placed the already shuffled tarot cards in the middle of the table.The fortune-teller clasped the cards with both her hands and carefully looked at cards for a while. Then, she suddenly opened her mouth and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I forgot to ask, but what would you like to ask about?\u201dBack when he was wooing his first love, Zhou Mingrui had also done research on tarot cards. He asked unhesitatingly, \u201cPast, present, and future.\u201dThis was a type of divination as part of tarot card interpretation\u2014three cards when opened sequentially symbolized one\u2019s past, present, and future.The fortune-teller nodded first, then curled her lips to reveal a smile and said, \u201cThen please reshuffle the deck. You can only truly get the cards you want if you know what you would like to ask about.\u201dWere you fooling me just now? Do you have to be this petty? Didn\u2019t I only ask a few times if this would be a free service? Zhou Mingrui\u2019s cheeks twitched a little. He took a deep breath and took the tarot deck back to reshuffle and cut it.\u201cThere won\u2019t be any problems this time, right?\u201d He placed the already cut deck back onto the table.\u201cNo problem.\u201d The fortune-teller reached out her fingers and picked a card from the top of the deck. Then she placed it on the left side of Zhou Mingrui. Her voice was going lower and lower as she spoke, \u201cThis card symbolizes your past.\u201d\u201cThis card symbolize your present.\u201d The fortune-teller placed the second card right in front of Zhou Mingrui.Then, she picked the third card and put it on the right side of Zhou Mingrui.\u201cThis card symbolizes the future.\u201d\u201cAlright, which card would you like to see first?\u201d The fortune-teller raised her head up after completing her placement of the cards and gazed deeply at Zhou Mingrui with her grayish-blue eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll have a look at the \u2018present\u2019 first,\u201d Zhou Mingrui said after giving it some thought.The fortune-teller nodded slowly and flipped over the tarot card that was directly in front of Zhou Mingrui.A colorfully dressed character was depicted on this card, wearing ragged headgear with a stick over his shoulder. There was a bindle hanging on the end of the stick and a puppy was following behind him. It was numbered \u201c0.\u201d\u201cThe Fool,\u201d the fortune-teller lightly read out the name of the card with her grayish-blue eyes affixed on Zhou Mingrui.The Fool? The \u201c0\u201d card of tarot? A start? A fresh beginning with all kinds of possibilities? Zhou Mingrui was not even considered an amateur enthusiast of tarot, so he could only make a rough interpretation based on his own impressions of tarot.Just as the fortune-teller was about to say something, the cloth curtains of the tent was suddenly lifted open. The ray of sunlight that shone in was so blinding that it caused the back-facing Zhou Mingrui to instinctively narrow his eyes.\u201cWhy are you impersonating me again! It\u2019s my job to handle the divination for people!\u201d a woman\u2019s voice growled angrily. \u201cReturn to your post quickly! You must remember that you\u2019re just an animal trainer!\u201dAn animal trainer? Zhou Mingrui\u2019s eyes had already adapted to the light by now. He saw a similar-looking woman who was also wearing a sharp pointy hat in a black dress, with her face painted in red and yellow as well. The only difference was that she was taller and had a slimmer physique.The woman who was seating in front of him immediately stood up and said disgruntledly, \u201cDon\u2019t mind this, it\u2019s just that I like doing this. But I have to say, my divination and interpretation can be really accurate sometimes. I\u2019m serious\u2026\u201dShe spoke and lifted up her dress to go around from the side of the table before quickly trotting away from the tent.\u201cSir, would you like me to interpret your cards for you?\u201d the real fortune-teller looked at Zhou Mingrui and asked with a smile.Zhou Mingrui\u2019s lips twitched and asked her sincerely, \u201cIs it free?\u201d\u201c\u2026No,\u201d the real fortune-teller answered.\u201cThen forget it.\u201d Zhou Mingrui pulled his hands back and put them into his pockets. He clutched his revolver and money before stooping again to exit the tent.Damn! He actually got an animal trainer to be his fortune-teller?Was an animal trainer who didn\u2019t want to be a fortune-teller not a good clown?Zhou Mingrui very quickly put this matter behind him. He spent seven pence at the \u2018Lettuce and Meat\u2019 market for a pound of not-so-great mutton. Then, he also bought some tender broad beans, cabbage, onions, potatoes, and other items. Together with the bread that he bought earlier, he spent a total of 25 copper pennies, which converted to two soli and one pence.\u201cThere is really not enough to go around for spending. Poor Benson\u2026\u201d Not only had Zhou Mingrui spent the two notes that he had brought with him, but it was also necessary for him top it up with the one penny he had in his pocket.He just sighed and did not think further about it as he hurried back home.With the staple food, he could now carry out the luck enhancement ritual!\u2026After the second-floor tenants gradually left, Zhou Mingrui was still in no hurry to carry out the ritual. Instead, he translated the \u201cBlessings Stem From The Immortal Lord of Heaven and Earth\u201d and related phrases into the ancient Feysac language, as well as the Loen language. He was intending to try the ritual again the next day in those local languages if the original incantation did not take effect!After all, he had to take into consideration the differences between the two worlds. In Rome, do as the Romans do!As for translating it into an ancient ritual prayer that used the dedicated Hermes language, Zhou Mingrui had a difficult time completing it due to his lack of vocabulary.After readying everything, he finally took out the four loaves of rye bread. He placed one in the corner where the coal stove was originally, one at the bottom inner side of the dress mirror, one at the top of the cupboard where two walls met, and one at the right side of the study table where miscellaneous items were kept.With a deep breath, Zhou Mingrui came to the center of the room and spent a few minutes to calm himself. Then, he took a solemn step forward and went in a counter-clockwise direction in the shape of a square.When he took the first step, he chanted in a low whisper, \u201cBlessings Stem From The Immortal Lord of Heaven and Earth.\u201dThe second step, he sincerely chanted, \u201cBlessings Stem From The Sky Lord of Heaven and Earth.\u201dThe third step, Zhou Mingrui breathed out a whisper. \u201cBlessings Stem From The Exalted Thearch of Heaven and Earth.\u201dAt the fourth step, he spat out a foul breath and meditated in concentration. \u201cBlessings Stem From The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth.\u201dWhen he returned back to the original spot, Zhou Mingrui closed his eyes and waited in his place for an outcome. He had some anticipation in him, some unease, some hope, and some fear.Could he make it back?Was there going to be any effect?Could there be some unexpected situation?The unknown in front of him was tainted with the crimson light of hope. Zhou Mingrui\u2019s thoughts were swirling in his head and was finding it difficult to quell it.It was at this time that he suddenly felt the surrounding air seem to stop, becoming thick and mysterious.Immediately after, a low whisper could be heard beside his ears that sounded at times real, at times sharp, at times imaginary, at times alluring, at times maniacal, and at times crazy.He clearly did not understand the murmuring that went on, but Zhou Mingrui still couldn\u2019t help himself from wanting to listen to it and distinguish what it was saying.His head was in pain again. It was so painful that it felt like someone had stuck a steel drill rod into it.Zhou Mingrui only felt like his head was going to explode. His thoughts were filled with a psychedelic of colors.He knew that something was wrong and tried to open his eyes. However, he wasn\u2019t even able to complete such a simple action.His entire body was getting tighter and tighter and it felt like he could just break apart at any time. At this time, a self-mocking thought came up in Zhou Mingrui\u2019s mind:\u201cIf you didn\u2019t seek death, you wouldn\u2019t die\u2026\u201dHe could no longer bear with it. Just as his mind was going to break, the murmuring of voices faded away and his surroundings became very quiet. The mood was an erratic one.It was not only the mood; Zhou Mingrui felt his own body going through the same sensations as well.He tried once more to open his eyes, an extremely easy task this time.A gray fog appeared over his eyes\u2014haziness, vague, and endless.\u201cWhat\u2019s with this situation?\u201d Zhou Mingrui suddenly looked around him and then lowered his head down to discover that he was floating at the edge of an endless fog.The fog was flowing like water and was dotted with a lot of crimson \u2018stars.\u2019 Some of them were enormous while others were tiny. There was a sense of them being hidden in the deep depths, while others floated over the surface of this water-like fog.Looking at the seemingly holographic sight, Zhou Mingrui reached out his right hand in a half-confused, half-exploring manner to try to touch the crimson \u2018star\u2019 that was seemingly floating on the surface. He was trying to find a way to leave this place.When his hand touched the surface of that star, a water mark suddenly appeared from within his body and agitated the stars into a \u201ccrimson\u201d burst. It looked like a dreamlike burning of flames.Zhou Mingrui got a fright from it. He retracted his right hand in a panic, but accidentally touched yet another crimson star.As a result, this star burst with splendid light as well.In turn, Zhou Mingrui felt his mind empty and his spirit dissipated.\u2026In the Loen Kingdom\u2019s capital, Backlund. Inside a luxurious looking villa at the royal district.Audrey Hall sat in front of a dresser. The markings on it were antiquated and there was a cracked bronze mirror on the surface.\u201cMirror, mirror, awaken\u2026\u201cIn the name of the Hall family, I command you to awaken!\u201d\u2026She switched between many different sayings, but there was no reaction from the mirror at all.After more than 10 minutes, she finally chose to give up and pouted her lips in grievance. She said in a soft murmur, \u201cFather was indeed lying to me. He always tells me that this mirror was the treasure of the Roman Empire\u2019s Dark Emperor, and that it is an extraordinary item\u2026\u201dHer voice trailed off. The bronze mirror which rested on the dresser suddenly glowed with a crimson light that shrouded her completely.\u2026In the Sonia Sea, a three-masted sailboat that looked like an obvious relic was navigating through a storm.Alger Wilson stood on deck, his body undulating with the currents at sea, maintaining his balance easily.He wore a robe embroidered with lightning patterns, and in his hand was a quirky-shaped glass bottle. Bubbles billowed inside the bottle at times, frost turned into snow at times, and signs of gusting wind could be seen at times.\u201cWe\u2019re still short on the Ghost Shark\u2019s blood\u2026\u201d Alger murmured.Then at this moment, a crimson burst appeared in the space between the glass bottle and the surface of his palm. In an instant, it enveloped the surroundings as well.\u2026In the fog of gray mist, Audrey Hall regained her sight. She started reckoning the situation in a state of horror and confusion when she noticed the blurry image of a man on the opposite side of her doing the same as well.Immediately after, the both of them discovered another mystery person standing not far from them who was shrouded in a gray mist.The \u2018mysterious person\u2019 was none other than Zhou Mingrui. He was similarly dumbfounded.\u201cSir, where is this?\u201dAudrey and Alger were startled at first, falling silent in the process. Then, they immediately started speaking in unison.\u201cWhat are you planning on doing?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What do I plan to do here? I would like to know too\u2026 Calming himself down, Zhou Mingrui silently repeated the questions posed by the two.What left the deepest impression on him were neither the sentences formed by words nor the meanings behind them, but the display of bewilderment, vigilance, panic, and reverence by the couple!For some baffling reason, two people had been mysteriously dragged into this world surrounded by gray fog. As the perpetrator, Zhou Mingrui was already feeling abnormally dumbfounded and startled, let alone the couple who was pulled into this mess completely passively!For them, such events and encounters might already be beyond their imaginations, right?Momentarily, Zhou Mingrui thought of two options: The first option was feigning victimhood to hide his true identity, and in turn gain a considerable amount of trust. He could then take a wait-and-see approach and take advantage of his circumstances where necessary. The other option was to maintain his mysterious identity in the eyes of the couple. He could then affect the subsequent development while gleaning valuable information from them.Without the luxury of time to deliberate over the situation, he grasped hold of the thought that flashed across his mind. He made an immediate decision to try out the second idea.Exploit the psychological state of the others to gain the greatest advantage for himself!After a few seconds of silence in the fog, Zhou Mingrui chuckled. With a low but not heavy tone, he calmly spoke as though he was replying to the polite greetings from the visitors, \u201cAn attempt.\u201dAn attempt\u2026 an attempt? Audrey Hall looked at the mysterious guy veiled in the grayish-white fog, and the only thought was that whatever was happening was absurd, funny, horrifying, and weird.She was at the dressing table inside her bedroom only moments ago. But just by turning around, she had \u201ccome\u201d into this place that was filled with gray fog!How inconceivable!Audrey took a breath, revealing an impeccable, courteous smile. She asked in a somewhat perturbed way, \u201cSir, is the attempt over? Might you permit our return?\u201dAlger Wilson also had the intentions to probe Zhou Mingrui in a similar fashion, but his rich experience made him statelier. He held back his impulse and only took on the role of a silent onlooker.Zhou Mingrui looked at the questioner. Looking through the hazy mist, he could roughly see the silhouette of the person in question. It was a tall girl with smooth blond hair, but her exact countenance could not be seen clearly.He did not rush to reply the girl\u2019s question but turned around to look at the man. He had messy dark-blue hair, as well as a medium stature that was not considered stout.Zhou Mingrui suddenly realized something. Once he became stronger or had a deeper understanding of the foggy world, perhaps it was possible for him to see through the fog and discern the girl and the man.In this situation, they are the visitors, and I\u2019m the master!After changing his mindset, Zhou Mingrui instantly noticed details that he had neglected earlier on.The girl with a melodious voice and the mature, withdrawn man both looked considerably incorporeal. Tainted by a faint crimson red, they resembled a projected image of the two crimson red 'stars\u201d beyond the gray fog.This projection was based on the connection between the crimson red and himself, an intangible connection that only he himself could realistically grasp hold of.The projection would disappear once the connection was cut, and the couple would then return\u2026 Zhou Mingrui nodded mildly and looked at the blond, chuckling. \u201cOf course, if you make a formal request, you can return this very moment.\u201dWhen she did not identify any ill intention from his tone, Audrey heaved a sigh of relief. She believed that since a gentleman who was capable of such miraculous things had given his word, he would definitely abide by it stringently.With her mind somewhat mollified, she surprisingly was in no hurry to request her leave. She rolled her virid eyes left and right, which sparkled with an abnormal radiance.She said in an anxious, anticipative and tempted manner, \u201cThis is such a wonderful experience\u2026 Yes, I have always been hoping that something like this would happen. I mean\u2014I like mysteries and supernatural miracles. No, my point is\u2014what I mean is that, Sir, what can I do to become a Beyonder?\u201dShe got more excited as she spoke, so much so she was fumbling over her words. The dream that sprouted in her as a result of listening to thrilling fantasies as told by her elders finally saw the possibility of being materialized.However, with just a few words, she had already forgotten all her previous fears and horrors.Good question! I would also like to know the answer\u2026 Zhou Mingrui complained inwardly.He started to ponder on an answer to the question to maintain his unfathomable image.At the same time, he felt that it was quite unbecoming of him to talk while standing. Shouldn\u2019t he be in a palace, sitting at the head of a long table, and on a mysterious high-back chair engraved with ancient patterns, while silently observing his visitors?As soon as this thought surfaced, the gray fog started to churn, giving both Audrey and Alger a shock.In an instant, they saw a number of towering stone pillars around them. Above them was a vast dome that encapsulated them.This entire edifice looked magnificent, grand and lofty, just like a legendary palace for giants.Directly under the dome where the gray fog gathered, a long, bronze table appeared with ten high-back chairs on either side in a symmetrical arrangement. The back of each chair dazzled and shone faintly with crimson red, drawing the outlines of weird constellations that differed from reality.Audrey and Alger sat face-to-face, sitting next to the Seat of Honor.The girl looked to her sides, and could not help but mumble, \u201cHow fascinating\u2026\u201dIt is certainly fascinating\u2026 Zhou Mingrui extended his right hand and caressed the edge of the bronze table a little while maintaining an unperturbed expression.Alger inspected the surroundings, and after a few seconds of silence, he suddenly opened his mouth, and answered Audrey\u2019s question in place of Zhou Mingrui.\u201cAre you a Loen?\u201cIf you want to become a Beyonder, join the Churches of either the Evernight Goddess, the Lord of Storms, or the God of Steam and Machinery.\u201cThe majority of us will not meet a Beyonder our entire lives. This has caused churches, and even some clergies within some of the biggest churches, to suspect the same. While this is the case, I am certain to tell you that Beyonders still exist in courts, tribunals, and execution agencies. They are still fighting against the dangers that grow in the dark, only that their numbers are much fewer as compared to before and during the early days of the Iron Age.\u201dZhou Mingrui listened attentively, but he tried his best to present himself as paying little attention to Alger\u2019s words, much like how young kids listened to stories.Relying on Klein\u2019s fragmented general knowledge of history, Zhou Mingrui knew clearly that the \u201cIron Age\u201d referred to the current epoch, which was the Fifth Epoch that began 1349 years ago.Audrey silently listened to Alger finish his sentence before sighing.\u201cMister, I know all about what you just said; I even know more than that, including the Nighthawks, the Mandated Punisher, and the Machinery Hivemind, but I don\u2019t want to lose my freedom.\u201dAlger gave a low-sounding laugh, and said vaguely, \u201cYou can\u2019t become a Beyonder without sacrifices. If you don\u2019t consider joining churches and accepting their given challenges, you can only seek the royal families and the few nobles with family histories of more than a thousand years. If not, you can rely on your luck to search for clandestine evil organizations.\u201dAudrey puffed her cheeks subconsciously and looked around in a fluster. After confirming that both the \u201cmysterious man\u201d and Audrey did not notice her tic, she pressed, \u201cAre there no other solutions?\u201dAlger sank into silence. About half a minute later, he turned around to look at the \u201cmysterious man\u201d who was watching the two of them in silence.Realizing that Zhou Mingrui had no plans to make any comment, he looked back at Audrey and said with deliberation, \u201cI have two sets of Sequence 9 Potion formulas.\u201dSequence 9? Zhou Mingrui muttered to himself.\u201cReally? Which two sets?\u201d Audrey clearly knew what the Sequence 9 Potion formulas meant.Alger leaned back slightly, and replied unhurriedly, \u201cAs you know, humanity can only depend on potions to become real Beyonders, while the names of potions come from the \u2018Blasphemy Slate.\u2019 After constant translations intoJotun <sup>1</sup> , Elvish, ancient and modern Hermes, and ancient Feysac, they have undergone changes to match the day and age of that era. The essence is not in their names, but whether they portray the \u2018core characteristics\u2019 of the potions.\u201cI have a Sequence 9 Potion named \u2018Sailor.\u2019 It enables you to have excellent balancing capabilities. Even if you were on a boat in a rainstorm, you will be able to walk about freely as though you were on land. You will also gain immense strength and illusory scales under your skin. They will enable you to swim like a fish and be difficult to catch. You will move agilely underwater just like marine animals. Even without any equipment, you will be able to easily submerge underwater for at least ten minutes.\u201d\u201cSounds great\u2026 the \u2018Keepers of the Seas\u2019 from the Lord of Storms?\u201d\u201cIt was called by that name in the past.\u201d Alger did not pause and continued. \u201cThe second set of Sequence 9 Potions is called \u2018Spectator,\u2019 although I am not sure what it was called in the past. This set of potions enables you to have an exceptionally sharp mind with acute observational abilities. I believe you can understand by what \u2018spectator\u2019 means from watching operas and plays. Just like an audience, spectators judge the \u2018actors\u2019 in the secular world, catching a glimpse of the real thoughts of them through their emotions, conduct, and mantras.\u201dAt this point, Alger emphasized, \u201cYou must remember, regardless of whether you are at an extravagant banquet or a crowded street, spectators can only be spectators forever.\u201dAudrey\u2019s eyes shone as she listened, and spoke after a long while, \u201cWhy? Alright, this is a follow-up question. I-I think I have fallen in love with this feeling\u2014of being a \u2018spectator.\u2019 How can I get this potion\u2019s formula? What can I use to trade with you for it?\u201dAlger looked like he was already prepared as he said in a deep voice, \u201cThe blood of Ghost Sharks, at least 100 milliliters of it.\u201dAudrey nodded her head excitedly, but subsequently asked worriedly, \u201cIf I can get it\u2014and I\u2019m saying if\u2014how do I hand it to you? How can you promise me that you can give the potion\u2019s formula to me in return for the Ghost Shark\u2019s blood, as well as the authenticity of the formula?\u201dAlger said calmly, \u201cI\u2019ll give you an address. I\u2019ll mail the formula to you, or tell you directly here, once I receive the blood of the Ghost Shark.\u201d\u201cAs for promises, I think that both you and I can feel rest assured under the witness of the mysterious sir.\u201dAs he said this, he swept his eyes towards Zhou Mingrui who was sitting up straight at the Seat of Honor.\u201cSir, the fact that you brought us here shows that you have tremendous strength unimaginable to us. Neither one of us would dare violate a promise with you as witness.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Audrey\u2019s eyes sparkled and agreed with excitement.From her perspective, the mysterious gentleman who had unimaginable abilities was definitely an \u201cauthoritative\u201d witness.How could I or the guy opposite me dare trick him!Audrey half-turned her body and looked at Zhou Mingrui earnestly.\u201cSir, please be the witness of our trade.\u201dAt that moment, she then realized that she was all too impolite, having forgotten all along to ask a particular question. She asked hurriedly, \u201cSir, how should we address you?\u201dAlger nodded slightly, and echoed the same question in a serious manner, \u201cSir, how should we address you?\u201dZhou Mingrui was taken aback. He gently rapped his fingers on the bronze table. The contents of the earlier divination flashed across his mind suddenly.He leaned back, withdrew his right hand, and crossed his ten fingers, placing them below his chin. He gave the duo a faint smile.\u201cYou can address me as\u2026\u201dUpon saying this, he paused for a moment. He said amiably and calmly, \u201cThe Fool.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, the voice kept resonating in Audrey\u2019s and Alger\u2019s hearts, stirring up one ripple after another.They never expected such a designation, but they felt that he was deserving of it. The designation perfectly embodied his image as someone mysterious, powerful, and bizarre!After a few seconds of silence, Audrey stood up, held up her skirt slightly and bent her knees, curtseying to Zhou Mingrui.\u201cHonorable Mr. Fool, would you please permit me to take the liberty of requesting you to be the witness of our trade?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Zhou Mingrui\u2019s mind whirred as he answered in a way that matched his status.\u201cIt\u2019s our honor, Mr. Fool.\u201d Alger stood up as well. He bent his back slightly with his right palm over his chest.Zhou Mingrui lowered his right palm and smiled.\u201cContinue, the both of you.\u201dAlger nodded and sat back down before looking at Audrey.\u201cIf you can obtain the Ghost Shark\u2019s blood, get someone to send it to the Warrior &amp; Sea Bar at Pelican Street, in the White Rose Borough of Pritz Harbor. Tell the boss, Williams, that it\u2019s what the \u2018Captain\u2019 wants.\u201cOnce I acknowledge receipt, will you be giving me an address to mail the potion formula to or do you want me to tell it to you here directly?\u201dAudrey thought for a moment before saying with a smile, \u201cI will choose the more secure method. Let\u2019s do it here, although it\u2019s a test of my memory.\u201dSince Mr. Fool had agreed to bear witness for the trade, it also represented that there would be a similar \u2018Gathering\u2019 the next time.With this in mind, she suddenly turned her head as she looked at Zhou Mingrui with sparkling eyes. With a tone of interest, she suggested, \u201cMr. Fool, would you mind making a few more \u2018attempts\u2019 like this?\u201dAlger listened to her suggestion calmly; he was tempted by the suggestion as well. He hurriedly echoed, \u201cMr. Fool, don\u2019t you find such \u2018Gatherings\u2019 interesting? Although your powers exceed our imaginations, there has to be certain domains that you don\u2019t understand or excel in. The person across me is obviously a young lady of lofty stature. I also have my unique set of experiences, insights, mediums, and resources. Perhaps there will come a day when both of us can help you complete something trivial that might be inconvenient for you.\u201dFrom his point of view, the fact that he had been pulled into this space without any warning or any means to resist meant that the mysterious Mr. Fool was in control. Participating in the \u2018Gatherings\u2019 was not necessarily something he could refuse. Therefore, it was better to reap the benefits of this encounter as much as he could to make up for his passive and disadvantaged state.The trio at the long table had different backgrounds, resources, information channels, and comprehension of the mystical domain. If they interacted and enjoyed some limited cooperation, they could produce unpredictable and immeasurable effects!The resource trade that had just been negotiated was one example. Another example would be if he wished to kill someone. He could easily request the Gathering\u2019s members who did not appear to be related to him both on the surface and in reality for help. He could perfectly misdirect any investigators.A young lady of lofty stature\u2026 Was my behavior and accent that obvious? Audrey stared blankly, mouth slightly agape, but she soon jolted back to her senses and nodded her head without any hesitation.\u201cMr. Fool, I think it\u2019s a very good suggestion. As long as this Gathering becomes regular, you can totally leave certain things that are inconvenient for you to us. Of course, it has to be something within our capacities.\u201dFrom the moment he heard the suggestion, Zhou Mingrui was already weighing the pros and cons. More gatherings definitely allowed him to gain more knowledge of the secrets of the Beyonders or other mysteries, a boon for his transmigration back. For example, it was likely that the potion formula would appear at the next gathering because of the \u2018spectators.\u2019 Similarly, the information he gained was bound to be helpful for his present life.However, more gatherings meant it was easier to expose himself!Indeed, regardless of the world, there is no such thing as a free lunch\u2026 Zhou Mingrui extended his right hand again as he rapped the side of the long table with his finger gently.Considering the fact that he was in control of the gathering\u2019s summoning and dismissal, any threat of exposure was within the confines of his control. The pros clearly exceeded the cons, so Zhou Mingrui rapidly made a decision.He stopped his rapping as he smiled at the anticipative and perturbed gazes of the duo.\u201cI\u2019m a person who likes a fair and equal exchange.\u201cYour help will not go unrewarded.\u201cEvery Monday at three in the afternoon, try your best to be alone. After I make a few more attempts and figure out certain things, perhaps you can apply for a leave of absence ahead of time. You will no longer need to worry about being in inappropriate situations.\u201dThis was a form of agreement to Alger\u2019s and Audrey\u2019s suggestions.Audrey had just turned seventeen. Having been taken care of her entire life, she had the character of a young girl. Therefore, she could not help but clench her fist and gradually pump it in front of her chest when she heard The Fool\u2019s reply.Without waiting for Alger to say a word, Audrey said in excitement, her eyes glowing, \u201cThen, shall we give ourselves call signs? After all, we can\u2019t use our real names for conversation.\u201dAlthough I might not be able to deceive Mr. Fool regarding my true identity, the person opposite me poses some danger. I must not let him know who I am!\u201cGood idea,\u201d answered Zhou Mingrui in a simple and relaxed manner.Audrey\u2019s mind immediately began whirring as she aired her thoughts as they came to her.\u201cYou are Mr. Fool which is derived from tarot cards. Then, as a fixed, long-term, and secretive \u2018Gathering,\u2019 we should be uniform in our designations. Yes, I\u2019ll also choose one from the tarot cards.\u201dHer tone slowly turned joyous.\u201cI\u2019ve decided. My designation shall be \u2018Justice!'\u201dIt was one of the twenty-two Major Arcana tarot cards.\u201cWhat about you, Mister?\u201d Audrey cheekily smiled at her \u2018partner\u2019 sitting across her.Alger frowned slightly before relaxing it immediately.\u201cThe Hanged Man.\u201dIt was another Major Arcana card.\u201cAlright, then we can be considered as the founding members of the Tarot Club!\u201d Audrey was the first to blurt it out happily, only to look fearfully at the fog-concealed Zhou Mingrui. \u201cWill that be alright, Mr. Fool?\u201dZhou Mingrui shook his head in amusement.\u201cYou can decide on such trivial matters by yourselves.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201d Audrey was clearly thrilled.Following that, she looked at Alger.\u201cMr. Hanged Man, can you repeat the address again once more? I\u2019m afraid that my memories will fail me.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d Alger was very pleased with Audrey\u2019s seriousness as he repeated the address once more.After repeating it to herself silently thrice, Audrey said again in excitement, \u201cI heard that tarot cards were invented by Emperor Roselle as a game. In fact, doesn\u2019t it come equipped with the power to divine the future?\u201d\u201cNo. Most of the time, divination stems from one\u2019s self. Everyone has something spiritual about themselves, allowing them to attune to the spiritual world and connect to information about themselves at an even higher level. However, ordinary folks are unable to notice this, much less be able to interpret the \u2018signs\u2019 they receive. This information will present itself with the help of divination tools. Let me raise a simple example, dreams and dream interpreters.\u201d Alger took a glance at Zhou Mingrui and seeing no response from him, he refuted Audrey\u2019s claim. \u201cTarot cards are, in fact, such a tool. It uses more symbolism and more logical elements to help us in conveniently and accurately interpreting the signs.\u201dAlthough Zhou Mingrui appeared indifferent, he was actually listening very carefully. It was only at this point that his empty mind slowly became heavy as his head began to feel a throbbing pain.\u201cGot it.\u201d Audrey nodded in agreement. Following that, she emphasized, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I\u2019m not doubting the tarot cards, but I heard that Emperor Roselle had actually created another set of cards, secret and mysterious ones. They were paper cards which symbolized a particular unknown power. There was a total of twenty-two cards that he completed. Later on in life, he referenced them to create the twenty-two Major Arcana tarot cards which are used as a gaming tool. Was what I said correct?\u201dShe looked at Zhou Mingrui as though she was attempting to get an answer from the mysterious Mr. Fool.All Zhou Mingrui did was smile without saying a word. He cast his gaze at The Hanged Man as though he was putting him to the test.Alger subconsciously straightened his back and said in a deep voice, \u201cThat\u2019s right. It is said that Emperor Roselle had seen the Blasphemy Slate and that set of paper cards contain the profound mysteries of the twenty-two paths of the divine.\u201d\u201cTwenty-two paths of the divine\u2026\u201d repeated Audrey with a longing tone.At that moment, Zhou Mingrui\u2019s headache intensified. He felt that his invisible connection with the crimson stars and grayish-white fog was beginning to falter.\u201cAlright, that will be all for today\u2019s gathering,\u201d he said in a deep voice after making the decision immediately.\u201cBy your will.\u201d Alger bowed his head respectfully.\u201cBy your will.\u201d Audrey mimicked The Hanged Man.She still had many questions and thoughts; thus, she was unwilling to have it end so soon.As Zhou Mingrui severed the connection, he said with a smile, \u201cLet us look forward to the next gathering.\u201dThe \u2018stars\u2019 brightened once more as the crimson light receded like water. Just as Audrey and Alger heard Mr. Fool\u2019s words, their figures turned into a blur as they phased away.In a second, the \u2018projection\u2019 shattered as the gray fog restored its silence.As for Zhou Mingrui, he felt himself turning heavy rapidly. His surroundings turned fleeting as his eyes met darkness before changing into dazzling sunlight.He was still standing in the middle of his apartment.\u201cIt was like a dream\u2026 What the heck was that foggy world\u2026 Who or what sort of power created the changes that just happened\u2026\u201d Zhou Mingrui sighed softly. He was completely puzzled as he walked towards the study desk as though his legs were filled with lead.He picked up the pocket watch he placed outside to determine how much time had passed.\u201cTime flowed at the same pace.\u201d Zhou Mingrui made a rough judgment.After putting down his pocket watch, he found himself unable to endure the splitting headache any further. He sat on the chair and lowered his head, using his left thumb and middle finger to massage his temples.After a long while, he suddenly let out a sigh and said in Mandarin, \u201cFrom the looks of it, I won\u2019t be able to return any time soon\u2026\u201dOnly the clueless could be fearless. After witnessing such a fascinating event and learning the situation regarding Beyonders and the mysterious world, Zhou Mingrui no longer dared to rashly try the luck enhancement ritual using ancient Feysac or Loen language.Who knew what other kinds of situation would happen. Perhaps, it would be more bizarre, horrifying, or even a living hell!\u201cAt the very least, I should attempt only when I have a deep mastery of mysticism,\u201d thought Zhou Mingrui helplessly.Thankfully, the so-called Gathering could provide him with help.After another bout of silence, he muttered to himself with a tone of dismay, disappointment, agony, and grief, \u201cFrom this moment forth, I\u2019m Klein.\u201d\u2026Klein tried his best to refocus his solutions and plans so as to purge the negative emotions in him.Perhaps, he could learn the potion formula for \u2018Spectator\u2019 from the side\u2026The \u2018Gathering\u2019 that just happened sure is fascinating. People who reside in different places across the world can reduce hundreds of kilometers to just mere inches and discuss face-to-face while supplying each other\u2019s needs. Uh, speaking of which, this does sound a little familiar\u2026Klein was stunned for a few seconds before he burst out in laughter. Pressing against his temple, he jested under his breath, \u201cWasn\u2019t that a social networking platform?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The three-mast sailboat was tossed around by the crests and troughs of the incoming waves, as if it was being toyed by a giant.The crimson glow in Alger Wilson\u2019s eyes faded. He found himself still remaining on the deck and nothing appeared to have changed.Almost immediately, the quirky-shaped glass bottle in his palm shattered and the frost within melted into the rain. In seconds, there were no longer any traces left that suggested the existence of the wondrous antique.A hexagonal crystal-like snowflake emerged on Alger\u2019s palm. It then faded rapidly until it was seemingly absorbed by the flesh, vanishing completely in the process. Alger nodded his head in a hardly noticeable manner, as if he was thinking about something. He remained still and silent for a full five minutes.He turned around and headed for the cabin. As he was about to enter, a man who wore a similar robe embroidered with lightning patterns emerged from inside.This man, who had soft blond hair, paused and looked at Alger. He held his right fist to his chest and said, \u201cMay the Storm be with you.\u201dAlger replied with the same words and gesture. There were no emotions on his rough face which had a well-defined structure.Alger entered the cabin after the greeting and proceeded to the captain\u2019s cabin situated at the far end of the corridor.Surprisingly, he did not encounter any sailors on the way. The whole place was as quiet as a graveyard.Behind the door to the captain\u2019s cabin, a soft brown carpet overlaid the floor. A bookshelf and a wine rack took the opposite side walls of the room. The books with their yellowish covers and wine bottles with their dark red color looked peculiar under the flickering candlelight.On the desk with the candle, there was a bottle of ink, a quill, a pair of black metallic telescope, and a sextant made of brass.Behind the desk sat a pale middle-aged man wearing a captain\u2019s hat which had a skull on it. As Alger approached him, he said menacingly, \u201cI will not give in!\u201d\u201cI believe you can do it,\u201d Alger said calmly, so calm that it felt like he was commenting on the weather.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The man seemed to be stunned by the unexpected answer.At this very moment, Alger leaned forward slightly and suddenly dashed across the room until they were only separated by the desk.Pa!Alger tightened his shoulder and reached out his right hand to choke the man.Illusory fish scales appeared on the back of his hand as he crazily mustered more strength to choke the man, giving him no time to respond.Crack!Amid the crisp cracking sound, the man\u2019s eyes widened as his body was lifted up.His legs twitched furiously before they soon became motionless. His pupils began to widen as he stared aimlessly. There was a stench from between his legs as his pants gradually turned moist.While lifting the man, Alger lowered his back and strode toward the wall.Bang! He used the man as a shield and smashed forward at the wall. His extremely muscular arm was monstrous.A hole cracked open in the wooden wall, and rain poured in, accompanied by the scent of the ocean.Alger flung the man out of the cabin, straight into the giant waves that resembled mountains.The wind continued to howl in the dark as almighty nature devoured everything.Alger took out a white handkerchief and wiped his right hand carefully before throwing it into the sea as well.He stepped back and waited patiently for company.In less than ten seconds, the blond man from before rushed in and asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cThe \u2018captain\u2019 has escaped,\u201d Alger answered in an annoyed manner as he panted. \u201cI didn\u2019t know he still had some of his Beyonder powers.\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201d the blond man cursed softly.He went up to the opening and stared into the distance. However, nothing was visible except for the waves and the rain.\u201cForget it, he was just extra loot,\u201d the blond man said, waving his arm, \u201cWe will still be rewarded for finding this ghost ship from the Tudor Era.\u201dEven if he was a Keeper of the Sea, he would not have hastily dived into the sea under this weather condition.\u201cThe \u2018captain\u2019 will not be able to survive much longer if the storm continues.\u201d Alger said, as he nodded in approval. The wooden wall was repairing itself at a discernible rate.He gazed at the wall and turned his head subconsciously towards the rudder and the sail.He was perfectly aware of what was going on behind all the wooden planks.The chief mate, the second mate, the crew, and the sailors were not present. There was no living person on board!Amidst all the emptiness, the rudder and the sail moved eerily by themselves.Alger again pictured \u201cThe Fool\u201d who was covered in grayish-white fog and sighed.He turned back and looked outside at the mighty waves and spoke as though in a reverie while filled with anticipation and awe, \u201cA new era has begun\u2026\u201d\u2026Empress Borough, Backlund, capital of the Loen Kingdom.Audrey Hall pinched her cheeks in disbelief of her encounter a while ago.On the dressing table in front of her, the old bronze mirror had shattered into pieces.Audrey cast her gaze downwards and saw the swirling \u201ccrimson\u201d on the back of her hand; it was like a tattoo depicting a star.The \u201ccrimson\u201d gradually faded and disappeared into her skin.Only at this point in time was Audrey certain that it was not a dream.Her eyes twinkled as she grinned. She could not help but stand up before bending down to lift up the hem of her dress.She curtseyed towards thin air and started dancing lively. It was the \u201cAncient Elf Dance, \u201cthe most popular dance among royalty at the moment.She had a bright smile on her face as she moved about gracefully.Knock! Knock! Someone suddenly knocked at her bedroom door.\u201cWho is it?\u201d Audrey immediately stopped her dance and asked as she tidied her dress to look more elegant.\u201cMy Lady, may I come in? You should start to prepare for the ceremony,\u201d Audrey\u2019s maidservant asked from outside the door.Audrey looked into a mirror on the dressing table and quickly wiped the smile from her face, leaving only a tiny hint of a smile.She responded gently after she had ensured everything was presentable, \u201cCome in.\u201dThe doorknob turned and Annie, her maidservant, pushed in.\u201cOh, it cracked\u2026\u201d Annie said as she instantly saw the outcome of the old bronze mirror.Audrey blinked and said slowly, \u201cErm, Yes! Susie was here just now. I am sure you know she likes to wreak havoc!\u201dSusie was a golden retriever that was not so much of a purebred. It was a gift given to her father, Count Hall, when he bought a foxhound. Nevertheless, Audrey adored it.\u201cYou should train it well,\u201d Annie said, as she picked up the pieces of the bronze mirror adeptly and with care, lest it hurt her mistress.As she finished tidying up, she asked Audrey with a smile, \u201cWhich dress do you want to put on?\u201dAudrey thought for a while and answered,\u201d I like the dress designed by Mrs. Guinea for my 17th birthday.\u201d\u201cNo, you can\u2019t wear the same dress twice to a formal ceremony or others will gossip about and question the Hall family\u2019s financial ability,\u201d Annie said, shaking her head in disagreement.\u201cBut I really like it!\u201d Audrey insisted in a gentle manner.\u201cYou can wear it at home or when you attend an event that isn\u2019t so formal,\u201d Annie said firmly, suggesting that it was not negotiable.\u201cThen it will have to be the one with the lotus design along the sleeves given by Mr. Sades two days ago,\u201d Audrey said as she drew in a gasp inconspicuously, maintaining her sweet smile.\u201cYou always have such a good taste,\u201d Annie said as she stepped back and shouted towards the door, \u201cThe sixth dressing room! Ah, forget it, I shall fetch it myself.\u201dMaidservants began to work. The dress, accessories, footwear, hat, makeup, and hairstyle\u2014everything had to be taken care of.When it was almost ready, Count Hall appeared at the door wearing a dark brown waistcoat.He had a hat sharing the same color as his clothes and a nice mustache. His blue eyes were filled with joy, but his loosening muscles, widening waist, and wrinkles were obviously destroying his handsome youth.\u201cThe brightest jewel of Backlund, it is time for our departure,\u201d Count Hall said, knocking at the door twice.\u201cFather! Stop calling me that,\u201d Audrey protested as she got up with the help of the maidservants.\u201cWell then, it\u2019s time to set off, my beautiful little princess,\u201d Count Hall said as he bent his left arm, signaling Audrey to hold his arm.Audrey shook her head slightly and said, \u201cThat is for my mother, Mrs. Hall, the Countess.\u201d\u201cThen this side,\u201d Count Hall bent his right arm with a smile and said, \u201cThis is for you, my greatest pride.\u201d\u2026The Royal Navy base, Pritz Harbor, Oak Island.When Audrey took her father\u2019s arm and walked down the carriage, she was suddenly shocked by the juggernaut in front of her.In the military port not far away, there was a huge ship shimmering with metallic reflections. It did not have a sail, leaving only an observatory deck, two towering chimneys, and two turrets at the ends of the ship.It was so majestic and large that the fleet of sails nearby were like newborn dwarfs clustering around a giant.\u201cHoly Lord of Storms\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, m\u2019lord.\u201d\u201cAn ironclad warship!\u201d\u2026Amidst the furore, Audrey was also shocked by this unprecedented miracle created by mankind. It was an ocean miracle that had never been seen before!It took a while for the aristocrats, ministers, and members of parliament to compose themselves. Then, a black spot on the sky started to grow in size until it occupied a third of the sky and entered everyone\u2019s view. The atmosphere suddenly became solemn.It was a gigantic flying machine with a beautiful streamlined design hovering in mid-air. The deep blue machine had airbags made of cotton which were supported by alloy structures that were strong but light. The alloy structure\u2019s bottom had openings mounted with machine guns, projectile launchers, and muzzles. The exaggerated humming noise from the ignition steam engine and the tail blades produced a symphony that left everyone amazed.The King\u2019s family arrived on their airship, exuding a lofty and indisputable authority.Two swords, each with a ruby crown at the handle, were pointing vertically down and reflected the sunlight on both sides of the cabin. They were the \u201cSword of Judgment\u201d emblem which symbolized the Augustus family and has been passed down from the previous epoch.Audrey was not yet eighteen, so she had not attended the \u201cintroductory ceremony,\u201d which was an event led by the Empress that marked one\u2019s debut into the Backlund social scene, to announce her adult status. Therefore, she could not be nearer to the airship and had to remain silent at the back to watch the entire event.Nevertheless, it did not matter to her. In fact, she was relieved that she did not need to deal with the princes.The \u2018miracle\u2019 that mankind used to conquer the sky touched down gently. The first ones to step down the stairs were the handsome young guards who wore red ceremonial uniforms with white trousers. Decorated with medals, they formed two lines with rifles in hand. They were awaiting the appearances of King George III, his queen, and the prince and princess.Audrey was not new to meeting important people so she showed no interest at all. Instead, she had her attention on the two statue-like black-armored cavalry flanking the king.In this era of iron, steam, and cannons, it was surprising that there was still someone who could bear wearing full armor.The cold metallic luster and the dull black helmet conveyed solemnity and authority.\u201cCould they be the higher-order Disciplinary Paladins\u2026\u201d Audrey recalled snippets of a casual conversation among adults. She was curious but did not dare go close.The ceremony commenced with the arrival of the king\u2019s family. The incumbent Prime Minister, Lord Aguesid Negan, went up to the front.He was a member of the Conservative Party and the second non-aristocrat to become the Prime Minister till this very day. He was given the title of a Lord for his great contributions.Of course, Audrey knew more. The main supporter of the Conservative Party was the present Duke of Negan, Pallas Negan, who was the brother of Aguesid!Aguesid was a slender and almost bald fifty plus year old man with a sharp gaze. He surveyed the area before speaking.\u201cLadies and Gentlemen, I believe you have witnessed this history-making ironclad warship. It has dimensions of 101 by 21 meters. It has an amazing port and starboard design. The armor belt is 457 millimeters thick. The displacement is 10060 tonnes. There are four 305-millimeter main cannons, six rapid-fire cannons, 12 six-pound cannons, 18 six-barrel machine guns, and four torpedo launchers. It can reach a speed of 16 knots!\u201cIt will be the real hegemon! It will conquer the seas!\u201dThe crowd was roused. The mere descriptions were enough to instill fearful images in them, let alone the fact that the actual thing was right in front of them.Aguesid smiled and spoke a few more lines before saluting the king and requested, \u201cYour Majesty, please give it a name!\u201d\u201cSince it will set sail from Pritz Harbor, it should be named \u201cThe Pritz,\u201d George III responded. His expression showed his delight.\u201cThe Pritz!\u201d\u201cThe Pritz!\u201d\u2026The words spread from the Navy Minister and the Admiral of the Royal Navy to all the soldiers and officers on the deck. They all exclaimed in unison, \u201cThe Pritz!\u201dGeorge III ordered the Pritz to set sail for a trial in the midst of the gun salutes and the celebratory atmosphere.Honk!Thick smoke spewed out from the chimneys. The sound from the machinery could be heard faintly beneath the sound of the ship horn.The juggernaut departed from the harbor. Everyone was shocked when the two main cannons at the ship\u2019s bow fired at an uninhabited island in its path.Boom! Boom! Boom!The ground shook as dust shot up into the sky. Shock waves spread out, producing waves in the sea.Satisfied, Aguesid turned back to the crowd and announced, \u201cFrom this day on, doomsday will fall on the seven pirates who call themselves Admirals and the four who call themselves Kings. They can only shiver in fear!\u201cIt is the end of their era. Only the ironclad warship will roam the seas no matter whether the pirates have the powers of the Beyonders, ghost ships, or cursed ships.\u201dAguesid\u2019s chief secretary deliberately asked, \u201cCan\u2019t they build their own ironclad warships?\u201dSome of the nobles and Members of Parliament nodded, feeling that such a possibility could not be eliminated.Aguesid immediately smiled and shook his head slowly as he answered, \u201cImpossible! It will never be possible! Building our ironclad warship required three big coal and steel amalgamators, a scale of more than twenty steel factories, 60 scientists and senior engineers from the Backlund Cannon Academy and Pritz Nautical Academy, two royal shipyards, almost hundred factories for spare parts, an Admiralty, a ship-building committee, a Cabinet, a determined king with excellent foresight, and a great country with an annual steel production of 12 million tonnes!\u201cThe pirates will never achieve it.\u201dHaving said that, he paused and raised his arms before shouting in agitation, \u201cLadies and Gentlemen, the era of cannons and warships has dawned upon us!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 - The NotebookPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 9: The NotebookTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosAfter half an hour of rest, Zhou Mingrui, who now viewed himself as Klein, finally recovered. In the meantime, he found that there were now four black dots on the back of his hand, which happened to form a small square.These four black spots faded and disappeared quickly, but Klein knew that they were still hiding in his body, waiting to be awakened.\u201cFour spots forming a square; is it in correspondence with the four pieces of staple food at the four corners of the room? Does this mean that in the future, I don\u2019t need to prepare the food and can do the ritual and chants immediately?\u201d Klein made a guess.This might seem good, but the emergence of the spots was ominous, and \u201cthings\u201d that one lacked understanding of were always scary.The fact that those inexplicable Chinese Divinations from Earth could produce effects here, the strange transmigration in his sleep, the mysterious murmurings that almost drove him crazy during the ritual, and the mysterious and trippy gray world whose significance he had no idea of made Klein shiver in the hot weather of June.\u201cThe oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest fear is the fear of the unknown.\u201d He recalled this saying as he was experiencing the fear of the unknown acutely.There was in him an unprecedented and irresistible urge to make contact with the mysterious domain, to learn more, and to explore the unknown. There was also a contradicting escape mentality within him compelling him to pretend nothing had happened.Intense sunlight shone through the window onto the desk. It was as if there were grains of gold sprinkled on the desk. Klein gazed at the desk, feeling as though he had come into contact with warmth and hope.He relaxed slightly, and a strong sense of fatigue washed over him.His eyelids were as heavy as lead as they kept closing themselves. It must have been the combined effect of the sleepless night and the tiring encounter.Klein shook his head and pushed himself up with the aid of the desk. He stumbled towards the double-decked bed, completely disregarding the rye bread placed at the four corners of the room. He fell asleep immediately after he lay down.Groan! Groan!Klein was woken up by hunger pangs. When he opened his eyes, he felt rejuvenated.\u201cThere\u2019s still a slight headache.\u201d He rubbed his temples and sat up. He was so hungry that he could eat a horse!He returned to the desk while straightening his shirt. He picked up the silver vine-leaf pocket watch.Pa!The pocket watch\u2019s lid sprang open and the second hand was ticking.\u201cHalf past twelve. I slept for three hours\u2026\u201d Klein put the pocket watch back into his linen shirt pocket in while swallowing.In the Northern Continent, there were 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. Whether each second passed at the same rate here compared to Earth was unknown to Klein.At this moment, he could not even think of terms such as mysticism, rituals or the grayish world. His mind was occupied by one thing\u2014food!He would leave the thinking to after his meals! Only then could he work!Klein picked up the loaves of rye bread from the four corners and wiped off the minute specks of dust on it without any hesitation. He planned on making one of them his lunch.He decided to dig into the offerings because he only had five pence with him and there was a tradition of eating the offerings back in his hometown. After all, there was not any observable change to the bread. It was better to be frugal.Of course, the memory and habits left behind by the original Klein had also played a role.It was a huge waste to use the expensive gas only to light up the room. So, Klein took out a furnace and boiled water with it after adding some coal. He paced around as he waited.Anyone would choke eating those loaves of rye bread without water.Yikes. Life with meat only for dinner is going to be dreadful\u2026 No, wait, this is already an exception. Melissa would only allow our meals to have meat twice a week if not for my upcoming interview, Klein thought, as he looked around, hungry. He had nothing better to do.His eyes seemed to turn avaricious when he set his eyes on the pound of mutton in the cupboard.No, I need to wait for Melissa to eat it together , Klein thought as he shook his head and rejected the idea of cooking half of it right now.Although he often ate outside, he had still developed some basic culinary skills, owing to his living in a big city alone. His dishes were not delicious, but they were at least edible.Klein turned his body around so that the mutton would not 'seduce\u201d him. Then, he suddenly realized that he had also bought peas and potatoes in the morning.Potatoes! Klein immediately had an idea. He quickly turned back to the cupboard and took out two potatoes from a tiny pile of them.He first cleaned the potatoes in the public bathroom and then added them into a pot so they were boiled together with the water.After a while, he sprinkled into the water some yellow coarse salt from the spices container he found inside the cupboard.He waited patiently for a few minutes before lifting the pot and pouring the 'soup\u201d into a few cups and a bowl. He took out the potatoes with a fork and placed them on the desk at the end.Ffffffff!He blew at the potato as he peeled it bit by bit. The fragrance of boiled potato diffused through the air. It smelled very appetizing.He salivated crazily; the heat could not deter him any longer. Klein took a bite despite having the potato only half peeled.How fragrant! It had a powdery texture and tasted sweet as he chewed. He was instantly filled with emotions and he wolfed down the two potatoes. He even ate some of the skin.Then, he held up the bowl and enjoyed the \u2018soup.\u2019 The pinch of salt in water proved to be thirst-quenching.I really enjoyed eating potatoes this way when I was young\u2026 A filled Klein exclaimed in his head. Meanwhile, he tore off a small piece of bread and dipped it into the \u2018soup\u2019 to eat it softened.Perhaps the ritual was too tiring; Klein ate two loaves of bread which amounted to a whole pound.Klein felt he was finally rejuvenated. He enjoyed the joy of life after he drank the \u2018soup\u2019 before tidying up. Then, he took in the lustrous sunshine happily.He sat back at the desk and began planning.\u201cI can\u2019t escape. I must think of a way to come into contact with mysticism and become a Beyonder as mentioned by Justice and The Hanged Man.\u201cI need to overcome the fear of the unknown.\u201cThe only way now is to wait for the next \u2018gathering.\u2019 I need to try listen for the formula of the \u2018Spectator\u2019 potion or other things related to mysticism.\u201d\u201cThere are four more days before Monday. Before that, I need to first figure out the problem with Klein. Why did he commit suicide? What happened to him?\u201dUnable to transmigrate back and wash his hands of everything, Klein picked up the notebook that lay on the table. He wanted to find hints that could help him regain his lost memory fragments.The original Klein obviously had the habit of taking notes. He also liked to write diaries.Klein was fully aware that the cabinet that supported the desk on the right stored a whole stack of completed notebooks.The book he had began on the 10th of May. Matters regarding his school, and mentor, as well as content pertaining to knowledge were at the beginning.\u201c12th May. Mr. Azik mentioned that the common language used by the Balam Empire in the Southern Continent also developed from Ancient Feysac, a branch of Jotun. Why is this so? Does this mean that every sentient living being once spoke the same language? No, there has to be a mistake. According to \u2018The Revelation of Evernight\u2019 and \u2018The Book of Storms\u2019, giants were not the only hegemons of the world in primordial times. There were also elves, mutants, and dragons. Anyways, these are just myths and fantasies.\u201d\u2026\u201c16th May. Senior Associate Professor Cohen and Mr. Azik discussed the inevitability of the Age of Steam. Mr. Azik opined that it was just a coincidence because if it wasn\u2019t for Emperor Roselle, the Northern Continent would still be wielding swords like the Southern Continent. Mentor argued that Mr. Azik had placed too much emphasis on the contribution of an individual. He believes that with progress, even if there wasn\u2019t an Emperor Roselle, there would be an Emperor Robert. Therefore, the Age of Steam might come late, but eventually come nevertheless. I found little meaning in their discussion. I prefer discovering new things and unraveling the hidden past. Perhaps I am more suited to study archeology than history.\u201d\u2026\u201c29th May. Welch found me and told me that he had acquired a notebook from the Fourth Epoch. Oh my Goddess! A notebook from the Fourth Epoch! He didn\u2019t want to ask the archeology department\u2019s students for help so he came to Naya and me to help him decode the contents. How can I refuse? Of course, I can only do it after my graduation defense. I can\u2019t afford diverting my attention at this stage.\u201dThis caught Klein\u2019s attention. Compared to the notes about history and viewpoint disagreements, the appearance of a notebook from the Fourth Epoch might have led to Klein\u2019s suicide.The Fourth Epoch was the epoch before the present \u201cIron Age.\u201d Its history was mysterious and incomplete. Due to the fact that very few tombs, ancient cities, and records had been found, archaeologists and historians could only refer to the ambiguous records provided by the seven major Churches that centered around their religious teachings to roughly form the \u2018original\u2019 picture. They knew the existence of the Solomon Empire, the Tudor Dynasty, and the Trunsoest Empire.Having set his sights on solving the mystery and restoring history, Klein didn\u2019t have much interest in the first three eras, whose roots were closer to legends. He was more interested in the Fourth Epoch, also known as the Age of the Gods.\u201cHmm, so Klein was concerned for his future career and thus focused on the interview. But it was all futile\u2026\u201d Klein could not resist exclaiming.Universities were still very scarce and the majority of students were either from noble or wealthy families. As long as he did not have an extreme mindset, a commoner who had been admitted into university would have been able to build precious social connections through group discussions and networking events despite the prejudice and exclusion from the entrenched social circles.The very generous Welch McGovern was an example. He was the son of a banker from Constant City, Midseashire, Loen Kingdom. He was used to asking Naya and Klein for help because they were always in the same group for work.Without thinking further, Klein continued reading the notebook.\u201c18th June. I have graduated. Farewell, Khoy University!\u201d\u201c19th June. I have seen the notebook. By comparing sentence structures and root words, I discovered that it is a modified form of ancient Feysac. More precisely, over the course of its thousand-year history, the Feysac language had changed constantly, a little at a time.\u201d\u201c20th June. We have deciphered the contents of the first page. The author was a member of a family called Antigonus.\u201d\u201c21st June. He mentioned the Dark Emperor. This is anachronistic with regards to the time this notebook is deduced to be written. Is Professor wrong? Is \u2018Dark Emperor\u2019 a common title for every emperor of the Solomon Empire?\u201d\u201c22nd June. The Antigonus family apparently had a very high standing in the Solomon Empire. The author mentions that he was making a secret transaction with a person named Tudor. Tudor? Is it related to the Tudor Dynasty?\u201d\u201c23rd June. I am trying to restrain myself from thinking about the notebook and going to Welch\u2019s place. I need to prepare for the interview! It\u2019s very important!\u201d\u201c24th June. Naya tells me that they have found something new. I think I need to check it out.\u201d\u201c25th June. From the new deciphered content, the author had accepted a mission to visit the \u2018Nation of the Evernight\u2019 situated at the summit of the highest peak of the Hornacis mountain range. Oh my Goddess! How can a nation exist at the summit of that peak which is over 6000 meters above sea level? How do they survive?\u201d\u201c26th June. Are these strange things real?\u201dThe record ended at this point. Zhou Mingrui transmigrated in the early hours of the 28th.\u201cWhich means to say that there was indeed an entry for June 27th, it\u2019s that line\u2026 Everyone will die, including me\u2026\u201d Klein flipped to the page he first saw when he arrived, feeling goosebumps while he made the deduction.In order to solve the mystery of the original Klein\u2019s suicide, he thought that he should visit Welch and take a look at the ancient notebook. However, with a lot of experience from novels, movies, and TV drama series, he suspected that if they were really related, this visit would be very dangerous\u2014those who went investigating castles despite knowing that they were haunted served as a warning!However, he had to go since escaping would never solve the problem. It would only make things worse, until it welled over and completely drowned him!Perhaps call the police? But claiming to have committed suicide would be silly, right\u2026Knock!Knock, knock!There was a series of quick and forceful knocks.Klein sat straight up and listened.Knock!Knock, knock!The knocks echoed through the empty hallway.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He subconsciously opened the drawer, took out the revolver, and asked vigilantly.The other party was quiet for two seconds before a slightly sharp voice, in Awwa\u2019s accent, replied, \u201cIt\u2019s me, Mountbatten, Bitsch Mountbatten.\u201dThe voice paused for a moment before adding, \u201cPolice.\u201dBitsch Mountbatten\u2026 When Klein heard this name, he immediately thought of the owner of this name.He was the policeman in charge of the street where the apartment was located. He was a rude, brutal, hands-on man. But perhaps, only such a man could be a deterrent for alcoholics, thieves, part-time thieves, villains, and hooligans.And his unique voice was one of his trademarks.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be right there!\u201d Klein responded loudly.He had planned to put the revolver back into the drawer but thinking that he had no idea why the police was outside and that they might search the room or do other things, he cautiously ran to the stove where the flames had already been extinguished and put the revolver in it.Then he picked up the coal basket, shook a few pieces into the stove, covered the gun, and finally placed the kettle over the stove to conceal everything.After doing all of that, he tidied up his clothes and quickly approached the door and murmured, \u201cSorry, I just had a nap.\u201dOutside the door stood four policemen in black-and-white checkered uniforms with peak caps. Bitsch Mountbatten, the one with a brown beard, coughed and said to Klein, \u201cThese three inspectors have something to ask you.\u201dInspectors? Klein looked at the shoulder badges of the other three reflexively and found that two of them had three silver hexagons and one had two, both of which looked superior to Bitsch Mountbatten, who had only three chevrons.As a history student, Klein did little to no research into the ranks of police epaulets, except that Bitsch Mountbatten often boasted of being a senior sergeant.So these three are inspectors? Influenced by conversations with Benson, Welch, and his classmates, Klein had the common sense to make way and point into the room.\u201cPlease come in. How might I help you?\u201dThe leader of the three inspectors was a middle-aged man with sharp eyes. He seemed to be able to read the mind of a person and make them fearful. His eyes were wrinkled, and the edge of his hat revealed light brown hair. He looked around the room and asked in a deep voice, \u201cDo you know Welch McGovern?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d Klein quivered and blurted back.\u201cI\u2019m the one asking the questions.\u201d The dignified middle-aged police inspector had a stern look in his eyes.The inspector next to him, also wearing three silver hexagons, looked at Klein and smiled gently.\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. It\u2019s just a routine questioning.\u201dThis policeman was in his thirties, with a straight nose and gray eyes that, like a lake in an ancient forest that no one visited, gave him an indescribable sense of depth.Klein took a breath and organized his words.\u201cIf you mean Welch McGovern, the graduate of Khoy University from Constant, then I\u2019m sure I know him. We are classmates with the same mentor, Senior Associate Professor Quentin Cohen.\u201dIn the Loen Kingdom, \u201cProfessor\u201d was not only a professional title, but also a position, just like the combination of professors and department deans on Earth. That meant there could only be one professor in a university\u2019s department. If an associate professor wanted to become professor, they had to wait for their superior to retire, or force out their superior with their abilities.As talents needed to be retained, the kingdom\u2019s Higher Education Commission had added senior associate professors in the three-level system of lecturers, associate professors and professors after years of observation. This title was given to anyone with high academic achievements or with enough seniority but did not make it to the position of professor.At this point, Klein looked into the eyes of the middle-aged police inspector and thought for a second.\u201cTo be honest, our relationship is quite good. During this period, I met with him and Naya frequently to interpret and discuss the Fourth Epoch notebook that belonged to him. Inspectors, did something happen to him?\u201dInstead of answering, the middle-aged police inspector looked sideways at his gray-eyed colleague.The inspector with the peak cap and ordinary looks replied mildly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Welch has passed away.\u201d\u201cWHAT?\u201d Despite having some hunches, Klein could not help but shout out in astonishment.Welch died just like the original owner of this body?That is a little scary!\u201cWhat about Naya?\u201d Klein questioned hurriedly.\u201cMs. Naya passed away too,\u201d the gray-eyed police inspector said quite calmly. \u201cBoth of them died in Mr. Welch\u2019s house.\u201d\u201cKilled?\u201d Klein had a vague guess.Perhaps it was suicide\u2026The gray-eyed inspector shook his head.\u201cNo, the scene suggests that they committed suicide. Mr. Welch hit the wall with his head many times, covering the wall with blood. Ms. Naya drowned herself in a basin. Yes, the kind used to wash your face.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible\u2026\u201d Klein\u2019s hairs stood on their ends as he seemed capable of imagining the strange scene.A girl kneeling on a chair and burying her face into a basin filled with water. Her soft brown hair swaying in the wind, but her entire person remaining motionless. Welch falling to the ground and staring at the ceiling intently. His forehead in a complete blood-mangled mess, while the traces of the impact on the wall were evident the with dripping of blood\u2026The gray-eyed inspector continued, \u201cWe believe so too, but the autopsy results and the situation at the scene exclude factors such as drugs and external forces. They\u2014being Mr. Welch and Ms. Naya\u2014showed no signs of struggling.\u201dBefore Klein could speak again, he stepped into the room and asked, pretending to be casual, \u201cWhen was the last time you saw Mr. Welch or Ms. Naya?\u201dAs he spoke, he gestured with his eyes to his colleague with two silver hexagons.He was a young police inspector and looked about the same age as Klein. With black sideburns and green pupils, he was good looking and had a poet\u2019s romantic temperament.When he heard the question, Klein thought about it and answered it thoughtfully, \u201cIt should be June 26th, we were reading a new chapter in the notes. Then, I went home to prepare for my interview on June 30th. Uh, the interview was for the History Department of Tingen University.\u201dTingen was known as the city of universities. There were two universities, Tingen and Khoy, as well as technical schools, law colleges and business colleges. It was second only to Backlund, the capital.As soon as he finished, he saw the young police inspector walk towards his desk in the corner of his eye and pick up the notes which resembled more of a diary.Damn! I forgot to hide it!\u201cHey!\u201d Klein cried out.The young inspector smiled back at him, but did not stop flipping through his notes, while the gray-eyed inspector explained, \u201cThis is a necessary procedure.\u201dAt this time, Bitsch Mountbatten and the dignified middle-aged police inspectors were just watching without interrupting or assisting in the search.Where are your search warrants? Klein had intended to question them, but on second thought, the judicial system of the Loen Kingdom did not seem to have such a thing as search warrants. At least he did not know if there was one. After all, the police force had only been established for fifteen or sixteen years.When the original owner of this body was still a child, they were still called Public Security Officers.Klein couldn\u2019t stop it. He watched the young inspector flip through his notes, but the gray-eyed inspector did not ask any questions.\u201cWhat is this strange thing?\u201d The young police inspector turned to the end of the notes and suddenly asked, \u201cAnd what does this mean? \u2018Everyone will die, including me\u2019\u2026\u201dIsn\u2019t it common sense that everyone dies except for deities? Klein was prepared to quibble, but it suddenly occurred to him that he had planned to \u201cconnect\u201d with the police in case of possible danger, but he had no reasons or excuses.He made a decision in less than a second. Putting his hand over his forehead, he answered painfully, \u201cI have no idea. I really have no idea\u2026 When I woke up this morning, I felt I wasn\u2019t quite right, as if I had forgotten something. It\u2019s especially true for whatever happened recently. I don\u2019t even know why I had written such a sentence.\u201dSometimes, being frank was the best way to solve a problem. Of course, it required skills. There were things that could be said and could not be said, and the order of what was said first mattered.As an expert keyboard warrior, Klein was also good at sophistry.\u201cThat is ridiculous! Do you think we are fools?\u201d Bitsch Mountbatten could not help but interject angrily.This is such a bad lie that it insults the intelligence of his and his colleagues!It\u2019s better for you to pretend to be mentally ill than to pretend to be an amnesiac!\u201cI\u2019m speaking the truth,\u201d Klein responded frankly, looking into the eyes of Mountbatten and middle-aged police inspectors.It really could not be more true.\u201cMaybe it is,\u201d the gray-eyed police inspector said slowly.What? He really believed it? Klein was surprised himself.The gray-eyed inspector smiled at him and said, \u201cAn expert will come in two days and believe me, she should be able to help you to recall your lost memories.\u201dExpert? Help me remember my memories? In the field of psychology? Klein frowned.Hey, what if his memories of Earth were exposed? He suddenly felt like facepalming himself.The young police inspector put down his notes and searched his desk and room. Fortunately, he focused on books instead of lifting the kettle.\u201cWell, Mr. Klein, thank you for your cooperation. We advise that you\u2019d better not leave Tingen for the coming days. If you have to, please notify Inspector Mountbatten, or you\u2019ll become a fugitive,\u201d the gray-eyed police inspector warned.That\u2019s it? That\u2019s it for today? No other questions with deeper investigations? Or taking me back to the police station to torture me for information? Klein was at a loss.Nevertheless, he wanted to solve the odd turn of events brought about by Welch too. So he nodded.\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be an issue.\u201dThe inspectors exited the room one by one, and the young man at the end suddenly patted Klein on the shoulder.\u201cIt\u2019s really nice. Very lucky.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Klein\u2019s face was puzzled.The green-eyed police inspector with a poet\u2019s temperament smiled and said, \u201cGenerally speaking, the norm is for all the involved parties to die in such an event. We are very glad and fortunate to see you still alive.\u201dAfter that, he exited the room and closed the door behind him in well-mannered manner.The norm is for everyone to die together? Very glad that I\u2019m still alive? Fortunate that I\u2019m still alive?On this June afternoon, Klein was chilling all over.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Very glad that I\u2019m still alive? Fortunate that I\u2019m still alive?Klein shivered and quickly ran to the door, trying to catch up with the policemen and ask for protection.But as soon as he reached the handle, he suddenly stopped.That officer talked so horribly about it, why didn\u2019t they protect me, an important witness or key lead?Isn\u2019t that too careless?Were they just probing me? Or maybe it\u2019s a bait?All kinds of thoughts rushed into Klein\u2019s mind; he suspected that the police were still secretly \u201cwatching\u201d him, observing his reaction.He felt much calmer after thinking of this and was no longer so panicked. He slowly opened the door, deliberately shouting with a trembling voice at the staircase, \u201cYou guys will protect me, right?\u201dTap, tap, tap\u2026 There was no response from the police officers, and there was no change in the rhythm of the contact between the leather shoes and the wooden stairs.\u201cI know! You\u2019ll do that!\u201d Klein shouted again in a tone of feigned conviction, trying to act like a normal person that was in danger.The sound of footsteps gradually weakened and disappeared into the bottom floor of the apartment.Klein snorted and laughed, \u201cIsn\u2019t that response too fake? Their acting skills are not up to standard!\u201dHe did not run after them. Instead, he turned back to the room and closed the door behind him.In the next few hours, Klein fully expressed what they called back in Foodaholic Empire, China\u2014restlessness, nervousness, agitation, inadvertence and murmuring words that he did not understand. He did not slack just because there was no one around.This is called the self-cultivation of an actor! He laughed at himself in his heart.When the sun moved to the west, the clouds on the horizon appeared to be reddish-orange. Tenants in the apartment came home one after another; Klein shifted his focus elsewhere.\u201cMelissa is almost done with school\u2026\u201d He looked at the stove, lifted the kettle, peeled off the coal and took out the revolver.Without pause or delay, he reached to the back of the board under the double-decked bed where more than ten wooden strips were staggered out.After clipping the left wheel between a piece of wooden strip and board, Klein straightened up and waited uneasily, fearing that the police would burst open the door and rush into the room with guns in their hands.If it was an Age of Steam, he was certain he would not be seen by anyone when he did that. However, there were extraordinary powers here, ones that he had proven through his own experiences.After waiting for a few minutes, there was no movement at the door. There was only the chatter between two tenants who were heading for the Heart of the Wild Bar on Iron Cross Street.\u201cPhew.\u201d Klein exhaled, feeling assured.All he needed to do was wait for Melissa\u2019s return and cook the stewed mutton with tender peas!When the idea came to Klein\u2019s mind, his mouth seemed to taste the rich flavor of the gravy; he remembered how Melissa cooked stewed mutton with tender peas.First, she boiled the water and stir-fried the meat. Then, she added onions, salt, a little pepper, and water. After a specific period of time, the peas and potatoes were added, and the stew was to be cooked for an additional forty or fifty minutes with the lid on.\u201cIt\u2019s indeed a simple and crude way to do it\u2026 Supported purely by the flavors of the meat itself!\u201d Klein shook his head.But there was no other way about it. It was hard for commoners to have many kinds of condiments and various cooking methods. They could only pursue simple, practical, and economical methods. As long as the meat was not burnt or spoiled, anything was good for people who could only eat meat once or twice a week.Klein was not a very good cook himself and ordered takeout food most of the time. But by cooking three or four times a week, after many weeks of accumulated practice, he had a passing standard and felt that he would not let the pound of mutton down.\u201cWhen Melissa comes back to cook it, it will be done after 7:30pm. She would be starving by then\u2026 It\u2019s time for her to see what real cooking is!\u201d Klein made an excuse for himself. First, he started the fire again, went to the bathroom to collect water, and washed the mutton. Then he took out the kitchen boards and knives before chopping the mutton into tiny chunks.As for the explanation for his sudden culinary skills, he decided to blame it on the dead Welch McGovern, who had not only hired a chef who was good at the Midseashire flavor, but also often created his own delicacies and invited people to try them.Well, the dead cannot refute me!Nevertheless, tsk, this is a world with Beyonders; the dead are not necessarily unable to speak. With that in mind, Klein was a little guilty conscience.He threw aside his confused thoughts and put the meat into the soup bowl. Then he took out the condiment box and added in a spoonful of the crude salt, half of which had begun yellowing. In addition, he cautiously took some black pepper grains from a special small bottle, mixing and marinating them together.He placed the saucepan on the stove and, while waiting for it to heat up, Klein rummaged for the carrots from yesterday and cut them into pieces with the onions he bought today.When he was done with his preparations, he took out a small can from the cupboard and opened it. There was not much lard left in it.Klein took a spoonful, put it in the pan, and melted it. He added in the carrots and onions and stirred it for a while.As the fragrance began to pervade, Klein poured all the mutton into the pot and fried it with care for a while.He should have added cooking wine in the process, or red wine at least. However, the Moretti family did not have these luxuries and could only drink a glass of beer a week. Klein had to make do with whatever was available and poured in some boiled water.After stewing for about twenty minutes, he opened the lid, put the tender peas and cut potatoes in it, and added a cup of hot water and two spoons of salt.He closed the lid, lowered the fire, and exhaled satisfactorily, waiting for his sister to reach home.As seconds turned into minutes, the fragrance in the room intensified. There was the allure from the meat, the rich smell of potatoes, and the refreshing scent of onions.The smell gradually mixed up, and Klein swallowed his saliva from time to time, keeping track of the time with his pocket watch.After more than forty minutes, some not-so-brisk but rhythmic footsteps approached. A key was inserted, the handle was turned, and the door opened.Before Melissa came in, she whispered doubtfully, \u201cSmells good\u2026\u201dWith her bag still in her hand, she stepped in and glanced over at the stove.\u201cYou made this?\u201d Melissa took off her veil hat and her hand paused mid-air, looking at Klein in astonishment.She twitched her nose and inhaled more of the fragrance. Her eyes quickly softened, and she seemed to find some confidence.\u201cYou made this?\u201d she asked again.\u201cAre you afraid I\u2019d waste the mutton?\u201d Klein smiled and returned with a question. Without waiting for an answer, he said to himself, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I specifically asked Welch to teach me how to cook this dish. You know, he has a good cook.\u201d\u201cFirst time?\u201d Melissa\u2019s eyebrows creased subconsciously, but they were smoothed by the fragrance.\u201cIt looks like I\u2019m talented.\u201d Klein laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s almost done. Put your books and veil hat down somewhere. Go to the bathroom and wash your hands, and then get ready to taste it. I\u2019m very confident about it.\u201dWhen she heard her brother\u2019s orderly arrangements and saw his gentle and calm smile, Melissa stood rooted at the door and failed to respond in her daze.\u201cDo you prefer the mutton to be cooked longer?\u201d Klein urged with a laugh.\u201cAh, okay, okay!\u201d Melissa jolted back to her senses. With handbag and veil in each hand, she rushed into the room quickly.When the lid of the saucepan was uncovered, a sudden blast of steam appeared before Klein\u2019s eyes. Two pieces of rye bread were already placed to the side of the mutton and tender peas, allowing them to absorb the fragrance and heat to become soft.By the time Melissa had packed her items, washed her hands and face, and returned, a plate of stewed mutton with tender peas, potatoes, carrots and onions was already placed on the table. Two pieces of rye bread, colored by a light dip into the gravy, were on their plates.\u201cCome on, try it.\u201d Klein pointed to the wooden fork and spoon next to the plate.Melissa was still a little confused. She didn\u2019t refuse; she picked up a potato with her fork, put it into her mouth and bit it lightly.The taste of the starchy potato and gravy fragrance flooded her mouth. Her saliva secretion went crazy as she gobbled down the potato in a few mouthfuls.\u201cTry the mutton.\u201d Klein gestured at the plate with his chin.He had tasted it just now and thought it was barely at a passing standard, but it was enough for a girl who was inexperienced with what the world had to offer. After all, she only ate meat occasionally.Melissa\u2019s eyes were filled with anticipation as she carefully forked some mutton.It was very tender and, as soon as it entered the mouth, nearly melted. The fragrance of the meat exploded in her mouth, filling it with delicious meat juices.It was an unprecedented feeling and that made Melissa unable to stop eating.By the time she realized it, she had already eaten several pieces of the mutton.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 Klein, this was supposed to be prepared for you\u2026\u201d Melissa blushed and stammered.\u201cI\u2019d nibbled some of the food just now. It\u2019s the privilege of being a cook.\u201d Klein smiled and soothed her sister. He picked up his fork and spoon. At times, he would eat a piece of meat and sometimes, he would stuff his mouth full of peas. At other times, he would put down the utensils, break off a piece of rye bread and dip it in gravy.Melissa relaxed and was immersed in the delicacy again by Klein\u2019s normal behavior.\u201cIt\u2019s really delicious. It doesn\u2019t seem like you were doing it for the first time.\u201d Melissa looked at the empty dish and praised him with all her heart. Even the gravy was finished.\u201cIt\u2019s a long way from Welch\u2019s chef. When I\u2019m rich, I\u2019ll take you and Benson out to the restaurant and have a better meal!\u201d Klein said. He was beginning to look forward to it himself.\u201cYour interview\u2026 Burp\u2026\u201d Melissa did not finish her words because she suddenly let out a sound of contentment involuntarily.She put her hand over her mouth in a hurry and looked embarrassed.The fault is with the stewed mutton with tender peas just now! It was just too delicious.Klein laughed secretly and decided not to make fun of his sister. He pointed to the plate and said, \u201cThis is your mission.\u201d\u201cAll right!\u201d Melissa stood up immediately, took the basin and rushed out the door.When she came back, she opened the cupboard to check the condiment box and other items as per normal.\u201cDid you just use them?\u201d Melissa was surprised, and turned to Klein, holding the black pepper bottle and lard can.Klein shrugged his shoulders and laughed.\u201cJust a little. It\u2019s the price of a delicacy.\u201dMelissa\u2019s eyes twinkled, her expression changing for a few moments, before she finally said, \u201cLet me cook in the future.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 You have to hurry up and prepare for the interview. You have to think about your job.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He felt a throbbing pain in his head.The amount of content Klein had forgotten was considered a lot, but neither was it negligible. The interview was in two days, so how could he find the time to make up for it\u2026?Furthermore, he was involved in such strange paranormal activity, so how would it be possible that he would be in the mood to revise?Klein gave his sister a perfunctory response and began putting on the appearance of studying. Melissa moved a chair over to sit beside him. With light shining from the gas lamp, she began working on her assignments.The atmosphere was serene. When it was almost eleven o\u2019clock, the siblings bade each other goodnight and went to bed.\u2026Knock!Knock! Knock!Poundings on the door roused Klein from his dreams.He peered out of the window to see the first glimmer of dawn. In a daze, he flipped over and sat up.\u201cWho is it?\u201dLook at the time now! Why didn\u2019t Melissa wake me up?\u201cIt\u2019s me. Dunn Smith,\u201d a man with a deep voice outside the door replied.Dunn Smith? Don\u2019t know him\u2026 Klein got off his bed and shook his head as he walked towards the door.He opened the door to see the gray-eyed police inspector whom he had met the day before standing in front of him.Alarmed, Klein asked, \u201cIs there something wrong?\u201dThe policeman replied with a stern look, \u201cWe found a carriage driver. He testified that you had gone to Mr. Welch\u2019s place on the 27th\u2014the day when Mr. Welch and Ms. Naya died. Furthermore, Mr. Welch was the one who paid for your transportation fees.\u201dKlein was startled. He did not feel a tinge of fear or guilt that one would expect from having his lies exposed.It was because he was not even lying. In fact, he was surprised by the evidence provided by Dunn Smith.On the 27th of June, the former Klein had indeed gone to Mr. Welch\u2019s place. On the night that he returned, he killed himself, the exact same way as Welch and Naya did!Klein gave a forced smile and said, \u201cThis is insufficient evidence. It does not directly prove that I am associated with the death of Welch and Naya. Honestly speaking, I\u2019m also very curious about the whole incident. I want to know what exactly happened to my two poor friends. But\u2026 But\u2026 I really can\u2019t remember. In fact I have almost completely forgotten what I had done on the 27th. You may find it hard to believe, but I fully relied on the diaries I had written to roughly make a guess that I had gone to Welch\u2019s place on the 27th.\u201d\u201cYou sure have great mental fortitude,\u201d Dunn Smith said while nodding. He showed not a trace of anger; nor was he smiling.\u201cYou should be able to hear my sincerity,\u201d Klein looked him straight in the eye and said.I\u2019m telling the truth! Of course, only part of it!Dunn Smith did not give an immediate response. He swept his glance across the room before saying slowly, \u201cMr. Welch lost a revolver. I guess\u2026 I should be able to find it here. Right? Mr. Klein?\u201dIndeed\u2026 Klein finally understood where the revolver had come from. A thought flashed in his mind and he came to the final verdict in an instant.He raised his hands halfway and retreated, leaving a path open. Then, he signaled at the bunk bed with his chin.\u201cBehind the bed board.\u201dHe did not specifically mention that it was the bottom deck, as no one would normally hide things at the back of the bed board on an upper deck. That would be too obvious for guests to notice at a glance.Dunn Smith did not move forward. The corners of his mouth twitched as he asked, \u201cNothing to add on?\u201dWithout hesitation, Klein replied, \u201cThere is!\u201d\u201cYesterday, when I woke up in the middle of the night, I realized I was laying on my desk with a revolver beside me. There was a bullet at the corner of the room. It was as if I had committed suicide. But due to a lack of experience of never having used a gun, or maybe I was too scared at the final moment\u2026 Anyway, the bullet did not achieve the desired result, my head is still in its place. I am still alive now.\u201cAnd since then, I have lost some memories, including what I saw and did at Welch\u2019s place on the 27th. I\u2019m not lying. I really can\u2019t remember.\u201dFor the sake of being eliminated as a suspect. For the sake of getting rid of all these strange events surrounding him, Klein explained almost everything that had happened. Except, the transmigration and \u201cgathering.\u201dAlso, Klein was careful with his words, allowing every sentence to be amenable. Such as, not revealing the fact that the bullet had hit his brains, but only mentioning that it did not achieve the desired result, and that his head was still in its place.To others, these two statements might seem to convey the exact same ideas, but in reality they were like chalk and cheese.Dunn Smith listened quietly, then said, \u201cThis corresponds with what I had surmised. It also corresponds with the hidden logic of similar incidents in the past. Of course, I have no idea how you managed to survive.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you believe in me. I don\u2019t know how I survived either.\u201d Klein heaved a small sigh of relief.\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Dunn threw out a conjunction. \u201cThere is no use in me believing you. You are currently the prime suspect. You have to be confirmed by an \u2018expert\u2019 that you have indeed forgotten what you went through, or that you indeed have nothing to do with the deaths of Mr. Welch and Miss Naya.\u201dHe coughed, his expression becoming serious.\u201cMr. Klein, I seek your cooperation on coming with me to the police station for the investigation. This should take roughly two to three days if it is confirmed that there are no issues with you.\u201d\u201cThe expert is here?\u201d Klein asked blankly in return.Didn\u2019t they say it would take another two days?\u201cShe came earlier than expected.\u201d Dunn turned sideways, signaling for Klein to leave.\u201cAllow me to leave a note,\u201d Klein requested.Benson was still away and Melissa had gone to school. He could only leave a note to inform them that he was involved in an incident associated with Welch so that they would not worry about him.Dunn nodded, barely minding.\u201cAlright.\u201dKlein returned to the desk. As he searched for paper, he began thinking about what was about to occur.Honestly speaking, he did not wish to meet the \u2018expert.\u2019 After all, he had a bigger secret.In a place where there were seven major churches, under the premise that Emperor Roselle, who was suspected to be a transmigrator predecessor, was assassinated, a thing like \u2018transmigration\u2019 usually meant having to go to court and enter arbitration!But, without weapons, combat skills, or superpowers, he was no match for a professional policeman. What\u2019s more, a few of Dunn\u2019s subordinates were standing in the dark outside.Once they draw their guns and shoot at me, I\u2019d be finished!\u201cUgh, I\u2019ll take one step at a time.\u201d Klein left the note, grabbed his keys, and followed Dunn out the room.Along the dark aisle, four policemen in black-and-white checkered uniforms split into pairs and guarded them on both sides. They were very alert.Tap. Tap. Tap. Klein followed alongside Dunn as they went down the wooden stairs which occasionally creaked in protest.Outside the apartment, there was a four-wheeled carriage. On the side of the carriage, there was the \u201ctwo crossed swords and a crown\u201d police emblem. Their surroundings were crowded and bustling with noise as usual.\u201cGo on, up.\u201d Dunn signaled for Klein to go first.Klein was just about to step forward when an oyster seller suddenly grabbed a customer and claimed that he was a thief.Both parties wrestled and triggered a response from the horses, causing great chaos.An opportunity!There wasn\u2019t much time for Klein to think any further; he bent forward and dashed towards the crowd.Either shoving or dodging, he escaped frantically towards the other end of the street.Right now, for the sake of not \u201cmeeting\u201d the expert, he could only proceed by going to the pier outside the city, taking a boat down the Tussock River and escaping to the capital, Backlund. The population was higher there, making it easier to hide.Of course, he could also get on a steam train, go eastward to the nearest Enmatt Harbor and take the sea route to Pritz, then towards Backlund.Not long after, Klein arrived at a street and made a turn onto Iron Cross Street. There were several carriages that could be hired.\u201cTo the pier outside the city.\u201d Klein reached out his hand and hopped onto one of the carriages.He had thought through things clearly. Firstly, he had to mislead the police that were coming for him. Once the carriage was a suitable distance away from them, he would jump right off!\u201cAlrighty.\u201d The carriage driver tugged at the reins.Clop! Clop! Clop\u2026 The carriage left Iron Cross Street.Just as Klein was about to jump off the carriage, he noticed that it had turned into another road. It wasn\u2019t leading out of the city!\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Klein blurted in his momentary daze.\u201cTo Welch\u2019s place\u2026\u201d the carriage driver answered monotonously.What!? Klein was at a loss for words. The carriage driver turned around, exposing his cold gray eyes. It was Dunn Smith, the gray-eyed policeman!\u201cYou!\u201d Klein was flustered. Everything suddenly became a blur as though the world spun around him when he instantly sat up.Sat up?\u00a0Klein looked around, confused. He noticed the crimson moon outside the window and the room being covered in a crimson veil.He reached out with his hand to feel his forehead. It was all moist and cold. Cold sweat. His back felt exactly the same.\u201cIt was a nightmare\u2026\u201d Klein heaved a sigh. \u201cAll is well\u2026 All is well\u2026\u201dHe found it weird. He was rather clear-minded in his dream, he was even able to think calmly!After calming down, Klein looked at his pocket watch. It was only two in the morning. He got out of bed quietly and planned to head to the washroom where he could wash his face and empty his burgeoning bladder.He opened the door and walked along the dark corridor. Under the dim moonlight, he walked lightly towards the washroom.Suddenly, he noticed a silhouette outside the window at the end of the corridor.That silhouette was wearing a black windbreaker that was shorter than a coat, but longer than a jacket.That silhouette was partly camouflaged in the darkness, bathing in the crimson moonlight.That silhouette turned around slowly. His eyes deep, gray, and cold.Dunn Smith!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

For a moment he was unsure if he was awake or still in his dreams.The silhouette took off his black top hat and bowed a little as he said with a smile, \u201cReintroducing myself, Nighthawk, Dunn Smith.\u201dNighthawk? One of the codenames of the Church of the Evernight Goddess\u2019 Beyonder teams which \u2018Justice\u2019 and \u2018The Hanged Man\u2019 mentioned before? Klein suddenly realised something, and exclaimed after making a connection, \u201cYou can control dreams? You just made me dream of that?\u201dNighthawk Dunn Smith wore his black hat again, concealing his slightly high hairline. With deep gray eyes he said, \u201cNo, I only entered your dream and made the necessary guidance.\u201dHis voice was deep and soothing; it reverberated through the dimly lit corridor without disturbing the sweet dreams of others, \u201cIn dreams, even though much of your usually suppressed emotions and various dark thoughts in you are amplified\u2014making everything seem chaotic, absurd, and crazy\u2014they are all rooted in reality since reality exists. For veterans like me, everything is crystal clear. Compared to a conscious you, I believe the you in your dreams more.\u201dThis\u2026 What normal human being could control his dream? If I had dreamed of something on Earth, wouldn\u2019t Dunn Smith have noticed? Klein was petrified by what had happened in the dream.Yet he quickly found it bizarre. He remembered being very much sober and rational\u2014knowing what to say and what not to say.To put it simply, it did not feel like dreaming at all!So, Dunn Smith only 'saw\u201d what I wanted him to see?Klein\u2019s mind whirled as he gained a glimmer of understanding.This is a perk that resulted from transmigration? Like having a special body and soul? Or was it the effects of that luck enhancement ritual?\u201cSo, Mr Smith, do you believe that I really lost my memory?\u201d Klein organized his thoughts and asked in reply.Dunn Smith did not answer him directly. Instead he looked at him keenly.\u201cYou are actually not surprised by the course of events?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve met people who wouldn\u2019t believe in the power of the Beyonders, and they would rather believe that they haven\u2019t really woken up.\u201dKlein tersely acknowledged as he said, \u201cPerhaps, I have always been praying, hoping that there was such power to help me.\u201d\u201cAn interesting train of thought\u2026 Perhaps you survived not only because you were lucky.\u201d Dunn nodded expressionlessly. \u201cI can now confirm that you really lost parts of your memories due to the incident, especially those related to it.\u201d\u201cSo can I go back now?\u201d Klein heaved a long sigh of relief in his heart as he probed.Dunn placed a hand in his pocket and walked slowly towards Klein, the surrounding darkness becoming tranquil and gentle.\u201cNo, you still have to come with me to see the expert,\u201d he smiled politely and said.\u201cWhy?\u201d Klein blurted out, then added, \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in the findings from my dream?\u201dYou must be joking, if that \u201cexpert\u201d specializes in hypnosis or mind-reading and stuff, then wouldn\u2019t my biggest secret be exposed?The consequences would be beyond imagination!\u201cI\u2019m quite humble usually, but I\u2019m still confident for things related to dreams.\u201d Dunn calmly replied, \u201cHowever, for important key matters, there is no harm in confirming them again. Plus, our specialties lie in different areas. Perhaps, she can help you recover some of your memories.\u201dNot waiting for Klein to reply, his voice turned deeper. \u201cAfter all you\u2019re connected to the whereabouts of that Antigonus family notebook.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Klein froze.Dunn stopped in front of him, locking his gray eyes on Klein\u2019s eyes and said, \u201cAt the scene of the suicide, there was not a single trace of that notebook from the Fourth Epoch. Welch is dead, Naya is dead; you are our only lead.\u201d\u201c\u2026Alright then.\u201d Klein went silent for a moment before exhaling.A missing notebook\u2026 now this is really peculiar!How did I not think about the whereabouts of that notebook from the Fourth Epoch!Dunn nodded slightly, walking pass Klein and said, \u201cLock your door and come with me to Welch\u2019s apartment, the expert is waiting for us there.\u201dKlein took in a silent breath. His heart was thumping wildly as he felt uneasy.He wanted to decline and even had the intention to run. However, he believed that with what had happened in his dreams, Dunn Smith would have definitely heightened his level of guard. And with the difference in strength between a normal human and a Beyonder, there was little chance of success by using force.He must have a revolver with him too\u2026 He must also have had practice using the revolver\u2026Many thoughts flashed past his mind, and eventually Klein chose to accept the reality.\u201cAlright.\u201dSigh, I can only take one step at a time and see how things unfold; maybe, that miraculous power in my dream will take effect again\u2026\u201cThen let\u2019s go,\u201d Dunn said in an indifferent tone.Klein turned and followed. After taking two steps, he suddenly stopped and said, \u201cMr. Smith, I\u2026 I would like to use the bathroom first.\u201dI came out originally for the bathroom\u2026Dunn did not stop him. Instead, he gave him a keen look and said, \u201cNo problem, Klein. Believe me, I am far more powerful than you can imagine in the dark night.\u201dIn the dark night\u2026 Klein silently repeated this phrase.He did not make any reckless attempt to escape and honestly relieved himself. He then washed his face with cold water, completely calming himself down.Klein changed his outfit and closed the door to his apartment. With gentle steps, Klein followed Dunn down the stairs and walked towards the building\u2019s entrance.In such a tranquil setting, Dunn Smith opened his mouth and spoke suddenly, \u201cAt the end of the dream, why did you try to escape? What were you afraid of?\u201dKlein immediately thought of an answer as he said, \u201cI do not remember what I did at Welch\u2019s place, nor do I remember if I was directly involved in Welch\u2019s and Naya\u2019s deaths. I was afraid that if it was really proven to be my doing, I would rather gamble and escape. I can then start anew in the Southern Continent.\u201d\u201cI would\u2019ve done the same if I were you,\u201d Dunn said as he pushed opened the door to the building, letting in the cool midnight breeze to disperse the sweltering heat inside.He was not afraid of Klein running away as he got on the carriage. It was exactly the one Klein had dreamed of\u2014a four-wheeled carriage drawn by a single horse and the carriage driver. There was also the police emblem of double-crossed swords that clustered a crown carved onto the side of the carriage.Klein followed into the carriage. Inside, there was a thick carpet laid out and the place was filled with a soothing fragrance.Having sat down, he looked for a topic to probe for more information.\u201cMr. Smith, what if\u2014and I mean if\u2014the \u2018expert\u2019 confirms that I have really forgotten a part of my memories? And that there is no other evidence which points to me being the perpetrator or a victim, would this be over?\u201d\u201cIn theory, yes. We will try to search for the notebook through other means. As long as it exists, it can be found. Of course, before that, we will have to make sure you are not cursed or have any scent of cacodemons and that there are no related psychological problems lingering. We must ensure that you can embrace the rest of your life peacefully and healthily.\u201d Dunn Smith had a smile on his face, a rather unusual smile.Klein caught on to this point keenly, and promptly inquired, \u201cIn theory?\u201d\u201cYes, only in theory. In this field of work, there are always twisted, unorthodox, and inexplicable things happening.\u201d Dunn looked Klein in the eye and said, \u201cTheir continuation or end are not what we can foresee or control at times.\u201d\u201cFor example?\u201d Klein actually felt frightened for a moment.The carriage sped through an almost empty street. Dunn took out his tobacco pipe and sniffed it, saying, \u201cWhen we believe that things have come to an end, with everything going back to normal, it would resurface in a terrifying, chilling way.\u201d\u201cA few years ago, we handled a case regarding an evil cult. They did live sacrifices to please an evil god by making followers commit suicide. When one of the followers was chosen, his survival instincts triumphed over his foolishness, twisted beliefs, and psychedelic drugs. He secretly escaped and reported to the police.\u201cThe case was handed over to us. It was a very small mission, since there were no Beyonders in that cult. The deity they worshiped was actually randomly thought up by their leader merely for the sake of money and satisfaction. Humanity was lost there.\u201cWe only used two members, coupled with the support from the police, to suppress this cult. No one was off the hook. For that whistleblower, we also confirmed that he had no lingering demonic scent left on him. He was not cursed and did not suffer any mental disorders. He didn\u2019t have any personality problems or any other irregularities, nothing.\u201cLater, he got a decent advancement in his career, got married to a very good wife, had a son and a daughter. His dark past seemed far away from him. The horror and bloodshed seemed to have completely vanished.\u201dAt this point, Dunn Smith gave out a laugh and said, \u201cYet in March this year, despite being in good financial health and having a loving wife and adorable kids\u2026 he strangled himself to death in his own office.\u201dThe crimson moonlight outside the carriage window shone upon Dunn Smith.At that instance, his seemingly self-derisive smile made Klein feel unspeakably horrified.\u201cStrangled himself to death\u2026\u201d Klein drew in a gasp of cool air silently, as if seeing his own tragic end.Even if I escaped it once, it might just be temporary?Is there any way to resolve this completely?Become a Beyonder to fight it?The carriage returned to silence. Countless thoughts welled in Klein\u2019s mind.Under an awkward silence, the carriage traveled for a long time at high speeds.Just as Klein made up his mind to consult Dunn Smith for any solutions, the carriage came to a halt.\u201cMr. Smith, we have reached Welch\u2019s apartment.\u201d The carriage driver\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cLet\u2019s get down.\u201d Dunn straightened out his black coat that reached his knees.\u201cOh, let me introduce beforehand, the official disguise of the \u2018expert\u2019 is the most renowned spirit medium of Awwa County.\u201dKlein suppressed his other thoughts and asked curiously, \u201cThen what is her actual identity?\u201dDunn half-turned his body and turned his head back, with his abstruse gray eyes he said, \u201cA true Spirit Medium.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He followed Dunn Smith down the carriage.Welch\u2019s place in Tingen was a detached house with a garden. The road outside the hollowed metal gates allowed four carriages to pass through at once. Street lamps lined the sides of the road every fifty meters. They looked different from the ones Klein had seen in his previous life. They were gas lamps and the height of every lamp was about that of an adult male so that it was convenient to light the lamps.The black metal was closely appressed to the glass, forming a checkered pattern, casting out classical paper lantern-like \u2018artworks.\u2019 Coldness and warmth were intertwined while darkness and light coexisted.Walking along the pathway blanketed by rays from the sunset, Klein and Dunn Smith entered Welch\u2019s rented place through the ajar metal gate.Facing the main entrance was a cemented road that led straight to a two-floored bungalow. Two carriages could go at once.There was a garden on the left and a lawn to the right. The pleasantly faint fragrance from the flowers mixed with the cool scent of the fresh grass made one feel happy and relaxed.As soon as he stepped in, Klein shivered and peered around.He felt that in the garden, somewhere in the lawn, on the roof, behind the swing, somewhere in a dark corner, pairs of eyes were observing him!There was clearly no one here; yet, Klein felt as if he was on a crowded street.This strange contrast\u2014this peculiar feeling\u2014tensed him up. A chill ran up his spine.\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong!\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but exclaim to Dunn.Dunn\u2019s expression remained unchanged as he walked beside him and replied calmly, \u201cJust ignore them.\u201dSince the \u201cNighthawk\u201d had said so, Klein tolerated the chilling feeling of not being able to notice the perpetrator despite being followed, spied, and observed. Step by step, he arrived at the main entrance of the bungalow.If this goes on any longer, I will go crazy\u2026 As Dunn reached out his hand to knock on the door, Klein quickly turned around. Flowers swayed in the wind, without a person in sight.\u201cCome in, gentlemen.\u201d A seemingly ethereal voice came from inside the house.Dunn turned the doorknob, pushed the door open and said to a woman on the sofa, \u201cDaly, any results?\u201dThe chandelier in the living room was unlit. A set of two leather couches surrounded a marble coffee table.On the table was a lit candle, but the light emitted a cobalt blue glow. It covered the half-enclosed living room, dining room, and kitchen in a strange, eerie hue.On the middle of the sofa sat a lady in a hooded black robe who wore blue eyeshadow and blush. An exposed silver bracelet with a hanging white crystal pendant was worn around her wrist.At the first sight of her, Klein had an inexplicable feeling. She was dressed just like a real medium\u2026Was she stereotyping herself?Daly, the \u201cmedium\u201d with uncanny beauty, took a quick glance at Klein with her twinkling emerald eyes. She looked at Dunn Smith and said, \u201cThe original spirits have all disappeared, including that of Welch\u2019s and Naya\u2019s. Right now, all these little rascals know nothing at all.\u201dSpirits? Spirit Medium\u2026 All the invisible things that were spying on him previously were spirits? There were so many of them? Klein removed his hat and placed it across his chest, bowing slightly as he said, \u201cGood evening, Madam.\u201dDunn Smith sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s tricky\u2026\u201d\u201cDaly, this is Klein Moretti. See if you can get anything out of him.\u201dThe medium, Daly, shifted her gaze onto Klein immediately. She pointed at a single armchair and said, \u201cPlease, take a seat.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Klein nodded, took a few steps over, and sat down obediently. His heart raced uncontrollably.Whether I survive, whether I get through this successfully or have my secrets exposed will all depend on whatever happens next!And the thing that made him feel the most helpless was that he had nothing to rely on. He could only place his hopes on his inherent specialness\u2026This feeling really sucks\u2026 Klein thought bitterly.Next, Dunn sat on the two-seater sofa opposite of Klein. Daly took out two thumb-sized glass bottles from her waist pouch.Her emerald eyes smiled at Klein as she said, \u201cI need a bit of help here. After all, you are not an enemy, I can\u2019t treat you harshly. That might make you uncomfortable or put you in pain. It might even leave some serious after-effects on you. I will give you some fragrances, making you feel tender and smooth, which will allow you to let loose bit by bit so that you can truly indulge in those feelings.\u201dThat sounded wrong\u2026 Klein gaped as his eyes were filled with shock.Seated across him, Dunn laughed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be weirded out. We are different from the fellows from the Church of the Lord of Storms. Here, the ladies can also verbally tease men. In this regard, you should be able to understand. Your mother was a devout believer of the Goddess. You and your brother used to attend Sunday school at Church.\u201d\u201cI understand. It\u2019s just that I never thought that she would be such a\u2026 such a\u2026\u201d Klein gestured, as he could not find the right words. He almost blurted out the direct translation for \u201cveteran\u00a0driver <sup>1</sup> \u201c.Dunn curved the corners of his mouth up and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Actually, Daly seldom does this. She just wants to use these methods to calm you down. She prefers corpses over men.\u201d\u201cYou make me sound perverted,\u201d Daly interjected with a smile.She opened one of the little bottles and dripped a few drops onto the bright blue candle flame.\u201cNight vanilla, slumber flower, and chamomile, all distilled and extracted to form this aromatic floral essence. I call it \u2018Amantha;\u2019 it means tranquility in the Hermes language. It smells really amazing.\u201dAs they chatted, the candle flame flickered, evaporating the floral essence and filling the room with its aroma.A beautifully enchanting aroma found its way into Klein\u2019s nostrils. He no longer felt tensed up. He was instantly calm as if he was gazing into the darkness of the silent night.\u201cThis bottle is called the Eye of the Spirit. Barks and leaves of drago and poplar trees are sun-dried for seven days and decocted thrice. Then, they are immersed in Lanti Wine. Of course, there would be several incantations while we\u2019re at it\u2026\u201d As Daly described the liquid, the amber substance dripped onto the cobalt blue candle flame.Upon smelling the ethereal scent of the aromatic wine, Klein noticed that the candle flame was dancing wildly. The luster of Daly\u2019s blue eyeshadow and blush shone oddly, to the extent of him seeing double.\u201cIt is a great helping hand for mediumship. It is also a floral essence that is sufficiently enchanting\u2026 \u201dAs Daly explained continuously, Klein felt as if her voice was coming from all around.Bewildered, Klein looked around and realized that everything was swaying and in a blur. He felt like he was shrouded by layers and layers of fog. Even his body was swaying as it phased away before he began floating and then losing his balance.Colors blended like an impressionist painting\u2014the reds were redder, the blues were bluer, and the blacks were blacker\u2014appearing more defined than usual. It was dreamy and hazy. Distinct murmurs from the surroundings came through as if hundreds and thousands of people who could not be seen were debating.\u201cThis feels similar to the luck enhancement ritual I did before, but without the kind of madness that makes your head feel like exploding\u2026\u201d Klein looked around and thought questioningly.At this moment, his vision was locked onto a pair of eyes that were crystal clear like emerald. On a blurry 'sofa\u201d sat Daly in a black robe. Eccentrically, her gaze concentrated on the tip of Klein\u2019s head. She smiled and in a gentle voice, said, \u201cLet me properly introduce myself. I am the Spirit Medium, Daly.\u201dI can still\u2026 have rational thoughts\u2026 It\u2019s like when I was at that luck enhancement ritual and that gathering\u2026 The thought crossed Klein\u2019s mind as he intentionally behaved muddled and said, \u201cHello there\u2026\u201d\u201cThe mental worlds of humans are extremely vast. Many secrets are hidden within the mind. Look at the ocean\u2014what we know about it is all on the superficial level. But in reality, deep in the ocean, there is a larger unseen portion. Other than islands, there is the entire ocean. There is the boundless sky that symbolizes the spiritual world\u2026\u201cYou are the spirit of your body. Not only do you know of the islands above, but you also know of the things hidden beneath the sea, as well as the entire ocean\u2026\u201cAnything that exists leaves some traces behind. The superficial memories of the islands may be wiped out, but what is left under the sea and the entire ocean will definitely have a corresponding projection left in it\u2026\u201dDaly went on and on, bewitching Klein. The vague surrounding winds and shadows took on similar forms. It as though Klein\u2019s spirit was fully exposed in the form of an ocean, waiting for him to search and discover.Klein watched patiently, as he \u2018churned\u2019 the ocean occasionally. Then, in an airy voice, he replied, \u201cNo\u2026 I can\u2019t remember\u2026 I have forgotten\u2026\u201dHe expressed his agony at just the right level.Daly tried to guide him once again, but the clear-headed Klein was unaffected.\u201cOkay. We shall end here. You may leave.\u201d\u201cLeave.\u201d\u201cLeave\u2026\u201dThe airy voice lingered and Daly disappeared. The wind and shadows began calming as the ethereal smell and subtle scent of the aromatic wine became more distinct again.The colors returned to their normal state and the fuzzy feeling was no longer around. Klein\u2019s body quivered, and he found his balance again.He opened his eyes, which he had no memory of closing, and noticed that the candle with the bright blue flame was still before him. Dunn Smith was still resting comfortably on the couch. Same for Daly with the black-hooded robe.\u201cWhy did you use the theory that belongs to that bunch of evil madmen, the Psychology Alchemists?\u201d Dunn furrowed his eyebrows and stared at Daly.As Daly put away the two little bottles, she replied calmly, \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty accurate. At least, it corresponds with some of the things I\u2019ve made contact with before\u2026\u201dWithout waiting for Dunn\u2019s reply, Daly shrugged and said, \u201cThis tricky fellow did not leave a single trace behind.\u201dUpon hearing this, Klein heaved a huge sigh of relief. Pretentiously, he asked, \u201cOh, it\u2019s over? What happened? It felt like I just took a nap\u2026\u201dThat was a pass, right?Thankfully, I had the \u2018luck enhancement ritual\u2019 as a rehearsal!\u201cJust take it as such.\u201d Dunn interrupted him and looked at Daly. \u201cHave you examined Welch\u2019s and Naya\u2019s bodies?\u201d\u201cThe corpses can tell us a lot more than you can imagine. It\u2019s such a pity that Welch and Naya had indeed committed suicide. So, the force that drove them to it is to be feared. Not a single trace was left behind.\u201d Daly stood up and pointed at the candle. \u201cI need some rest.\u201dThe cobalt blue glow vanished, and the house was instantly inundated with a blurry shade of crimson.\u2026\u201cCongratulations. You can return home now. But do remember, do not reveal this incident to your loved ones. You have to promise this.\u201d Dunn said as he led Klein to the door.Surprised, Klein asked, \u201cIs there no need to examine the curses or the trails left behind by the evil spirits?\u201d\u201cDaly didn\u2019t mention anything about it, so there\u2019s no need for it,\u201d Dunn answered simply.Klein calmed down. As the thought of his previous worries came to mind, he asked hurriedly, \u201cHow can I be sure that I will be free from trouble from now on?\u201d\u201cNo worries.\u201d Dunn twitched his lips and said, \u201cBased on statistics of similar incidents in the past, eighty percent of the survivors of the incident do not experience any horrifying after-effects. Yeah\u2026 This is based on what I know\u2026 roughly\u2026 more or less\u2026\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 there\u2019s still one fifth of those poor souls\u2026\u201d Klein did not dare to try his luck.\u201cThen you can consider joining us as a civilian staff. This way, even if there are any precursors, we can discover it in time,\u201d Dunn said casually as he approached the carriage. \u201cOr simply become a Beyonder. After all, we are not nannies. We can\u2019t babysit you all day long and even watch what you do with women.\u201d\u201cCan I?\u201d Klein questioned the statement.Of course, he did not expect much. After all, how was it even possible to be a part of the Nighthawks so easily and obtain the power of the Beyonders?That was the power of the Beyonders!Dunn paused, and turned his head sideways to look at him.\u201cIt\u2019s not that you can\u2019t\u2026 It depends\u2026\u201dWhat? The transition in his words shocked Klein. Klein stared blankly beside the carriage before answering, \u201cReally?\u201dWho are you kidding? Is it so easy to become a Beyonder?Dunn laughed lightly; his gray eyes were hidden in the shadow of the carriage.\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me, huh? Actually, when you become a Nighthawk you lose a lot. For instance, freedom.\u201cEven if we don\u2019t talk about this now, there is another issue. Firstly, you are not a member of the clergy, nor a devotee. You can\u2019t pick whatever you want or choose the safest approach.\u201d\u201cAnd secondly\u2026\u201d Dunn held onto the handle and hopped onto the carriage as he went on. \u201cAmong the cases that we\u2014us, the Mandated Punisher, the Machinery Hivemind and other Judiciaries\u2014have to deal with annually, a quarter of them were a result of Beyonders who lost control.\u201dA quarter\u2026 Beyonders who lost control\u2026 Klein was dumbfounded.Just then, Dunn turned slightly. His gray eyes were deep. With no sign of a smile, he continued, \u201cAnd among the quarter of cases, a large number of them are our teammates.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instinctively, he uttered, \u201cWhy?\u201dThe Beyonders have serious hidden dangers? So much so that the Church\u2019s internal Judiciary and the Beyonders, who dealt with bizarre phenomenon, are also prone to problems?Dunn stepped into the carriage and sat back in his seat. His expression and tone remained the same.\u201cThis is not something that you need to understand. Neither is it something you can understand, unless you become one of us.\u201dKlein was struck dumb for a moment, after which he sat down and questioned in a tone that was half dubious and half-joking.\u201cIf I don\u2019t come to understand, how is it possible for me to make a decision to join?\u201dAnd not joining would mean Klein could not understand. This would end in a deadlock\u2026Dunn Smith took out the pipe once again, placed it against his nose, and took a whiff.\u201cYou probably misunderstood; a civilian staff member is also one of us.\u201d\u201cIn other words, as long as I become one of your civilian staff members, I will be able to understand the relevant secrets, figure out the hidden dangers that plague Beyonders, and the dangers that may be encountered, as well as consider whether I want to become a Beyonder later?\u201d Klein reorganized his thoughts and paraphrased what Dunn had shared.Dunn smiled and said, \u201cYes, that is the case, except for one point. You cannot simply become a Beyonder just because you want to because every church will be equally strict in this aspect.\u201dIt would be odd if the churches were not strict\u2026 Klein lampooned silently, as he added with a more intense tone coupled with stronger body language, \u201cWhat about civilian staff members? This should be quite strict as well, right?\u201d\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any problems if it\u2019s you,\u201d said Dunn with half-closed eyelids as he whiffed the pipe with partially relaxed countenance. However, he did not ignite it.\u201cWhy?\u201d Klein asked as he was once again grappled by doubt.At the same time, he jested inwardly.So my uniqueness and halo as a transmigrator are akin to the fireflies in the night, ever so bright and outstanding?Dunn opened his half-closed eyelids, his silver-colored eyes reflecting the same tranquility as before.\u201cFirst, you managed to survive without our help in such a situation. Certain exceptional qualities are not present in others. For instance, luck. Lucky people are often welcomed.\u201dSeeing that Klein\u2019s expression had turned blank, Dunn smiled slightly.\u201cAll right, just treat this as a humorous statement. Second, you\u2019re a graduate of the history department from Khoy University; this is something we urgently need. Although a believer of the Lord of the Storms, Leumi, perceives women in a way that is loathsome, his views regarding society, humanities, economics, and politics remain incisive. He said before that talents are key to maintaining a competitive advantage and positive development, a point that I very much agree with.Noticing that Klein was slightly furrowing his eyebrows, Dunn casually explained, \u201cYou should be able to imagine that we often encounter documents and objects from the Fourth Epoch or earlier. Many cults and heretics have tried to gain power from these things. Sometimes, they themselves can lead to strange and terrible things.\u201cExcept for the Beyonders in special fields, most of us are not good with our studies, or have passed that age.\u201d Having said that, Dunn Smith pointed to his own head, and the corner of his mouth turned up slightly as if he was mocking himself.He then said, \u201cThose dry, boring knowledge always puts us to sleep. Even the Sleepless can\u2019t help it. In the past, we would cooperate with historians or archaeologists, but this posed the risk of exposing secrets, and mishaps might befall on these otherwise uninvolved professors and associate professors. Thus, the addition of a professional in our ranks is hard to refuse.\u201dKlein nodded lightly and accepted Dunn\u2019s explanation. With his thoughts all over the place, he asked, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you directly, um, groom one?\u201dDunn continued, \u201cThis brings me to the third point, which is also the final and most important point. You\u2019ve already been through a similar ordeal, so inviting you doesn\u2019t violate the confidentiality clause.\u201cWith regard to developing others, I will bear the responsibility of exposure if it fails. Most of our team members, our civilian staff members, come from within the Church.\u201dAfter Klein finished listening silently, he asked curiously, \u201cWhy are you so strict about maintaining confidentiality? Wouldn\u2019t spreading the news publicly to more people and increasing awareness lessen the chances of a similar mistake from happening again? The greatest fear stems from the fear of the unknown; we can make the unknown become known.\u201d\u201cNo, humanity\u2019s stupidity is beyond your imagination. It actually leads to more people emulating these acts, creating more chaos and more severe incidents,\u201d Dunn Smith shook his head and replied.Klein acknowledged as he replied in enlightenment, \u201cThe only lesson that humans can learn from history is that humans do not gain any lessons from history, and they\u2019re always repeating the same tragedies.\u201d\u201cThat famous quote from Emperor Roselle is indeed filled with much philosophical meaning,\u201d agreed Dunn.\u2026Emperor Roselle said that? This transmigrator senior really did not give the \u2018latecomers\u2019 any chance to posture\u2026 Klein did not know how to follow up on Dunn\u2019s words.Dunn turned his head and gazed out of the horse carriage. The dim yellowish light of the street lamps intertwined to display the splendor of civilization.\u201c\u2026There is a similar discourse within the judiciary of the major churches. This may be the main reason for the strict confidentiality and the prohibition of ordinary people from knowing.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Klein asked as his interest was piqued, pleasured that he seemed to be spying on secrets.Dunn turned his head; his facial muscles pulled themselves so slightly that it was hardly visible.\u201cFaith and fear bring troubles. More faith and more fear bring more troubles, until everything is destroyed.\u201dAfter he said that, Dunn signed, \u201cBesides praying for the blessings and help from gods, humans can\u2019t solve their real major problems.\u201cFaith and fear bring troubles. More faith and more fear bring more troubles\u2026\u201d Klein recited silently, but he could not fully understand it.What followed next was the fear of uncertainty that came from the unknown. It was like the dark shadows formed by the street lights outside. In the darkness without light, it appeared as though there were pairs of callous-looking eyes and wide-opened mouths.As the horse galloped vigorously and nimbly while the wheels of the horse carriage reeled on ahead with Iron Cross Street in sight, Dunn broke the silence suddenly and formally invited Klein.\u201cWould you like to join us as a civilian staff member?\u201dIn Klein\u2019s mind, multiple thoughts surfaced, making him indecisive. He contemplated and asked, \u201cCan I have some time to consider?\u201dSince this matter had serious implications, he could not hastily and recklessly make the decision.\u201cNo problem, just give me a reply before Sunday,\u201d Dunn nodded and added. \u201cOf course, remember to keep this a secret and don\u2019t disclose the information regarding Welch to anyone, including your brother and sister. Once this is violated, it\u2019ll not only bring them trouble, but you might also have to attend a special court.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Klein answered gravely.The carriage was once again plunged into silence.Seeing that they were nearing Iron Cross Street and that he was almost reaching home, Klein suddenly thought of a question. He hesitated for a few seconds before asking, \u201cMr Smith, what kind of salary and benefits do civilian staff get?\u201dThis was a serious question\u2026Taken aback momentarily, Dunn smiled instantly and answered, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to worry about this issue. Our funds are guaranteed by the Church and the police department. For newly registered civilian staffs, the weekly salaries are placed at two pounds and ten soli. There is an additional ten soli as compensation for the risk and confidentiality. All of this will add up to a total of three pounds. This is hardly worse than a confirmed university lecturer.\u201cAfterwhich, your salary will gradually rise according to your experience and contributions.\u201cAs for civilian staff members, the contract is generally five years. After five years, you can quit normally if you\u2019re no longer willing to stay. You only have to sign a lifetime confidentiality agreement and you\u2019re not allowed to leave Tingen until permission is given. If you want to move to another city, the first thing you must do is register with the local Nighthawk.\u201cBy the way, there are no weekends and you can only work in shifts. At any point in time, there should be three civilian staffs on duty and if you wish to go to the South or Desi Bay for a vacation, you\u2019ll need to arrange it with your colleagues.\u201dJust as Dunn finished speaking, the horse carriage pulled to a stop and the apartment building where Klein and his siblings resided in appeared on the side.\u201cI get it now,\u201d Klein turned around and walked down the horse carriage. He stopped at the side and asked, \u201cBy the way Mr. Smith, where do I find you after I\u2019ve come to my decision?\u201dDunn gave a deep and low throaty laugh before saying, \u201cGo to the \u2018Hound Pub\u2019 at Besik Street and find their boss, Wright. Tell him that you want to hire a small mercenary squad for a mission.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Klein asked confusedly.\u201cOur location is confidential too. Before you agree to become one of us, I can\u2019t tell you directly. Alright Mr. Klein Moretti, I wish you a good dream tonight as well,\u201d Dunn smiled as he said.Klein took off his hat and saluted, watching as the pace of the departing horse carriage gradually sped up.He took out his pocket watch.\u201cClick,\u201d he pressed it open and saw that it was only a little past four in the morning. The street was filled with a relaxing, cool breeze. A dim yellowish light from the street lamps illuminated the surroundings.Klein drew a deep breath and took in the deep silence of the night around him.The busiest and noisiest district in the day could be so lifeless and quiet at night. This was in stark contrast to the silent observations and medium\u2019s seance in Welch\u2019s residence.It was only then that Klein realized that the back of his linen shirt was unknowingly drenched in sweat, cold and clammy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He slowly turned around and enjoyed the cool breeze and tranquility of the night while walking closer and closer to the apartment building\u2019s door.He took out his keys, inserted the correct one in and turned it gently, allowing the crimson-mixed darkness to expand with the creaking sound of the opened door.Walking on the staircase without a single person in sight and taking in the cold air, Klein had an inexplicable and amazing feeling. It felt like he had a few more hours than others. This caused him to hasten his pace.In a similar state of mind, he opened the door to his room and before he even stepped inside, he saw a silhouette sitting silently in front of his desk. It had reddish black hair, bright brown eyes, and a delicate, pretty face. Undoubtedly, she was Melissa Moretti!\u201cKlein, where did you go?\u201d Melissa asked curiously as she relaxed her eyebrows.Without waiting for Klein\u2019s reply, she added, \u201cJust now, I got up to go to the bathroom and realized you weren\u2019t home.\u201d It was as if she wanted to know everything clearly, from the causes and effects of the matter to the underlying logic.With great experience at lying to his parents, Klein\u2019s brain took a spin before he gave a bitter smile and calmly replied, \u201cI couldn\u2019t fall asleep again after I woke up. Instead of wasting time, I decided that I should train my body. So I went out to run a few rounds. Look at my sweat!\u201dHe took off his jacket and half-turned his body, pointing to his back.Melissa stood up, took a glance half-heartedly and deliberated for a few moments before saying, \u201cHonestly speaking, Klein, you don\u2019t have to stress yourself out. I\u2019m sure you can pass the interview to Tingen University. Even if you can\u2019t, er\u2014I mean if \u2014you can still find better ones.\u201dI haven\u2019t even thought about the interview\u2026 Klein nodded his head and said, \u201cI understand.\u201dHe did not mention the \u201coffer\u201d that he had gotten because he had not decided whether he wanted to join them or not.Staring at Klein intensely, Melissa suddenly turned around and trotted into the interior of the house. She took out an object that resembled a tortoise. It was comprised of items like gears, rusted iron, torsion springs and ordinary springs.After quickly tightening the torsion spring, Melissa placed the object on the desk.Ka! Ka! Ka!Dum! Dum! Dum!The \u201ctortoise\u201d moved and jumped with a rhythm that could pull anyone\u2019s attention.\u201cWhenever I feel irritated, I feel much better seeing this tortoise move. I\u2019ve been doing this very often recently and it\u2019s very effective! Klein, give it a try!\u201d invited Melissa as her eyes brightened.Klein did not turn down his sister\u2019s goodwill. He approached the \u201ctortoise\u201d and waited for it to stop before laughing. He said, \u201cSimplicity and regularity can indeed help relaxation.\u201dWithout waiting for Melissa\u2019s reply, Klein pointed to the \u201ctortoise\u201d and casually asked, \u201cDid you make this yourself? When did you make this? Why wasn\u2019t I aware of it?\u201d\u201cI made use of unwanted materials from school and things picked up from the streets to make this. It was only finished two days ago,\u201d Melissa said in her usual tone, the side of her lips upturned a few more degrees.\u201cThat\u2019s impressive,\u201d Klein praised sincerely.As a boy with poor skills in machine assembly, he encountered great difficulties even assembling a four-wheel toy car as a child.With her chin slightly raised and her eyes slightly bent, Melissa calmly replied, \u201cIt was okay.\u201d\u201cBeing overly humble is a bad trait,\u201d Klein smiled slightly and continued, \u201cThis is a tortoise, right?\u201dInstantly, the atmosphere in the room took a great plunge, leaving behind an air of graveness for a while. Then, Melissa faintly replied with a voice that seemed enigmatic like the crimson veil, \u201cIt\u2019s a puppet.\u201dPuppet\u2026Klein gave an awkward smile, and tried to forcefully explain, \u201cThe problem lies in the materials, they\u2019re too rudimentary.\u201dFollowing that, he tried to change the topic and said, \u201cWhy would you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night? Isn\u2019t there a toilet here? Don\u2019t you always sleep till dawn?\u201dMelissa was taken aback momentarily.It was only after a few seconds, before she opened her mouth, prepared to explain.At that moment, an intense sound of digestion sounded from herthoracoabdominal <sup>1</sup> area.\u201cI-I\u2019ll go get some more sleep!\u201dBang! She grabbed her tortoise-like \u201cpuppet\u201d, trotted to the interior of the house, and closed the door to her room.Last night\u2019s dinner was too good, she ate too much and now her stomach is having trouble digesting it\u2026 Klein shook his head as he smiled, slowly walking towards his desk. He sat down soundlessly, silently pondering Dunn Smith\u2019s invitation as the crimson red moon emerged from behind the dark clouds.Being a Nighthawk civilian staff member had its apparent disadvantages.With me being a transmigrator, \u201cThe Fool\u201d\u2014initiator of the mysterious Gathering\u2014and the multiple secrets I have, it will be risky to be under the noses of the Church of the Evernight Goddess\u2019s team that specializes in dealing with matters regarding the Beyonders.As long as I join Dunn Smith and his team, I would certainly aim to become a Beyonder. I could then cover up the benefits gained from the Gathering.Yet, becoming a formal member would entail many restrictions on my freedom, like how a civilian staff has to report his leaving of Tingen. No longer would I be able to go wherever I want or do whatever I want. I would miss many opportunities.The Nighthawks are a strict organization. Once a mission is given, I can only wait for the arrangements and accept orders. There is no room for rejection.Beyonders have the risk of losing control.\u2026Having all the disadvantages listed out one by one, Klein turned to considering the necessities and advantages:Judging from the situation of the luck enhancement ritual, I\u2019m not one of the eighty percent of lucky people. In the future, there is bound to be some bizarre event happening to me, increasing the dangers I face.Only by becoming one of the Beyonders or by joining the Nighthawks can I be equipped with the ability to resist.The wish to become a Beyonder cannot be solely reliant on the Gathering. The potion formula is not a major problem, but where can I find the corresponding materials? How am I to obtain and concoct them?Not forgetting the nous of daily practice, I\u2019m faced with serious obstacles! It is just not possible for me to consult Justice and The Hanged Man on every matter and exchange every object with them. This would not only hurt the image of The Fool and arouse their suspicions, but there will also be inadequate time to communicate on such trivial issues.Similarly, I am unable to produce anything that can pique their interest.Besides, more materials would more often than not leave behind the trail of my real identity. Then, \u201conline disputes\u201d would effectively be transformed into \u201coffline conflicts,\u201d bringing about immense troubles.By joining the Nighthawks, there would definitely be contact with the common knowledge of the world of mystery and relevant channels. This can sufficiently accumulate into a corresponding social circle and can be used as leverage. Only then can I initiate the Gathering and in turn gain the greatest benefits from Justice and The Hanged Man. In reality, the gains can feedback into reality, allowing me to obtain more resources and form a virtuous cycle.Of course, I could also go to an organization that is suppressed by the various Churches such as the Psychology Alchemists mentioned by Dunn and join them.Yet I\u2019ll also lose my freedom, and be in a constant state of fear and anxiety. However, more importantly, I have no idea where to look for them. Even if I manage to gain the corresponding information from The Hanged Man, such rash contact with them could endanger my life.Becoming a civilian staff leaves opportunity for a buffer and exit.The inferior recluse hides away in the wild; the superior, the crowd. Perhaps the identity as a Nighthawk can be a better cover.In the future, when I become one of the top authorities of the tribunal, who would imagine that I am a heretic, the head of the secret organization who is working behind the scenes?\u2026As the first rays of the morning sun shone, the crimson disappeared. Gazing at the golden light on the horizons of the sky, Klein made up his mind.He would find Dunn Smith today and become part of the Nighthawk\u2019s civilian staff!At this moment, Melissa, who had gotten out of bed again, had pushed open the door to the room. She was surprised to see her brother stretching in an unglamorous manner. \u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep?\u201d\u201cI was thinking through some things.\u201d Klein smiled, feeling relaxed.Melissa thought for a moment and said, \u201cWhenever I encounter problems, I\u2019ll list out both the pros and cons one by one and compare them. After that, I would be able to get a hint of what I should do next.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good habit. I did that too,\u201d Klein smiled and replied.Melissa\u2019s countenance was relaxed, and she did not add more. Holding a yellowish sheet of paper and her toiletries, she headed to the bathroom.Not in a hurry to leave after he finished his breakfast and his sister\u2019s departure, Klein took a good nap. Based on what he knew, nearly all the pubs were closed in the morning.At two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, he smoothed the pleats of his silk hat and handkerchief using a small brush. He also removed the dirt to reestablish the tidiness.Thereafter, he wore a suit of formal clothing, just like he was going for an interview.Besik Street was a little far, and Klein was afraid that he would miss the \u201cworking hours\u201d of the Nighthawk. Therefore, he did not walk there, but instead waited for public horse carriage at Iron Cross Street.In the Loen Kingdom, public horse carriages were placed under two categories\u2014without track and with track.The former consisted of a carriage drawn by two horses and could sit approximately 20 people while taking into account the top of the carriage. Only a general route existed, without specific stations. It had flexible operations and could be hailed anywhere unless it was full.The latter was operated by the Orbital Carriage Company. First, a rail-like service device was laid on the main street. The horses would move on the inner lane while the wheels ran on the tracks, making it easier and more labor-saving. This could thus pull a bigger double-decker carriage that sat nearly fifty passengers.However, the only problem was that the route and stations were fixed, making many places inaccessible.After ten minutes, the sound of the wheels hitting the tracks approached from a distance. A double-decker horse carriage stopped in front of the station at Iron Cross Street.\u201cTo Besik Street,\u201d Klein said to the carriage driver.\u201cYou have to transfer at Champagne Street but when you get there, it takes about ten minutes to walk to Besik Street,\u201d explained the carriage driver to Klein, with regards to the route.\u201cLet\u2019s go to Champagne Street then.\u201d Klein nodded in approval.\u201cIt\u2019s more than four kilometers, four pence\u201d, said a young man with a fair and clean face, as he extended his hand.He was a worker responsible for money collection.\u201cOkay.\u201d Klein fished out four copper coins from his pocket and handed it to the other party.He walked up to the carriage and found that there were not many passengers. Even on the first floor, there were a few empty seats.\u201cI only have three pence on me now, so I can only walk when I go back\u2026\u201d Klein pressed his hat down and sat down firmly.On this floor, the men and women were mostly well-dressed although there were a few clothed in their work clothes, leisurely reading newspapers. Almost no one spoke, and it was quite quiet.Klein shut his eyes and recharged his strength, oblivious to the coming and going of passengers around him.Station after station passed until he finally heard the few words \u201cChampagne Street.\u201dAfter alighting the horse carriage, he inquired along the way and soon reached Besik Street, where he saw the pub with the brownish-yellow hound logo.Klein reached out his right hand and gave a forceful push. The heavy door gradually opened, inundating him with a wave of uproarious noises and an impetuous heat wave.Although it was still afternoon, there were already many customers in the pub. Some were temporary workers, looking for opportunities here, waiting to be hired. Others were simply idling around, numbing themselves with alcohol.The pub was dimly lit. In the center, there were two large iron cages with a third of its bottom sinking deep into the ground without any gaps.People held wooden wine cups and surrounded it, sometimes discussing loudly while laughing, sometimes cursing loudly.Giving a curious glance, Klein found two dogs caged inside. One was black and white, similar to the husky found on Earth. The other was wholly black, with shiny fur, making it look healthy and fierce.\u201cDo you want to bet? Doug has won eight games in a row!\u201d said a little man wearing a brown beret, as he neared Klein and pointed to the black dog.Bet? Taken aback at first, Klein regained his senses immediately.\u201cDog-fighting?\u201dWhen he was at Khoy University, those aristocratic and wealthy students would always ask him contemptuously and curiously, if the boorish workers and unemployed hooligans enjoyed participating in boxing and gambling at the pubs.Besides being able to gamble on boxing and card games, didn\u2019t it also include cruel and bloody activities like cock-fighting, dog-fighting, and others?The short man smirked. \u201cMister, we\u2019re civilized people. We don\u2019t engage in such unglamorous activities.\u201dHaving said that, he whispered, \u201cBesides, laws were introduced to ban these things last year\u2026\u201d\u201cThen what are y\u2019all betting on?\u201d asked Klein curiously.\u201cThe better hunter.\u201d Just as the short man finished his sentence, a resounding cacophony sounded.He turned his head, waved his hands excitedly, and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t place a bet for this round as it has started, wait for the next one then.\u201dUpon hearing that, Klein tipped his toes, lifted his head, and looked as far as he could.He saw two strong men each dragging a sack, coming to the side of the iron cage and opening the \u201cprison door.\u201d They then dumped the contents of the sack into the cage.There were gray and disgusting animals!Klein tried to identify them carefully before realizing that they were rats. Hundreds of rats!As the iron cage was deep underground without any gaps, the rats moved in all directions but could not find a way out.Right then, just as the door of the cage was closed, the chain of the two dogs were untied.\u201cWoof!\u201d The black dog pounced ahead and killed a rat in one bite.The black-and-white dog was dazed at first before it started playing excitedly with the rats.The surrounding people either raised their wine cups and intensified their gaze or shouted loudly, \u201cBite it! Kill it!\u201d\u201cDoug, Doug!\u201dMotherf**king rat-baiting with\u00a0dogs <sup>2</sup> \u2026 Klein regained his senses and the corner of his mouth twitched unceasingly.The objective of the gamble is to determine which dog can catch more rats\u2026Perhaps, one can even bet on the specific number of rats caught\u2026No wonder there were people purchasing live rats at Iron Cross Street\u2026That\u2019s really unique\u2026Klein shook his head, laughing as he backtracked, and circled along the edge of the alcoholic customers, and reached the front of the bar.\u201cNew here?\u201d said the bartender as he spared Klein a glance while wiping the cups. He continued, \u201cOne cup of rye beer is a penny. Enmat beer, costs two pence. Four pence for Southville beer, or do you want a cup of purely brewed malt Lanti?\u201d\u201cI came here for Mr. Wright,\u201d said Klein directly and bluntly.The bartender whistled and shouted to the side, \u201cOld Man, someone is looking for you.\u201d\u201cOh, who\u2026\u201d A vague voice sounded, and an intoxicated old man stood up from behind the bar.He rubbed his eyes, shifted his gaze to Klein and asked, \u201cLad, were you looking for me?\u201d\u201cMr. Wright, I would like to hire a small mercenary squad for a mission,\u201d replied Klein, according to what Dunn had instructed.\u201cA small mercenary squad? Are you living in an adventure story? This hasn\u2019t been around for a long time!\u201d the bartender interrupted and smiled.Wright went silent for a few second before saying, \u201cWho told you to look for it here?\u201d\u201cDunn. Dunn Smith,\u201d replied Klein in all honesty.Instantly, Wright broke out in a chuckle and replied, \u201cI see. Actually, the small mercenary squad still exists. It\u2019s just in another form, with a more contemporary name. You can find it on the second floor of No. 36 Zouteland Street.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d thanked Klein sincerely before he turned and squeezed out of the pub.Before he went out the pub, the alcoholic customers who surrounded him suddenly quieted down, as they murmured, \u201cDoug was actually defeated\u2026\u201d\u201cDefeated\u2026\u201dKlein smiled and shook his head. Then he left quickly and found his way to the nearby Zoeterland Street after asking around.\u201c30, 32, 34\u2026 Here,\u201d he counted the house numbers and walked into the stairwell.Going around the corner and slowly climbing up the stairs, he saw the vertical sign with the current name of the so-called small mercenary squad.\u201cBlackthorn Security Company.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Knock! Knock!The sound echoed slowly but rhythmically, but there was no response; only a faint sputtering sound could be heard.Knock! Knock! Knock!Klein repeated, only to be met with the same outcome.He switched to pushing the door, making the gap larger as he stared inside\u2014a classic sofa which might have been for serving guests, a soft fabric armchair, and a burly wood coffee table. There was a girl with brown hair behind a table right across with her head drooped.Even though \u201cSecurity Company\u201d is just a guise, isn\u2019t this just\u2026 just too \u201cunprofessional?\u201d How long has this place been out of business? Right, you guys don\u2019t need any business\u2026 Klein drew closer as he complained silently and knocked on the table just beside the girl\u2019s ear.Knock! Knock!The brown-haired girl sat up immediately and swiftly took the newspaper in front of her, covering her face.Tingen City Honest Paper\u2026 Nice name\u2026 Klein silently read the title of the page facing him.\u201cThe steam train service \u2018Soaring Express\u2019 that directly reaches Constant City is starting operations today\u2026 Oh come on, when will there be one that goes straight to Brindisi Bay. I really don\u2019t want to take the ship there again, it\u2019s too awful, really awful\u2026 Hey, who are you?\u201d The girl with brown hair read pretentiously and gave her opinion. As she spoke, she lowered the newspaper and revealed her bright forehead and light-brown eyes, looking at Klein with a fawning and startled look.\u201cHello, I am Klein Moretti, and I am here at the invitation of Dunn Smith,\u201d Klein said as he took down his hat to his chest and bowed slightly.The brown-haired girl looked to be in her early twenties. She wore a light green, Loen-styled dress. She was set off with beautiful laces on her sleeves, collar, and chest.\u201cThe Captain\u2026 alright, wait here for a moment. I\u2019ll go get him.\u201d The girl scurried up and went into the room beside her.She didn\u2019t even serve a cup of water or anything\u2026 The level of service awareness is worrying\u2026 Klein smiled faintly as he waited at his spot.After two to three minutes, the brown-haired girl opened the door and came out. She said with a sweet smile, \u201cMr. Moretti, please follow me. The Captain is on watch at the \u2018Chanis Gate\u2019 and is unable to leave at the moment.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Klein quickly followed behind. In his mind, he pondered to himself.Chanis Gate, what could that be?Going through the partition, the first thing he saw was a small corridor, with only three offices on each side.Some of these offices were locked tight, while some were opened, revealing someone on the inside who typed non-stop on a heavy mechanical typewriter.At a glance, Klein noticed a familiar figure: the young officer that had investigated his apartment, the one with the black hair and blue eye and romantic vibe of a poet.He was not in official wear; his white collared shirt was not tucked in, making for quite an unruly appearance.Perhaps he really is a poet\u2026 Klein nodded in greeting and was greeted with a smile.The brown-haired girl pushed opened the left office door at the end of the room and pointed inside, chirping, \u201cWe still have to go down a few levels.\u201dThis office had no furniture in place, only a grayish-white stone staircase that extended downwards.The two sides of the stairs were lit up by gas lamps. The stable glow dispelled the darkness and gave a sense of harmony.The brown-haired girl walked in front, staring at her feet while walking carefully.\u201cAlthough I walk here often, I am still constantly afraid of falling down, tumbling down like a barrel. You don\u2019t know, Leonard did such a folly. On the first day of becoming a \u2018Sleepless\u2019\u2014the first day where he had not mastered his new powers\u2014he tried to rush down the flight of stairs. And-and he became a cartwheel. Haha, it was hilarious if you think about it. Oh yes, it was the guy that greeted you just now. This was about three years ago. Speaking of which, I have been with the Nighthawks for five years; I was only seventeen when I joined\u2026\u201dThe girl watched her steps as she spoke. Suddenly, she smacked her forehead and said, \u201cI forgot to introduce myself! I\u2019m Rozanne. My father was a member of the Nighthawks, who sacrificed himself in an accident five years ago. I suppose we are colleagues from now on\u2014 Err, yeah \u2018colleague\u2019 is the right word\u2026 we are not teammates since we are not Beyonders.\u201d\u201cI hope to have the honor, but still it depends on what Mr. Smith has to say,\u201d Klein said as he sized up the enclosed surroundings. He felt that they were going underground\u2014dampness seeped out from the stone walls, dispelling the summer heat.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the fact that you came so far means the Captain has agreed. I\u2019ve always been a little afraid of him, even though he is amiable, a fatherly figure. I don\u2019t know why but I\u2019m still afraid.\u201d Rozanne spoke as though there was a piece of sweet in her throat.Klein answered humorously, \u201cIsn\u2019t being afraid of a father normal?\u201d\u201cTrue.\u201d Rozanne said as she held the wall around the bend.As they spoke, the two finished walking down the stairs and reached a stone-paved floor.It was a long aisle; both sides of the walls were mounted with gas lamps surrounded by metal gratings. Klein and Rozanne\u2019s shadows were elongated under the illumination.Klein keenly noticed that there was a \u201cDark Sacred Emblem\u201d every few meters\u2014the symbol of the Evernight Goddess. A deep black background dotted with sparkling embellishments, as they clustered precisely half the crimson moon.These emblems did not seem special, but walking between them gave Klein a sense of serenity. Rozanne also stopped talking, unlike her previous talkative state.Before long, an intersection appeared up front. Rozanne briefly introduced,\u201cThe path to the left will lead to the Saint Selena Cathedral; to the right are the armory, storeroom, and archives. And straight ahead is the Chanis Gate.\u201dSaint Selena Cathedral? Then, Zouteland Street is just behind Red Moonlight Street? Klein was a little stunned.Saint Selena Cathedral of Red Moonlight Street was the headquarters of the Church of the Evernight Goddess in Tingen, a sacred ground where local followers yearned to visit. Along with \u201cHoly Numerics Cathedral\u201d of the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery in the suburbs, and the \u201cRiver and Sea Cathedral\u201d of the Church of the Lord of Storms in North Tingen, they sustained the religious circles in Tingen city and its affiliated towns and villages.Aware that his status made it unsuitable for him to ask more, Klein only listened silently.They passed the intersection and moved straight ahead. In less than a minute, a black iron split gate carved with seven sacred emblems were seen.It stood there, heavy, cold and domineering, like a giant guarding in the darkness.\u201cChanis Gate.\u201d Rozanne reminded him and pointed at the room beside them, saying, \u201cCaptain is inside. Go on in by yourself.\u201d\u201cAlright, thank you.\u201d Klein replied politely.The room Rozanne was referring to was just in front of \u201cChanis Gate.\u201d The windows were opened, revealing the lit room inside. Klein took a deep breath to calm himself.Knock! Knock! Knock!\u201cCome in.\u201d He heard Dunn Smith\u2019s deep and amiable voice.Klein opened the unlatched door gently. There was only a table and four chairs inside. Dunn Smith with his high hairline, who was wearing the black coat from the previous night plus a gold watch chain around his chest, was reading the newspaper leisurely.\u201cCome and have a seat. Have you decided? Are you certain you want to join us?\u201d Dunn smiled and asked as he put down the newspaper.Klein removed his hat and bowed, then he sat beside the table and said, \u201cYes, I am certain.\u201d\u201cThen take a look at this deed, heh heh. People like to call it a contract now.\u201d Dunn pulled out the table drawer and took out two contract copies.There were not many clauses, and most of them had been mentioned by Dunn Smith. The emphasis was on the confidential clause. Violators were tried in the tribunal courts of the Church of the Evernight Goddess instead of the kingdom\u2019s courts. It was akin to how soldiers and officers were sent to court martial for trials.A five year contract\u2026 Two pounds and ten soli for weekly wages, ten soli as compensation for the risk and confidentiality\u2026 Klein read through it and answered resolutely, \u201cI\u2019ve no problem with it.\u201d\u201cThen sign it,\u201d Dunn said as he pointed to the dark red fountain pen and ink.Klein used a piece of waste paper to try out the pen before drawing a breath. He signed on both contracts with his name: Klein Moretti.As he did not have a stamp yet, he could only use his thumbprint.Dunn received the contract, took out a stamp from the drawer, and stamped on the end of the contract and a few key parts.With that done, he stood up and returned a contract with one hand, and reached for Klein with the other saying, \u201cWelcome, from now on, you are one of us, and please note that the contract is confidential as well.\u201dKlein stood up as well. He received the contract, shook his hand, and said, \u201cSo, I shall be addressing you as Captain?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Dunn\u2019s grayish eyes seemed especially deep in the dim surroundings.After shaking hands, they sat down. Klein glanced at the stamp on the contract, it read: \u201cNighthawks Squad, Tingen City, Awwa County, Loen Kingdom.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe you guys would use the name \u2018Blackthorn Security Company\u2019 as a disguise,\u201d he laughed and said.\u201cActually, we have other signboards.\u201d Dunn pulled out a piece of paper from the drawer.It was stamped with the stamps of the city government and the police department. The content were as follows: \u201cSeventh Unit, Special Operations Department, Awwa County Police, Loen Kingdom.\u201d\u201cThe first four units are the regular police responsible for general security, like the VIP Protection Unit and Key Installations Protection Unit. And from unit five onwards are the ones dealing with supernatural incidents in each city. Our unit is responsible for incidents related to the followers of Evernight Goddess in Tingen. If there are different types of followers, then we divide the area accordingly; we are mainly in charge of places like the north, west and the Golden Indus region.\u201dDunn briefly introduced, \u201cUnit Six of the Mandated Punisher squad under the Church of the Lord of Storms is in charge of the pier region, the east, and the south. The university area and the suburbs are under Unit Five, which is the Machinery Hivemind squad in Tingen.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Klein had no questions about it. He then laughed. \u201cWhat happens if someone really comes here due to the \u2018Blackthorn Security Company\u2019 signboard and requests for our services?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll take those requests; why shouldn\u2019t we? As long as it doesn\u2019t affect our daily operations,\u201d Dunn said slowly and humorously. \u201cAny earnings would be considered additional bonuses, so our members are quite willing to take those jobs. Anyway, the market for trivial and troublesome matters such as finding dogs and cats have been monopolized by private detectives.\u201d\u201cSo how many people are there in this Nighthawks squad?\u201d Klein asked since they were on this topic.\u201cThere aren\u2019t many supernatural incidents, so there are even fewer Beyonders. There are only six formal members of the Nighthawks in the entire Tingen City, including me. Heh heh, as for civilian staff, there are six including you.\u201dKlein nodded his head, and eventually asked the question that he was most concerned about, \u201cSo, Captain, what do you mean by Beyonders losing control? Why does it happen?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 - Origin and CausePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 18: Origin and CauseTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosUpon hearing Klein\u2019s question, Dunn looked out of the window toward the corridor that led to Chanis Gate. He took out his pipe, stuffed it with some tobacco and mint leaves, and held it to his nose. He took a deep whiff as his voice turned reflective and drifting.\u201cOnly at home can I enjoy the beautiful flavors of tobacco mixed with mint leaves without any worries\u2026 Klein, do you know about the creation myth?\u201d\u201cOf course, when I received primary education during Sunday school, we learned to read using The Revelation of Evernight. Among them, the Book of Wisdom and the Letters from the Saints mentioned the myth of creation.\u201d Klein attempted to recall via the memory fragments of the original Klein. He slowed down his tempo and said, \u201cThe Creator awoke from Chaos and shattered the darkness, creating the first ray of light. He then fused himself completely into the universe and made up all of existence. His body became the land and stars. One of his eyes became the sun, while the other became the crimson moon. Some of his blood rushed into the seas and rivers, nourishing and nurturing lives\u2026\u201dKlein subconsciously paused when he said that. Partially, it was because the relevant memories were a blur and that the creation myth was very similar to the Chinese creation myth of Pangu.The imaginations of people from different worlds shared something in common on their myths and legends!Noticing that Klein was having \u2018trouble,\u2019 Dunn smiled and added, \u201cHis lungs turned into the elves; His heart turned into the giants; His liver turned into the treants; His brain turned into the dragons; His kidneys turned into the feather serpents; His hair turned into the phoenixes; His ears turned into the demonic wolves; His mouth and teeth turned into the mutants, and His remaining bodily fluids turned into the sea monsters, of which the essence was Naga. His stomach, His small and large intestines, and the evil parts of His body turned into devils, evil spirits and various kinds of unknown maleficent existences. His spirit became the Eternal Blazing Sun, the Lord of the Storms, and the God of Knowledge and Wisdom\u2026\u201d\u201cHis wisdom gave birth to humanity. That was the first Epoch, the Chaos Epoch.\u201d Klein finished the last sentence for Dunn, but he found it funny and ridiculous.As a keyboard folklorist, it was the first time he came into contact with a creation myth that was \u2018arranged\u2019 in such great detail. It was so detailed that almost every prominent race corresponded to a particular body part of the Creator.It\u2019s like a children\u2019s song with children sitting in a row and eating fruit\u2026Furthermore, it was not only mentioned in the canon of the Evernight Goddess. The Churches of the Lord of Storms and God of Steam and Machinery also had similar descriptions. None of them alleviated themselves or devalued the other gods\u2026This either means that the creation myth is real or hints that the few Churches had undergone a long period of strife before compromising before the Fifth Epoch\u2026With this in mind, Klein suddenly had another question. He asked with a frown, \u201cIt feels problematic. Why are the Eternal Blazing Sun, Lord of Storms, and God of Knowledge and Wisdom born directly from the Creator\u2019s spirit, while the Goddess isn\u2019t?\u201dIn the Revelation of Evernight\u2019s prehistorical records, the Evernight Goddess had only awoken at the end of the Second Epoch. Together with the Lord of Storms, Eternal Blazing Sun, and other gods, she blessed and help humanity survive the Cataclysm. It was also known as the Third Epoch, the Cataclysm Epoch.It was during that time that Mother Earth and the God of War appeared as well. As for the God of Steam and Machinery, whose original name was the God of Craftsmanship, He was born only in the Fourth Epoch.In that sense, the standing among the gods seemed self-evident.The ones who were more ancient was more orthodox. It was extremely clear!This also troubled the believers of the Evernight Goddess.Dunn Smith held his pipe with another hand and instead of answering, he returned with a question, \u201cRepeat the Goddess\u2019s full title.\u201dKlein immediately felt like he had stabbed himself with a knife. He racked his brains and tried his best to recall.\u201cThe Evernight Goddess is nobler than the stars and more eternal than eternity. She is also the Lady of Crimson, the Mother of the Secrets, the Empress of Disaster and Horror, Mistress of Calm and Silence.\u201dThankfully, Klein\u2019s mother was a devout believer of the Evernight Goddess. When she was still alive, she would recite this every evening at dinner. Even though the memories of the original Klein had fragmented, not all was lost.\u201cWhat does the Lady of Crimson symbolize?\u201d Dunn asked with a guiding tone.\u201cThe red moon.\u201d The moment Klein answered, he immediately understood.\u201cThen which part of the Creator did the red moon come from?\u201d asked Dunn with a smile.\u201cA single eye!\u201d Klein and Dunn smiled at each other.This was no way less impressive than the Lord of Storms who was formed from a third of the Creator\u2019s spirit!As for the Churches of Mother Earth and the God of War, they likely had similar explanations. However, the God of Steam and Machinery had been born too late to find a reason; thus, their church had been weak in the past thousand plus years. It was only with the invention of the steam engine that they seized the opportunity to truly be on par with the other gods.Dunn stroked his pipe gently.\u201cHumanity was born out of the wisdom of the Creator, so we have clever and extraordinary brains, but lack other magical powers. However, from the creation myth, we can form a simple but clear conclusion. Everything stems from the same origin.\u201d\u201cStems from the same origin\u2026\u201d Klein repeated the last few words.\u201cAccording to this conclusion, humans who are protected by the gods were able to resist the giants, devils, and the mutants. Gradually, they figured out means to obtain the power of the Beyonders. That is by using the corresponding parts of the evil spirits, dragons, monsters, magical trees, flowers, or crystals and combining them with other materials to form potions. By consuming and absorbing the potion, one will gain different powers. This is common knowledge among mysticism studies.\u201dDunn did not elaborate in detail and only gave a brief introduction. \u201cIn this process, our ancestors relied on painful lessons to discover that if they were to consume high-grade or extraordinary potions, it would easily lead to tragic consequences. There are three possible outcomes.\u201d\u201cWhich three?\u201d pressed Klein curiously.\u201cFirst, mental death and the complete breakdown of a body. Every piece of flesh would become a terrifying monster. Second, their personality will be changed by the powers contained in the potion. They will turn cold, sensitive, irascible, cruel, and indifferent. Third, well\u2026\u201d Dunn put down his pipe and picked up a porcelain cup and took a sip. \u201cFermo coffee from the Paz River Valley is bitter, but very fragrant. It leaves a splendid aftertaste. Do you want one?\u201d\u201cI prefer coffee from the Feynapotter plateau. Of course, I have only drank it a few times at Welch\u2019s place.\u201d Klein politely declined. \u201cWhat\u2019s the third outcome?\u201d\u201cMental disorder. Turning crazy on the spot, becoming more devilish than the devil. This is what it means by losing control.\u201d Dunn emphasized the words \u2018losing control.\u2019Without waiting for Klein to say a word, he put down his coffee cup and continued, \u201cAfter a long period of experimentation and exploration, together with the birth of the Blasphemy Slate, humans have finally perfected the potion system. We formed a tiered system that chains into stable progression paths known as Sequences. The lower the number in a Sequence, the higher the grade of a potion. At this point, the seven major churches each control at least one complete Sequence. Besides, there are also incomplete \u2018paths\u2019 that they have gathered over the past hundreds or thousand years.\u201d\u201cBlasphemy Slate?\u201d Klein sharply noticed the term.At the Gathering, The Hanged Man had also mentioned it!According to The Hanged Man, the Blasphemy Slate was the most critical factor of a potion\u2019s system formation and completion!That seemed to contradict what Dunn had just said.\u201cThose were things created by some evil gods. As for which era it appeared, what it contains or what\u2019s so special about it, I am unsure as well. If you discover any clues, you have to immediately report it to me. It deserves the highest level of response,\u201d said Dunn vaguely. \u201cI mentioned one of the types of losing control. I\u2019ll now tell you the remaining four.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein pushed the question of the Blasphemy Slate to the back of his mind and listened attentively.\u201cAlthough humans have clever minds, they lack extraordinary powers, it is not absolute. There are always a few lucky ones; perhaps I should call them the unlucky ones. They are born with relatively higher perception. Well, it also means the ability to sense spirits. They can hear voices that others cannot hear and see things that others cannot see. They have partial characteristics of Beyonders.\u201dWhile Dunn spoke, he looked at the empty air around him and watched Klein shudder in fear. \u201cIn other words, if they are half a Sequence 9 Beyonder and have fixed characteristics. Oh, Sequence 9 is the lowest grade in the \u2018chain\u2026\u2019 In short, they can only choose a corresponding, fixed Sequence pathway. If they consume other potions, the effects might range from mental disorders to a loss of control, or even worse, death.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d Klein nodded slowly.\u201cThe third kind is similar to the second kind. Once you choose a Sequence chain, you will be forced to go down that path. There will be no room for regret. If you were to consume potions from the corresponding Sequence of other \u2018paths,\u2019 there will be a high probability you will get mixed, unusual and warped powers. But it is almost certain that you would be in a semi-deranged state; sensitive and irascible, cruel and bloodthirsty, and silent and melancholic.\u201cAnd there is only one such opportunity. After that, regardless if you consume the potions from the original path or potions in the present Sequence, the only result is a loss of control. The outcome could then be mental death; alternatively, the body breaks down into monsters or even transforms into an evil spirit.\u201d As Dunn spoke, he lifted his coffee cup to take a sip.Klein, who turned alarmed and fearful after hearing this, fell silent for a few seconds before asking, \u201cWhat about the fourth kind?\u201d\u201cThe fourth kind, heh heh. That is the most common problem. When we consume potions to gain powers that originally belong to extraordinary beings, we undergo an unnatural transformation. Therefore, we would more or less be affected by the remnant spiritual powers. While perhaps the symptoms might not manifest and are undetectable to others, it will definitely lurk in one\u2019s mind. If one rushes to consume the corresponding potion ranked higher in the Sequence before fully grasping the extraordinary powers the potion brings and eliminating the subtle traces, the madness will accumulate, increasing the chances of losing control\u2026\u201d Dunn suddenly fell silent.After a short pause, he said with a sigh, \u201cAs per the internal rules of us Nighthawks, even if a teammate were to make a great contribution, they must have consumed the last potion three years ago and be examined before they can be promoted. Even so, there are still many who lose control every year.\u201dHow terrifying\u2026 Klein drew a gasp as he asked, \u201cThen what about the final kind?\u201dThere was no trace of a smile despite Dunn\u2019s curved lips.\u201cThe fifth kind is the most common reason for a loss of control. For Beyonders, one\u2019s spiritual perception would be enhanced more or less. The smaller the number in the Sequence, the more enhanced their perception. Therefore, they would hear what others cannot hear, see what others cannot see, and encounter things others would not encounter. They are constantly met with mysterious enticement and illusionary bewitchment. Once they are overstimulated or have greedy desires, they will slowly go down the path of losing control.\u201dAs he spoke, Dunn looked straight at Klein, his gray pupils reflecting Klein\u2019s figure.His tone turned bleak as he said, \u201cThe founder of the Nighthawks, Archbishop Chanis, once said, \u2018We are guardians, but also a bunch of miserable wretches that are constantly fighting against dangers and madness.'\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The room was illuminated with bright yellow lights. Dunn Smith\u2019s delivery echoed, sending blow after blow to Klein\u2019s heart. It left him temporarily at a loss for words.Dunn shook his head and smiled when he saw Klein silent.\u201cAre you very disappointed? Beyonders are not like what you imagine them to be. We are always treading alongside danger.\u201d\u201cThere is always a price to any gain.\u201d Klein recovered from his shock as he answered with a quivering voice.It was true that he never imagined that the halo, extraordinariness, and the inordinary aspects of a Beyonder would have such hidden threats. Perhaps it was only because he was hearing a description without witnessing it first hand and that he had been sucked into the vortex with a peculiar incident already befalling him. Klein soon brought his fear, uneasiness, worry, and apprehension under control.Of course, the thought of shrinking back was inevitable; it lingered around and refused to leave.\u201cNot bad. Very mature and rational\u2026\u201d Dunn finished the last mouthful of coffee and added, \u201cAlso, Beyonders are not as powerful as you imagine them to be, especially a low-Sequence Beyonder. Heh, why would we use 1 to represent the highest grade and 9 the lowest? Isn\u2019t this against intuition and logic? The low Sequence we often mention refers to a low grade or a high number. They are the starting point of the Sequence chain.\u201cAlright, where was I? Yes, Beyonders are not as powerful as you imagine. A low-Sequence Beyonder\u2019s power is no match for guns, much less cannons. They are just more fascinating and indefensible than firearms. If you have a chance to become a Beyonder in the future, you must consider what I said today carefully. Do not make a rash decision.\u201dKlein gave a self-deprecating smile.\u201cI don\u2019t even know when I will have the chance.\u201dHe felt that he would not miss the opportunity if it presented itself to him. Consuming the wrong potion or a higher-ranked potion in the Sequence could be mostly avoid. The major potential danger was the subtle influences the potions had and what he experienced from having heightened auditory and visual perceptions.For the former, he could draw on the experiences from generations of people before him. As long as he was not in a rush to advance himself and patiently grasped control over his powers, the chances of losing control were relatively low. Furthermore, he still had to resolve the potential problem that he currently faced. He had to understand the essence of mysticism and seek a way to transmigrate back. These were the underlying reasons for taking the first step. He did not aim for higher Sequence spots. If it was easy to lose control, he could just forget about advancement, stay in his original Sequence, and rely on knowledge to plan a way \u2018home.\u2019It was needless to elaborate on the potential risks. Back when Klein held the luck enhancement ritual, he was nearly driven crazy. The murmurings that nearly blew up his head were still fresh in his mind. They were not unavoidable by not becoming a Beyonder; therefore, it was better to gain power that allowed him to defend himself.With this in mind, Klein felt that the pros clearly outweighed the cons. It made his thoughts of withdrawal almost disappear.Dunn picked up his pipe again as his gray eyes carried a smiling trace to them.\u201cI cannot give you an accurate answer on this. To become a Beyonder, firstly, you must make enough contributions. Perhaps tomorrow or the day after, you would be able to interpret critical ancient documents. Maybe you would be able to give us valuable ideas for one of our cases? Secondly, it depends on the arrangements of the higher-ups. No one can be sure.\u201cAlright, I believe you should know quite a bit about Beyonders now. In the future, do not make a rash decision. Now, I\u2019ll introduce you to our Nighthawk team\u2019s civilian jobs.\u201dHe stood up and walked to the door. He pointed in the opposite direction of Chanis Gate and said, \u201cWe have an accountant and someone else who is in charge of procuring necessities and collecting supplies handed out by the Church and the police department while standing in as a carriage driver. They are professionals and do not need to take shifts, so they can rest on weekends. The other three civilian staff are Rozanne, Bredt, and Old Neil. Their jobs include: attending to visitors, cleaning the rooms, and writing case files and inventory registration lists. They also guard the armory, storeroom, and the archives, strictly enforcing the registration should someone wish to enter, take out or return an item. Each of them has one day off a week, other than Sundays. They negotiate among themselves on the arrangement of night shifts and rest days.\u201d\u201cSo is my job scope the same as Rozanne and the rest?\u201d Klein swept away his thoughts about Beyonders and tried to clarify his job responsibilities.\u201cNo, there\u2019s no need. You are a professional,\u201d said Dunn with a smile. \u201cYou currently have two tasks. First, every morning or afternoon, go take a stroll outside. Focus on the various streets that lead from Welch\u2019s place to yours.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Klein was dumbfounded.What kind of job is this?Is that very professional?Dunn inserted his hands into the pockets of his black windbreaker and said, \u201cAfter you confirm that you have lost your memories, we will close the case on Welch and Naya. Similarly, that diary of the Antigonus family has vanished completely. We suspect that you brought it with you. You might have hidden it on your way home which might be why we did not find any clues at your place. This is also likely the reason why you were not there and chose to commit suicide at home.\u201cAlthough you were mysteriously influenced and have forgotten this piece of memory, the human spirit and brain is very fascinating, so there might be residual traces. Daly might not be able to obtain them through her means as a medium, but it does not mean that they do not exist. Perhaps you will feel a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at a familiar and critical spot.\u201cThat is what we wish to obtain.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d Klein was enlightened.The Nighthawks\u2019 deduction of the diary\u2019s location was indeed reasonable.He was the only one alive among the people involved. Only he had the time and motive to take the diary away and hide it on his way back!\u201cIf you can find the diary this way, you will likely made enough of a contribution to become a Beyonder,\u201d encouraged Dunn, indirectly revealing the importance of the diary.\u201cI hope.\u201d Klein nodded.Dunn changed the subject again.\u201cSecondly, you get a day off every week. You can decide which day it is for now. When you are not outside, go to our armory and read the literature and canon books. This is a job for a professional historian. When you finish them all, you will have to begin taking shifts with Old Neil and the rest.\u201d\u201cAlright, no problem.\u201d Klein heaved a sigh of relief.This is not something too difficult\u2026At this moment, Dunn turned his body halfway and pointed to the black outward-swinging gates that was engraved with seven sacred emblems.\u201cThis is Chanis Gate. It is named after the creator of the modern Nighthawk system, Archbishop Chanis. There is one under the central cathedral of every major city.\u201cIt is guarded by formal Nighthawk members on rotation. Inside, there are at least two \u2018Keepers\u2019 who are sent by the Church, as well as countless traps. You must not approach it under any circumstance; otherwise, misfortune will befall you.\u201d\u201cThat sounds scary,\u201d Klein expressed his feelings.\u201cThe area inside is divided into a few zones. Stored within are certain potion formulas for certain Sequences and other magical materials. It is also used to temporarily hold heretics, mutants, cultists, and members of secret organizations. Heh heh, they will eventually be sent to the Holy Cathedral,\u201d introduced Dunn in passing.Holy Cathedral? The headquarters of the Church of the Evernight Goddess located in the Winter County to the north of the kingdom, Cathedral of Serenity? Klein nodded slightly as though he was pondering over the matter.\u201cIn addition, there are all sorts of classified documents and records inside. When you gain a higher clearance, you might have a chance of reading them.\u201d Dunn hesitated for a moment before adding, \u201cBehind the Chanis Gate, there are also Sealed Artifacts in the basement.\u201d\u201cSealed Artifacts?\u201d Klein ruminated on the terms.It sounded like a specialized term.\u201cSome of the extraordinary items we gather and retrieve are just too important and magical. If they fall into the wrong hands, it would cause immense destruction. Therefore, we have to keep it strictly confidential and watch them carefully. Even we can only use it under special circumstances. Besides\u2026\u201d With that said, Dunn paused for a moment before continuing, \u201cBesides, there are some things inside that are very special. They had certain \u2018living\u2019 characteristics which can entice the Keepers. It would influence the surroundings, attempt escape, and cause catastrophic outcomes. They have to be strictly controlled.\u201d\u201cHow fascinating,\u201d commented Klein wistfully.\u201cThe Nighthawk headquarters have categorized these Sealed Artifacts into four grades. Grade 0 represents Extremely Dangerous. They are of the highest importance and of the highest confidentiality. They are not to be inquired, disseminated, described, or spied. They can only be sealed in the basement of the Holy Cathedral,\u201d described Dunn in detail. \u201cGrade 1 is Highly Dangerous. They can be used in limited ways. Their security clearance is limited to diocesan bishops or Nighthawk deacons and above. The central cathedral of diocese headquarters like Backlund can store one to two artifacts. The rest will be handed over to the Holy Cathedral.\u201cGrade 2 is Dangerous. They can be used with care and moderation. The security clearance requires one to be a bishop or a Nighthawk team\u2019s captain and above. The central cathedrals in the various cities can store three to five artifacts. The rest will be turned into the Holy Cathedral or the diocese headquarters. Grade 3 is Considerably Dangerous. They have to be used carefully. It can only be applied for operations that require three or more people. The security clearance requires one to be a formal member of the Nighthawks.\u201d\u201cIn the future, you will see the corresponding documents. Through the numbers, you can understand what they represent. For instance, 2-125 means that it is a Dangerous grade Sealed Artifact No. 125.\u201dAs Dunn went on, he suddenly turned around and returned to his room. He pulled out a piece of paper from the bottom of the drawer.\u201cBy the way, take a look at this. Three years ago, a newly appointed archbishop lost control. For some unknown reason, he stormed through the various levels of protection and vanished mysteriously with a Grade 0 Sealed Artifact. Memorize this photo. If you discover him, do not alert or disturb him. Return to report it immediately or the chance of you dying in the line of duty is a thousand percent.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Klein received the piece of paper. There was no title on it, just a black and white photo with a few lines of words.\u201cInce Zangwill. Male. Forty years old. Former archbishop. A Gatekeeper who failed in his promotion and was enticed by the devil and was corrupted. He escaped with Sealed Artifact 0-08. Particular traits are\u2026\u201dThe picture depicted Ince Zangwill as wearing an all-black clergyman robe with buttons on both sides and a soft cap. His hair was dark blonde and his pupils were so blue that it was nearly black. He had a high nose and his lips were tightly pursed. His facial features were like a classic sculpture without any wrinkles. The most striking characteristic was that he was blind in one eye.\u201cThe description of the corrupted is so detailed but the only thing about the Sealed Artifact is its codename\u2026\u201d Klein honestly offered his first impression.\u201cThat\u2019s why it is at the highest security clearance. The search for Sealed Artifacts No. 0-08 is only described verbally and never written in words. Even so, the description will be little,\u201d said Dunn with a sigh. \u201c0-08 appears to be a common quill, but it does not need ink to write. That\u2019s all.\u201dDunn did not dive deeper into the topic. He tugged at the golden chain on his black windbreaker and took out a gorgeous pocket watch of the same color. He clicked it open and took a glance before pointing outside.\u201cI\u2019ve told you all you need to know. Go to the armory to find Old Neil. Get him to arrange the documents that you need to read. He is no ordinary civilian clerk. He was once a formal member, but due to his advanced age, he failed to be promoted. His health is ailing, so it\u2019s no longer suitable for him to handle cases. Furthermore, he does not wish to become an internal Keeper or rest at home. All he wishes is to be accompanied by documents and records.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, his mind was preoccupied with how Sealed Artifact 0-08 looked.It appears to be just your everyday quill?It writes without ink?Then, what is its actual use? What makes it classified at the highest level of confidentiality that it\u2019s deemed Extremely Dangerous?Can it be a pen that kills anyone whose name is written?No, that would be way too heaven-defying. Ince Zangwill wouldn\u2019t need to escape and hide away if that were the case\u2026Just as Klein turned around to leave, Dunn suddenly shouted out to him.\u201cHold on. I forgot something.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Klein turned his head; his eyes puzzled.Dunn put back his pocket watch and said with a smile, \u201cLater, remember to visit the accountant, Mrs. Orianna, and get an advance payment of four weeks\u2014a total of twelve pounds. After that, you\u2019ll earn half your salary every week until the difference is covered.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too much. There\u2019s no need for this, the amount should be reduced,\u201d said Klein subconsciously.He had no objection towards an advanced payment. After all, he didn\u2019t even have the money needed to pay for the public horse carriage trip home. However, to receive twelve pounds at once left him a little afraid.\u201cNo, it\u2019s necessary,\u201d said Dun as he shook his head and smiled. \u201cThink about it. Do you still wish to continue living in your present apartment? One that needs you to share a bathroom with so many other tenants? Even if you aren\u2019t taking yourself into consideration, think about the lady. Besides\u2026\u201dHe paused when he saw Klein nod in agreement. He smiled and sized up Klein\u2019s garbs and said with a meaningful intent, \u201cBesides, you need a cane, and you should buy a new suit.\u201dKlein was taken aback for a second before snapping back to reality. His face immediately burned with embarrassment since the suit he was wearing was cheap and of inferior quality.Typically, a top hat was made of silk, costing five to six soli. A bow tie was three soli, a walking cane inlaid with silver was seven to eight soli, a shirt was three soli, while pants, a vest, and tuxedo were around seven pounds in total. Leather boots were nine to ten soli. As such, an entire suit cost more than eight pounds and seven soli. Of course, to be a presentable gentleman, one needed a watch chain, a pocket watch, and a wallet.Back then, the original Klein and Benson scrimped and saved before managing to save up a pool of money. When they went to a clothing store to check the price, they ended up running off without even bothering to try haggling. They each bought a set at a bargain shop near Iron Cross Street for a total of less than two pounds.It was also because of that incident that original Klein had a deep impression of the prices of clothes.\u201cO-Okay,\u201d Klein stammered a reply.He was like the original Klein. He was someone who cared about his appearance.Dunn took out the pocket watch again and clicked it open to take a glance at it.\u201cPerhaps you should find Mrs. Orianna first? I know you\u2019ll spend quite some time at Old Neil\u2019s while Mrs. Orianna will likely be returning home soon.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein was acutely aware of his state of poverty and did not object to it.Dunn returned to the table\u2019s side and pulled at a few hanging ropes as he said, \u201cI\u2019ll get Rozanne to bring you there.\u201dThe ropes began their operation as the gears ground, producing a chime from a bell at the reception area of Blackthorn Security Company. When Rozanne heard it, she hurriedly stood up and carefully made her way down.It did not take long before she appeared in front of Klein again.Dunn said humorously, \u201cI did not disturb your rest, right? Oh, bring Moretti to Mrs. Orianna.\u201dRozanne secretly curled her lips as she answered \u2018happily\u2014\u2019\u201cAlright, Captain.\u201d\u201cIs that all?\u201d At that moment, Klein blurted out in surprise.To get his advance payment from finance, isn\u2019t there a need to get an approval letter from the Captain? Shouldn\u2019t you write something?\u201cSo?\u201d Dunn returned with a question.\u201cI mean\u2014 Don\u2019t I need your signature to claim an advance payment from Mrs. Orianna?\u201d Klein tried his best to use simple language.\u201cOh, no. There\u2019s no need. Rozanne is enough proof.\u201d Dunn pointed at the brown-haired girl and gave a reply.Captain, it seems there\u2019s almost zero management of our finances\u2026 Klein resisted his urge to deliver a sarcastic comment before turning to leave the room with Rozanne.At that moment, he heard Dunn shout out again.\u201cHold on. There\u2019s still another thing.\u201dCan we finish it all at once? Klein turned back with a smiling face.\u201cYes?\u201dDunn pressed at his temple and said, \u201cWhen you meet Old Neil, remember to collect ten demon hunting bullets.\u201d\u201cMe? Demon hunting bullets?\u201d Klein returned in astonishment.\u201cWelch\u2019s revolver is still with you, right? There\u2019s no need for you to turn it in.\u201d Dunn inserted a single hand into his pocket and said, \u201cWith the demon hunting bullets, if you were to face with an paranormal danger, you will be able to protect yourself. Uh, it will give you some courage at the very least.\u201dThere\u2019s no need for you to add on the final sentence\u2026 Just as Klein was vexing over the problem, he answered without any hesitation, \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll remember to do so!\u201d\u201cThis will require me to write a formal document. Wait a moment.\u201d Dunn sat down and picked up the dark red fountain pen. He scribbled a \u2018note,\u2019 signed it, and stamped it.\u201cThank you, Captain.\u201d Klein received it sincerely.He slowly walked back before turning around.\u201cHold on.\u201dDunn shouted one more time.\u2026Captain, you look to be in your thirties. Why do you have the symptoms of dementia? Klein squeezed out a smile and turned around to ask, \u201cAnything else?\u201d\u201cI forgot earlier that you are not trained in shooting, so getting demon hunting bullets would be useless. Let\u2019s do this; collect thirty normal bullets every day. Take the opportunity when you are out to go to the street corner\u2014the underground shooting range at No. 3 Zouteland Street. Most of it belongs to the police department, but there is one that is specially for us Nighthawks. Oh, right, you also need to get a badge from Old Neil. Otherwise, you won\u2019t be able to enter the shooting range.\u201d Dunn smacked his forehead and took back the note from Klein. He then added the information and stamped it with another seal.\u201cA good marksman is produced by expending bullets. Do not think lightly of it.\u201d Dunn handed back Klein the modified note.\u201cGot it.\u201d Klein, who was fearful of danger, yearned to visit the shooting range that very day.He took two steps towards the exit before carefully turning around halfways. He deliberated before asking, \u201cCaptain, is there anything else?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Dunn nodded firmly.Klein heaved a sigh of relief and walked straight out the door. While walking, he had the strong urge to turn around to ask another, \u201cAre you sure there\u2019s nothing else?\u201dHe resisted that urge and finally left the Keeper room successfully.\u201cCaptain has always been this way. He often forgets things.\u201d As Rozanne walked by his side, she softly disparaged the captain, \u201cEven my granny has a better memory than him. Of course, he only forgets the trivial stuff. Yea, trivial stuff. Klein, I\u2019ll call you Klein in the future. Mrs. Orianna is a very affable person. It is easy to hit it off with her. Her father is a watchsmith with excellent skill\u2026\u201dAs Klein listened to the brown-haired girl rattle on, he stepped into the stairwell and returned to the upper floor. He found Mrs. Orianna in the far office on the right-hand side.She was a black-haired woman dressed in a flounce lace dress. She appeared in her thirties and had fashionable curly hair. Her pair of green eyes were clear and smiling, and she seemed refined and elegant.After Orianna heard Rozanne repeat Dunn Smith\u2019s instructions, she took out a note and wrote an advance slip.\u201cSign here. Do you have a seal? If not, you can leave a thumbprint.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Now familiar with the procedures, Klein completed the formalities.Orianna took out a copper key and opened the safe in the room. As she counted the pounds, she said with a smile, \u201cYou are lucky. We have enough cash today. By the way, Klein, were you invited by Captain because you were involved in a paranormal activity and the fact that you have a specialty?\u201d\u201cYes, you have an impeccable intuition.\u201d Klein was not stingy with his compliments.Orianna took out four notes with light-gray backgrounds with deep black patterns printed on them. After locking the safe, she turned around and smiled.\u201cThat\u2019s because I had a similar experience too.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Klein showed an appropriate level of surprise.\u201cDo you know about the serial killer that sent Tingen City into a frenzy sixteen years ago?\u201d Orianna handed over the four gold pounds to Klein.\u201c\u2026Yes! It\u2019s the one which had five girls killed consecutively. Some had their hearts and stomachs removed by that Bloody Butcher? My mother often used that matter to scare my sister when we were young,\u201d said Klein as he thought about it.He received the notes and discovered that two of them were in five pound denominations and two of them were in one pound denominations. All of them had a gray background and were inked in black. The four corners had complicated patterns and special ink to prevent counterfeiting.The former notes were slightly bigger and in the middle of them was Loen Kingdom\u2019s fifth king, George III\u2019s direct ancestor, Henry Augustus I. He wore a white hair band above his rotund face. His eyes were slender and he had an abnormally serious expression. However, Klein felt an indescribably sense of closeness to him.This was a five-pound note!It\u2019s almost equal to four weeks of Benson\u2019s salary!In the middle of the one-pound note was George III\u2019s father, the former king, William Augustus VI. This mighty figure had a thick mustache and a firm gaze. While he was in power, he freed the Loen Kingdom from the shackles of the old order, allowing his nation to regain the pinnacle spot.They were all \u2018good kings\u2026\u2019 Klein could faintly smell the notes\u2019 ink that elated and refreshed him.\u201cYes, if the Nighthawks had not come in time, I would have been the sixth victim.\u201d Mrs. Orianna\u2019s tone still hinted at a sense of lingering fear despite the incident having happened more than ten years ago.\u201cI heard that the serial killer, no\u2014 The Butcher was a Beyonder?\u201d Klein carefully folded the paper notes and placed it in an inner pocket of his suit. Then, he patted the area a few times to confirm it was there.\u201cYes.\u201d Mrs. Orianna gave a firm nod. \u201cHe had killed even more before that. The reason why he was captured was because he was preparing a ritual for the devil.\u201d\u201cNo wonder he wanted different organs\u2026 Sorry, Mrs. Orianna for making you recall such unpleasant memories,\u201d said Klein sincerely.Orianna smiled. \u201cI\u2019m no longer afraid\u2026 I was studying accountancy in business school back then. After that incident, I\u2019ve been here ever since. Alright, I\u2019ll stop keeping you from what you should do. You still need to head to Old Neil\u2019s.\u201d\u201cGoodbye, Mrs. Orianna.\u201d Klein took off his hat and bowed before leaving the office. Before he went downstairs, he could not help but pat his inner pocket to make sure the twelve pounds was still there.He did a turn at a cross-junction and headed right. It did not take him long to see a half-closed iron door.Knock! Knock! Knock!While he knocked, an aged voice sounded from inside.\u201cCome in.\u201dKlein pushed open the metal door and discovered a cramped room which only allowed for a desk and two chairs.There was a tightly locked iron door inside the room and behind the desk was a hoary elder dressed in a class black robe. He was reading a few yellowed pages from a book with the illumination of a gas lamp.He raised his head and looked at the door.\u201cAre you Klein Moretti? Rozanne said you were very polite when she came over a while ago.\u201d\u201cMiss Rozanne is really a friendly person. Good afternoon, Mr. Neil.\u201d Klein took off his hat as a gesture of respect.\u201cHave a seat.\u201d Neil pointed to the silver tin can with complex flowery patterns on the table. \u201cWould you like a cup of handground coffee?\u201dThe wrinkles at the edge of his eyes and mouth were deeply recessed. His dark red pupils appeared slightly turbid.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like you drink coffee?\u201d Klein acutely noticed that Neil\u2019s porcelain cup was filled with clear water.\u201cHaha, it\u2019s a habit of mine. I do not drink coffee after three in the afternoon,\u201d Neil explained with a laugh.\u201cWhy?\u201d Klein asked in passing.Neil held back his smile as he looked into Klein\u2019s eyes and said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that it would affect my sleep at night. It will make me hear the murmurings of the unknown existence.\u201dKlein was momentarily unable to answer him as he changed the subject.\u201cMr. Neil, what documents and books should I read?\u201dAs he spoke, he took out the note written by Dunn.\u201cAnything that has to do with history, or are complicated and incomplete. To be honest, I have always been trying to learn, but all I can achieve is a rudimentary grasp. It\u2019s just too troublesome for the other material, such as people\u2019s diaries, contemporary books, epitaphs, etc\u2026\u201d lamented Neil. \u201cFor example, the things I have here require more detailed historical records to determine the exact content.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Klein turned confused.Neil pointed to a few yellowed pages in front of him.\u201cThese are from Roselle Gustav\u2019s lost diary before his death. In order to keep things secret, he used strange symbols he invented to take records.\u201dEmperor Roselle? The transmigration senior? Klein was taken aback as he immediately listened attentively.\u201cMany people believe that he did not truly die, but instead became a hidden god. Therefore, cults which revere him have always been holding various rituals to attempt at gaining power. We will occasionally encounter such incidents and obtain a few original or duplicated copies of the diary,\u201d Neil said with a shake of his head. \u201cTill date, no one has been able to decipher the special symbols\u2019 true meaning. Therefore, the Holy Cathedral has permitted us to keep copies for research, hoping that it would bring them a pleasant surprise.\u201dWith that said, Neil revealed a smug smile.\u201cI have already deciphered a few symbols and have confirmed that they represent numbers. Look at what I discovered. It\u2019s actually a diary! Yes, I wish to use history from different periods, especially events that revolved around the emperor. By comparing those records to the ones written in the diary for the corresponding day, I can try to interpret more of the symbols.\u201cThat\u2019s the mind of a genius, right?\u201d The old gentleman with white hair and deep wrinkles looked at Klein with bright eyes.Klein nodded in agreement.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHaha, you can also take a look at it. Tomorrow, you will have to help me with this diary.\u201d Neil pushed the few yellowed pages towards Klein.Klein turned them around and took a glance at them, but it immediately stunned him!Although the \u2018symbols\u2019 had been copied in terribly ugly fashion, to the point of looking a little distorted, there was no way he could be mistaken\u2026This was because they were words he was most familiar with.Chinese!And it\u2019s f**king Simplified Chinese!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, the elegant gas lamp surrounded by brass grids and the silver-inlaid tin, which Old Neil kept his handground coffee in, made him recognize the reality he was in.The transmigrator, Emperor Roselle, is really a fellow countryman of mine? He was using Simplified Chinese\u2014which doesn\u2019t exist in this world\u2014to record secrets? With the indescribable feeling of identifying an old friend in a different world, Klein quickly read through the three pages.\u201c18th November. Truly a fascinating matter. A blue-sky experimentation and a chance mistake made me discover the pathetic fellow lost and trapped in the deep darkness amid the storms. He can only approach the reality of this world on the day of the full moon every month; yet, he is unable to transmit his cries. He is lucky to have met me, the protagonist of this era.\u201d\u201cAfter reading the paragraph I wrote above, I suddenly felt a little down. Even my Chinese is written like a translation. Four decades have passed in a finger snap. My past memories feel more like a dream.\u201d\u201c1184, 1st January. At the grand New Year Gala, Lady Florena was truly splendid.\u201d\u201c2nd January. My diplomats are all idiots!\u201d\u201c3rd January. I made a hasty choice back then. In hindsight, I should have chosen the Apprentice, the Seer, or the Bandit. Unfortunately, there is no way of redoing it.\u201d\u201c4th January. Why are my children so stupid? I\u2019ve repeated myself so many times. Do not be fooled by those charlatans! The key thing about potions is not about grasping them, but digesting them! It\u2019s nothing about tapping powers, but acting! And the name of a potion is not solely symbolic at its core, but a concrete imagery, and the \u2018key\u2019 to digestion!\u201d\u201c9th September. An alliance opposing me has been established. Feysac from the north, Loen from the east, Feynapotter from the south. My enemies have finally joined forces, but I have no fear. I will use facts to teach them that the generations of weapons and knowledge cannot be compensated by mere numbers and low-grade Sequencers. Besides, it\u2019s not as though I do not have subordinates. As for the higher-grades, heh heh. Have they forgotten who I am?\u201d\u201c23rd September. I have lost communications with the ship seeking the Forsaken Land of the Gods. I should consider inventing wireless telegraphs. I hope it would not be affected by the storm.\u201d\u201c24th September. Miss Ithaca is more mesmerizing than Lady Florena. Perhaps, I\u2019m just being nostalgic about my youth.\u201dDue to the complexity of characters in Simplified Chinese, the font was slightly larger than normal, leading to less content on each page. Furthermore, for preservational and research purposes, the back of each page was left empty. But even so, Klein still felt an upheaval of emotions when he read the diary. In particular, Emperor Roselle\u2019s description of the crux of potions made him feel like he found the path to the solution. He was thrilled at having learned a priceless secret.Perhaps, this will be a beacon for my future path as a Beyonder! Well, the three pages belong to entries at different times. It seems Emperor Roselle only writes the year on the first entry of each year. It cannot be determined which year the two pages with September and November belong to\u2026 Who is the pathetic fellow he discovered?What do \u201cdigesting\u201d and \u201cacting\u201d actually mean?Where is the Forsaken Land of the Gods? \u2026These questions bubbled in Klein\u2019s head. It made him eager to immediately gather all of Emperor Roselle\u2019s diary and read it from cover to cover!\u201cKlein?\u201d At that moment, Old Neil asked puzzledly across him.Klein jolted awake as he hurriedly covered it up with a laugh. \u201cI thought I would be the most special one. I was trying to decipher and interpret it.\u201d\u201cYou are young indeed.\u201d Old Neil nodded, laughing. \u201cI once believed that I was the most special one as well.\u201dKlein flipped through the three pages in his hand and after confirming that he had not missed anything, he handed it over to Old Neil and thoughtlessly asked, \u201cDo we only have these few pages?\u201dI want to see more of Emperor Roselle\u2019s diary! \u201cDid you think there would be many?\u201d Old Neil caressed the scripts as his wrinkles deepened from his scoff. \u201cThere are not many incidents a year that involve Beyonders and mystery to begin with. Sigh, the major reason is the gradual extinction of extraordinary species in our Northern Continent. Without them, there won\u2019t be a lot of potions, causing the number of Beyonders to reduce with time. Sigh, over the past few centuries, dragons, giants, and elves have become simply records in books. Even the seafolks are no longer seen near the coastal waters.\u201dUpon hearing this, Klein suddenly thought of a meme. He immediately said with a smile, \u201cI think it\u2019s time to establish a Dragons and Giants Protection Association.\u201dOld Neil looked confused when he heard that. It took him quite some time to figure out what it meant. After figuring out its meaning, he rapped the table and laughed quite heartily in a not-so-gentlemanly manner.\u201cHaha, Klein, you really are humorous. This is a tradition of our Loen Kingdom. It\u2019s good that young people have a sense of humor. I believe we shouldn\u2019t be overly narrow in scope. Why are we only protecting dragons and giants? It should be called Fantastic Beasts Protection Association.\u201d\u201cNo, no, no. How can we forget those poor plants?\u201d Klein shook his head.They exchanged looks and proclaimed in unison: \u201cFantastic Organisms Protection Association!\u201dBoth of them laughed tacitly. The awkwardness and unfamiliarity of the atmosphere between them dissipated considerably.\u201cThere are fewer interesting young people like you these days\u2026 Where was I?\u201d Old Neil\u2019s wrinkles suffused a smile as he said, \u201cI remember. There are not many incidents a year that involve Beyonders and mystery to begin with. The retards who revere Emperor Roselle are the minority of the minority. It\u2019s already pretty good that we can obtain three scripts\u2026 Well, the other larger cathedrals or dioceses might have some\u2026\u201dAfter muttering a few words, he took the approval note which Klein had placed on the table earlier and took a look.\u201cAre they pistol bullets, rifle bullets, or steam-pressured bullets?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a revolver,\u201d answered Klein honestly.\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll go get them. Ahem, do you have an armpit holster? As a gentleman, we can\u2019t let you have something bulging below your waist in public.\u201d Old Neil made a joke that all men understood.\u201cHeh, no. Do I need to get Captain to include it?\u201d Klein smiled cooperatively.Old Neil stood up and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need. I just need to make a record. It\u2019s an accessory item. Repeat after me: accessory item.\u201d\u201cWere you a teacher in the past?\u201d joked Klein.\u201cI spent some time at the Church\u2019s Sunday school and free schools.\u201d Old Neil waved the note and took out a key from the drawer. He then opened the iron door that led into an inner chamber.Beyonders do not seem much different from commoners\u2026 Klein murmured silently before casting his gaze on the table where the three pages of the diary were.Emperor Roselle is indeed involved in the realm of mystery\u2026His diary is invaluable\u2026 To others, they are just pieces of scrap paper. It is unknown when they will be deciphered, but they are a valuable treasure to me! I wonder where the remaining parts of the diary are\u2026I have to think of ways to get more\u2026 Klein\u2019s mind went through upheavals as he could hardly calm down. This continued until Old Neil came out and closed the iron door.\u201cTen demon hunting bullets, thirty revolver bullets. An ox-hide armpit holster, and a Seventh Unit, Special Operations Department badge. Please count them and give them a try. Remember to sign the log book.\u201d Old Neil placed the items down on the table.The revolver bullets were arranged neatly in a paper box which was divided into three layers. The bullets shimmered with a yellow sheen just like the bullets back home, but they appeared narrower.As for the demon hunting bullets, they were kept in a small iron box. The shape was identical to regular revolver bullets, but their surface was silver in color. Upon a more careful examination, there were complicated and dazzling patterns with tiny Sacred Emblems\u2014a black background dotted with stars and a half crimson moon\u2014engraved at the bottom.The ox-hide holster felt solid and it came with a belt and buckle. Beside it was a badge half the size of a palm. It had a metallic background with \u201cAwwa County Police Department and Seventh Unit, Special Operations Department\u201d inscribed in silver text. They formed almost two sealed circles and surrounded the \u201ctwo crossed swords and a crown\u201d police emblem.\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s not a Nighthawks badge,\u201d Klein said half wistfully and half probingly.Old Neil smiled and urged Klein to test the armpit holster.After he took off his jacket, Klein took quite a bit of effort to buckle up the holster, which hung close to his left armpit.\u201cNot bad.\u201d He put on his jacket again.Old Neil sized him up and nodded in satisfaction.\u201cIt suits you well. My judgment is as accurate as usual.\u201dAfter putting away the other items into his pockets and signing the log book, Klein had a short, casual conversation with Old Neil before leaving.Halfway, he suddenly he slapped himself in the forehead.\u201cI forgot to learn more about the Sequences and potions. It\u2019s all the fault of Emperor Roselle\u2019s diary\u2026\u201dAt this point, he was still unaware of what the first Sequence of the complete pathway the Church of the Evernight Goddess possessed. All he knew was that it started with Sequence 9.Rozanne had apparently mentioned something\u2026 The Sleepless? Just as Klein was slowly walking towards the stairs, a person came down.He wore tight trousers which made movement easy. His white shirt was not tucked in, and he had a clear romantic temperament of a poet. He was none other than the black-haired, green-eyed police inspector who had previously came to search Klein\u2019s place. They had met upstairs previously, but they had not exchanged words.\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d greeted the young poet-like Nighthawk with a smile.\u201cGood afternoon. I believe I do not need to introduce myself?\u201d answered Klein humorously.\u201cThere\u2019s no need. I have a deep impression of you.\u201d The young Nighthawk extended his right hand and said, \u201cLeonard Mitchell. Sequence 8\u2019s Midnight Poet.\u201dSequence 8\u2026 He\u2019s really a poet\u2026 Klein smilingly shook his hand as he returned with a question, \u201cYou have a deep impression of me?\u201dLeonard Mitchell\u2019s green eyes were deep as he replied with a very faint smile. \u201cYou have a special disposition.\u201dHe feels and sounds so gay\u2026 The corners of Klein\u2019s mouth moved slightly as he barely said with a smile, \u201cI don\u2019t think so myself.\u201d\u201cAfter encountering an accident like that, you remained alive despite not receiving our protection immediately. That makes you special enough.\u201d Leonard pointed ahead. \u201cI have to replace Captain. See you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d Klein turned to make way for the Nighthawk.As he walked to the ends of the stairwell, Leonard Mitchell suddenly turned around and stared at the stone-paved ground which was illuminated by the yellow sunset. He muttered into the air softly, \u201cDid you manage to notice anything\u2026\u201d\u2026\u201cIndeed, there\u2019s nothing special about him\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He wants you to settle your household affairs first.\u201d\u201c\u2026Alright.\u201d Klein never expected the Nighthawks\u2019 management to be so humane and accommodating. It made him feel a little grateful.He was planning on waking early the next morning and make use of the opportunity to \u201cwander around\u201d to visit Tingen University. He planned on informing the staff in charge of the interview that he was not participating in the follow-up interviews. After all, he had originally obtained the opportunity to make the interview because of his professor\u2019s recommendation letter. Regardless, it was basic courtesy to have formal closure. Even if it was not for himself, he had to respect his mentor\u2019s efforts.And in a world without telephones, where telegrams were charged by the character, and the fact that it would be too late to send a letter, he felt that taking the public carriage to the university was the most economical and suitable solution.Having received the Captain\u2019s special approval, Klein did not need to tire himself out. He could wake up late and still make his way there on time.Klein was just about to take off his hat to bid Rozanne farewell when he suddenly thought of something. He looked around and suppressed his voice. \u201cRozanne, do you know what the starting point of the Church\u2019s complete Sequence is?\u201dHe had forgotten to ask Old Neil.Rozanne\u2019s eyes widened as she looked at Klein in astonishment. \u201cYou wish to become a Beyonder?\u201dWas I that obvious? Klein\u2019s body language betrayed him as he answered in embarrassment, \u201cHaving learned that extraordinary and mysterious powers exist in the world, it\u2019s inevitable that I have some yearnings for it.\u201d\u201cOh my Goddess. Do you know how dangerous it is? Didn\u2019t Captain tell you? The enemies of Beyonders are not just cultists or dark warlocks, but themselves! People lose control nearly every year. Some even end up sacrificing themselves! Aren\u2019t you going to consider how your family will feel?\u201d Rozanne\u2019s hand gestures amplified her tone as her reaction appeared overly agitated. \u201cKlein, I think the better choice is to be a civilian staff. There\u2019s nearly no danger, and our salary increases every year. After a few years of work, you will have saved up much money, allowing you to rent a bungalow in the North Borough or in the suburbs. You can then marry a rich and charming lady and have a wonderful family, having adorable and naughty little angels\u2026\u201d\u201cRozanne, stop! Hold up!\u201d Klein hurriedly stopped her in exasperation when he realized that she was changing the subject. \u201cI just want to\u2026 to, well, understand the basics for now.\u201d\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Rozanne fell silent for a few seconds as she lowered her gaze, feeling somewhat sorry. \u201cDue to what happened to my father, whenever I face similar problems, I tend to be\u2026 well, you know, a little agitated. However, to be honest, I\u2019m filled with respect towards any man or woman who willingly wishes to be a Nighthawk.\u201d\u201cI understand, I understand,\u201d echoed Klein.Rozanne blinked her light brown eyes and added, \u201cMy father once said that one should never think that they can resolve hidden risks or combat danger by simply becoming more powerful or a higher Sequencer. In fact, it\u2019s the opposite. They will encounter more terrifying matters. When facing the unknown or a terrifying existence, death and insanity are the only two outcomes. Heh, he ended up sacrificing himself two weeks after saying that\u2026 Klein, don\u2019t look at me with pity. My life is great now, really great! It\u2019s only right to feel fear towards these matters!\u201d\u201cI only want to know the basics\u2026\u201d Klein repeated his previous reply, not sure whether he should laugh or cry.Captain explained it more clearly than you. And even if I do not become a Beyonder, I have already encountered something extraordinary\u2026 \u201cAlright,\u201d said Rozanne ruminatively. \u201cI\u2019ve heard Captain\u2019s and Old Neil\u2019s conversation before. As extraordinary creatures are declining or going extinct, few high Sequencers exist in this era. It\u2019s already very impressive to become a Beyonder! Combining our Tingen City and the suburbs, there are hundreds of thousands of people or maybe even more. Yet, there are only about thirty plus Beyonders. Well, it\u2019s just my guess\u2026 I\u2019m not counting the cultists and dark warlocks who hide in the dark\u2026\u201dWithout waiting for Klein\u2019s reply, she seemed to regain her vibrancy as she clenched her fist and brought it to her chest.\u201cAnd among these thirty plus Beyonders, most of them are at Sequence 9! Uh, it seems I have gone off topic\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. That was something I wanted to know as well.\u201d Klein wished that Rozanne could be like her usual self, revealing more information as she rambled on.\u201cAnyways, it\u2019s already very, very impressive to become a Beyonder!\u201d Rozanne repeated herself. \u201cThe starting Sequence of our Church\u2019s complete Sequence is Sleepless: Sequence 9, Sleepless!\u201dIndeed\u2026 Klein nodded as he watched Rozanne finding hard to stop herself from describing in detail.\u201cYou should be able to guess from the name. A Sleepless is someone who does not need to sleep at night. Three to four hours of rest in the day would be sufficient. Man, I\u2019m so envious\u2026 No, not at all! Sleep is a gift bestowed upon us by the Goddess. It\u2019s the truest bliss!\u201cWhere was I? Ah, right. A Sleepless can see through the darkness even without any lights. The deeper into the night, the more powerful they become. I mean more powerful in the aspects of their physical strength, their intuition, and their mental capabilities. However, although they can detect unknown dangers that lurk in the dark, they will still rely on demon hunting bullets and other items to handle monsters they are unable to deal with via normal means. My father was once a Sleepless.\u201dWithout waiting for Klein to press on, Rozanne continued, \u201cAfter that, it\u2019s Sequence 8\u2019s Midnight Poet, and one level higher is Sequence 7\u2019s Nightmare.\u201dNightmare? Klein instantly recalled that Dunn Smith had guided his dreams. He asked as a confirmation, \u201cCaptain?\u201d\u201cYou know about it?\u201d Rozanne\u2019s mouth nearly turned into an \u201cO\u201d shape.\u201cCaptain once entered my dream\u2026\u201d Klein glanced around as he lowered his voice once more.\u201cGot it\u2026\u201d Rozanne was enlightened as she answered with a whisper.She picked up a coffee cup beside her and took a sip before saying wistfully, \u201cThere are only two Sequence 7 Beyonders in our Tingen City\u2019s Church. It\u2019s likely that Captain is one of them. Even if he goes to a large diocese like Backlund, he is still an impressive figure. Some deacons might not even be stronger than he is!\u201d\u201cSo Captain is that impressive.\u201d Klein echoed with a smiled.Frankly, Dunn Smith\u2019s appearance last night had left a deep impression on him. He had basically believed that Dunn was an extremely powerful Beyonder.\u201cOf course!\u201d Rozanne proudly straightened her back.In moments, the scatterbrained her said with a vexed expression, \u201cAs for what\u2019s above Sequence 7, I have no idea. Among all the Nighthawks, perhaps only Captain will know.\u201d\u201cThen what about other starting Sequences? The ones that aren\u2019t complete?\u201d Klein was satisfied as he changed the subject.It had to be said that Rozanne\u2019s description of Sleepless did match his imaginations and expectations of Beyonders. However, it was not the kind he wished to become. The perfect Sequence 9 was likely one that could study and grasp more knowledge of the mystery. By doing so, he could leverage on them to figure out the reason for his transmigration and lay the foundations of his future transmigration back.Rozanne thought for a moment before saying with a sigh, \u201cI\u2019m not that interested in this aspect. I only know we have more than other churches. After all, the Goddess is the Mother of the Secrets\u2026 Well, there should be two or three. Some of our teammates are cold and distant, making me fear them. They also have a strange smell to them. Some members\u2026 Well, I mean you should talk to Old Neil. He knows a lot, as well as quite a number of interesting magical rituals. Let me think. He once mentioned his Sequence 9 title, which is also the name of the potion formula\u2026 Ah, yes, it\u2019s called Mystery Pryer.\u201dQuite a number of interesting magical rituals? Mystery Pryer sounds very close to what I want\u2026 Klein was slightly delighted.\u201cIn addition, I also know of the name of a Sequence 7, the kind that\u2019s incomplete!\u201d Rozanne said with a flaunting tone. She had just thought of it while recollecting.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Klein was abnormally curious.In a world where high Sequencers were scarce to the point of them possibly not existing, Sequence 7 was probably considered quite a potent force in the Church.Rozanne revealed a sweet smile as she replied smugly, \u201cSpirit Medium!\u201d\u201cMdm. Daly?\u201d asked Klein subconsciously.After his initial surprise, he realized that it was nothing unexpected. Only a Sequence 7 Beyonder could achieve such an impressive performance as a medium!Rozanne\u2019s eyes widened once again as she said in disbelief, \u201cH-how do you know of that too?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve met Mdm. Daly.\u201d Klein did not hide the matter.\u201cAlright,\u201d said Rozanne with an envious tone. \u201cIf I can become a Spirit Medium, one just like Mdm. Daly, then I\u2019ll be willing to be a Beyonder. No, I\u2019ll consider it carefully for ten minutes\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, Mdm. Daly fulfills all my imaginations as a Beyonder,\u201d echoed Klein in a slightly exaggerated manner.Having fulfilled his goals, he chatted idly with Rozanne for a few minutes until he realized he was not getting any new information. He took of his hat and bowed before leaving.As he walked down the stairs, Klein suddenly stopped after taking a few steps. He reached out to pad the notes in his inner pocket.Immediately following that, he took out twelve gold pound notes and clenched then tightly in his left palm. Then, he reached his hand into his pocket and refused to release or pull them out again. Without realizing it, a smile appeared on his face.According to the customs of the Foodaholic Empire\u2014China\u2014a treat had to be given after earning money!It\u2019s time to give Melissa a treat tonight!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 - Side ArmPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 23: Side ArmTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosAs Klein walked down Zouteland and while taking in the warm, humid breeze, he suddenly realized something.He only had three pence of change. If he returned to Iron Cross Street via public carriage, it would cost him four pence. If he were to hand over a one-gold pound note, it would be akin to using a hundred-dollar bull to buy a bottle of cheap mineral water back on Earth. There was nothing wrong with that, but it was just quite awkward to do so.Should I use three pence to travel three kilometers and walk the rest of the journey? Klein reached into his pocket with one hand as he slowed down his pace, considering other solutions.That won\u2019t do! Soon, he rejected the idea.It would take him a while to walk the remaining journey. Considering how he was carrying twelve pounds\u2014a massive fortune\u2014it was not safe!Furthermore, he had deliberately not brought the revolver with him, afraid that the Nighthawks would confiscate it. If he were to encounter the danger that instigated Welch\u2019s death, there was no way he could fight back!Get some change from a nearby bank? No, no way! There\u2019s a 0.5% processing fee. That\u2019s way too extravagant! Klein shook his head silently. Just the thought of the fees involved pained his heart!Having ruled out one solution after another, Klein\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up when he saw a clothing shop in front of him!That\u2019s right! Wouldn\u2019t the normal course of action be to buy something appropriately priced to get some change? A formal suit, shirt, vest, trousers, leather boots, and a cane were all within budget. They had to be bought sooner or later!Oh, it\u2019s very troublesome when fitting clothes. Besides, Benson knows more about this than me and he\u2019s better at bargaining. I should consider it only after he\u2019s back\u2026 Then should I buy a cane? That\u2019s right! As the saying goes, a cane is a gentleman\u2019s best choice of defense. It is half as good as a crowbar. A gun in one hand and a cane in the other is the combat style of a civilized person! After debating internally, Klein made up his mind. He turned around and entered the clothing shop, Wilker Clothing and Hats.The clothing store\u2019s layout resembled the clothing stores on Earth. The left wall was filled with rows of formal attires. The middle rows were decked with things like shirts, trousers, vests, and bowties. On the right were leather shoes and boots placed inside glass cabinets.\u201cSir, may I help you?\u201d A male salesperson dressed in a white shirt and red vest came over and asked politely.In Loen Kingdom, rich and powerful gentlemen of high standing enjoyed wearing black suits comprising of white shirts matched with black vests and trousers. Their colors were relatively monotonous, so they required their male servants, salespeople, and service attendants to dress more brightly and colorfully, in order to distinguish themselves from their masters.In contrast, ladies and mistresses wore dresses of all kinds in glamorous fashions. As such, maidservants would wear black and white.Klein thought for a moment before answering the male salesperson\u2019s question. \u201cA cane. Something that\u2019s heavier and harder.\u201dThe kind that can crack the skulls of others! The red-vested salesperson sized up Klein furtively before leading him into the store. He then pointed at a row of canes in the corner. \u201cThat cane inlaid with gold is made of Ironheart wood. It\u2019s both very heavy and hard, and costs eleven soli seven pence. Do you want to give it a try?\u201dEleven soli seven pence? Why don\u2019t you go rob a bank! Big deal with the gold inlay! Klein was shocked by the price.With an unperturbed expression, he nodded gently. \u201cAlright.\u201dThe salesperson took down the Ironheart wood cane and carefully handed it to Klein, seemingly afraid that Klein would drop and break the merchandise.Klein took the cane and found it heavy. He tried moving with it and discovered that he could not sway it smoothly as he wanted.\u201cIt\u2019s too heavy.\u201d Klein shook his head in relief.This is not an excuse! The salesperson took back the cane and pointed at another three canes.\u201cThis is made of walnut wood, created by Tingen\u2019s most famous cane artisan, Mr. Hayes. It\u2019s priced at ten soli three pence\u2026 This is made of ebony wood and inlaid with silver. It\u2019s an hard as iron, costing seven soli six pence\u2026 This is made from the core of a white boli tree and also inlaid with silver, costing seven soli ten pence\u2026\u201dKlein tried each one of them and found them of appropriate weight. He then tapped them with his fingers to gain an understand of their hardness. Finally, he chose the cheapest one.\u201cI\u2019ll take the one made from ebony wood.\u201d Klein pointed at the cane with the silver inlay which the salesperson was holding.\u201cNo problem, Sir. Please follow me to proceed with the payment. In the future, if this cane is scuffed or stained, you can hand it to us for handling for free.\u201d The salesperson led Klein to the counter.Klein took the opportunity to release the four gold-pound notes from his tight grip and removed two of the smaller denominations.\u201cGood day, Sir. It will be seven soli six pence.\u201d The cashier behind the counter greeted with a smile.Klein was planning on maintaining his gentlemanly image, but when he extended his hand with the one-gold pound note, he could not help but ask, \u201cCan I get a discount?\u201d\u201cSir, what we have is all hand-crafted, so our costs are very high.\u201d the salesperson beside him answered. \u201cSince our boss isn\u2019t here, we are unable to lower the prices.\u201dThe cashier behind the counter added, \u201cSir, sorry about that.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein handed the note over and received the black silver-inlaid cane.While waiting for the change to be given to him, he took a few steps back and distanced himself from them. He swung around his side arm as a test.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!The wind sounded heavy when the cane sliced through the air. Klein nodded in satisfaction.He looked forward again, prepared to see notes and coins, but was appalled to see the red-vested salesperson retreating far away. The cashier behind the counter had retracted into a corner, leaning close to a double-barreled shotgun hanging to the wall.The Loen Kingdom had a semi-regulated policy on firearms. To possess a firearm, one needed to apply for an all-purpose weapon usage certificate or a hunter\u2019s license. Regardless of which type, one could still not be in possession of restricted military firearms such as repeaters, steam-pressured guns, or six-barrel machine guns.An all-purpose weapon usage certificate could be used to purchase or store any kind of civilian firearm, but earning the certificate was extremely troublesome. Even merchants of substantial standing might not be approved. A hunter\u2019s license was relatively easy. Even farmers in the suburbs could receive approval. However, the license was limited to hunting guns with restricted numbers. People with sizable assets would tend to apply for one to use it for self-defense in emergency situations, such as now\u2026Klein looked at the two wary salespeople as the corners of his mouth twitched. He chuckled dryly. \u201cNot bad. This cane is perfect for swinging. I\u2019m very pleased.\u201dRealizing that he had no intention to assault them, the cashier behind the counter relaxed. He handed over the notes and coins he had taken out over with both hands.Klein took a look at what he received and saw two five-soli notes, two one-soli notes, a five-pence coin, and a one-penny coin. He could not help but nod inwardly.After a two-second pause, he ignored the way the salespeople looked at him and unfurled the four notes towards the light to ensure that the anti-counterfeit watermarks were present.Klein put away the notes and coins when he was done. With the cane in hand, he tipped his hat and walked out of Wilker Clothing and Hats. He extravagantly spent six pence by taking a short-distance trackless carriage before transferring once before reaching home safe and sound.After closing the door, he counted the eleven pounds and twelve soli notes thrice before placing them into the desk drawer. He then found the bronze revolver with the wooden grip.Clink! Clang! Five brass bullets fell onto the table when Klein inserted the silver demon hunting bullets which had complicated patterns and the Dark Sacred Emblem into the revolver\u2019s cylinder.Like before, he only inserted five rounds and left an empty spot to prevent any misfires. The remaining rounds were placed together with the five ordinary bullets in a small iron case.Pa! He snapped the cylinder in place, giving him a sense of security.He excitedly lodged the revolver into the holster at his armpit and buckled it securely. Then, he repeatedly practiced unbuckling and drawing the gun. He rested whenever his arms ached, and this continued until sunset when he heard the sounds of tenants walking along the corridor outside.Phew! Klein let out a foul breath before putting his revolver back into his armpit holster.Only then did he take off his formal suit and vest. He wore back his usual brownish-yellow coat and swung his arms to relax them.Tap. Tap. Tap. He heard the sound of nearing footsteps before the twisting sound of an inserted key.Melissa with her soft, black hair entered. Her nose twitched a little as she swept her gaze towards the unlit stove. The luster in her eyes dimmed slightly.\u201cKlein, I\u2019ll heat up the leftovers from last night. Benson will likely be home tomorrow.\u201d Melissa turned to look at her brother.Klein had his hands in his pocket as he leaned against the edge of the desk. He smiled and said, \u201cNo, let\u2019s eat out.\u201d\u201cEat out?\u201d Melissa questioned in surprise.\u201cHow does Silver Crown Restaurant at Daffodil Street sound? I heard they serve delicious food,\u201d suggested Klein.\u201cB-but\u2026\u201d Melissa was still confused.Klein grinned and said, \u201cTo celebrate my new job.\u201d\u201cYou found a job?\u201d Melissa\u2019s voice rose unknowingly, \u201cB-but, isn\u2019t the Tingen University interview tomorrow?\u201d\u201cAnother job.\u201d Klein gave a faint smile before fishing the stacked notes from the drawer. \u201cThey even gave me an advance of four weeks\u2019 pay.\u201dMelissa looked at the gold pounds and soli as she widened her eyes.\u201cGoddess\u2026 You- they- what job did you get?\u201dThis\u2026 Klein\u2019s expression froze as he deliberated on his words.\u201cA security company whose mission is to seek, collect, and protect ancient relics. They were in need of a professional consultant. It\u2019s a five-year contract, earning me three pounds a week.\u201d\u201cWere you vexing over this last night?\u201d asked Melissa after a moment of silence.Klein nodded. \u201cYes, although being an academic at Tingen University is respectable, I prefer this job.\u201d\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t bad either.\u201d Melissa gave an encouraging smile. She asked half-suspiciously and half-curiously, \u201cWhy would they give you an advance payment of four full weeks?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because we need to move. We need a place with more rooms and a bathroom that belongs to us,\u201d said Klein while grinning and shrugging.He felt that his smile was impeccable, just short of the word: \u201cSurprised?\u201dMelissa was stunned momentarily before she suddenly spoke out in a fluster, \u201cKlein, we are living quite well now. My occasional grumblings of not having a personal bathroom is just a habit. Do you remember Jenny? She lived next door to us, but ever since her father was injured and lost his job, they had no choice but to move to Lower Street. The family of five ended up staying in one room, with three of them sleeping in a bunk bed and two of them sleeping on the ground. They even wish to rent the remaining empty spot to someone\u2026\u201cCompared to them, we are really very lucky. Don\u2019t waste your salary on this matter. Besides, I love Mrs. Smyrin\u2019s bakery.\u201dSis, why is your reaction completely different from how it played out in my head\u2026 Klein\u2019s expression went blank when he heard his sister.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was momentarily at a loss for words; none of the lines he prepared could be used.He coughed lightly twice as he quickly racked his brains.\u201cMelissa, this isn\u2019t a waste of salary. In the future, my colleagues, as well as Benson\u2019s colleagues might visit. Are we going to host them in such a place? When Benson and I get married and have wives, are we still going to sleep in bunk beds?\u201d\u201cNone of you have fianc\u00e9es yet, right? We can wait a little while and save up more money in the meantime,\u201d answered Melissa in a logically concise manner.\u201cNo, Melissa. This is a societal rule.\u201d Klein was stumped and could only count on lofty principles. \u201cSince I\u2019m earning three pounds a week, I should look like I\u2019m earning three pounds a week.\u201dTo be honest, having rented an apartment before with others, Zhou Mingrui was no stranger to his present living conditions as Klein. He was very used to it, but it was because of his past experience that he knew how inconvenient such an environment was for a girl. Furthermore, his goal was to become a Beyonder and study mysticism to find his way home. In the future, he was bound to conduct some magical rituals at home. Having too many people in the apartment building made incidents prone to happen.Klein saw that Melissa was about to continue arguing, and hurriedly added, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not planning to get a bungalow, but probably a terrace. Basically, it has to have a bathroom we can call ours. Also, I like Mrs. Smyrin\u2019s bread, Tingen biscuits, and lemon cakes too. We can first consider places near Iron Cross Street and Daffodil Street.\u201dMelissa pouted her lips slightly and fell silent for a moment before nodding slowly.\u201cBesides, I\u2019m in no rush to move either. We have to wait for Benson to return,\u201d said Klein with a chuckle. \u201cWe can\u2019t have him be shocked when he opens the door to find nothing, right? Imagine him saying in astonishment\u2014\u2019Where are my things? Where are my siblings? Where\u2019s my home? Is this my home? Did I make a mistake? Goddess, wake me up if this is a dream. Why is my home gone after a few days of absence!?'\u201dHis mimicking of Benson\u2019s tone made Melissa involuntarily smile as her eyes scrunched up and revealed her shallow dimples.\u201cNo, Mr. Franky would definitely be waiting by the door to get Benson to hand over the apartment keys. Benson wouldn\u2019t even be able to come up.\u201d The girl disparaged the miserly landlord.In the Moretti household, all of them would like to make Mr. Franky the butt of their jokes for every trivial and major matter. It was all thanks to Benson who initiated this practice.\u201cRight, there\u2019s no way he would switch locks for the tenants after us,\u201d Klein echoed with a smile. He pointed at the door and quipped, \u201cMiss Melissa, shall we head to Silver Crown Restaurant for a celebration?\u201dMelissa sighed gently and said, \u201cKlein, do you know Selena? My classmate and my good friend?\u201dSelena? An image of a girl with wine-red hair and deep brown eyes surfaced in Klein\u2019s mind. Her parents were Evernight Goddess believers. They had named her after St. Selena as a blessing. She was not yet sixteen, and was half a year younger than Melissa. She was a happy, cheerful, and outgoing lady.\u201cYes.\u201d Klein nodded in affirmation.\u201cHer elder brother, Chris, is a lawyer. He currently earns close to three pounds a week as well. His fianc\u00e9e works part time as a typist,\u201d described Melissa. \u201cThey have been engaged for more than four years. To ensure a decent and stable life after marriage, they are still saving money to this very day. They have yet to go down the wedding aisle and plan to wait for at least another year. According to Selena, there are many people like her brother. They typically get married after twenty-eight. You have to be make advanced preparations and save up. Don\u2019t squander your money.\u201dIt\u2019s just a meal at a restaurant. Is there a need to preach at me\u2026 Klein was rendered at a loss whether to laugh or cry. After a few seconds of thought, he said, \u201cMelissa, I\u2019m already earning three pounds a week, and I\u2019ll have increments every year. There\u2019s no need for you to worry.\u201d\u201cBut we need to save some money in the case of any unexpected emergencies. For example, what if that security company suddenly closes down? I have a classmate whose father\u2019s company went bankrupt. He had to find temporary work at the pier and their living conditions turned terrible instantly. She had no choice but to quit school,\u201d advised Melissa with a serious expression.\u2026 Klein extended his hand to cover his face. \u201cT-that security company and the government\u2026 Yes, has some connections with the government. It will not easily close down.\u201d\u201cBut even the government isn\u2019t stable. After every election, if the party in power changes, many people will have their positions stripped off. It turns into a mess.\u201d Melissa retorted in an unyielding manner.\u2026Sis, you sure know a lot\u2026 Klein found the humor in his exasperation as he shook his head. \u201cAlright then\u2026\u201cThen I\u2019ll boil some soup with the leftovers from yesterday. Buy some pan-fried fish, a slab of black-pepper beef, a small bottle of butter, and a cup of malt beer for me. Anyway, there should still be some celebration.\u201dThey were commonly sold items by hawkers on Iron Cross Street. A piece of pan-fried fish was six to eight pence; a not-so-big piece of black-peppered beef was five pence; a cup of malt beer was a penny; and a bottle of butter weighing about a quarter pound was four pence, but buying a pound of butter would only cost one soli three pence.The original Klein was responsible for buying ingredients during holidays, so he was no stranger to the prices. Klein did a mental estimate that Melissa would need about one soli six pence. Therefore, he took out two one-soli notes.\u201cAlright.\u201d Melissa did not object to Klein\u2019s proposal. She put down her backpack of stationery and took the notes.When he saw his sister taking out a tiny bottle for the butter and pots for the other food before briskly walking to the door, Klein thought for a moment and shouted out to her. \u201cMelissa, use the remaining money to buy some fruits.\u201dThere were many hawkers on Iron Cross Street who would buy low-quality or expiring fruits from other places. The residents were not outraged about this because the prices were extremely cheap. They could taste the magnificent flavors after removing the rotten parts, so it was a cheap enjoyment.With that said, Klein took a few brisk steps forward and took out the remaining copper pennies from his pocket and stuffed it into his sister\u2019s palm.\u201cAh?\u201d Melissa\u2019s brown eyes looked at her brother in puzzlement.Klein took two steps back and smiled. \u201cRemember to go to Mrs. Smyrin\u2019s. Reward yourself with a tiny lemon cake.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Melissa\u2019s mouth widened as she blinked. Finally, she said a single word, \u201cOkay.\u201dShe quickly turned around, opened the door, and ran toward the stairwell.\u2026A river tore through the land, with cedar and maple trees lining the banks; the air so fresh, it was intoxicating.Klein, who was here to put closure to his interview, had his revolver with him. He held his cane and paid six pence for the public carriage. He walked down a cemented path and approached a three-story stone building which was shaded by greenery. It was Tingen University\u2019s administrative block.\u201cIt\u2019s truly worthy of being one of the two major universities of the Loen Kingdom\u2026\u201d With this being his first time here, Klein sighed as he walked.Compared to Tingen University, Khoy University right across the river could only be described as shabby.\u201cHeave-ho!\u201d\u201cHeave-ho!\u201dVoices approached slowly as two rowing boats made their way upstream across the Khoy River. Oars were being rowed in an orderly and rhythmic manner.This was a rowing sport that was popular among all the universities in Loen Kingdom. With Klein requiring a scholarship to finance his university studies, he, Welch, and the others had joined Khoy University\u2019s rowing club and were pretty good at it.\u201cThis is youth\u2026\u201d Klein stopped and looked into the distance before sighing wistfully.Such sights would no longer be seen in another week since school would break for summer.As he proceeded down a road sheltered by trees, Klein stopped by a three-story stone building. He entered after successfully registering himself and easily found his way to the office of the person who had tended to him the other time.Knock! Knock! Knock! He knocked lightly on the half-closed door.\u201cCome in.\u201d A man\u2019s voice sounded from inside.A middle-aged instructor dressed in a white shirt and black tuxedo frowned when he saw Klein enter. \u201cThere\u2019s another hour until the interview.\u201d\u201cMr. Stone, do you still remember me? I\u2019m a student of Senior Associate Professor Cohen, Klein Moretti. You have read my recommendation letter before.\u201d Klein smiled as he took off his hat.Harvin Stone stroked his black beard and asked, puzzled, \u201cIs there something wrong? I\u2019m not in charge of interviews.\u201d\u201cHere\u2019s the situation. I\u2019ve already found a job, so I won\u2019t be participating in the interview today.\u201d Klein gave his reason for coming.\u201cI see\u2026\u201d When Harvin Stone learned of the reason, he stood up and reached out his right hand. \u201cCongratulations. You are really a polite lad. I will inform the professor and senior associate professors.\u201dKlein shook Harvin\u2019s hand and planned on making a little small talk before bidding him farewell when he heard a familiar voice behind him.\u201cMoretti, you found another job?\u201dKlein turned around and saw an elder with a head of silver hair that left a deep impression on his silhouette. His deep, blue eyes sunk deep into his face and he had few wrinkles. The man looked sharp in his black tuxedo.\u201cGood afternoon, Mentor. Mr. Azik,\u201d he hurriedly greeted. \u201cWhy are the two of you here?\u201dThe elder was none other than Senior Associate Professor of Khoy University\u2019s history department, who was also his mentor, Mr. Quentin Cohen. Beside Cohen was a middle-aged man with bronze-colored skin of average build. He did not have any facial hair and held a newspaper in his hand. His hair was black and his pupils brown. His facial features were soft as his eyes revealed an indescribable sense of weariness like it had seen the vicissitudes of life. Beneath his right ear was a black mole which could only be seen if looked at carefully.Khoy University recognized him since he was Khoy University\u2019s history department lecturer, Mr. Azik, who often helped the original Klein. He enjoyed debating with his mentor, Senior Associate Professor Cohen. They often had a clash of opinion, but even so, they were best friends; otherwise, they would not have enjoyed meeting up for a chat.Cohen nodded and said with a relaxed tone, \u201cAzik and I are here to participate in an academic conference. What kind of job did you get?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a security company which seeks, collects, and protects ancient relics. They were in need of a professional consultant and are paying me three pounds a week.\u201d Klein repeated what he said to his sister yesterday. Following that, he explained, \u201cAs you know, I prefer exploring history, instead of summarizing it.\u201dCohen nodded slightly and said, \u201cEveryone has their own choices. I\u2019m very happy that you bothered to come to Tingen University to inform them instead of just not showing up.\u201dAt that moment, Azik interjected, \u201cKlein, do you know what happened to Welch and Naya? I read on the newspapers that they were killed by burglars.\u201dThe incident has become a case of armed burglary? And why it is already on the newspapers? Klein was taken aback as he weighed over his words.\u201cI\u2019m not very clear of the specifics as well. Welch had obtained a diary of the Solomon Empire\u2019s Antigonus family from the Fourth Epoch. My help on interpreting it was sought. I helped them for the first few days, but I later got busy with job hunting. The police even came to me two days ago.\u201dHe deliberately divulged the matter regarding the Solomon Empire and the Antigonus family in hopes of getting any information from the two history teachers.\u201cThe Fourth Epoch\u2026\u201d Cohen muttered with a frown.The bronze-skinned and weary eyes of Azik went blank first before he inhaled. He rubbed his temple with his newspaper-wielding left hand and said, \u201cAntigonus\u2026 rings a bell\u2026 But why can\u2019t I remember\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 - CathedralPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 25: CathedralTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosWhile Azik muttered to himself, he subconsciously shot a glance at Quentin Cohen, seemingly hoping for hints to jolt his memories.Cohen, with his deep set blue eyes, shook his head without any hesitation. \u201cI do not have any impression of it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Alright then. Perhaps, it just shares a root word.\u201d Azik lowered his left hand and gave a self-deprecating laugh.Klein was rather disappointed with the outcome, and he could not help but add on. \u201cMentor, Mr. Azik, as the both of you know, I\u2019m very interested in exploring and restoring the history of the Fourth Epoch. If you ever recall anything or obtain relevant information, could you please write to me?\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d As a result of Klein\u2019s actions today, the silver-haired Senior Associate Professor was rather pleased with him.Azik also nodded and said, \u201cIs your address still the same as before?\u201d\u201cFor now, but I\u2019ll be moving soon. I\u2019ll write a letter to inform you when the time comes,\u201d replied Klein in a respectful manner.Cohen shook his black cane and said, \u201cIt\u2019s indeed about time you moved to a place with a better environment.\u201dAt that moment, Klein caught a glance at the newspaper in Azik\u2019s hand. He deliberated on his words before saying, \u201cMentor, Mr. Azik, what did the newspapers say regarding Welch and Naya? I only learned a little from the police who were in charge of the investigations.\u201dAzik was just about to answer when Cohen suddenly pulled out the pocket watch that was linked to his black tuxedo by a golden chain.Click! He opened the pocket watch and tapped his cane.\u201cThe meeting is about to begin. Azik, we can\u2019t be delayed any further. Give the newspaper to Moretti.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Azik handed over the newspaper he had read to Klein. \u201cWe will be going upstairs. Remember to write a letter. Our address has yet to change; it\u2019s still the Khoy University History Department Office. Haha.\u201dHe laughed as he turned around and left the room with Cohen.Klein took off his hat and bowed. After watching the two gentlemen leave, he bade farewell to owner of the office, Harvin Stone. He proceeded across the corridor and slowly exited the gray three-story building.With his back against the sun, he lifted up his cane and unfolded the newspaper and saw the title: \u201cTingen Morning Post.\u201dTingen sure has all sorts of newspapers and magazines\u2026 There is the Morning Post, Evening Post, the Honest Paper, Backlund Daily Tribune, Tussock Times, family magazines and book reviews\u2026 Klein casually recalled the several names that surfaced in his mind. Of course, a number of them were not local. They were distributed via steam locomotives.Now that the papermaking and printing industries were getting more advanced, the cost of a newspaper has already decreased to the price of a penny. The audience it reached also grew wider and wider.Klein did not scrutinize the details of the newspaper, quickly flipping to the News section with the report \u201cArmed Burglary Murder.\u201d\u201c\u2026According to the police department, the scene at Mr. Welch\u2019s home was a horrible sight. There was missing gold, jewelry, and money, as well as anything valuable that could be easily taken away. Not even a penny was left behind. There is reason to believe that this was done by a merciless group of criminals that would not hesitate to kill the innocent, such as Mister Welch and Madam Naya, if sight of their faces are caught.\u201d\u201cThis is outright contempt for our kingdom\u2019s laws! This is a challenge to public security! No one wishes to have such an encounter! Of course, one piece of good news is that the police have located the murderer and captured the main culprit. We will do our best to provide news on any follow-ups.\u201d\u201cReporter: John Browning.\u201dThe matter has been handled and covered up\u2026 As Klein walked through the boulevard, he nodded in a hardly noticeable manner.He flipped through the newspaper as he strolled down the path, reading the other news articles and serials in the process.Suddenly, he felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand, as though needles were stabbing at him.Someone is watching me? Observing me? Monitoring me? Various thoughts welled up in him as Klein had a faint realization.Back on Earth, he had once felt an invisible gaze before ultimately discovering the source of the gaze. However, it had never felt as crystal clear as what he was experiencing now!This was the same in the original Klein\u2019s memory fragments!Was it the transmigration or the mysterious luck enhancement ritual which enhanced my sixth sense? Klein fought back the urge to seek out the observer. Using his knowledge from reading novels and watching movies, he slowed his pace and put away the newspaper before looking toward Khoy River.Following that, he acted as if he was admiring the scenery, slowly turning his head in different directions. He acted natural as he turned around, taking in everything with his eyes.Other than the trees, grassy plains, and students passing by in the distance, there was no other person there.But Klein was certain that someone was watching him!This\u2026 Klein\u2019s heart raced as his blood surged through his body with the intense thumping.He unfolded the papers and covered half his face, afraid that anyone would discover anything wrong with his expression.Meanwhile, he clenched his cane and readied himself to draw his gun.One step. Two steps. Three steps. Klein proceeded forward slowly.The feeling of being spied upon remained, but there was no sudden outburst of danger.He walked through the boulevard in a somewhat stiff manner and arrived at the waiting point for public carriages when a carriage pulled up coincidentally.\u201cIron\u2026 Zoute\u2026 No, Champagne Street.\u201d Klein continually dismissed his thoughts.He originally planned on heading home immediately, but he was afraid of leading an observer of unknown motives to his apartment. Following that, he thought of heading to Zouteland Street to seek help from the Nighthawks or his colleagues. However, he thought otherwise, afraid that he would end up alerting his enemy and expose the Nighthawks. Therefore, he casually chose somewhere else.\u201cSix pence,\u201d the ticketing officer replied routinely.Klein did not bring any gold pounds with him today. He had hidden the money in the usual spot and had only taken two soli notes with him. And before he came, he had spent the same amount of money, leaving him with one soli six pence. Therefore, he took out all his coins and handed to the ticketing officer.He found a seat after boarding the carriage, and finally with the closing of the carriage doors, Klein felt that unease of being watched vanish!He exhaled slowly as he felt his limbs tingle slightly.What do I do?What should I do next? Klein looked out the carriage as he racked his brains for a solution.Until he was clear about the intentions of the person watching him, Klein had to assume that there was malicious intent!Many thoughts sprang up in his mind, but he dismissed them. He had never experienced such an event, and had to use a few minutes to organize his ideas.He had to notify the Nighthawks; only they could truly get rid of this threat!But I can\u2019t head there directly or I might expose them. Perhaps, that might be their goal\u2026Following this train of thought, Klein crudely surmised various possibilities as his thoughts turned clearer.Ffffffff! He exhaled as he regained some semblance of composure. He looked seriously at the scenery outside flying past him.There were no accidents along the way to Champagne Street, but when Klein opened the door and stepped out of the car, he immediately had the uneasy feeling of being watched again!He acted as though he had not sensed anything. He took the newspaper and his cane, slowly making his way in the direction of Zouteland Street.But he did not enter that street. Instead, he took another route to the Red Moonlight Street behind. There was a beautiful white plaza there, as well as a large cathedral with a pointy roof!Saint Selena Cathedral!The Tingen headquarters of the Church of the Evernight Goddess!As a believer, there was nothing odd about him participating in Mass or pray on his day off.The cathedral exhibited a design similar to Earth\u2019s Gothic style. It also had a tall, black, and imposing clock tower, situated between blue and red checkered windows.Klein stepped into the cathedral and followed an aisle into the prayer hall. Along the way, the stained windows were comprised of red and blue glass patterns that allowed colored light to shine into the hall. The blue was closer to black, the red the same color as the crimson moon. It made the surroundings seem unusually dark and mysterious.The feeling of being watched vanished. Klein acted unfazed as he walked toward the open prayer hall.There were no high windows here. The deep darkness was emphasized, but behind the arc-shaped holy altar, on the wall directly opposite the door, were about twenty circular fist-sized holes that allowed the radiant sunlight to enter the hall.It was akin to pedestrians seeing the starry sky when suddenly looking up into the dark night to see the shimmering stars in all their nobility, purity, and holiness.Even though Klein had always believed that gods could be analyzed and understood, he could not help but lower his head here.The bishop was preaching in a gentle tone as Klein silently made his way down the aisle that split the pews into two columns. He searched for an empty area close to the passageway before slowly taking a seat.Leaning his cane onto the back of the pew in front of him, Klein took off his hat and placed it onto his lap together with the newspaper. Then he clasped his hands together and lowered his head.The entire process was done slowly and routinely as though he was really there to pray.Klein closed his eyes as he silently listened to the bishop\u2019s voice in the darkness.\u201cLacking clothes and food, they have no covering in the cold.\u201cThey are drenched by rains, and huddle around the rocks for lack of shelter.\u201cThey are orphans snatched from the breast, hope lost on them; they are the poor that have been forced off the proper path.\u201cThe Evernight did not forsake them, but bestowed them with\u00a0love <sup>1</sup> .\u201d\u2026Echoes amplified as they entered his ear. Klein saw a swath of darkness in front of him as he felt his spirit and mind cleansed.He calmly took it in until the bishop finished his preachings and ended Mass.After which, the bishop opened a confessional door beside him. Men and women began lining up.Klein opened his eyes and donned his hat once more. With his cane and newspaper, he stood up and found his place in line.It was his turn after more than twenty minutes.He stepped in and closed the door behind him. There was darkness in front of him.\u201cMy child, what do you wish to say?\u201d The bishop\u2019s voice sounded from behind the wooden damper screen.Klein took out the \u2018Seventh Unit, Special Operations Department\u2019 badge from his pocket and handed it over to the bishop through an opening.\u201cSomeone is tailing me. I wish to find Dunn Smith.\u201d As though he had been infected by the silent darkness, his tone turned softer as well.The bishop took the badge and after a few seconds of silence, he said, \u201cTurn right from the confession booth and walk to the end. There will be a secret door to the side. Someone will lead the way after you enter.\u201dAs he spoke, he pulled a rope inside the room, causing a particular priest to hear a chime.Klein retrieved his badge and took off his hat and pressed it to his chest. He gave a slight bow before turning around and exiting.After confirming that the feeling of being watched was gone, he wore his halved top hat. Without any excessive emotions, he held his cane and turned right, until he arrived by an arched altar.He found the secret door in the wall facing his side. He silently opened it before sneaking in quickly.The secret door closed silently as a middle-aged, black-robed priest appeared under the illumination of gas lamps.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d the priest asked tersely.Klein showed his badged and repeated what he said to the bishop.The middle-aged priest did not ask further questions. He turned around and proceeded forward in silence.Klein nodded and took off his hat. With his black cane, he followed silently in tow.Rozanne had once mentioned that heading left from the crossroads towards Chanis Gate would reach Saint Selena Cathedral.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Tap! The sound of footsteps echoed through the dark, narrow corridor, which was otherwise silent.Klein kept his back straight as he kept up with the priest\u2019s pace. He did not pose questions or chat idly with him, remaining silent like a windless body of water.After passing through the heavily guarded passageway, the priest opened a secret door with a key and pointed down a stairwell made of stone. \u201cTurn left at the intersection to reach Chanis Gate.\u201d\u201cMay Goddess bless you.\u201d Klein gestured the sign of the crimson moon on his chest.Commoners practiced etiquette, while the religious partook in ritual blessings.\u201cPraise the Lady.\u201d The priest returned with the same gesture.Klein did not speak further as he walked down the dark stone stairwell with the aid of the refined inlaid gas lamps on both sides of the wall.Midway, he subconsciously turned back and saw the priest standing at the entrance. He was in the shadows and appeared like an immobile wax statue.Klein looked away and continued to proceed down. It did not take long before he hit ground laid with ice-cold stone slabs. This led him to the intersection.He did not turn towards Chanis Gate because Dunn Smith, who had recently finished his shift, was definitely not there.He turned right and saw the familiar path. Klein went back up another flight of stairs and appeared inside Blackthorn Security Company.Seeing doors that were tightly shut or half-closed, he did not rush into them. Instead, he went to the reception and saw a brown-haired girl focused on a magazine with a sweet smile.\u201cHi, Rozanne.\u201d Klein came to her side and deliberately rapped the table.Knock! Rozanne stood up suddenly and knocked over a chair and said in a fluster, \u201cHi, nice weather today. Y-you, Klein, why are you here?\u201dShe patted her chest and heaved a few sighs of relief. She was like a young lady afraid that her father had caught her skiving.\u201cI need to find Captain,\u201d answered Klein simply.\u201c\u2026You gave me a fright. I thought Captain came out.\u201d Rozanne glared at Klein. \u201cDon\u2019t you know how to knock!? Hmph, you should be thankful that I\u2019m a tolerant and kind woman. Well, I do prefer the term lady\u2026 Is there a reason why you are looking for Captain? He\u2019s in the room opposite Mrs. Orianna.\u201dEven though he felt uptight, Klein was so amused by Rozanne he smiled. He pondered for a moment before saying, \u201cA secret.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Rozanne\u2019s eyes widened and while she reeled in her disbelief, Klein did a slight bow before bidding her farewell.He went through the reception\u2019s partition and knocked on the door of the first office on the right.\u201cCome in.\u201d Dunn Smith\u2019s deep and gentle voice sounded.Klein pushed the door and opened before closing the door behind him. He took off his hat and bowed. \u201cGood morning, Captain.\u201d\u201cGood morning, how can I help you?\u201d Dunn\u2019s black windbreaker and hat were hanging on a clothes stand to his side. He was dressed in a white shirt and black vest. Even though his hairline was rather high, his gray eyes were deep, and he appeared much fresher.\u201cSomeone is following me.\u201d Klein honestly answered without any embellishments.Dunn leaned back and clasped his hands together. His deep gray eyes silently looked at Klein\u2019s eyes. He did not follow up on the topic of being followed and instead, asked, \u201cYou came from the cathedral?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Klein answered.Dunn nodded gently. He did not comment on its merits or demerits as he switched the subject back. \u201cIt might be that Welch\u2019s father doesn\u2019t believe the cause of death that we reported and had hired a private investigator from Wind City to investigate the matter.\u201dMidseashire\u2019s Constant City was also known as Wind City. It was a region with extremely advanced coal and steel industries. It was one of the top three cities of Loen Kingdom.Before waiting for Klein to give his opinion, Dunn continued, \u201cIt might also be a result of that notebook. Heh, we happened to be investigating where Welch received the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook. Of course, we can\u2019t eliminate other people or organizations that might be seeking out this notebook.\u201d\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d Klein asked in a serious voice.Without a question, he hoped that it was the first reason.Dunn did not immediately answer him. He raised his coffee mug and took a mouthful, his eyes not showing the sliver of a ripple. \u201cReturn the way you came, then do anything you wish.\u201d\u201cAnything?\u201d Klein returned with a question.\u201cAnything.\u201d Dunn nodded with certainty. \u201cOf course, do not scare them off or violate the law.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein took a deep breath and bade him farewell. He left the room and went back underground.He turned left at the intersection, and bathed in the light from the gas lamps on the two walls, he arrived silently to the empty, dark, and cold passageway.The sound of his footsteps echoed, making him sound more alone and terrified.Soon, Klein arrived at the stairwell. He went forward and saw a shadow standing there\u2014the middle-aged priest.The two did not say a word when they met. The priest turned around in silence and made way.He proceeded silently before returning to the prayer hall. The circular holes behind the arched altar were still as pure and bright, while the darkness and silence of the building\u2019s interior remained. There were still men and women lining outside the confessional, but much fewer than before.After waiting for a moment, Klein slowly left the prayer hall with his cane and newspaper as though nothing had ever happened, successfully leaving Saint Selena Cathedral.The moment he walked out, he saw the burning sun. He immediately regained the familiar feeling of being observed. He felt like he was prey being eyed by a hawk.Suddenly, a question surfaced in his mind.Why didn\u2019t the \u201cobserver\u201d follow me into the cathedral? Although I could have still used the dark environment and the priest to conceal my temporary disappearance, would it be hard for him to continue monitoring me by pretending to pray? If he had not done something wrong, there would be no problem walking in with an open and aboveboard manner, right? Unless the person has some dark history, making him afraid of the Church or fear the bishop, knowing that he might have the powers of a Beyonder.In that case, the likelihood of it being a private investigator is very slim\u2026 Klein exhaled and no longer acted as nervous as he was previously. He took a casual stroll before going around and to the back of Zouteland Street.He stopped at an ancient-styled building with mottled walls. The address on the door was \u20183.\u2019 Its name was the Zouteland Shooting Club.Part of the police department\u2019s underground shooting range was opened to the public as a way to earn some additional funds.Klein went in and the feeling of being watched vanished instantly. He took this opportunity to hand over his Special Operations Department badge to the attendant.After a short verification, he was led underground to a small, confined shooting range.\u201cTen-meter target.\u201d Klein informed the attendant simply. Next, he retrieved the revolver from his armpit holster and the box of brass bullets from his pocket.The feeling of being suddenly targeted made his desire to protect himself win over his procrastination. Therefore, he could not wait to come over to practice his shooting.Pa! After the attendant left, he flicked open the cylinder and removed the silver demon hunting bullets. Following that, he filled the cylinder with normal brass bullets.This time, neither did he leave an empty spot to prevent misfiring, nor did he take off his formal attire and halved top hat. He planned on practicing in his usual getup. After all, it was impossible for him to shout \u201cwait a minute, let me change into something more comfortable\u201d after encountering an enemy or danger.Click! Klein closed the cylinder and rolled it with his thumb.Suddenly, he held the gun in both hands, raised it up straight, and aimed at the target more than ten meters away.However, he was in no hurry to shoot. Instead, he recalled his experience at military\u00a0training <sup>1</sup> , how to form a line with the iron-sights, and knowledge about a gun\u2019s recoil.Rustle! Rustle! While his clothes rustled, Klein repeated his aiming and his holding stance. He was as serious as a student taking a high-school exam.After repeating it several times, he retreated to the wall and sat down on a long, soft bench. He placed the revolver to the side, began massaging his arms, and rested for quite a while.He spent a few minutes recalling his practice before he picked up the revolver with the wooden handle and bronze cylinder. He got into standard firing position and pulled the trigger.Bang! His arm trembled as his body moved back from the recoil. The bullet missed the target.Bang! Bang! Bang! Drawing from the experience he gained, he shot again and again until all six rounds were finished.I\u2019m starting to hit the target\u2026 Klein stepped back and sat down again as he exhaled.Click! He swung the cylinder out and allowed the six shells to fall to the ground. Then, without a change in expression, he inserted the remaining brass rounds in.After relaxing his arm, Klein stood up again and returned to his shooting position.Bang! Bang! Bang! Ringing shots echoed as the target shook. Klein practiced and rested repeatedly. He expended all thirty normal rounds and the remaining five from before. He gradually hit the target and started aiming for the bull\u2019s eye.He swung his sore shoulders and threw out the final five shells. He lowered his head and inserted the demon hunting bullets with the complicated patterns back into gun, leaving an empty spot to prevent misfiring.After putting the revolver back into his armpit holster, Klein patted the dust from his body and walked out the shooting range to return to the streets.The feeling of being observed arose once again. Klein felt calmer than he previously felt as he slowly walked to Champagne Street. He spent four pence on a tracked carriage to return to Iron Cross Street before returning to his own apartment.The feeling of being spied upon vanished without a trace. Klein took out his keys and opened the door to see a short-haired man nearing his thirties and wearing a linen shirt seated at a desk.His heart tensed up before relaxing immediately. Klein greeted with a smile, \u201cGood morning\u2014no\u2014good afternoon, Benson.\u201dThis man was none other than Klein\u2019s and Melissa\u2019s elder brother, Benson Moretti. He was only twenty-five this year, but his receding hairline and decrepit appearance made him look nearly thirty.He had black hair and brown eyes, resembling Klein somewhat, but he lacked the faint scholarly air which Klein had.\u201cGood afternoon, Klein. How was the interview?\u201d Benson stood up as he grinned.His black coat and halved top hat were hanging on a protrusion of their bunk bed.\u201cHorrible,\u201d Klein replied in a deadpan manner.When he saw Benson stunned, Klein chuckled and added, \u201cIn fact, I didn\u2019t even participate in the interview. I found a job ahead of the interview and it pays three pounds a week\u2026\u201dHe repeated what he told Melissa again.Benson\u2019s expression calmed down as he shook his head with a laugh. \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m seeing a child grow up\u2026 Well, this job is pretty good.\u201d He sighed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s great that the first thing I heard is such good news after being away for work. Let\u2019s celebrate tonight and buy some beef?\u201dKlein smiled. \u201cSure, but I believe Melissa will feel the pinch. Let\u2019s buy some ingredients later in the afternoon? Let\u2019s bring at least three soli? Well, to be honest, a pound exchanges for twenty soli, and one soli exchanges for twelve pence. There are even denominations like the halfpence and quarterpence. Such a coin system just goes against logic. It\u2019s so troublesome. I think it must be one of the most foolish coin system in the world.\u201dWhen he said that, he saw Benson\u2019s expression turn stern. Feeling a little unease, he wondered if he had said anything wrong.Could it be that in the lost memory fragments of the original Klein, Benson was an outright, extreme nationalist who showed no tolerance for any negativity? Benson took a few steps and refuted him with a stern expression. \u201cNo, it is not one of, but the most foolish coin system.\u201dNot one of! Klein was taken aback, but he quickly snapped to his senses. He looked at his brother in the eye and laughed.Indeed, Benson was great at mocking humor.Benson lifted the corners of his lips and said in all seriousness, \u201cYou should understand that to institute a reasonable and simple coin system, one needs to know how to count and grasp the decimal system. Unfortunately, there are too few talents among those important figures.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Using the rich experience he had from his previous incarnation, he added another insult. \u201cIn fact, there is no evidence to suggest that those important figures have any brains at all.\u201d\u201cGood! Very good!\u201d Benson roared with laughter as he gave a thumbs up. \u201cKlein, you are a lot more humorous than before.\u201dAfter taking a breath, he continued, \u201cI have to go to the pier in the afternoon. I\u2019m only off work tomorrow. After that I\u2019ll have time\u2026 to go to Tingen City Housing Improvement Company with the both of you. Let\u2019s see if they have cheap and good terrace houses for rent. Also, I need to pay Mr. Franky a visit.\u201d\u201cOur landlord?\u201d the perplexed Klein asked. Does our current landlord have some terrace houses from pretty good districts under his name?Benson shot his brother a glance and said, amused, \u201cHave you forgotten the one-year rental contract we have with him? It has only been six months.\u201d\u201cHiss\u2026\u201d Klein immediately drew a gasp of cold air.He had really forgotten the matter!Although rent was paid once a week, the lease was a year long. If they were to move now, it was equivalent to a breach in contract. If they were taken to court, they would have to compensate large sums of money!\u201cYou are still lacking in societal experience.\u201d Benson touched his receding black hairline and said wistfully, \u201cThis was a clause I fought so hard back then. If not, Mr. Franky was only willing to lease it to us for three months each contract. To those with money, landlords would sign leases for a year, two years, or even three years to seek stable income. But for us\u2014the past us\u2014and our neighbors, landlords would have to be constantly worried that something bad might happen, depriving them of their rent. Therefore, they would only sign short-term contracts.\u201cIn that case, they can offer to raise prices according to the situation.\u201d Klein summarized and added, using the original Klein\u2019s memories and his own experience as a tenant.Benson sighed and said, \u201cThis is the cruel reality of today\u2019s society. Alright, you don\u2019t have to worry. The issue with the contract can be easily resolved. To be frank, even if we owe him a week\u2019s rent, Mr. Franky would have immediately thrown us out and confiscated whatever valuable items we have. After all, his intelligence is below that of a monkey\u2019s. There\u2019s no way he can comprehend overly complicated matters.\u201dUpon hearing this, Klein suddenly recalled a particular Sir Humphrey\u2019s meme. He shook his head and said seriously, \u201cNo, Benson. You are wrong.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Benson was puzzled.\u201cMr. Franky\u2019s intelligence is still slightly higher than a monkey\u2019s,\u201d Klein replied in all seriousness. Just as Benson seemed to smile in response, he added, \u201cIf he is on form.\u201d\u201cHaha.\u201d Benson lost it and burst out in laughter.After a series of rapturous laughter, he pointed at Klein, momentarily unable to put his thoughts in words. Only then, he returned to the topic at hand.\u201cOf course, as a gentleman, we cannot employ such shameless tactics. I will discuss this with Mr. Franky tomorrow. Believe me, he\u2019s easily convinced, easily.\u201dKlein had no doubts regarding Benson\u2019s point. The existence of the gas pipes was excellent proof.After some idle chatter between the brothers, the remnants of pan-fried fish from the previous night were made into a soup with some vegetables. During the boiling process, the steam moistened the rye bread.Smearing a little butter on the bread, Klein and Benson had a simple meal, but they were very satisfied with it. After all the fragrance and sweetness of butter brought them endless aftertastes.After Benson left, Klein headed to the Lettuce and Meat market with three Soli notes and some spare pennies. He spent six pence on a pound of beef and seven pence on a fresh and succulent fish with few bones. Additionally, he bought potatoes, peas, radishes, rhubarbs, lettuce, and turnips, as well as spices such as rosemary, basil, cumin, and cooking oils.During this entire time, he continued to feel like he was being watched, but there was no physical interaction.After spending some time at Smyrin Bakery, Klein returned home and began weight-lifting with heavier items such as books to train his arm strength.He had planned to exercise by military boxing, which he learned from his compulsory military stint for students. However, he had already forgotten the radio exercise routines from school, much less boxing which was only taught during the military stints. Exasperated, he could only do something simpler.Klein did not overexert himself since it would lead to fatigue and thus put him in greater danger. He took an appropriate break and began reading the original Klein\u2019s notes and study material. He wished to read anything regarding the Fourth Epoch again.\u2026In the evening, Benson and Melissa sat in front of a desk. The food was placed neatly like children in upper primary school.The fragrances of the dishes were composed of a rich melody of scents\u2014the soul captivating fragrance of the stewed beef, the obviously tender potatoes, the sweetness of the thick pea soup, the mellow flavors of the stewed rhubarb, and the sweetness of the buttered rye bread.Benson gulped a mouthful of saliva as he turned around to see Klein placing a crispy fish onto a plate. He felt the fragrance of the oil permeate through his nostrils into his throat and then into his stomach.Groan! His stomach made a distinct protest.Klein rolled up his sleeves and held up a plate of fried fish before placing it in the middle of the tidied desk. Following that, he returned to the cupboard and took out two large cups of ginger beer and placed them where he and Benson sat.He smiled at Melissa and took out a lemon pudding as if he were performing a magic trick. \u201cWe\u2019ll have beer, while you\u2019ll have this.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201d Melissa took the lemon pudding.When Benson saw this, he raised his calm and said with a smile, \u201cThis is to celebrate Klein\u2019s finding of a decent job.\u201dKlein raised his cup and clinked it with Benson before clinking it with Melissa\u2019s lemon pudding. \u201cPraise the Lady!\u201dGulp. He tilted his head back and drank it down. The spicy feeling warmed his gullet, bringing him great aftertastes.Despite its name, ginger beer did not contain any alcohol. It was a mixture of the ginger\u2019s spiciness and the sourness of lemon that made it taste similar to beer. It was a kind of beverage that both women and children found acceptable. However, Melissa did not like the taste of it.\u201cPraise the Lady!\u201d Benson drank a mouthful as well while Melissa took a nibble of the lemon pudding. She chewed at it repeatedly before swallowing it down unwillingly.\u201cGive it a try.\u201d Klein put down his cup and picked up his fork and spoon and pointed at the tableful of food.He was most pessimistic of his thick pea soup. After all, he had never eaten something so strange on Earth. All he could do was adapt the recipe from the original Klein\u2019s memory fragments.As the eldest brother, Benson did not stand on ceremony as he dug up a spoonful of mashed potatoes and stuffed it into his mouth.The beaten potatoes were boiled thoroughly and mixed with the faint taste of lard and just enough salt. It whetted his appetite and made him salivate.\u201cNot\u2026 bad\u2026 Not bad,\u201d praised Benson vaguely. \u201cIt\u2019s much more delicious than the one I had back at work. They only used butter.\u201dThis is one of my specialties after all\u2026 Klein accepted the praise. \u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to the teachings of the chef at Welch\u2019s place.\u201dMelissa looked at the beef soup. The green basil leaves, the green lettuce heads, and the radishes were submerged in the colorless soup, covering the tender beef. The soup was clear and its fragrance tantalizing.She forked a piece of beef and placed it in her mouth to chew. The beef retained a little chewiness despite being stewed tender. The mixture of salt, the sweetness from the radishes, and the spiciness from the basil leaves complemented the deliciousness of the beef.\u201c\u2026\u201d She seemed to give her approbation, but she could not stop her chewing.Klein tasted it and felt that although it was delicious, it was not without regret. This was still far from his usual standard. After all, he was lacking in certain condiments and could only use replacements. It was no wonder it tasted different.Of course, even with the best standards, one could only make do with the dishes they cooked personally.Suddenly, his heart pained for Benson and Melissa who were stunted in their world view.After swallowing a piece of beef, Klein picked up a piece of fried Tussock Fish which was sprinkled with cumin and rosemary. It was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The char was a perfect golden brown and the saltiness and oil fragrance intertwined as one.Nodding slightly, Klein tried a piece of stewed rhubarb and found it palatable. It got rid of the cloyed taste of meat.Finally, he mustered his courage and scooped a bowl of thick pea soup.Too sweet and too sour\u2026 Klein could not help but frown.However, after seeing Benson and Melissa looking satisfied from tasting it, he began suspecting his tastes. He could not help but down a mouthful of ginger beer to cleanse his tongue.The siblings were stuffed by the end of the meal. They laid slumped in the chairs for quite a while.\u201cLet us praise the Lady once more!\u201d Benson raised his ginger beer\u2014which had only one mouthful left\u2014as he said in satisfaction.\u201cPraise the Lady!\u201d Klein downed the last bit of his beverage.\u201cPraise the Lady.\u201d Melissa finally put the last bit of lemon pudding into her mouth and enjoyed the flavors swishing through her mouth.When Klein saw this, he took advantage of his tipsiness and smiled. \u201cMelissa, that\u2019s not right. You should eat the thing you find most delicious thing at the beginning. That way, you can fully appreciate its most delicious aspects. Tasting it when you are filled and satiated will not do the food justice.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s still as delicious as it can be,\u201d answered Melissa firmly and stubbornly.The siblings had a happy chat, and after digesting their meals, they cleaned up the plates, cutlery, and stored the oil which was used to fry the fish.After busying themselves, it was revision time. One refreshed his accounting knowledge while another continued reading the study material and notes. Time was spent to its fullest.At eleven, the siblings extinguished the gas lamp and went to bed after washing up.\u2026Klein felt groggy as he stared at the darkness in front of him. A figure wearing a black windbreaker and halved top hat appeared suddenly in Klein\u2019s vision. It was Dunn Smith.\u201cCaptain!\u201d Klein jolted awake and knew he was dreaming.Dunn\u2019s gray eyes remained calm, as though he was mentioning something trivial. \u201cSomeone has sneaked into your room. Pick up your revolver and force him to the corridor. Leave the rest to us.\u201dSomeone has sneaked into my room? The observer has finally taken action? Klein jumped in fright, but did not dare ask further. All he did was nod and say, \u201cAlright!\u201dThe scene before his eyes changed immediately as a swath of colors appeared like the bursting of bubbles.Klein\u2019s eyes opened as he carefully turned his head. He looked toward the window and saw a thin but unfamiliar back standing at his desk, rummaging for something in silence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Badump! Badump!Klein\u2019s heart began beating rapidly. It shrank into a clump before expanding abruptly. It made his body tremble gently.There was an instant when he nearly forgot what he had to do until the lurking figure suddenly paused. The figure pricked his ears slightly as though listening for any changes.Blood flowed back from his brain as Klein regained his basic cognitive abilities. He reached beneath the pillow for the wooden grip of the revolver.He felt the firm but smooth feeling as he rapidly calmed down. He silently and slowly pulled out the revolver and aimed it at the trespasser\u2019s head.To be honest, he had no confidence in striking the intruder. Although he was already able to stably hit the target during practice, a moving person and a fixed target were completely different. He was not arrogant enough to confound the two together.However, he vaguely remembered something from his previous life; the general idea was that a nuclear weapon wielded the greatest strength before its launch.The principle held in his current situation. The best deterrence was before he shot!By not pulling the trigger or shooting blindly, the intruder was unable to determine whether or not he was a complete rookie who had an extremely high chance of missing him. His worries and fears would make him deliberate more, resulting in him restraining himself!In an instant, another thought arose in him. It immediately made Klein turn decisive. He was not the kind of person who turned calmer when faced with danger; instead, he had already imagined the situation when he faced the observer\u2014using intimidation instead of attacking.The Foodaholic Empire had an idiom: Where there is precaution there will be no danger!When Klein pointed his gun at the intruder, the thin man froze suddenly, as though he had sensed something.Following that, he heard a voice that hid a chuckle.\u201cGood evening, Sir.\u201dThe scrawny man clasped both his hands together, and his body seemed to tense. Klein sat on the lower bunk, aimed the person\u2019s head with the revolver, and tried to speak as leisurely and as naturally as he could.\u201cPlease raise both of your hands and turn around. Try to do it slow. To be frank, I am very timid and I get nervous easily. If you move too quickly, I can be frightened, and I can\u2019t guarantee that there won\u2019t be a situation where I misfire. Yes, that\u2019s right.\u201dThe scrawny man raised both of his hands and held them up near his head before turning his body bit by bit. The first thing that came into view was a black tight suit with neat buttons. Next, he caught a pair of brown eyebrows that were thick and sharp.The intruder\u2019s deep blue eyes didn\u2019t reflect fear, but rather gazed upon Klein with the intensity of a ferocious beast. It seemed that if Klein were careless for a second, the other person would leap forward and tear him to pieces.He clenched the handle tightly as he tried his best to appear calm and indifferent.It was only when the thin man faced him completely did Klein jerk his chin towards the door. He softly and gently said, \u201cSir, let\u2019s take this outside. Do not disturb the beautiful dreams of others. Oh, do keep your motions slow. Lighten your footsteps a little too. It\u2019s basic courtesy for a gentleman.\u201dThe thin man\u2019s cold pupils rolled as he swept Klein a glance. He continued raising his hands as he walked slowly to the door.Under the revolver\u2019s aim, he twisted the handle and slowly opened the door.When the door was half-opened, he suddenly lowered himself and rolled forward. The door was pulled by a strong wind and it closed with a slam.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Benson, who was on the top bunk, was stirred. He almost woke up in a daze.At that moment, a leisurely and serene melody entered from outside. The heavy and comfortable voice started to sing.\u201cOh, the threat of horror, the hope of crimson cries!\u201cOne thing at least is certain\u2014that this Life flies;\u201cOne thing is certain, and the rest is Lies;\u201cThe Flower that once has bloomed forever\u00a0dies <sup>1</sup> \u2026\u201dThe poem seemed to possess the power to calm and relax others. Benson, who was on the top bunk, and Melissa, who was in another room, again fell asleep amid their grogginess.Klein\u2019s body and mind was also peaceful and quiet. He nearly yawned.The way the thin man had darted off was so agile that he could not react in time.Looking at the closed door, he smiled and muttered to himself. \u201cYou might not believe it, but pulling the trigger would not release a round.\u201dThe empty chamber to prevent misfiring!Following that, Klein listened to the midnight poem as he patiently awaited for the battle outside to end.Within a minute, the tranquil melody which resembled the reflection of moonlight on the surface of a lake stopped, and the dark night resumed its deep silence.Klein silently spun the cylinder and moved the empty chamber away as he awaited for the outcome.He uneasily waited for a full ten minutes. Just as he wondered if he should investigate, he heard Dunn Smith\u2019s staid and warm voice from the door.\u201cIt\u2019s settled.\u201dPhew. Klein exhaled. He held his revolver and took his key. Barefooted, he carefully approached the door before silently opening it to see the black windbreaker and the halved top hat. Dunn Smith was standing there with his deep and calm gray eyes.He closed the door behind him and followed Dunn to the end of the corridor and stood amid the weak crimson moonlight.\u201cIt took me some time to enter his dream,\u201d said Dunn calmly as he looked at the red moon outside the window.\u201cDo you know his background?\u201d Klein felt a lot more relieved.Dunn nodded and said, \u201cAn ancient organization known as the Secret Order. They were established in the Fourth Epoch and are related to the Solomon Empire and a number of fallen aristocrats of that period. Heh, the Antigonus family\u2019s diary came from them. Due to a member\u2019s negligence, it entered the antique market and was obtained by Welch. They had no choice but to send people in search of it.\u201dWithout waiting for Klein\u2019s question, he paused before continuing.\u201cWe will capture the remaining members they have according to the clues. Well, it might not end too well. These fellows are as good at hiding as the rats in the sewers. But at the very least, they would believe that we have likely obtained the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook or that we have obtained a critical clue. In that case, as long as it\u2019s not something extremely crucial or important, they would abandon the operation. That is their philosophy on surviving.\u201d\u201c\u2026What if the notebook is extremely crucial and important?\u201d asked Klein worriedly.Dunn smiled without an answer. Instead, he said, \u201cWe know very little of the Secret Order. Our success this time is all thanks to your sharp wits. This contribution is all yours. In light of the possibility of hidden dangers and how heightened perception would aid in finding the notebook, you have a chance at choosing.\u201d\u201cA chance at choosing?\u201d Klein vaguely guessed something as his breathing subconsciously turned heavy.Dunn wiped the smile from his face as he said in all seriousness, \u201cDo you wish to become a Beyonder? You can only choose the starting Sequence of an incomplete Sequence.\u201cOf course, you can give up this chance and choose to accumulate the merit you have garnered. Then, all you have to do is wait till there\u2019s sufficient room for you to become a Sleepless, which is also the first, complete Sequence the Goddess has bestowed on the Nighthawks.\u201dIndeed\u2026 Klein felt delighted and did not have any hesitant emotions. He took the initiative to ask, \u201cThen from which of the Sequence 9s can I choose from?\u201dI have to have detailed information to decide whether to give up or accept, as well as choose which one!Dunn turned around and seemed to be cloaked in the crimson veil that shone down on him. He looked into Klein\u2019s eyes and said slowly, \u201cApart from the Sleepless, the Church has three Sequence 9 potion formulas. One of them is Mystery Pryer, which is also the power Old Neil controls. Heh, Rozanne has likely mentioned this to you. She can never hold her tongue.\u201dKlein smiled awkwardly, at a loss for an answer. Thankfully, Dunn did not mind it as he continued. \u201cOur Mystery Pryer potion formula and the later Sequences that aren\u2019t directly chained were obtained from the Moses Ascetic Order. Back then, it was said that they had yet to fall to corruption. They persisted in their morals and precepts, determined in their pursuit of knowledge. They kept their secrets strictly confidential. Anyone that entered the order would be barred from speaking for five years after becoming a Mystery Pryer. They would learn to keep silent, so as to cultivate and enhance their focus. The motto of Moses Ascetic Order\u2014do as you wish, but do no harm\u2014began from them.\u201cMystery Pryers have a comprehensive but rudimentary understanding and grasp of magic, witchcraft, astrology, and other mystical knowledge. They also know a fair number of magical rituals, but they can easily sense certain existences that hide among matter. Therefore, they have to be careful and show respect to their powers as a Beyonder.\u201cWe lack a large portion of this Sequence, causing it to be an incomplete chain. For example, its Sequence 8. Of course, perhaps the Holy Cathedral has it.\u201dThis pretty much meets all my requirements\u2026 Klein nodded slightly, to the point of having the urge to choose.Thankfully, he still remembered certain things.\u201cWhat about the other two?\u201d\u201cThe second type is named Corpse Collector. Quite a number of cultists who worship Death in the Southern Continent choose it. After consuming the potion, unintelligent dead spirits would mistake them as one of their kind and not attack them. They would gain resistance to the cold, decay, and corrosiveness of cadaveric auras. They will be able to directly see a portion of evil spirits and see the characteristics and weaknesses of undead creatures, as well as gain certain attribute enhancements. We have the Sequence 8 and Sequence 7 that follows it. Heh heh, you probably can guess Sequence 7\u2014Spirit Medium! This was chosen by Daly back then,\u201d described Dun in detail.Spirit Medium does appear mysterious and cool, but what I want most is to grasp knowledge of mysticism\u2026 Klein did not interject; all he did was listen quietly.Dunn Smith looked sideways at the crimson moon and said, \u201cWe only have Sequence 9 of the third type. Whether the Holy Cathedral has it, I\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s called Seer.\u201dSeer? Klein\u2019s pupils constricted as he recalled the regret Emperor Roselle had left in his diary: He regretted not\u00a0choosing <sup>2</sup> an Apprentice, Bandit, or Seer!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 - \"Jobs\" and Rentals Are Serious BusinessPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29: \u201cJobs\u201d and Rentals Are Serious BusinessTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosKlein tried his best to remain his usual self as he asked with genuine interest, \u201cWhat abilities do Seers have?\u201d\u201cYour question is inaccurate; the question should be, \u2018what abilities does consuming the Seer potion give?'\u201d Dunn Smith shook his head and chuckled. His gray pupils and face turned away from the moon as his features hid in the shadows. \u201cThere are many kinds of things involved\u2014astromancy, cartomancy, spiritual pendulums, and scrying. Of course, it does not mean that consuming the potion will immediately allow you to grasp all of them. The potion only equips you with the qualifications and ability to learn it.\u201cAs they lack direct means of fighting enemies, heh. You can probably imagine that setting up a magical ritual requires a lot of preparation. It\u2019s not suitable for combat. Therefore, in terms of knowledge of mysticism, a Seer will be more learned and professional than a Mystery Pryer.\u201dIt sounds like it matches my requirements as well\u2026 However, the lack of means to directly deal with enemies is quite a dilemma\u2026 Furthermore, the Church of the Evernight Goddess likely doesn\u2019t have the subsequent Sequences\u2026 The Holy Cathedral likely refers to the headquarters, the Cathedral of Serenity\u2026 The means available to low-Sequence Beyonders against their enemies might not be comparable to firearms\u2026 Klein fell into deep thought as he racked his brains. He kept going back and forth between Mystery Pryers and Seers. He no longer considered Corpse Collector.Dunn Smith smiled when he saw this.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to rush into a decision. Tell me your answer Monday morning. Regardless of your choice of Sequence or giving up this opportunity, none of us from the Nighthawks would have any other thoughts on the matter.\u201cCalm down and ask your heart.\u201dWith that said, he took off his hat and bowed slightly. He slowly walked past Klein and headed for the stairwell.Klein did not say a word and did not immediately reply. He silently bowed and watched as Dunn left.Although he was constantly hoping to become a Beyonder previously, he was thrown into a dilemma when the opportunity arose; the subsequent missing Sequences, Beyonders having the risk of losing control, the believability of Emperor Roselle\u2019s diaries, and the illusory murmurs that could corrupt people into madness all mixed together and formed a moat that obstructed his advancement.He took a deep breath and slowly breathed out.\u201cNo matter how bad it is, it can\u2019t be worse than making an eighteen-year-old high-school student decide on his future career\u2026\u201d Klein gave a self-deprecating chuckle. Gathering his scattered thoughts, his opened the door softly and laid back on the bed.He laid there with his eyes open, silently looking at the bottom of the top bunk that was dyed with the faint crimson of the moon.A drunkard staggered outside the window as a carriage sped down the empty streets. These noises did not break the serenity of the night but instead made it even darker and more distant.Klein\u2019s emotions settled down as he recalled his past on Earth. He recalled how he liked exercising, his father who always spoke loudly, his mother who enjoyed busying herself despite having a chronic disease, his friends who grew up with him, going from playing sports like soccer and basketball to games and mahjong, as well as the person he made a failed confession to\u2026 These were like a silent river; it did not have many ripples or deep sentimental feelings, but it silently drowned his heart.Perhaps one will only learn to cherish things after they have lost them. When the crimson receded and the sky turned golden-yellow from the flaming ball\u2019s illumination, Klein had made his choice.\u2026He got out of bed and headed to the public bathroom to wash his face to wake himself up. Then, he took a one-soli note to Mrs. Wendy\u2019s to buy eight pounds of rye bread with nine pence, replenishing the staple food that had been consumed the previous night.\u201cThe price of bread has begun stabilizing\u2026\u201d He commented after breakfast as Benson changed.It was Sunday, so both he and Melissa finally had the chance to rest.Klein, who was already in proper attire, was sitting on a chair and flipping through the outdated newspapers he brought back from yesterday. He said in surprise, \u201cThere\u2019s a house for rent here: North Borough\u2019s 3 Wendel Street, a bungalow with two floors. There are six bedrooms, three bathrooms, and two big balconies upstairs. Downstairs, there\u2019s a dining hall, a living room, a kitchen, two bathrooms, and two guest rooms, as well as an underground cellar\u2026 In front of the house are two acres of private land and there\u2019s a small garden behind. It can be rented for one, two, or three years, with a weekly rent of one pound six soli. Those interested can head to Champagne Street and look for Mr. Gusev.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s our goal for the future.\u201d Benson wore his black halved top hat as he smiled to say, \u201cThe rent for the places in newspapers is usually a little too expensive. The Tingen City Housing Improvement Company has options that do not pale in comparison to that for cheaper.\u201d\u201cWhy are we not searching in the Tingen Housing Improvement Association for the Working Class?\u201d Melissa walked out from her room holding an old, veiled hat. She had changed into a grayish-white long dress that had been mended several times.She was silent and introverted, but that could not mask her youthfulness.Benson laughed.\u201cWhere did you hear of the Tingen Housing Improvement Association for the Working Class?\u201d Jenny? Mrs. Rochelle? Or is it from your good friend Selena?\u201dMelissa looked to the side and whispered a reply.\u201cMrs. Rochelle\u2026 While washing up last night, I happened to meet her. She asked me about Klein\u2019s interview and I told her roughly what happened. Then, she suggested I find the Tingen Housing Improvement Association for the Working Class.\u201dBenson noticed Klein\u2019s puzzled expression and shook his head in amusement.\u201cThey are targeted at the poor. Well, a precise description is that they are a housing association for the lower strata of society. They build and renovate houses that basically have communal bathrooms. They only provide three choices\u2014a single, double or triple bedroom. Do you wish to continue living in such an environment?\u201cThe Tingen City Housing Improvement Company share similar businesses as them, but they also provide choices for the lower-middle class. To be honest, we are a little better than lower-middle class, but we still quite worse off than true middle-class families. It\u2019s not a matter of salary; it\u2019s just that we did not have the time to save up.\u201dKlein came to a realization as he put away the newspaper. Picking up his top hat, he stood up.\u201cThen, let\u2019s set off.\u201d\u201cI remember that the Tingen City Housing Improvement Company is on Daffodil Street,\u201d Benson said as he opened the door. \u201cThey are like the Tingen Housing Improvement Association for the Working Class, known as Five Percent Charities. Do you know why?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Klein raised his cane and walked to Melissa\u2019s side.The girl with black hair that reached down her back nodded.Benson headed out and said, \u201cThese kinds of housing improvement associations or companies were established as a result of Backlund. They are funded in three ways: One, by requesting donations from charitable foundations. Two, through funding proposals. They receive grants from the government\u2019s commission at a special rate of 4%. Third, through investments. By taking a portion of the rent received, they will give their investors 5% returns. That\u2019s why they are called Five Percent Charities.\u201dThe siblings went down the stairs and slowly walked toward Daffodil Street. They decided to confirm a place before talking to their present landlord, Mr. Franky. They did not want to be in a situation where they were forced to move when had no place to stay.\u201cI heard from Selena that there are housing improvement companies that are purely run as charities?\u201d Melissa asked in thought.Benson chuckled.\u201cThere are, such as the Deweyville Trust which Sir Deweyville donated money to establish. He builds apartments targeted for the working class. He also provides dedicated estate management personnel while only charging rather low rent. However, the criteria for applying is very strict.\u201d\u201cIt sounds like you aren\u2019t fond of the idea?\u201d Klein acutely sensed it as he asked with a smile.\u201cNo, I respect Sir Deweyville a lot, but I\u2019m certain he does not know what true poverty is. Staying in his apartment is like a priest giving hope. It\u2019s not very pragmatic. For instance, tenants have to receive the main vaccines and they have to take turns cleaning the bathroom. They are unable to sublease their apartments or use it for commercial activities. They aren\u2019t allowed to throw their rubbish wantonly and children are prevented from playing in the corridors. Goddess, does he wish to make everyone ladies and gentlemen?\u201d Benson answered in his usual tone.Klein creased his brows in doubt.\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound problematic. Those are all very reasonable criteria.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Melissa nodded in agreement.Benson cocked his head and looked at them before chuckling.\u201cPerhaps I have protected the both of you too well that you have not seen actual poverty. Do you think they would have the money for the main vaccines? The line for free charitable organization sets them back three months.\u201cDo you think their work is stable and not temporary? If they cannot sublet parts of their apartment to receive some extra income, are they to move out when they lose their jobs? Besides, many ladies mend clothes or make match boxes at home to maintain their livelihood. Those are included as commercial activities. Are you going to chase them all out?\u201cMost of the poor use all their efforts to survive. Do you think they have the time to discipline their children and stop them from running along the corridors? Perhaps they can only be locked at home until they\u2019re old enough, then sending them to places that accept child labor when they are around seven or eight years old.\u201dBen did not use many adjectives to describe the matter; it caused Klein to shudder a little.This was how people from low socioeconomic classes lived?Beside him, Melissa fell into silence. It took a long while before she said in an ethereal tone,\u201cJenny no longer wished for me to visit her after she moved to the Lower Street.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s hope her father gets back on his feet after that injury and finds a stable job. However, I have seen too many alcoholics use alcohol to numb themselves\u2026\u201d Benson laughed with a somber tone.Klein was at a loss for words. Melissa seemed to be the same. As such, the siblings walked silently down Daffodil Street and found Tingen City Housing Improvement Company.The person who served them was a middle-aged man with an amiable smile. He did not wear a formal attire or a hat, but instead, wore a white shirt and black vest.\u201cYou can call me Scarter. Might I know what kind of house you have in mind?\u201d When he caught a glance at Klein\u2019s silver-inlaid cane, his smile widened.Klein looked at Benson, who was better with words, and gestured for him to answer.Benson directly answered, \u201cA terrace house.\u201dScarter flipped through the files and documents in his hand before smiling.\u201cThere are currently five that haven\u2019t been rented out. To be honest, we are geared more to serving customers\u2014laborers and their children who have housing difficulties where six, eight, or even ten or twelve people squeeze into a house. There aren\u2019t many terrace houses. There\u2019s one at 2 Daffodil Street, one in the North Borough, one in the East Borough\u2026 The weekly rent goes from 12 to 16 soli. You can take a look at the detailed introductions here.\u201dHe handed over a document to Benson, Klein, and Melissa.After reading through it, the siblings exchanged looks and pointed to the same spot on the piece of paper simultaneously.\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at 2 Daffodil Street first,\u201d said Benson. Klein and Melissa nodded in response.This place was a district they were familiar with.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Their exteriors were painted grayish blue, and three chimneys stood erected.The place obviously did not have lawns, gardens, or porches. The entrances directly faced the street.Tingen City Housing Improvement Company\u2019s Scarter took out a bunch of keys and while opening the door, introduced, \u201cOur terrace houses do not have foyers, so you enter directly into the living room. There\u2019s an oriel window facing Daffodil Street, so there\u2019s pretty good lighting\u2026\u201dKlein, Benson, and Melissa were greeted by a fabric sofa bathing in the golden rays of the sun, and an area more spacious than their previous two-bedroom apartment.\u201cThis living room can be used as a guest hall. To its right is the dining room and on the left is a fireplace that will keep you warm in winter.\u201d Scarter pointed around with great familiarity.Klein looked around and confirmed that it was a crude, open-style concept. The dining room and the living room were not separated by any partitions, but they were also far from the oriel window, making those spots rather dim.There was a rectangular red wooden table surrounded by six hardwood chairs with soft cushions. The fireplace on the left wall looked exactly like the ones in foreign movies and TV series that Klein used to watch.\u201cBehind the dining area is the kitchen, but we do not provide any appliances. Opposite to the living room is a small guest room and a bathroom\u2026\u201d Scarter walked around and described the remaining layout of the house.The bathroom was separated into two parts. The outer area was where one would wash their face and brush their teeth, while the inner area was the toilet. There was an accordion door that separated them. The guest room was described to be small, but it was as big as the room that Melissa currently stayed in. She was stunned at the sight.After looking around the first floor, Scarter brought the three siblings to the stairway next to the bathroom.\u201cDown below is the underground cellar. It is quite stuffy downstairs, so you must remember to let some fresh air in first before entering.\u201dBenson nodded casually and followed Scarter to the second floor.\u201cOn my left, there\u2019s a bathroom. On the same side, there are an additional two bedrooms. It\u2019s the same layout on my right, but the washroom on this side is next to the balcony.\u201dAs he spoke, Scarter opened the bathroom door and stood sideways so that he would not obstruct Klein, Benson, and Melissa from looking in.The bathroom had an extra bathtub. Like the other bathroom, there was an accordion door next to the toilet. Although it was a little dusty, it wasn\u2019t dirty, smelly, or cramped.Melissa looked in a daze until Scarter walked to the bedroom next to it. Only then did she stop looking and follow the rest slowly.She took another few steps before looking back.Klein, who was experienced in life, was delighted and excited as well. Even though their landlord often supervised their cleaning up of the bathroom, it still was not clean enough. It was often nauseating, let alone the fact that they would easily encounter a line when they needed to relieve their urgencies.The other bathroom was similar. One of the four bedrooms was slightly bigger and was furnished with a bookcase. The rest were about the same size as each other and had a bed, table, and wardrobe.\u201cThe balcony is very tiny, so you won\u2019t be able to dry too many clothes in the sun at a time.\u201d Scarter stood at the end of the corridor and pointed to a spot with a door and lock. \u201cThere is a complete underground drainage, gas piping, meter, and other facilities. It is very suitable for you gentlemen and a lady like yourselves. It only requires thirteen soli of rent and five pence for use of the furniture weekly. In addition, there is a deposit that amounts to four weeks of rent.\u201dWithout waiting for Benson to say a word, Klein looked around and asked curiously, \u201cRoughly how much would it cost to buy the house?\u201dAs a transmigrator from the Foodaholic Empire, the desire to buy property still existed within him.Upon hearing that question, Benson and Melissa were shocked. They looked at Klein as though they were seeing a monster. Scarter replied calmly and firmly, \u201cBuy? No, we do not sell property. We only provide rental properties.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just trying to have a general sense of the prices.\u201d Klein explained awkwardly.Scarter hesitated for a few seconds before saying, \u201cLast month, the owner of 11 Daffodil Street sold a limited-period land deed with a similar property sitting atop the land. 300 pounds for fifteen years. It is much cheaper than renting directly but not everyone can fork out such a large sum of money. If one would like to buy it over completely, the owner\u2019s posted price 850 pounds.\u201d850 pounds? Klein quickly made the mental calculations.My weekly pay is three pounds, Benson eans one pound and ten soli\u2026 Rent is thirteen soli and if we eat well every day, we would spend nearly two pounds a week. On top of that, there are expenses such as clothes, transportation, social expenditures, so on and so forth. We can only save less than twenty soli a week. One year adds up to about 35 pounds. 850 pounds would require more than twenty years. Even if it we bought the land for a limited period of time for 300 pounds, it would take us at least eight or nine years\u2026 That doesn\u2019t include getting married, living independently, raising children, traveling, and so on\u2026In a world without individual housing loans, most people are likely to opt for rental\u2026Realizing this, he stepped back and stole a glance at Benson. He beckoned him to talk to Scarter about the rent.As for Melissa\u2019s intentions, they were obvious from her bright eyes!At that moment, Klein suddenly thought of letting Benson loose.Benson tapped his plain cane and looked around before he said, \u201cWe should take a look at other houses. The dining area\u2019s lighting isn\u2019t good, and the balcony is very small. Look, only that bedroom has a fireplace, and the furniture is too old. If we move in, we have to at least change half of these\u2026\u201dHe pointed out faults in a hurried tone, spending ten minutes to persuade Scarter to lower the rent to twelve soli and the furniture usage fee to three pence, while rounding up the deposit to two pounds.Without further ado, the siblings returned with Scarter to the Tingen City Housing Improvement Company and signed two copies of the contract. They then headed over to the Notary Office of Tingen City to notarize the contract.After paying the deposit and first week\u2019s rent, Klein and Benson\u2019s remaining money added up to nine pounds, two soli, and eight pence.Standing before the door of 2 Daffodil Street, they each held a bunch of copper keys. They were momentarily unable to look away; their emotions churning within them.\u201cIt feels like a dream\u2026\u201d After a while, Melissa lifted her head to look at the future \u201cMoretti Residence,\u201d and she spoke with a low yet unsteady voice.Benson let out a breath and smiled.\u201cThen don\u2019t wake up.\u201dKlein wasn\u2019t as emotional as they were. He nodded and said, \u201cWe need to change the locks of the main door and balcony door as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no hurry. The reputation of Tingen City Housing Improvement Company is very good. The rest of the money is for your formal suit. However, before that, we need to pay Mr. Franky a visit.\u201d Benson pointed in the direction of the apartment.\u2026The siblings made do with rye bread at home before heading for a terrace apartment on Iron Cross Street. When they knocked on their landlord\u2019s door, Mr. Franky declared imposingly while his short frame perched on a sofa, \u201cYou know my rules. No one is allowed to be behind their rent!\u201dBenson leaned forward and smiled.\u201cMr. Franky, we are here to give up our lease.\u201dThat straightforward? Would negotiating this way work? Standing beside Benson, Klein was shocked when he heard him.On the way here, Benson had said that his bottomline was a compensation of twelve soli.\u201cGive up your lease? No! We have a contract, and there\u2019s still half a year left!\u201d Franky glared at Benson as he flailed his arms.Benson looked at him seriously and waited for a moment before saying calmly, \u201cMr. Franky, you should understand that you could have made much more money.\u201d\u201cMake much more?\u201d Franky asked with interest, touching his skinny face.Benson sat up straight and explained with a smile, \u201cThe two-bedroom unit was rented to the three of us for five soli and six pence. But if you were to rent it to a family of five or six people, with two or three of them working and getting paid, I think they would be willing to pay more to stay there instead of staying at Lower Street where its ridden with crime. I think five soli ten pence or six soli would be a reasonable price.\u201dFranky\u2019s eyes brightened up and his throat moved as Benson continued to say, \u201cBesides, you are certainly aware that rental prices have been increasing in recent years. The longer we stay, the greater a loss you incur.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 I need time to look for a new tenant.\u201d Mr. Franky, who had inherited the apartment building, obviously liked the idea.\u201cI believe you can find one very quickly since you have the ability and resources to do so. Maybe two days, maybe three days\u2026 We will pay for the losses you incur during this time. How about the deposit of three soli that we have paid? It is very reasonable!\u201d Benson immediately decided for Franky.Franky nodded in satisfaction.\u201cBenson, you are such a conscientious and honest young man. Alright then, let\u2019s sign the termination of contract.\u201dKlein was dumbfounded watching this happen. He completely understood how easy it was to \u2018convince\u2019 Mr. Franky.That\u2019s way too easy\u2026With the problem of the previous contract resolved, the three siblings first helped Klein buy his formal wear and then got busy with moving house.They didn\u2019t have anything heavy or bulky as bulkier items belonged to the landlord. Thus, Benson and Melissa rejected Klein\u2019s idea of hiring a carriage, and instead carried their things themselves. They went back and forth between Daffodil Street and Iron Cross Street.The hot sun outside the window set in the west, and golden rays shone through the oriel window, scattering across the desk\u2019s surface. Klein looked at the rack that had books and notebooks arranged neatly before putting an ink bottle and a fountain pen on the table which he had wiped cleaned earlier.It\u2019s finally over\u2026 He let out a breath of relief and heard his stomach growl. He loosened his rolled up sleeves as he walked towards the door.He had a bed that belonged to him. The bedsheet and blanket were white, old but clean.Klein twisted the doorknob and walked out of his bedroom. Just as he was preparing to say something, he saw both doors on the opposite side open simultaneously as Benson and Melissa came into his view.Looking at the dust and dirt marks on their faces, Klein and Benson suddenly burst out into laughter, sounding abnormally cheerful.Melissa bit her lips lightly but the laughter was contagious. She eventually let out a soft laugh.\u2026The next morning.Klein stood before a full-length mirror with no cracks, seriously smoothing out his collar and sleeves of his shirt.The outfit included a white shirt, black tuxedo, silk top hat, black vest, a set of trousers, boots, and a bow tie. He felt the pinch of paying eight pounds in total.However, the effect was great. Klein felt that his reflection in the mirror exhibited greater scholarly qualities and made him look more handsome.Click!He closed his pocket watch and put it into his inner pocket. He then took his cane and hid his revolver. He took the tracked public carriage and arrived at Zouteland Street.The moment he entered the Blackthorn Security Company, he realized that he was so used to his previous lifestyle that he had forgotten to give Melissa extra money but allowed her to walk to school instead.Shaking his head, he took note of it before stepping into Blackthorn Security Company. He saw the brown-haired girl, Rozanne, making coffee. A rich aroma permeated throughout the office.\u201cGood morning, Klein. The weather is great today,\u201d Rozanne greeted him with a smile. \u201cTo be frank, I have always been curious. In such weather, don\u2019t you men feel hot wearing those formal suits? I know for a fact that Tingen\u2019s summer isn\u2019t as hot as the South\u2019s, but it is still summer.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the price of style,\u201d Klein replied humorously. \u201cGood morning, Miss Rozanne. Where\u2019s the Captain?\u201d\u201cSame old place.\u201d Rozanne pointed inside.Klein nodded. He went through the partition and knocked on Dunn Smith\u2019s office door.\u201cCome in.\u201d Dunn\u2019s voice was deep and gentle as usual.When he saw Klein, who looked quite different in a set of nice formal wear, he nodded and his gray eyes smiled.\u201cHave you decided?\u201d he asked.Klein took a deep breath and answered seriously, \u201cYes, I have made a decision.\u201dDunn slowly sat up straight. His expression became solemn but the deep recesses of his gray eyes remained the same.\u201cTell me your answer.\u201dKlein replied without hesitation, \u201cSeer!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 - PotionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 31: PotionTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosDunn Smith stared at Klein with his gray eyes for a full minute without a word.Klein did not cower under the pressure of the silence and his gaze. He continued locking his eyes with Dunn.\u201cYou must understand that once you consume the potion, there will be no room for regret.\u201d Finally, Dunn spoke again in a deep emotionless voice.Klein grinned and said, \u201cI know, but I respect the voice in me.\u201dFirst, Sleepless does not meet my requirements. It was the same for Spectator which he heard from the Tarot Club based on description. He was unsure when he would come into contact with other Beyonder pathways. A slow remedy could not work for an urgent situation; therefore, there was no need for him to wait. By the same logic, Corpse Collector was eliminated as well, leaving the two choices\u2014Mystery Pryer and Seer.Under the premise that potions of the same Sequence were equally dangerous and him unable to obtain more information, as well as the fact that both Mystery Pryer and Seer met his requirements, then regardless of whether Emperor Roselle was making a passing remark or if he really regretted not choosing Apprentice, Marauder, and Seer, it was enough to tip the balance in his heart.Furthermore, he could tell from the diary that as long as he figured out the true essence of digestion and acting, he would be able to avoid the negative effects the potion would bring to a significant extent. As for the murmurings and illusory enticements that could drive people to corruption and madness, he had already encountered that even without being a Beyonder!\u201cAlright.\u201d Dunn stood up and picked up his halved top hat. As he put it on, he said, \u201cFollow me down.\u201dKlein nodded and gave a gentleman\u2019s bow in gratitude.Tap. Tap. Tap. Both of them ventured down, their footsteps echoing through the silent and vast stairwell and passageway.Klein suddenly felt gripped by anxiety as he tried to find a topic of conversation.\u201cCaptain, you mentioned that taking the potion would not directly give me the corresponding knowledge on mysticism, that I\u2019ll only have the qualifications to learn it. Then, where does the basic knowledge of mysticism come from? Did our predecessors risk their life for it or obtain it via other means?\u201dEvery time he went underground, he would find the air especially fresh. Clearly, the ventilation was excellent. However, the occasional gust of wind made one shiver.Dunn glanced at him, the darkness in his gray eyes appearing abnormally deep.He answered calmly, \u201cOne of them is as you said, experimentation, summarization, and enhancement. Second, being bestowed by the gods. Third, heh. The dangerous murmurs that others can\u2019t hear do not only growl and roar senselessly. At times, they will describe some matters regarding mysticism. But according to what I know, people who truly listen to the murmurs on a long-term basis have gone mad without exception. Or they would fall to corruption and become monsters. Of course, we must thank them. The notebooks they\u2019ve left behind are precious treasures in the field of mysticism.\u201dHuman lab rats? The underground passage\u2019s cold humidity made Klein shudder suddenly.Then, would my luck enhancement ritual which turned into \u201cSocial Network Magic\u201d eventually lead to similar effects due to the crazy and horrible murmurs?At the intersection, Dunn did not proceed toward Chanis Gate, nor did he turn to the weapons, materials and archives. Instead, he took Klein to the left and approached Saint Selena Cathedral.Midway, he stopped. It was unclear what he touched to open a secret door.\u201cThis is our Nighthawk team\u2019s alchemy room. I will get Old Neil to retrieve the Seer potion formula and the corresponding materials from inside Chanis Gate. Heh, you have pretty good luck. The Goddess has blessed you with her favor. We should still have the materials needed for two Seer potions. If not, you would have to wait a long while.\u201d Dunn pointed at the room behind the door. \u201cWait in here. Later, watch Old Neil concoct the potion. It\u2019s the most basic part of mysticism studies. Oh, do not randomly touch things in there. They are either very dangerous, expensive, or both.\u201dWith that said, Dunn added like before.\u201cOh right, I forgot something again. Your becoming a Beyonder is a result of you having to face danger and the need to find the notebook. The meritorious deed was only a part of it; therefore, you will not be a member of our team for the time being. You will still be a civilian staff member with a corresponding salary. You will still do what I instructed you to do previously. One additional thing is to learn more about mysticism with Old Neil. You can arrange the time with him.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Other than feeling a little disgruntled by the lack of a pay rise, Klein was in full agreement with the rest.According to Dunn, there was still the process of learning and grasping one\u2019s newfound powers after consuming the potion. If he were to become a formal member immediately and participate in paranormal missions, his death was certain.Dunn turned around and walked two steps towards the intersection when he suddenly turned back.\u201cAnother thing.\u201dI knew it\u2026 Klein was already used to the 'style\u201d of his Captain.\u201cWe got something out of the Secret Order\u2019s actions,\u201d said Dunn with his usual expression. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely they will provoke you in the near future, but don\u2019t be careless. It has to do with them being temporarily unable to confirm whether the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook is important to them. From what we discovered, they have preserved some of the ancient customs and we can confirm that they are related to the Solomon Empire and the corrupted nobles of that period.\u201d\u201cGot it. Thanks, Captain,\u201d said Klein as he exhaled.This was also one of the reasons why he did not wish to wait, grasping the chance of becoming a Beyonder in such a hurry!As he watched Dunn leave and confirmed that he would not turn his head to say more, Klein slowly walked into the alchemy room.The room had long tables. There were test tubes, pipettes, scales and crucibles. It resembled a chemistry laboratory from his previous life. It was just more spartan and ancient.Other than that, there was a huge cauldron, a dark wood ladle, a translucent crystal ball, and other items. The Dark Sacred Emblem and other strange emblems were visible everywhere. They gave the room a tint of mystery.Klein looked around with interest, but he was not stupid enough to touch the things.After a while, he heard footsteps. Old Neil carried a tiny silver chest with complicated patterns. He was still wearing his unique classic black robe that seem anachronistic, matched with a felt hat with a rounded edge of the same color.\u201cLad, I never expected you to choose Seer.\u201d Old Neil put down the chest and used his somewhat turbid red eyes size up Klein. \u201cYour personality is just like mine when I was young. You just don\u2019t want to follow the masses. Not bad. Light these few gas lamps and close the door.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein tried hard not to tremble as he lit each gas lamp in the alchemy room. He made dim light rule over the place once again.Tak! Tak! Tak! The secret door was closed. He turned back to see the white-hairedand deep-wrinkled Old Neil using a bunch of strange tied tree branches to scrubthe black cauldron.\u201cThe concoction of a Sequence potion is extremely simple, at least for Sequence 7 and below. There\u2019s no need for a special flame or any additional ritual, much less an incantation. There\u2019s no need for one to participate in it spiritually. All one needs to do is go according to the formula\u2019s steps, add the precise amounts, and mix it. That will be all.\u201d Old Neil\u2019s wrinkles seemed to bloom from his smile.\u201cFor real?\u201d Klein questioned in surprise.This sounds as simple as my luck enhancement ritual\u2026Man, it\u2019s quite frightening when you come to think of it\u2026\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s a gift of the gods. Praise the Lady.\u201d Old Neil drew a haphazard circle over his chest.Following that, he opened the silver chest and pulled out goatskin parchment that exuded antiquity.The yellowish-brown goatskin unfurled inch by inch, revealing words on it. Klein looked from a distance and realized it was in Hermes, a language he was very familiar with.It was written in ink that resembled blood, seeming to still having its fluidity intact. But other than that, it did not seem extraordinary in any way.\u201cSeer: 100 milliliters of pure water, 13 drops of night vanilla liquids, 7 gold mint leaves\u2026\u201d Klein silently recited the formula\u2019s content, but the rest of it was blocked by Old Neil\u2019s wrist, preventing him from reading it.\u201cPure water is water that is repeatedly distilled. Thankfully, I made some previously, so there\u2019s no need to waste time on it.\u201d While Old Neil gave the introduction, he took a large sealed glass bottle from the table with great familiarity.He took off the stopper and poured about 100 milliliters of pure water into the cauldron without much thought.Klein did not dare ask, afraid he would affect Old Neil\u2019s concoction. After all, he was the one drinking the potion.\u201c13 drops of night vanilla juices. This can be extracted and stored as an essential oil ahead of time.\u201d Old Neil took out a tiny brown bottle from the silver chest and with a pipette and dripped 13 drops into the cauldron in a relaxed manner.A faint but easing fragrance emanated, making Klein feel an abnormal sense of peace.\u201c7 gold mint leaves\u2026\u201d Old Neil picked up a silver patterned can and removed its lid. With his bare hands, he picked up a few leaves and scattered it into the cauldron. He caught a whiff of a fresh and stimulating scent.\u201c4, 5, 6, 7. Perfect.\u201d Old Neil chuckled and looked at the potion formula on the goatskin. \u201c3 drops of poison hemlock. This isn\u2019t something you should drink randomly. It can cause your entire body to numb to the point of death. In ancient times, it proved to be the best option for committing suicide.\u201dIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m silly\u2026 Klein lampooned.Old Neil changed pipettes and dripped the poison hemlock into the cauldron. The mixture caused a strange smell that freshened one\u2019s mind.\u201c9 grams of dragon blood grass powder.\u201d Old Neil took his time to reach his hand into the silver chest and pulled out a transparent test tube. There was some deep black powder inside.He used a beaker and a scale to measure 9 grams of powder and poured it into the cauldron. He then stirred the mixture twice with the dark wood ladle. The laidback process to making the concoction made Klein a little worried.\u201cIn fact, the materials from before were just supplemental. The exact amount doesn\u2019t really affect the final outcome. Should I put a little bit more?\u201d Old Neil made a joke. \u201cThe last two is what\u2019s crucial. The amount can be slightly lowered, but it cannot be too far from the requirement, or your \u2018enhancement\u2019 can fail. Oh, the quantity cannot be any more, even just by a bit. If so, you will have to be treated for mental problems. It\u2019s not impossible to die immediately.\u201dKlein immediately tensed up as he saw Old Neil pull out a black glass bottle from the silver chest.\u201cLavos Squid\u2019s blood, 10 milliliters. This kind of squid is considered an extraordinary biological species. It is clearly mutated. It is covered in mystery. Its blood will rapidly break down under sunlight and lose its unique qualities. It has to be stored in opaque material.\u201d Old Neil\u2019s tone no longer sounded relaxed. He quickly and carefully retrieved 10 milliliters of blood with a test tube.The blood was blue like the sky. From time to time, it produced illusory bubbles as though it was connected to the spiritual world.\u201cAfter pouring the blood inside the test tube, the remaining drops are ignored as a form of precaution,\u201d whispered Old Neil.The moment the blue blood entered the cauldron and made contact with the liquid from before, it produced bubbling sounds. The surrounding light was dyed with a light blue tinge, making Klein feel a strange sense of distance but also familiarity.It felt like the feeling of being in a mother\u2019s womb. It elevated a human\u2019s soul.\u201cThe final item. Stellar Aqua crystal. 50 grams.\u201d Old Neil\u2019s voice sounded in Klein\u2019s ears, jolting him awake as he looked at the table.In the old gentleman\u2019s hand was a piece of extremely pure crystal. Furthermore, the crystal appeared gelatinous, as though it was jelly from Earth. It lacked hardness.Under the blue light\u2019s illumination, it reflected bits of light as it seemed to contain a resplendent void of stars within.\u201cThis is excellent material for the creation of divination crystals\u2026 Just a little less in consideration of any mistakes.\u201d As Old Neil measured, he used a tiny patterned silver blade to extract the crystal.\u201cPure water, night vanilla, gold mint leaves, poison hemlock juice, dragon blood grass, Lavos Squid blood, and Stellar Aqua crystal make up a Seer\u2026\u201d At that moment, Klein could not help but recall the formula.With everything done, Old Neil poured in a few blocks of Stellar Aqua crystal into the cauldron.Sizzle!Illusory fog instantly spewed forth, turning the alchemy room into a blur.Klein seemed to see a vast array of stars amid the fog and felt like he was being observed by an invisible existence.A few seconds later, the fog dissipated. Old Neil used the dark wood ladle and scooped out some sticky dark-blue liquid. It had strange characteristics\u2014gooey and inseparable. Not one bit was left in the black cauldron.The dark-blue liquid was poured into an opaque cup before Old Neil pointed at it.\u201cIt\u2019s done, your Seer potion.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He swallowed his saliva and said in great difficulty, \u201cAm I to drink it just like that?\u201cIs there no need for any other preparations? Like a ritual, an incantation, or a prayer?\u201dOld Neil acknowledged tersely before saying, \u201cPreparation? There is. Get a cup of Intis Aurmir grape wine, suck on a Desi cigar, then whistle a relaxing tune, and dance a upbeat court dance. You can do a tap dance if you prefer that. Finally, play a round of Gwent cards\u2026\u201dWhen he saw Klein\u2019s expression turn dumbfounded, Old Neil laughed and summarized what he had just said.\u201cIf you feel nervous.\u201d\u2026You are quite humorous, aren\u2019t you\u2026? The corners of Klein\u2019s mouth twitched as he resisted the urge to draw his gun.He put his cane down and extended his right hand. As though he held something heavy, he raised the opaque cup. The smell of the potion was faint and seemingly ethereal.\u201cLad, do not hesitate. The more you hesitate, the more nervous and afraid you will be. That will only affect the absorption that follows,\u201d said Old Neil with his back facing Klein. It was as though he had said it casually.It was unknown when he arrived by the nearby water basin. He turned on the tap and washed his hands.Klein nodded silently and took a deep breath. Just like he was back when he was a child, he pinched his nose and drank it like medicine. He moved the opaque cup to his mouth and tipped his head, drinking it down with a gulp.A cool and smooth feeling quickly filled his oral cavity. It then flowed through his gullet and into his stomach.The sticky, dark-blue liquid seemed to grow out thin and long tentacles, bringing stimulation and coldness to every cell in Klein\u2019s body.He could not help but convulse as his vision rapidly went into a blur. All colors seemed to saturate. The reds were redder, the blues were bluer, and the blacks were blacker. The rich colors blended like an impressionist painting.Klein had seen such a scene before. It was back when he was questioned by the Spirit Medium, Daly.At that moment, his vision became a blur and although his mind felt light, it was clear. He felt like a castaway floating in the sea.Slowly, his surroundings turned discernible. All the colors returned to their original as a grayish and blurry fog emanated.Around him were bodies he found difficult to describe. There were transparent objects that did not seem to exist. Deep down, there were clean light clusters of different colors. The light seemed to possess life or contain immense knowledge.This is a little similar to what I saw during the luck enhancement ritual\u2026 As Klein instinctively looked down, he realized that \u2018he\u2019 was still standing in his original spot, body convulsing.Suddenly, he came to a realization, causing his consciousness to sink abruptly and fuse with him.Boom!The fog quickly dissipated as the colors restored to normal. The bright, clear halo and the inexistent objects instantly vanished.The scene in the alchemy room returned to normal, but Klein felt his head swell. He felt like it was being yanked apart. Whatever he saw had countless afterimages. His ears were overwhelmed by an ethereal murmur.\u201cHornacis\u2026 Flegrea\u2026 Hornacis\u2026 Flegrea\u2026 Hornacis\u2026 Flegrea\u2026\u201dKlein felt a stabbing pain at his forehead as he quickly had thoughts of causing destruction to vent the discomfort in him.He frowned and hurriedly shook his head.\u201cIs your vision abnormal? Are you also hearing things you did not use to hear?\u201d said Old Neil, at his side with a concealed smile.\u201cYes, Mr. Neil, what should I do?\u201d Klein tolerated the intense mania and asked.Old Neil chuckled.\u201cThis is the resulting seepage of the potion\u2019s energy. You lack the means to control it. Alright, do as I say. Think of an object in your mind, something common. Make it simple and easy.\u201dKlein quickly focused as he envisaged his own halved top hat woven from black silk. He recalled the feeling when he touched it and its exact shape.\u201cPlace all your focus on it. Keep repeating that while creating the outlines. Does it feel a little better?\u201d Old Neil\u2019s voice penetrated into his mind like a serene song.Klein turned his focus bit by bit to the imagined top hat. He felt the murmurs subside into a whisper before they vanished. The afterimages he saw also stacked upon one another and no longer appeared a blur.\u201cMuch better,\u201d said Klein after calming his mind of chaotic emotions and having exhaled.He looked down at his body and discovered that nothing abnormal had happened.He moved his limbs and with half-anticipation and half-doubt, asking, \u201cI succeeded? I\u2019m now considered a Seer?\u201dOld Neil pulled out a mirror-like mercury plate and shoved it in front of him.\u201cLook at your eyes.\u201dKlein focused his gaze and saw that he was wearing a black top hat. His outline stood out and his facial features looked normal. Apart from having his face covered in sweat, he did not seem different in any way.He followed Old Neil\u2019s instruction and carefully looked at his eyes. Only then did he discover that his brown eyes had deepened quite significantly. It was so much deepened that it was like the night\u2014one in complete darkness. It felt so deep that it could absorb the souls of others.Normally, dark brown pupils are easily recognized as black. Without looking very carefully, even Klein himself would not have noticed.\u201cThis is a physical manifestation of the potion\u2019s powers. When you learn Cogitation and how to converge your power, your eyes will return to normal.\u201d Old Neil smiled as he reached out his right hand. \u201cCongratulations, our new Beyonder, our Seer.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Klein reached out his hand and shook it. \u201cMr. Neil, when can I learn how to Cogitate?\u201d\u201cYou can learn it now. The initial steps of Cogitation is relatively simple. It\u2019s even more so for Beyonders,\u201d said Old Neil with a smile. \u201cJust now, producing an object in your mind to divert your attention and turning the energy seepage inwards is actually the first step to Cogitation. Try doing it again.\u201dKlein closed his eyes and once again, his mind depicted the halved top hat.His concentration seemed to be more easily focused than before. Soon, random thoughts that surfaced would quickly vanish, leaving the hat\u2019s outline.\u201cLet your brain go somewhat blank. Exchange the object you imagined. Use something that does not exist in this world, an object you imagine completely out of thin air.\u201d\u201cYou have to follow this rule. Only by doing so can you enter Cogitation, only then can you exceed the concept of \u2018I.\u2019 The limitless \u2018I\u2019 will be become one with the universe, giving you the ability to see and understand the truth. You will obtain knowledge only you yourself can understand. In the domain of mysticism studies, it\u2019s called a Mystic Experience,\u201d said Old Neil using a pacifying tone. \u201cYou just need to listen to the descriptions that I\u2019ll get to later. What\u2019s most important is to enter Cogitation.\u201dSomething that doesn\u2019t exist in this world. Imagine something completely out of thin air\u2026 Would things from Earth count? Klein attempted using an earthy-green intercontinental missile he saw on television. He replaced the halved top hat with this long and thick missile.However, regardless of how he outlined it or imagined it, he ultimately only ended up focusing his attention.It doesn\u2019t seem like it will work\u2026 Klein had no choice but to let his imagination run wild. Heoutlined a sphere of light and then many similar objects, gathering them together.The spheres of light stacked upon one another. It felt like an object of fantasy. Klein\u2019s thoughts gradually turned ethereal and afloat.His body and mind calmed down. The objects that did not seem to exist, the fog with the bright clusters of light, and the complex colors appeared once again. They floated in the sky in close reach.He extended his spirituality inch by inch as he looked down at them quietly. He sensed it and took it in.\u201cVery good. As expected of a Seer. You entered Cogitation very smoothly. You are just slightly worse than me back then. Slightly,\u201d said Old Neil with a chuckle. \u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll begin teaching you the most common, easiest to grasp, and most useful ability in the future in mysticism. Spirit Vision!\u201dHe switched off the gas lamps one after another but opened the door to the alchemy room. It made the spot where Klein was dark, but not to the point of failing to make out silhouettes of objects.\u201cAlright. in your present state, raise your hands and place them in front of your eyes. Your index fingers need to face each other, but they are not to touch.\u201cOpen your eyes and keep them open until you are accustomed to the darkness.\u201dKlein completed each step according to Old Neil\u2019s description. He saw the silhouettes of his fingers and the surrounding objects.\u201cActually, you should be lying down to let your body be entirely relaxed. But since the effect of your Cogitation is not bad, let\u2019s continue.\u201d Old Neil laughed. \u201cFocus your gaze on a spot behind your hands. It has to be behind. Then, slowly move your fingers and maintain the same pose without touching them. Also, do not pull them out of your sight.\u201dKlein calmly listened to it and cast his gaze at an empty spot behind his palms. He then slowly moved his index fingers within his vision.Once, twice, thrice\u2026 Suddenly, Klein saw a fiery-red color in between his fingers.\u201cEh\u2026\u201d He let out a sound.\u201cYou see color? That\u2019s right. That\u2019s the initial step to Spirit Vision. The color you see is your aura,\u201d said Old Neil with a chuckle. \u201cNo rush. Do it a few more times. After stabilizing it, look elsewhere. I\u2019ll also take this opportunity to explain to you the different meanings of the different colors.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein moved his fingers back and forth while having his vision trained on the fiery-red.Old Neil thought for a moment before saying, \u201cTo put it simply, the mainstream way of mysticism is to split non-physical parts of a human into four levels. At its core is the Spirit Body, which is also everyone\u2019s basic spirituality. There is a school of thought that believes all biological creatures have spirituality and have a Spirit Body.\u201cI\u2019m not sure about anything else, but to Mystery Pryers, the goal of Cogitation and the method to increase our strength is directed toward the Spirit Body.\u201cOutside the Spirit Body is the Astral Projection. It is the means for the Spirit Body to communicate with the spirit world and with stellar space. It\u2019s considered an external manifestation of the Spirit Body. Besides, it will be directly related to your personal ambition and your prevailing emotions\u2026 The scenes you see after consuming the potion are scenes your Astral Projection sees when it wanders through the spirit world. That world does not obey the laws of the physical world. It involves exceeding the concept of \u2018I,\u2019 the limitless \u2018I\u2019, and the Universe\u2019s \u2018I.\u2019 The past, present, and future might be stacked upon one another and that is the source of divination.\u201cIn the spirit world, what you see is just an imagery, a symbol. You have to interpret it to understand its actual meaning.\u201cDivination and many magic spells are cast through the Astral Projection.\u201cDo not mistake its relationship and differences with a Spirit Body.\u201dOne is just a body and the other is for form\u2026 Klein continued looking at the aura in between his fingertips and made the simple conclusion.\u201cFurther out will be the Body of Heart and Mind. From this point forth, it will combine with the physical body\u2026 It involves your brain and is an overall manifestation of your inferential abilities, your analytical abilities, your observational abilities, and identification abilities. Some potions will mainly raise this. Quite a number of magic spells target it as well.\u201dOld Neil explained in relatively great detail, \u201cThe outermost layer is the Ether Body. It is a manifestation of your vital energies and physical form.\u201d\u201cThe aura color you see is an external phenomenon of your Ether Body. In other words, apart from the spiritual bodies, ghosts, and specters you can see directly with Spirit Vision, it might also include certain existences that should not be seen. You can also see the Ether Bodies of others or their auras. From their thickness, brightness, and color, you can determine their health and emotional state.\u201cWhen your Spirit Vision improves and you grasp more mysticism knowledge, you will be able to discover even more details. You can even determine the lifespan of others.\u201cBy the way, the emotional state I mentioned would also manifest itself because of your Astral Projection. When you go higher in Sequence, your Spirit Vision will reach a relatively high stage. You can even be able to see someone else\u2019s Astral Projection. That way, you will learn even more things. This is a level only Seers and Mystery Pryers can attain.\u201cSome fellows even claim that the strongest form of Spirit Vision allows one to see anything in any place, including the past and future. However, I\u2019m skeptical about it.\u201dIt sounds quite powerful\u2026 Klein was almost turning eager.Old Neil coughed and continued, \u201cLet\u2019s return to the Ether Body and the colors of the auras. Your limbs and parts that are required in motion will appear red. Your head and brain\u2019s surface will appear as purple. Spots that excrete waste will appear orange. The digestion system will appear as yellow. The heart and other regulatory systems will appear green. Your throat and other parts of the nervous system will appear blue. An entirely balanced body will make a body be cloaked in white\u2026 That is a symbol of health.\u201cOnce it turns dark or the thickness thins, the color will change. That indicates that the corresponding spot has turned problematic. It means it\u2019s in a state of exhaustion or illness.\u201cIn addition, the inner layer of the Astral Projection represents prevailing emotions. Red means passion and excitement. Orange means warmth and satisfaction. Yellow means happiness and extroversion. Green means calm and peace. Blue means coldness and stillness that one is in thought. White means brightness, an eagerness to improve. Dark colors mean worry, sorrow, and silence. Purple means that spirituality is taking control of the lead, coldness and estrangement\u2026\u201dKlein silently memorized the information and stabilized his initial Spirit Vision.\u201cGood, you can look at other objects.\u201d Old Neil did not speak further as he nodded.Klein slowly turned his head and looked at Old Neil. Indeed, he saw different colors in different parts of his body. The aura was both thick and thin at different spots. The purple color at his head was brightest and his limbs\u2019 redness was relatively dark. The overall whiteness to his body was somewhat faded as well.Indeed, he\u2019s getting on in age\u2026 Klein made a silent comment to himself.Only with what he saw did he feel that he had become a Beyonder!\u201cI am now a Beyonder!\u201dHe shifted his gaze and carefully sized up Old Neil when suddenly he saw a translucent pair of cold and ruthless eyes without any brows in the void behind him!This nearly illusory eyes were staring at Old Neil intently, as well as him!This\u2026 Klein shuddered as he gapped and said, \u201cYou have a pair of eyes behind you!\u201dOld Neil was taken aback before he forced a smile.\u201cIgnore them.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 - SwitchPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 33: SwitchTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosThe moment Old Neil finished his sentence, the illusory pair of eyes that lurked in the darkness behind him vanished. Even in his Spirit Vision state, Klein was no longer able to identify traces of its existence.\u201cThis is a characteristic of ritualistic magic,\u201d explained Old Neil with a chuckle.Fascinating\u2026 Is Spirit Vision an enhanced version of Yin-Yang eyes? Klein felt like a child who had received a new toy. In excitement, he turned his gaze way and began observing every corner of the room. He wanted to see the differences of the alchemy room with and without the Spirit Vision.The outlines of the objects in the dark such as the tables, test tubes, scales, cups, and cupboards did not look different from how it looked like without Spirit Vision. They did not emit any lights or colors.Objects without lives do not have any spirituality? Klein mumbled to himself as he swept his gaze toward the silver chest.Suddenly, he saw a vibrancy of colors. The colors were as blue as the sky, as resplendent as the stars, or as crimson red as burning flames!\u201cMaterials from extraordinary beings still have some life in them, and uh\u2026 are still active? Even if the source is already dead?\u201d Klein deliberated on his words as he sought Old Neil\u2019s help.\u201cA precise description is that they have remnant spiritualities. It is one of the crucial points of a successful potion concoction. It is also one the reasons why a Beyonder will lose control. Dunn should have already informed you,\u201d explained Old Neil frankly.He suddenly laughed, having recalled something.\u201cI remember that the formula of Corpse Collector requires a desiccated mature black-spotted frog. To consume that potion requires a lot of courage.\u201dKlein imagined a little and found it disgusting. He did not echo Old Neil\u2019s words and turned his gaze to a dark area. However, there were no spiritual bodies or ghosts that he looked forward to seeing.\u201cIsn\u2019t it said that the world of spirits is everywhere?\u201d he asked out of curiosity.Old Neil chuckled tersely before saying, \u201cPunk, repeat after me.\u201cThis is the headquarters of a Nighthawk squad. This is the ground beneath the Church of the Evernight Goddess. There are many Beyonders in here!\u201cDo you think we will allow spirits and souls to wander around in here? Furthermore, the spiritual world and spirit are two different concepts.\u201dKlein felt a little embarrassed as he turned his head, pretending to look at the faint light from the gas lamps at the entrance.\u201cI get it.\u201dWhile speaking, the area between his brows began to spasm.What\u2019s happening? Just as Klein turned around to ask, he suddenly saw a figure standing quietly by the door at the periphery of the light. It appeared human, though its aura\u2019s colors and the darkness blended perfectly, making it impossible to discern.Hiss!Klein felt a painful spasm at his\u00a0glabella <sup>1</sup> . His vision turned chaotic as he focused his attention again, but there was no \u201cformless\u201d figure!Strange\u2026 He turned around and asked.\u201cMr. Neil, the spot in between my brows is a little painful from spasms.\u201d\u201cHaha, this is very common. You are a new Beyonder. Spirit Vision places a great burden on your Spirit Body. Furthermore, it drains you constantly. Physical effects can be glabella spasms, headaches, oversensitivity, and minor bouts of hallucinations. And while viewing things with Spirit Vision, it\u2019s very easy to feel uncomfortable as a result of the unfamiliar surroundings. It\u2019s also very easy to have your emotions affected by others. These are things that require you to pay attention. You can become accustomed to and eliminate them with repeated practice. In addition, use it sparingly and end it in a timely fashion,\u201d answered Old Neil with a smile.Why does it feel like you are delighted by this\u2026 Klein hurriedly asked for advice, \u201cThen, how do I exit from the state of having Spirit Vision?\u201dHe had planned on mentioning the invisible figure he had seen, though when he heard of the minor bouts of hallucination among the symptoms, he struck that thought away.From the glabella spasm and headache, he could completely guess Old Neil\u2019s answer!\u201cLike before, think of an item to divert your attention. It will bring you out of Cogitation. Close your eyes and control your spirituality and repeatedly tell it to end. When you open your eyes again, you will discover that your Spirit Vision has ended.\u201dOld Neil described leisurely and when he was done, added, \u201cOf course, that is the most trivial and clumsy method. We can repeatedly hint to ourselves in Cogitation from practice to affect our spirituality. That way, you will have a simple switch. For instance, tapping at your glabella twice lightly would allow you easily activate Spirit Vision. Another two taps will simply end it. As for how you set it up, it depends on your habits and preferences.\u201cGot it.\u201d Klein thought for a moment and planned to imitate Old Neil to use tapping his glabella twice as a switch for his Spirit Vision.Tapping once was easily mistaken as an instinctive knock to his head and tapping thrice could be a waste of valuable time in dangerous situations. As for actions like snapping fingers, they were too attention-drawing.He eased his focus and imagined the stacked spheres of light and re-entered a state of Cogitation.Under Old Neil\u2019s guidance, after repeated hints and practice, he finally 'set up\u201d his 'switch.\u201dHe clenched his fist slightly and used his index finger\u2019s joint to tap at his glabella twice. Immediately, there were glowing auras of differing thickness and colors appearing before his eyes.After another two taps, everything returned to normal.\u201cI\u2019ve finally grasped it\u2026\u201d he sighed with delight.Only then did he realize how exhausted he was, feeling like he could fall asleep at any time. His mind hurt as though he had stayed up for three nights.Old Neil said with a chuckle, \u201cWe are not Sleepless. Every practice and every time Spirit Vision is used excessively, you will need some sleep. You can now go back and have a good rest. In the afternoon, go to Iron Cross Street where Welch\u2019s place is and walk around. Try your best to find clues about the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook as soon as possible. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll continue teaching you about mysticism. Of course, do not forget to read the historical documents.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein was in full agreement with Old Neil\u2019s arrangements.He picked up his cane and left the alchemy room. He watched the door close as Old Neil returned to the armory. Klein massaged his glabella and temples and with the help of his cane, sauntered up the stairwell.At that moment, Dunn Smith came from behind him with the corners of his lips hooked. With a deep gaze, he said, \u201cI heard from Old Neil that you are a very suitable candidate. Even without Cogitation, you were able to use Spirit Vision.\u201d\u201cPerhaps, it\u2019s a unique trait of being a Seer,\u201d replied Klein humbly.He guessed that Dunn had been watching the armory for Old Neil.Dunn slowed down and went ahead of Klein a little. After a few seconds of silence, he turned around and said, \u201cYou have to remember that curiosity killed the cat. It can also kill Beyonders. Do not attempt to probe the murmurings you should not be listening or see existences you should not see.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein knew this was another reminder of how Beyonders lost control.After entering Blackthorn Security Company, he greeted Rozanne who obviously did not know that he had become a Beyonder. He slowly walked out the door and reached the streets where he took a trackless carriage to Daffodil Street. He nearly fell asleep on his return journey.It was still in the morning and the temperature was about twenty-six degree Celsius. Klein pulled out a copper key from his waistband and opened the door to his home.There were still many items missing from his home. The living room and dining hall were still empty. Benson and Melissa had work or school, so they had both left early in the morning.Klein did not have the capacity to bother with anything else. He closed the door and briskly went to the second floor and entered the bookshelf-equipped bedroom that belonged to him.After taking off his tuxedo and hanging it on a clothing rack, he eagerly plunged into bed. The moment his head hit the pillow, he fell asleep.Klein was awoken by bright sunlight. He turned his head and slowly opened his eyes to discover the burning sun outside.\u201cWhat time is it? Did I miss the Tarot Club in the afternoon?\u201d He struggled to get up and walked to the clothing rack to take out his pocket watch from the pocket of the tuxedo\u2019s inner lining.Not only had he forgotten about the matter, he had forgotten to close the door to his bedroom and pulled the curtains to the oriel window.Pa!Klein pulled out the pocket watch and immediately felt relieved when he opened it.It was only slightly past noon. There was still a lot of time until the scheduled gathering at three in the afternoon.It was Monday, the day he would have a gathering with The Hanged Man and Justice.Klein went into thought as he tapped his glabella twice. The scene before him changed once again as he saw that his body had restored to a bright luster.He tapped twice again and stopped his Spirit Vision. Relaxed, he went to the first floor and boiled a kettle of water. He placed some inferior-quality tea leaves and chewed on some rye bread dabbed in a little butter.Afterwards, Klein flipped through historical materials and original Klein\u2019s diary. He began \u2018revising\u2019 and consolidating his knowledge.\u2026At 2:57pm, Klein closed his book and capped his fountain pen before pulling the curtains.Immediately following that, he locked the bedroom\u2019s door, making the room turn abnormally dark.He tapped his glabella twice and activated Spirit Vision to survey his surroundings.After confirming that there were no invisible spiritual bodies in his room, Klein stopped the Spirit Vision and took out his pocket watch to check the time.Tick-tock. Tick-tock.One minute before three, he opened up his pace and like before, walked four steps in a counter-clockwise manner in a squarish shape. He incanted in Chinese softly.Only this time, he did not prepare any staple food.Klein closed his eyes as he felt the back of his hands turn itchy. It felt like the four black docks forming a square was protruding and projecting something.Hysterical shouts and alluring murmurs began resounding, but Klein realized that the headache was not as bad as the first time.It was not that he was unaffected, but that he was doing his best to stop himself from listening.As a Beyonder, he had to have more self-control in such an environment.Soon, his body turned light as he floated up. He saw the grayish-white and blurry fog that emanated. Then, he saw dark red \u2018stars.\u2019 Two of them had a minuscule connection with him with an abnormal sense of familiarity.Klein looked at his blurry self and muttered in confusion, \u201cThe Astral Projection that Old Neil mentioned?\u201dHe remained calm for a few seconds and again transformed the opulent divine palace with the tall bronze table under the domed ceiling, as well as the twenty-two high-back chairs that corresponded to the different constellations.Klein calmly walked to the Seat of Honor and made his body and face be immersed in thicker gray fog. He extended his right hand and tapped two familiar deep-red stars and created a miraculous connection.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The dim, yellowish flame\u2019s flickering made the shadows of the objects and table move like a mirage.Alger\u2019s hair was disheveled like seaweed with a deep blue color that resembled black. He wore a robe with lightning patterns embroidered on it. He clasped his hands with his thumbs facing each other while he focused on a bottle of black liquid to the left of the candle.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Splash! Splash! Splash!The sound of tempestuous winds or the crashing of the sea waves howled from inside the sealed bottle. And in spots where the black ink did not sink, a faint fog would swirl. It was as though it grew eyes and a mouth.Alger cocked his head to glance at the clock hanging on the wall and watched the needle strike three.He pressed down on his temple as his eyes turned dark. Fascinating colors surfaced from the various items on the table.At that moment, he discovered a deep-red light appear like a tidal wave from nowhere, drowning him instantly!\u2026Backlund, Empress Borough, Inside the Hall family\u2019s luxurious mansion.After dismissing her dance teacher, Audrey locked the door and sat straight up in front of her dressing table.The sun outside was bright and gorgeous. There was a light-brown notebook made of exquisite goat skin. It was flipped open to reveal that it was blank. To its right was a fountain pen with a golden tip and embedded rubies.Audrey did a test and made sure that she could pick up the fountain pen and write down the formula the moment she left the Gathering.\u201cI\u2019m so looking forward to it\u2026\u201d She inhaled to repress her excited emotions as she looked at the mirror with puckered lips.However, she did not see it reflect herself. Instead, a dark red and illusory beam burst out from her body!\u2026Above the gray fog stood a majestic divine hall that looked like a giant\u2019s residence.Dark red colors bloomed on both sides of the bronze table. They surged upwards like a fountain before pattering down. It \u2018carved\u2019 two blurry figures who sat in the same spots as before.Audrey, with her soft blond hair and tall, slim build, instinctively looked towards the Seat of Honor. She saw the figure immersed in thick gray fog sitting back. One hand was flat, touching the table\u2019s side while the other hand was stroking his chin.\u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Fool~!\u201d Audrey shouted with a cheery voice.Following that, she turned her head and looked at the person opposite her. With the same tone, she said, \u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Hanged Man~!\u201dThis lady sure is unsophisticated. Is she so sure that I\u2019m a good person? Why isn\u2019t there any fear from her? Is she a noble lady who has been protected well? Klein smiled and maintained his unfathomable image.\u201cGood afternoon, Miss Justice.\u201dAs he spoke, he lowered his head slightly and moved his left hand and tapped his glabella twice.What he saw changed instantly. He saw Justice and The Hanged Man emit the colors of their aura!And the surrounding gray fog and dark red stars remained the same. Nothing that seemingly did not exist or lustrous brilliances that possessed life was seen.He shifted his gaze and saw that Justice\u2019s aura perfectly matched the colors Old Neil described. What was supposed to be red, purple, blue, or white were their respective colors. Furthermore, they maintained a lustrous brilliance and were of appropriate thickness. It was easy to tell that she was a vibrant young girl.The colors of her emotions are red and yellow. That\u2019s joy, zeal, and excitement\u2026 Klein made a judgment before casting his attention towards The Hanged Man.Like Justice, there was nothing special about the colors of The Hanged Man\u2019s aura. His emotions were blue mixed in with some orange.Calm, thoughtful, careful, and a little pleased? With this being his first attempt, Klein made a conclusion without much confidence.Just as he shifted his gaze away, he suddenly realized something strange.The aura of the Hanged Man\u2019s innermost layer was nearly of the same color!Klein focused his mind and took another careful look. He could faintly see that deep within The Hanged Man\u2019s Ether Body was a deep blue, akin to the sea. It felt like a tidal storm.His Astral Projection? Or should I say the surface of his Astral Projection? From the looks of it, he\u2019s really a Beyonder, and one that\u2019s apparently stronger than Old Neil. Klein analyzed as his mind was filled with questions. \u201cNot necessary. It might have to do with this being a unique environment. It\u2019s only because this is my home ground that I\u2019m able to see these things that Old Neil did not manifest.\u201dHe turned his head toward Justice again and confirmed that it was a characteristic only Beyonders possessed.At that moment, Alger also completed his greetings.Audrey drew a light gasp as she asked in anticipation, \u201cMr. Hanged Man, did you receive the box of Ghost Shark blood?\u201dAlger took a look at Klein and saw him tapping his glabella as though he was considering other matters.\u201cThank you very much. It perfectly met my expectations. I never expected you to send it to me so quickly. The Ghost Shark blood is not the typical extraordinary creature,\u201d said Alger frankly.Audrey smiled humbly and said, \u201cI\u2019m very happy to see this outcome.\u201dAs she loved anything to do with mystery from a young age, she had befriended those in aristocratic circles with similar interests. They have exchanged information, books, and rare artifacts among each other. But before this, none of them had ever obtained any supernatural power to become a real Beyonder. Instead, there were a few princes that hinted that they could gift them what they wanted if they became their princess consort.However, she had obtained the Ghost Shark blood directly from her family\u2019s vault. After all, the inventory only states \u2018one big bottle,\u2019 without mentioning how many milliliters or how full it had to be, she believed that pouring a little bit of it would go unnoticed. Even if there was an accident and the matter was exposed, her parents were unlikely to pursue the matter.Alger looked deeply at The Fool who was enveloped in fog before turning his head back with a smile.\u201cAccording to our agreement, I will tell you the formula to the potion, Spectator.\u201d\u201cLet me prepare myself. Alright, begin.\u201d Audrey inhaled as she focused her full attention.\u201cLow-Sequence potions are very easy to concoct. Just follow the order that I provide you. Do remember that there can be smaller quantities of the ingredients but not more. It would cause major problems. You should have heard about news of Beyonders losing control. I believe there\u2019s no need for me to repeat it?\u201d Alger first mentioned things to take note of.Audrey nodded gently and said, \u201cI understand completely.\u201dWhile she spoke, she turned her head to look at Mr. Fool. She wished to know if the mystery expert had anything to add; unfortunately, The Fool was sitting silently there like a statue.Alger thought for a moment before saying, \u201cHaving smaller quantities does not mean it should deviate by too much\u2026 If you do not have an assistant, I suggest you spend some time familiarizing yourself with chemistry experiment.\u201d\u201cI have a family tutor for such matters,\u201d answered Audrey without feeling the burden.After Alger mentioned the furthest extent of the deviation, he recited with great fluency, \u201cSpectator. Sequence 9 potion. 80 milliliters of pure water. 5 drops of autumn crocus essence. 13 grams of cow teeth paeonol powder. 7 petals of elf flowers. A matured Manhal Fish\u2019s eyeball. Add 35 milliliters of goat-horned black fish blood.\u201cThe final two items are the main ingredients. They are extraordinary creatures from the sea. You have to be careful.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Audrey recalled and repeated, \u201c80 milliliters of pure water. 5 drops of autumn crocus essence, 13 grams of cow teeth\u2026\u201d\u201cPaeonol powder,\u201d reminded Alger.With his help, Audrey gradually and precisely memorized the formula\u2019s order. However, she appeared worried as she mumbled it again and again.\u201cDo you know about Cogitation?\u201d When Alger saw Justice nod, he continued, \u201cI do not know how much you know about Cogitation. Let me describe it once\u2026 After consuming the potion, quickly begin Cogitation to control your spirituality and energy\u2026 Make sure to practice every day to truly grasp the powers of the potion. Dig out the meaning it symbolizes and even more of its mysteries. That way, you can avoid the danger of losing control to the greatest extent. And the meaning of a potion mainly lies in its name, such as Spectator!\u201dKlein silently listened to the conversation and had no plans on interrupting. All he did was secretly memorize and study, but when he heard that, he suddenly had a thought.Audrey listened to The Hanged Man\u2019s explanations attentively, and just as she was about to inquire about something more detailed, she suddenly heard the rapping sound on the table,She and Alger turned their heads and looked at The Fool. They realized that the mysterious and mighty figure was tapping gently with his fingers. He said in a deep voice, \u201cIt\u2019s not about grasping them, but rather digesting them.\u201cIt\u2019s not about discovery, but rather acting.\u201cThe name of a potion is not only symbolic, it\u2019s also imagery. It is the key to digesting.\u201dAudrey was dazed and confused from hearing that. She was not very clear on what Mr. Fool was trying to express.She subconsciously eyed The Hanged Man for a reaction from the corner of her eyes. She was surprised to see him jolt and freeze. It was as though an ordinary person had heard a loud and sudden clap of thunder.\u201cDigesting, acting\u2026 Digesting, acting\u2026 Digesting, acting, key\u2026\u201d Alger repeated it again and again softly as though he had grasped a key concept or had succumbed to a strange curse.After a while, he raised his head and said with a hoarse voice, \u201cThank you, Mr. Fool. Your hint is as valuable as my life. You have enlightened me greatly. Of course, I believe I have yet to fully understand or comprehend it.\u201dKlein maintained his mysterious and unfathomable image by saying with a smile, \u201cThat was an advance payment.\u201dIn fact, he did not truly understand the exact meaning of what was said. He was just certain that Emperor Roselle was more powerful than the typical Beyonder and stronger than The Hanged Man.\u201dAdvance payment\u2026 Audrey looked at The Hanged Man\u2019s reaction and knew that the hint from before was precious. As she ruminated over it, she asked, \u201cMr. Fool, what do you wish for us to do?\u201dOpposite to her, Alger said with a nod, \u201cWhat matter might you wish to entrust us with?\u201dKlein leaned back slightly as he glanced at the two of them before saying in a soft and pleasant voice, \u201cCollect Roselle Gustav\u2019s secret diary on my behalf, even if it\u2019s just one page of it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was said that the secret cards he created hid the twenty-two paths of the divine. This was something every high-Sequence Beyonder would definitely pay attention to!\u201cDiary? That\u2019s a diary?\u201d Alger frowned slightly as he keenly noticed this tidbit.The item which Roselle Gustav had left behind had been described by Mr. Fool as a diary!How did he know?How did he determine it?Could he know the way to decipher Roselle\u2019s cryptic text?Faced with The Hanged Man\u2019s question and having obtained the desired effect, Klein leaned back into his chair and interlocked his hands. He answered in a relaxed manner, \u201cLet us first view it as a diary for now.\u201dHe did not deny or confirm it.Audrey had heard the children of other nobles mention the matter. However, she had never really learned much of it. With her curiosity piqued, she asked, \u201cIt\u2019s said that Emperor Roselle\u2019s, well, diary was written in a cryptic language or symbols he invented.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d answered Alger simply. \u201cSome people believe that it is a unique set of symbols from mysticism. Others believe that it is a hieroglyph. But up to today, no one has found the correct way of deciphering it. At the very least, that\u2019s all I know.\u201dWith that said, he turned his head at Klein in a bid to get some confirmation or show his suspicions.They are texts that have been passed down for generations, so are no longer in their original state. According to your line of thought, how can it be deciphered\u2026 Klein maintained his calm as he secretly gave a self-deprecating laugh.As for how to handle the symbols of mysticism, he instantly thought of a ridiculous and funny scene.Dressed in a black-pointed hat and long robe, an evil mage pulls up his sleeve to reveal a symbol tattooed on his arm. It was said that this was a symbol with mysterious power left behind by Emperor Roselle. They were written in two blue, large simplified Chinese characters:\u201cRetarded Joker!\u201dThe corners of Klein\u2019s mouth curved up slowly as he found himself in a good mood.After hearing The Hanged Man\u2019s description, Audrey said in a stumped manner, \u201cWe can\u2019t understand the symbols or the words\u2026 Then, how are we to pass the information to you, Mr. Fool? Or are we to mail it somewhere?\u201dThis is quite an important question\u2026 I do not have the means to accept an item secretly\u2026 Klein was in no hurry to answer. His repeatedly released his thumbs from his interlocked hands before tapping them back again.Soon, he thought of a solution.Since I can create a divine palace and table according to my wishes in here, would it be possible to project the content in the minds of others here?I\u2019ll give it a try\u2026At that moment, Audrey and Alger saw Mr. Fool slowly sit up amid the thick grayish fog.\u201cMiss Justice, let us give it a try. Imagine a paragraph of text and give it the emotions of writing it with urgency. Yes, pick up the fountain pen beside you and write on the piece of paper.\u201dBefore Klein finished his sentence, Audrey saw a piece of yellowish-brown goatskin parchment and a dark red fountain pen in front of her.She picked up the fountain pen both curiously and doubtfully. In accordance with the instructions, she imagined a poem Emperor Roselle once wrote:\u201cIf Winter comes, can Spring be far\u00a0behind <sup>1</sup> ?\u201dAfter scrutinizing the text, she picked up her fountain pen and imbued them with the desire of projecting them out.Klein sensed the emotions and using the fountain pen as a medium, he guided her.The moment Audrey landed her fountain pen, she saw a line appear on the goatskin parchment.\u201cIf Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?\u201d\u201cGoddess, how fascinating!\u201d Audrey exclaimed in astonishment while feeling rueful.Following that, she looked at Klein with some fear.\u201cMr. Fool, can you read what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m only guiding you. I simplified the process of writing for you and made it become an imprint. If you did not wish to express it, nothing would appear.\u201d Klein placated her with a low tone.\u201cIs that so\u2026 Then we can only memorize the symbols or the way the cryptic text looks like. Then, we can present it directly as we wish?\u201d Audrey heaved a sigh of relief as she asked in enlightenment.\u201cYes.\u201d Klein answered.\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad method. Miss Justice, do not doubt your memory. After becoming a Spectator, you will receive immense improvement in this aspect.\u201d Alger had watched the attempt from the side, fully coming to the realization that The Fool was more powerful and mysterious than he imagined.As for his memory, he believed that the next advancement would improve it sufficiently.Regarding this, Audrey nodded in delight.\u201cYou have delighted me with this reminder. Mr. Hanged Man, do you have any other guidance on Spectators?\u201dWith that said, she looked toward the Seat of Honor.\u201cMr. Fool, I will work hard to complete your mission. I will do my best to gather more of Emperor Roselle\u2019s secret diary.\u201d\u201cI mentioned before that I\u2019m a person who likes a fair and equal exchange. The advanced payment I gave is only equivalent to two pages of the diary for each person. If there are more, I will give additional in return,\u201d Klein said calmly, like he was an adult who did not take advantage of children.As for where the additional payment could come from, it was naturally from the newly acquired Emperor Roselle diary pages. This formed a virtuous cycle.\u201cYou are truly a generous gentleman.\u201d Alger fell silent for a few seconds before bowing slightly with his hand by his chest.After the bow, he turned to Justice and said, \u201cLet me emphasize once more. A Spectator will forever be a spectator.\u201cI know that many Spectators enjoy imagining themselves to be the protagonist or some other character. As a result, they invest a lot of feelings into it, to the point of crying, laughing, raging, and turning sorrowful because of the drama. However, that is not what a Spectator should do.\u201cWhile faced with the various dramas of society and figures who knowingly or unknowingly act the role of particular characters, you have to maintain the attitude of being an absolute bystander. Only then can you calmly and objectively observe them. You will discover their habits, their tics from lying, or their scent of nervousness. From those minute clues, you can grasp their true thoughts.\u201cBelieve me, everyone is different because of their emotions. They will secrete different \u2018things\u2019 and different smells. However, only a real Spectator can sniff it out.\u201cOnce you invest too many of your emotions, your observation will be influenced. Your sensitivity towards the emotions of others will deviate.\u201dAudrey listened attentively as her eyes brightened gradually.\u201cIt sounds, really, really interesting!\u201dKlein\u2019s heart stirred when he heard that.The Spectator potion\u2019s requirement when summarized seemed to be \u201can absolutely objective and neutral spectator.\u201dIn a particular sense, it was equivalent to acting\u2026Acting?Was this the \u2018acting\u2019 which Emperor Roselle was referring to?Then, I will have to act as a Seer, and from there, digest the potion bit by bit?Just as Klein was immersing himself in thought, Alger finished explaining the demands he knew of a Spectator. He sighed before saying, \u201cIt seems like there\u2019s nothing else?\u201cPerhaps we can have a casual chat. We can talk about things happening around us. Perhaps it is something very normal to you, but in the ears of others, it might be a very important clue.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Klein snapped back and nodded slightly.He was already planning to attempt to act as a Seer. After all, it did not seem like there were any negative effects from doing so.\u201cThen, shall we begin with you, Mr. Hanged Man?\u201d Audrey agreed in excitement.Alger thought for a moment before saying, \u201cThe infamous pirate who calls himself Lieutenant General Deweyville has begun his voyage to explore the eastern end of the Sonia Sea again.\u201d\u201cOh? The owner of the Black Tulip?\u201d returned Audrey with a question after some thought.\u201cYes,\u201d Alger replied with a nod.I don\u2019t even know who that is\u2026 Klein listened silently while he pondered over the news he planned on sharing. It had to be something that did not expose him while also allowing him to gain feedback.Soon, he decided. He maintained his unfathomable image as The Fool and caressed the side of the bronze table with his fingers.\u201cAccording to what I know, the Secret Order has lost an Antigonus family notebook.\u201dThis news was not only known by the Nighthawks from Tingen City. The Secret Order as well as Beyonders with close ties with them similarly knew.\u201cAn Antigonus family notebook?\u201d Alger repeated before smiling with a shake of his head. \u201cI\u2019m really curious as to what reaction the Church of the Evernight Goddess will have if they learn of it.\u201dWhy would he mention the Church of the Evernight Goddess? Klein acutely sensed a problem, but it was not appropriate for him to ask.That would shatter his image as the mysterious and profound Fool.At that moment, Audrey asked out of curiosity, \u201cWhy are you curious? What sort of special reaction would the Goddess\u2019s church have?\u201dAlger smiled and said, \u201cThe Antigonus family was destroyed by the Church of the Evernight Goddess.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not really sure if it happened at the end of the Fourth Epoch or the early stages of the present epoch.\u201dThis\u2026 Klein\u2019s pupils constricted as a chill suddenly swept through him.From the looks of it, the value the Nighthawks have placed on this Antigonus notebook far exceeds my imagination!The reason why they nominated me as a Beyonder\u2014having some contribution and to prevent danger to me are likely negligible reasons\u2014is that they wish for me to raise my spiritual sensitivity to aid them in finding the notebook.This was not kept from me by Captain. He had mentioned it, but I just didn\u2019t pay much attention to it\u2026After hearing The Hanged Man\u2019s explanation, Audrey said with deep interest, \u201cI never imagined that such a thing would happen\u2026\u201cAlright, my turn. Let me think of what I have to share.\u201dShe cocked her head and held her head up with her hand before chuckling.\u201cYesterday, my etiquette teacher taught me how to faint, how to faint elegantly without any faux paus. It\u2019s a practical skill used at social events to avoid awkward situations or nasty guys\u2026 Heh heh. I was just organizing my thoughts. What I really wanted to say is that ever since the failure of the battle on Balam\u2019s eastern shore, the king, premier, and gentlemen are under immense stress. They eagerly wish to change.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 - A Simple QuestionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 36: A Simple QuestionTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosWhile Audrey recalled the conversation between her father and elder brother about the situation, she put in her own words, \u201cThey believe that the government\u2019s structure is too chaotic. Every election, if there is a change of the ruling party, there will be a change of personnel from top to bottom. It makes things a mess and lowers efficiency tremendously. Not only does it cause the battle loss, it also brings great inconvenience to the civilians.\u201dKlein knew very well that as there was no example to reference, the Loen Kingdom had yet to evolve into a system that examined public servants. The political situation was still in its preliminary stages; therefore, after every election victory, many so-called positions would be awarded to members and supporters.Hmm, Emperor Roselle not establishing such an institution in Intis does not match his personality\u2026 Could it be that he diverted his focus to other things later in life?When the Hanged Man, Alger, heard that he interjected with a soft chuckle.\u201cThey believe? Then their beliefs are a little slow. Perhaps they will only feel the itch a year after they get bitten by black mosquitoes.\u201dBlack mosquitoes were a type of creature that resided in the south of the Loen Kingdom. It was extremely venomous, and its venom made victims have the urge to rip apart their skin.Audrey extended her palm and covered her mouth. Ignoring the Hanged Man\u2019s mockery, she expressed the core information of what she said, \u201cUnfortunately, they are temporarily unable to find a good solution to replace this system.\u201dKlein listened carefully and felt that the topic was in the domain of his expertise. He smiled faintly and said, \u201cThis is a simple problem.\u201dThe Foodaholic Empire and the decadent countries that studied the Foodaholic Empire had very advanced experiences of success.\u201cSimple?\u201d Audrey returned with a question in puzzlement.Although her education did not include politics, she often heard from the discussions of her father, brother, and people around her. She had a sufficient understanding of similar matters.Klein felt as though he had returned to the message boards of yesteryear. Composed, he said, \u201cAn examination, just like an entrance-examination for college. Hold an exam that is open to the public. It can be split into two rounds or three rounds. Use the most objective method to select the elite.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Audrey knew what sort of objection this would entail.Before she had the chance to arrange her thoughts, Klein continued, \u201cAfter which, use these elites to fill the positions of the Cabinet, the county government, the city government, and the various towns. Yes, the positions that are directly handling matters, such as the Secretary of the Cabinet.\u201cDifferent positions should be given different requirements. The second or third rounds can be tested based on locale and region. Professional matters should be left to the professionals.\u201cAs for political positions such as ministers, governors or mayors, they will be left to the parties that win the election. That is a slice of the pie they deserve.\u201dAlger, who lacked interest in such matters, unknowingly turned his head and listened carefully. Audrey frowned slightly as she fell into deep thought.\u201cThere\u2019s no hurry in replacing everyone at once. The cabinet and various agencies in the civil service will be crippled if that happens. You can have an examination every year or every three years. They can be gradually replaced. Finally, in light of the kingdom\u2019s expansion and the salaried civil servants\u2019 resignations that will bring in vacancies, you can systematically allot spots.\u201d Klein fully expressed his talent as a keyboard politician. He then faced his palm outwards and said, \u201cSuch a design can bring the kingdom\u2019s insightful elites into the government. Regardless of the party in power or who the minister is, the civil service will allow the kingdom to maintain its basic and effective operations.\u201dOf course, a side effect was the birth of the undying devil that was bureaucracy.While considering the suggestion, Audrey asked doubtfully, \u201cAre you implying that even if those ministers become monkeys, the effects would be insignificant?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Alger interjected suddenly. \u201cI believe that monkeys are a better choice than the present ministers.\u201dHe paused before adding, \u201cAfter all, monkeys only need to eat, sleep, and mate. They would not come up with foolish ideas and insist on brainless projects.\u201dMr. Hanged Man, it sounds you have quite a terrible superior\u2026 Klein sat at his seat of honor and shook his head in silent amusement.Audrey ruminated over the suggestion Mr. Fool had offered and after a while, said in surprise, \u201cIt sounds like it actually might work\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s a very simple but effective solution!\u201dShe looked at Klein and sincerely marveled, \u201cMr. Fool, you must be an elderly person with outstanding intelligence who is very experienced in life!\u201d\u2026 The corners of Klein\u2019s mouth twitched a little as he looked at the Hanged Man and Justice for a few silent seconds.\u201cLet us end today\u2019s gathering here.\u201dIf Miss Justice is able to influence her family and effect change on this matter, I can guide Benson ahead of time and give him a chance at becoming a civil servant.On careful thought, Benson was indeed suitable for such a career.However, it is unlikely Justice would take the initiative to do it. This is because the Hanged Man and I can easily find out which noble suggested it and basically guess her identity.Of course, she could do it through a roundabout manner secretly.\u201cBy your will.\u201d Audrey and Alger stood up together.Klein leaned back slightly and severed the connection. He saw Justice and the Hanged Man\u2019s illusory and blurry figures instantly shatter and dissipate.Above the gray fog, in the opulent palace where gods seemingly lived, he was the only one sitting silently at the head of the bronze table.Klein did not plunge into the gray fog like the other time to leave. This was because his mind was still energetic enough after becoming a Beyonder.The reason why he had ended the Tarot Club early was because he learned the true attitude the Nighthawks had towards the Antigonus notebook. He decided that he had to search for it seriously and not sleep all the way. Doing so would make Dunn Smith suspicious of his activities at home.Furthermore, he had benefited quite a lot this time.Klein sat on the high-back chair at the head of the bronze table. His arms leaned on the armrest as he crossed his fingers while he observed the boundless gray fog carefully. He found the place serene as though no one had stepped into it for ten million years.When he established the connection to summon the Hanged Man and Justice, he acutely noticed something.That was the fact that as a Beyonder himself, he had the ability to touch another dark red star!\u201cDoes this mean I can summon one more?\u201d Klein recalled the feeling and muttered in confirmation.However, he did not have the urge to make an attempt since he did not know what the identity of the newcomer would be or what sort of attitude they would have. After all, not everyone was like Justice or the Hanged Man who had unique personalities that easily blended in and took whatever they needed. They even seemed willing to conceal matters. If he pulled someone like Dunn Smith, then the mysterious organization he had just established would instantly come under the watch of the church.As an \u201cevil\u201d organization\u2019s boss, his future would be worrying.Klein knew that the gray fog was special. He knew it was not something a Beyonder at Dunn Smith\u2019s Sequence could see through. But the problem was that since he had the powers of a Beyonder, he had to consider the existence of the gods.Klein had chosen to carefully believe that the seven orthodox gods existed in reality. Of course, he was more tenable to the belief that these gods were just more powerful than high-Sequence Beyonders. Furthermore, they were under strict limitations. At the very least, ever since the Fifth Epoch, apart from a few oracles, they have not appeared again.\u201cHeh, forcefully pulling people here isn\u2019t a good thing. No one would wish to be pulled into mystery for some baffling reason\u2026 Let\u2019s wait and see how things go in the future\u2026\u201d Klein sighed and stood up.He released his spirituality and sensed his body\u2019s existence. Then, he began imitating the heavy feeling of rapidly plunging down.The scenes in front of him changed. The gray fog and dark red instantly departed him. Klein felt like he had torn through endless water membranes before ultimately seeing the real world, his room in darkness.This time, he was fully awake and seriously took in the entire experience.\u201cStrange\u2026 There are some differences between the gray fog and the spirit world\u2026\u201d Klein moved his limbs and felt the existence of his body.After he seriously thought through the experience, he shook his head, walked to the desk and pulled open the curtains.Whoosh!The curtains were drawn as sunlight poured in, illuminating the room.As he looked at the street outside the oriel window and the pedestrians going back and forth, Klein took a deep breath and muttered silently, \u201cIt\u2019s time to go out and work.\u201cHow should I act as a Seer?\u201d\u201cIt cannot be rushed\u2026 All I can do is use Spirit Vision now\u2026\u201d\u2026Backlund, Empress Borough.Audrey Hall looked at herself in the mirror. She saw her cheeks flushed red with excitement and her eyes, so bright that they would have daunted anyone from looking into them.She did not examine any of this as she hurriedly recalled. She picked up the ruby-studded fountain pen and wrote the formula to the Spectator potion on the exquisite goatskin parchment.\u201c80 milliliters of pure water. 5 drops of autumn crocus essence, 13 grams of cow teeth paeonol powder. 7 petals of elf flowers. A matured Manhal Fish\u2019s eyeball. 35 milliliters of goat-horned black fish blood.\u201dPhew\u2026 Audrey heaved a sigh of relief as she read it a few times to confirm that she had not made any mistakes.She had the urge to dance again, but reminded herself to remain restrained.After some thought, she began writing various chemical names around the potion\u2019s formula. She then faked the page into complicated and messy chemistry.Yes, as long as one doesn\u2019t read it carefully, a person who flips through this randomly will not discover the details I have hidden in here\u2026 Excellent! Audrey praised herself and turned her mind towards the acquirement of the materials.\u201cI\u2019ll first search the few vaults we have. I\u2019ll then attempt to exchange for the missing parts with others\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I still can\u2019t gather them all, I can only seek help from the Hanged Man or the Fool\u2026 What can I offer as payment?\u201dAfter some thought, Audrey closed the notebook and placed it on a tiny bookshelf. Following that, she briskly walked to the door and pulled it open.A golden retriever was sitting obediently outside.The corners of Audrey\u2019s mouth curled as she revealed a radiant smile.\u201cSusie, you completed the mission perfectly!\u201d\u201cIn the serialized stories on the newspapers, detectives would often have a capable assistant. I think there should be a huge dog supporting a real Spectator~\u201d\u2026In an underground basement lit only by a flickering candle, Alger Wilson raised his palm and looked at it carefully.After a long while, he let out a sigh.\u201cIt\u2019s still that miraculous. I was unable to figure out any specific details at all\u2026\u201dDespite having made sufficient preparations, he failed to understand how the Fool had completed the summoning\u2026He moved his gaze down and looked at the goatskin parchment on the table in front of him.At the title head of the yellowish-brown parchment, there was a Hermes sentence written in dark blue ink.\u201c7.

    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 - The ClubPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 37: The ClubTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosUnder the scorching afternoon sun, Klein left his house.Since he had to walk all the way from Iron Cross Street to Welch\u2019s place, he wore a linen shirt instead of his formal attire of top hat and leather boots. He wore a matching brown coat, a round felt hat and a pair of old leather shoes. That way, he did not need to worry that the stench of his sweat would contaminate the rather expensive suit.As he went down Daffodil Street, he strolled toward Iron Cross Street. When he passed by the square around the corner, he subconsciously took a glance.The tents had already vanished. The circus troupe from before had left after finishing their performance.Klein originally imagined the animal trainer who had helped him tell his fortune to be a hidden expert. He believed she had purposely appeared to guide him after discovering something unique about him and that she would meet him and provide hints for the future. However, none of that happened. She left for the next stop in the tour with the circus troupe.How can there be so many cliched tropes\u2026 Klein shook his head while grimacing a smile. He turned toward Iron Cross Street.Iron Cross Street was not characterized by just a single street. Like its name suggested, it was formed by two roads that crossed each other.With the intersection at its core, it was split into Left Street, Right Street, Upper Street, and Lower Street. Klein, Benson, and Melissa previously lived on Lower Street.However, the residents living at his former apartment and the surrounding area did not think of the area as Lower Street. Instead, they created the term Middle Street. By doing so, they made a clear difference between those staying there and the poor who lived two hundred meters down the road.There, a bedroom was occupied by five or six people, and sometimes even up to ten.Klein walked along the periphery of Left Street as he let his mind wander. He recalled the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook and how it was missing. He thought of its importance to the Nighthawks and thought of the deaths that resulted from it.His heart slowly turned heavy as his face turned ashen.At that moment, a familiar voice sounded.\u201cLad.\u201dOh\u2026 Klein turned his head curiously and found himself by Smyrin Bakery\u2019s entrance. Mrs. Wendy with a head of gray hair was greeting him with a wave and a warm smile.\u201cYou don\u2019t look\u2026 very happy?\u201d Wendy asked genially.Klein rubbed his face and said, \u201cA little.\u201d\u201cRegardless of your worries, tomorrow will always come,\u201d said Mrs. Wendy with a smile. \u201cHere, try out my newly created sweet iced tea. I\u2019m not sure if it suits the palate of the locals.\u201d\u201cLocals? Aren\u2019t you one, Mrs. Smyrin?\u201d Klein shook his head in amusement.Trying out something means it\u2019s free, right?Wendy Smyrin raised her chin a little and said, \u201cYou guessed right. I\u2019m actually a Southerner. I came to Tingen with my husband, but that was more than forty years ago. Heh heh, back then, Benson was not born yet. Even your parents did not know each other.\u201cI have always been a little unaccustomed to the dietary preferences of Northerners and I\u2019m always missing my hometown\u2019s food. I miss pork sausages, potato bread, roasted pancakes, vegetables fried in lard, and roasted meat with specialty sauces.\u201d\u201cOh, and I also miss sweet iced tea\u2026\u201dKlein suffused a smile when he heard that.\u201cMrs. Smyrin, this sure is a topic that makes me hungry\u2026 But I feel a lot better. Thank you very much.\u201d\u201cDelicacies can always cure sorrow.\u201d Wendy handed him a cup of brownish-red liquid. \u201cThis is sweet iced tea I made according to my memories. Try it and tell me if it\u2019s nice.\u201dAfter thanking her, Klein took a sip and found it resembling iced red tea from Earth. However, it was not as stimulating. The taste of tea was stronger and felt more refreshing. It instantly expelled the heat brought by the burning sun.\u201cIt\u2019s excellent!\u201d he marveled.\u201cThat puts me at ease.\u201d Wendy smiled with squinted eyes as she watched him finish the cup of tea in a genial manner.After chatting with Mrs. Smyrin about his moving, Klein returned to the street he was most familiar with.There were far fewer street side hawkers in the afternoon. They gathered again after half past five. The ones that stayed behind looked drowsy and listless.The moment he entered the area, Klein\u2019s heart suddenly felt overwhelmed by darkness. His heart felt heavy, down, and gloomy for an inexplicable reason.What\u2019s happening? He sharply sensed something wrong about himself. He immediately stopped and observed his surroundings, but did not see anything strange.After some thought, Klein raised his hand and tapped his glabella like he was thinking.The extent of his vision immediately transformed. The auras of the hawkers and pedestrians all appeared.Before Klein could observe the colors of their health, his attention was pulled away by the colors that represented gloominess.He was unable to determine the exact thoughts of the observed, but the despondent, apathetic, and gloomy impression was deeply carved into his heart.As he surveyed the area, he realized that even the sun could not disperse those dark colors.It was a sense of gloom that tainted them from years of repression.Upon seeing this, Klein instantly understood the reason.Just as Old Neil said, activating his Spirit Vision easily pulled him into unfamiliar environments and made him feel discomfort. It was also easy for himself to be affected by the emotions of others.A similar principle could be used on an ability like perception. This was an ability he obtained without additional practice after becoming a Seer. It was a passive sense that could not be declined. It allowed him to directly sense the existence of anything abnormal.There was bound to be a level of interaction when perceiving things; therefore, in the Beyonder eyes of someone like a Spirit Medium, the intensity of everyone\u2019s perception is clear. It is like a fire in the night. Therefore, people with high perceptivity were naturally affected by the intense atmosphere of anything abnormal. It could only be repeatedly practiced to grasp, control, and adapt to such outcomes.\u201cSuch a repressed color is probably formed over extended periods of time, right?\u201d Klein sighed as he shook his head, feeling somewhat affected.He tapped his glabella twice again and tried hard to converge his spirituality.Tap. Tap. Tap. Klein walked toward the apartment and sensed for any abnormal existences or tiny connections while also searching for the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook which \u201che\u201d had hidden.The streets were the same as usual. There was filthy water and trash on the streets. It only cleared up when he reached the apartment\u2019s entrance.Klein pushed open the half-closed door and circled the first floor in the darkness that the sunlight could not reach.The wooden stairs creaked constantly as he went up them.The second floor was as dim as always. Klein released his perception and looked into the darkness.However, not only did he fail to discover any clues regarding his notebook, he even failed to see any invisible spiritual bodies.\u201cIf it\u2019s so easy to encounter them, most ordinary people would not have already sensed the existence of extraordinary matters\u2026\u201d Klein sighed in reflection.He had already understood that most 'spirits\u201d did not exist in the form of spiritual bodies, but in the form of spirituality. Only a Spirit Medium could effectively communicate with them.After circling the third floor once, Klein left the apartment and retraced his memory\u2019s footsteps towards Welch\u2019s place.He walked for a full hour but did not discover anything along the way.Standing outside the gardened bungalow, Klein looked at the building through the locked iron gates and mumbled to himself, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for me to search Welch\u2019s place, right? Captain and Madam Daly must have done a carpet search of the place\u2026\u201cBesides, I don\u2019t have the key. They can\u2019t expect me to climb the walls, right\u2026\u201cI\u2019ll try another path tomorrow\u2026\u201cI\u2019ve walked so much today, but there are no step counter rankings\u2026\u201dWhile lampooning, Klein returned to the nearby district. He planned on taking a public carriage to Blackthorn Security Company to retrieve his daily allocation of thirty bullets. He needed to make use of his time and practice.A Seer\u2019s lack of quick and effective offensive means could only be made up with his revolver and cane!The district around Welch\u2019s place was relatively clean. Shops with clean and bright windows lined the two sides of the street.At the turn of the street, Klein was just about to seek out the carriage stop when his gaze swept past a few signboards on the second floor.\u201cHarrods Department Store.\u201d\u201cMilitary Veterans Mess.\u201d\u201cDivination Club.\u201d\u2026Divination Club\u2026 Klein silently repeated the name and recalled that he had to \u2018act\u2019 as a Seer.Yes, I should take a look\u2026 and seek out new ideas\u2026Amid his mixed thoughts, Klein went across the street and went to the second floor. He entered the main foyer to see a beautiful female attendant.The woman with coiled brownish-yellow hair sized up Klein before saying with a smile, \u201cSir, do you wish to have your fortune told, or do you wish to join our club?\u201d\u201cWhat are the conditions for entry?\u201d asked Klein casually.The woman explained with great familiarity, \u201cFill in your particulars and pay an annual membership fee. The first year is five pounds and subsequent years will be one pound a year. Don\u2019t worry, we are not like political or business clubs which allow entry through recommendations from formal members.\u201cMembers can freely use the club\u2019s meeting room and various divination rooms and tools. They can enjoy the coffee and tea we provide and read the newspapers and magazines we subscribe for free. They can buy lunch, dinner, and alcoholic beverages at cost price, as well as education materials and materials needed for divination.\u201cIn addition, we invite at least one famous fortune-teller to lecture every month to answer any questions.\u201cMost importantly, you can find a bunch of friends with the same hobbies and have an exchange with them.\u201dIt sounds pretty good, but\u2026 I do not have the money\u2026 Klein gave a self-deprecating smile before asking, \u201cThen what if I want my fortune told?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, she maintained her smile and said, \u201cOur members are free to do divination for others in the club. They also have their prices and we take a very tiny cut as a fee. If you wish to have your fortune told, you can take a look at this album. It has introductions and rates of the members who are willing to do divination for others.\u201d\u201cHowever, it\u2019s Monday afternoon, so most of our members are busy at work. We only have five here today\u2026\u201dAs she introduced the club, she invited Klein to have a seat on the sofa beside a window in the reception hall. Then, she flipped through the album and pointed out the present club members.\u201cHanass Vincent. Famous Tingen fortune-teller. The club\u2019s resident mentor. Good at various forms of divination. He charges four soli each time.\u201dIt\u2019s really expensive\u2026 That\u2019s enough to feed Benson, Melissa, and me to two sumptuous dinners\u2026 Klein clicked his tongue silently and did not reply.When the woman saw this, she continued flipping the page and introducing one member after another.\u201c\u2026And the final one, Glacis. A member who joined the club this year. He is skilled in tarot divination. He charges two pence each time.\u201cSir, who do you plan on choosing?\u201dKlein did not stand on ceremony and answered, \u201cMr. Glacis.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The female attendant fell silent for two seconds before saying, \u201cSir, I have to remind you that Mr. Glacis is only considered a novice.\u201d\u201cI understand. I will be responsible for my own decision.\u201d Klein nodded with a smile.\u201c\u2026Then please follow me.\u201d The woman stood up and led Klein through a door beside the reception hall.It was not a very long corridor and an open meeting room was situated at its end. There was enough sunlight and it was equipped with tables and chairs. There were newspapers, magazines, and paper cards. A faint coffee aroma drifted out.About two rooms from the meeting room, the attendant gestured for Klein to stop. She sped up her pace and entered the room. She shouted gently, \u201cMr. Glacis, someone wishes for your divination.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d A voice filled with surprise and doubt immediately sounded. Following that, there was the sound of a chair moving.\u201cYes, which divination room would you like to use?\u201d replied the lady without any emotion.\u201cTopaz Room. I like topaz.\u201d Glacis appeared by the meeting room\u2019s door and looked curiously at Klein who was waiting not far away.He was a man in his thirties; his skin was slightly dark and his pupils were a dark green shade. Under his light, yellow and soft hair, he was dressed in a white shirt and black vest. A monocle hung from his chest and he seemed to have a good disposition.The attendant did not say anything further as she opened the door to the Topaz Room which was next to the meeting room.The curtains inside were tightly shut, making it dim. It appeared that only by doing so would one gain revelations from the gods and spirits to obtain an accurate divination outcome.\u201cHello there. I\u2019m Glacis. I never expected you to choose me for your divination.\u201d Glacis gave a gentleman\u2019s bow, briskly stepped into the room, and sat behind a long table. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m only attempting divination for others. I do not have much experience. For now, I\u2019m not a good fortune-teller. You still have a chance for regret.\u201dAfter Klein returned the bow, he entered and closed the door behind him.By the light seeping through the curtains, he said with a smile, \u201cYou are a really honest man, but I\u2019m someone who is very firm on his choices.\u201d\u201cPlease have a seat.\u201d Glacis pointed at the seat in front of him and thought for a few seconds. \u201cDivination is my hobby. Heh heh. In life, one often receives guidance from the divine, but the ordinary person is unable to accurately understand the meaning. This is the reason why divination exists and also why I joined this club. In this aspect, I still lack confidence. Let\u2019s make the divination that follows an exchange, a free exchange. How do you like my suggestion? I\u2019ll cover the fees the club requires. It\u2019s just a quarterpence.\u201dKlein did not agree or shake his head. Instead, he smiled.\u201cFrom the looks of it, you have a pretty well-paying and decent job.\u201dWhile he said so, he leaned his body forward slightly. He held his forehead with his right fist and tapped at it twice.\u201cBut that does not enhance the accuracy of my divination,\u201d answered Glacis humorously. \u201cDoes your head hurt? Do you want to divine problems regarding health?\u201d\u201cA little. I wish to divine where an item is.\u201d Klein had already thought of an excuse as he slowly leaned back.In his eyes, Glacis\u2019s aura clearly presented itself. The orange colors by his lungs were dark and sparse. They even influenced the brightness in other areas.This is not a symptom of exhaustion\u2026 Klein nodded in an indiscernible manner.\u201cAre you searching for a lost item?\u201d Glacis thought for a few seconds before saying, \u201cThen let\u2019s do a simple determination.\u201dHe pushed the neatly stacked tarot cards on the black table toward Klein.\u201cCalm down. Think of that item and ask yourself \u2018can it still be found.\u2019 While doing so, shuffle and cut the deck.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein actually did not remember what the ancient notebook looked like. All he could do was repeat the question to himself: Can the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook still be found?While he repeated the thought, he skillfully shuffled and cut the deck.Glacis picked the topmost card and pushed it in front of Klein. The card was facing down horizontally.\u201cTurn it clockwise until it sits vertical. Then flip it open. If the card is inverted, which means the picture on the card is facing away from you, it indicates that the item cannot be found. If the card is upright, then we can continue the divination and seek its actual location.\u201dKlein followed his instructions and turned the horizontal card vertical.He clasped the end of the tarot card and flipped it over.It was an inverted card.\u201cWhat a pity.\u201d Glacis sighed.Klein did not respond because his attention was focused on the tarot card in front of him.The inverted card\u2019s picture was dressed in gorgeous clothes and splendid headdress\u2014The Fool!It\u2019s The Fool again? It can\u2019t be so coincidental, right\u2026 According to the Hanged Man and Old Neil, divination is the outcome of the communication of spirituality and the spirit world with a higher-dimensional \u201cme.\u201d Tarot cards are only a convenient tool to read what the truth symbolizes. In theory, using any divination item doesn\u2019t matter as it doesn\u2019t affect the outcome\u2026 Klein frowned as he thought for a moment.\u201cCan it be divined whether the item is already in the hands of others?\u201d\u201cOf course. Follow the same procedure and do it again.\u201d Glacis nodded with rich interest.Klein shuffled and cut the deck while thinking of his question.He drew a card and placed it horizontally before turning it vertical clockwise. He finished all the preparations with a serious expression.Taking a deep breath, Klein reached out his hand and flipped over the tarot card.Please do not be The Fool again\u2026While praying, he suddenly relaxed because the card was that of The Star and it was inverted!\u201cFrom the looks of it, the item has not been taken by others yet,\u201d interpreted Glacis with a smile.Klein nodded and raised his right hand. He tapped his glabella, looking as though he was deep in thought. Then, he took out two pennies with a dark copper luster from his pocket and pushed it towards Glacis.\u201cDidn\u2019t I say it was free?\u201d Glacis said with a frown.Klein laughed as he got up.\u201cThis is the respect divination deserves.\u201d\u201cAlright, thank you for your generosity.\u201d Glacis stood up and reached out his hand.After shaking his hand, Klein took two steps back and turned around. He walked to the door and twisted the doorknob.Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly turned his head and made a terse sound.\u201cMr. Glacis, I suggest that you see a doctor as soon as possible. Focus on your lungs.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Glacis in surprise.Are you cursing me because you aren\u2019t pleased with the divination results?Klein thought for a moment before saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a symptom based on the color of your face. You, well\u2026 your glabella seems\u00a0dark <sup>1</sup> .\u201d\u201cGlabella seems dark\u2026\u201d It was the first time Glacis was hearing such a description.Klein did not explain further as he walked out the room with a smile. He closed the wooden door behind him.\u201cIs he an unlicensed doctor or a herbalist?\u201d Glacis shook his head, amused. He then picked up his monocle for divination.On careful look, he realized his glabella was indeed dark.But this was a problem of the environment. In the darkness due to the closed curtains, not only was his glabella dark, his entire face was shrouded in darkness!\u201cIt\u2019s not a very likable joke.\u201d Glacis muttered.He worriedly divined his own health to make sure that everything was alright.\u2026After leaving the Divination Club, Klein had an additional plan for the future.It was to save as much money as possible to pay the annual fee to become a member of the club. After which, he could begin acting as a Seer.As for why he did not choose to do it independently, it was because he temporarily lacked the resources and channels. He could not bring himself to stand on the streets as a hawker since he cared for his reputation.A few minutes later, the public carriage arrived. He spent two pence and reached Zouteland Street which was not very far off.He pushed open the door to Blackthorn Security Company but did not see the familiar brown-haired girl. He only saw the black-haired, green-eyed Leonard Mitchell with his poetic bearing behind the reception counter.\u201cGood afternoon. Where\u2019s Rozanne?\u201d Klein asked after taking off his hat and bowing.Leonard smiled and pointed at the partition.\u201cIt\u2019s her shift tonight at the armory.\u201dWithout waiting for Klein to ask another question, Leonard said as though he was pondering over a matter, \u201cKlein, I have a question that has always puzzled me.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Klein was puzzled.Leonard stood up and smilingly said with a relaxed tone, \u201cWhy did Welch and Naya commit suicide on the spot while you returned home?\u201d\u201cIt likely has to do with how the unknown existence made me take the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook away to hide it,\u201d answered Klein with the official surmise.Leonard paced around before turning to look straight into Klein\u2019s eyes.\u201cIf your suicide was meant to silence you and wipe out any clues, why weren\u2019t you made to destroy the notebook there and then?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was no need for me to take it away to carry out the destruction\u2026Upon hearing Leonard\u2019s question, Klein instantly went into keyboard detective mode and said with a sigh, \u201cPerhaps when Welch, Naya, and I made contact with the unknown existence, it enjoyed the sacrifice of life or wished for similar situations to continue. With the suicide definitely easily discoverable, I was made to take away the notebook to hide it so as to prepare for the existence\u2019s second round of entertainment. However, some mishap happened during the process and I failed to succeed in my suicide.\u201dThis was a reasoned guess Klein made from his consumption of novels, movies, and TV dramas which involved cult sacrifices.As for the mishap that happened midway, he knew very well that it was due to the unexpected variable of him being a transmigrator.\u201cQuite a good explanation, but I believe there might be other possibilities. Welch\u2019s and Naya\u2019s suicide sacrifice might have made it possible for the unknown existence to descend on this world. Then, that notebook is a vessel or a breeding ground for evil. It made you take it away to hide it, worried that we would destroy it if we discovered its birth\u2014before it became strong.\u201d Leonard Mitchell suggested another possibility.Having said that, he stared into Klein\u2019s eyes and smiled slightly.\u201cOf course, perhaps the notebook has been destroyed. The goal is to hide its content, to conceal the vessel or the brooding of evil. That way, there is a sufficient reason for your failed suicide.\u201dWhat does he mean? Is he suspecting me? Is he suspecting that the original Klein\u2019s body is a vessel or used for the brooding of evil? No, what he\u2019s being a vessel for is a transmigrator\u2026 Actually, \u201cBrooding\u201d isn\u2019t a correct term. Klein was taken aback. While he secretly criticized the idea, he weighed his words.\u201cI will not try to defend myself since I\u2019ve lost memories from that period. Be it Captain or Madam Daly, they have already confirmed that I\u2019m fine. Your joke isn\u2019t funny.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m only considering a possibility. It does not eliminate the blow the unknown existence encountered when it descended which caused your suicide to fail. We believe that the Goddess will ultimately bless us.\u201d Leonard laughed as he changed the subject. \u201cDid you discover anything in the afternoon?\u201dAfter the conversation and the previous encounters, Klein was very wary of Leonard. He answered in a composed manner, \u201cNo. I plan on trying a different route tomorrow afternoon.\u201dHe pointed to the partition and said, \u201cI\u2019ll need to head to the armory to draw the bullets.\u201dThe Shooting Club opened to nine at night. After all, its availability increased only after many of its members got off work.\u201cMay Goddess bless you.\u201d Leonard smiled as he gestured the sign of the crimson moon on his chest.He watched Klein pass through the partition and listened to his footsteps down the stairs. Leonard\u2019s smile gradually vanished as a look of doubt appeared in his green eyes.He whispered something with a displeased tone.\u2026Down the stairs, Klein followed the gas lamp-illuminated corridor to the armory and archives.The iron door was open and the brown-haired Rozanne was standing in front of the table. She was chatting with a top hat-wearing middle-aged man with a thick black beard.\u201cGood afternoon, no. Good evening. It\u2019s always night here. Klein, I heard from Old Neil that you have become a Beyonder? It\u2019s called Seer?\u201d Rozanne turned her head and deluged him with her questions.She did not hide her curiosity and concern.Klein nodded with a smile.\u201cGood afternoon, Miss Rozanne. It\u2019s indeed always night here, but it makes one feel a sense of serenity. The description you gave wasn\u2019t accurate enough. It should be said that the Sequence potion I consumed has the name Seer.\u201d\u201cYou still chose to become a Beyonder after all\u2026\u201d Rozanne said with a sigh as she fell into a deep thought.Klein looked at the middle-aged man beside her and asked politely, \u201cYou are?\u201dAnother Nighthawk member or one of the other two civilian staff I have not met?Rozanne puckered her lips and said, \u201cBredt. Our colleague. He wishes to change slots with me to free up the night after tomorrow. He plans on going to the theater in the North District with his wife to watch The Prideful One. It\u2019s to celebrate their fifteenth-year wedding anniversary. He\u2019s truly a romantic gentleman.\u201dBredt smiled as he extended his hand and said, \u201cWith Miss Rozanne around, there\u2019s nothing that requires repeating. Hello, Klein. I never expected you to become a Beyonder so quickly. As for me, heh, I might never have the courage.\u201d\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s as the saying goes, the ignorant knows no fear,\u201d Klein said in a self-deprecating manner as he extended his hand to shake Bredt\u2019s.\u201cMe not having courage is not something bad,\u201d said Bredt with a shake of his head. \u201cA Beyonder once told me before his death to never probe the strange and dangerous matters. The less you know, the longer you live.\u201dAt that moment, Rozanne interjected, \u201cKlein, there\u2019s no need to mind it. I heard from Old Neil that as a Seer, you are used as support. It\u2019s relatively safe as long as you do not attempt to communicate with unknown existences. Why are you dressed in such clothes? It\u2019s so unbecoming of a gentleman! What are you here for?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to draw my thirty bullets.\u201d Klein did not reply to Rozanne\u2019s first question.He believed that the lady would quickly forget the matter.\u201cAlright.\u201d Rozanne pointed at the table and said, \u201cBredt, it\u2019s all yours. You should know where the keys and bullets are. Oh, Old Neil really is petty. He did not even leave his hand ground coffee behind. He promised me that I could drink my fill today\u2026\u201dShe prattled on as Klein received the bullets.The duo left together and went their separate ways at Zouteland Street. One took a public carriage home while the other walked into the Shooting Club.Bang! Bang! Bang!Klein repeated the process\u2014gripping the gun, raising his arms, shooting, releasing the cylinder, ejecting the empty shells, and stuffing in rounds\u2014again and again. He became familiar with the process and built it into his muscle memory.Of course, he had a few breaks in between to review and correct the process.After finishing his practice, Klein used the grounds to do various exercises like push-ups. He worked hard to train his body to improve his physique.Once everything was over, he sat in an untracked carriage home. Only then he realized it was nearing seven and the sky was already dark.Just as Klein was planning to head to the market or streets to buy the ingredients for dinner, the door opened. Melissa had returned with her stationery-filled bag.Apart from that, she carried quite a lot of groceries.\u201c\u2026I thought you and Benson would be home rather late. This morning, I took out 1 soli from the place you hide the money.\u201d Upon seeing her brother\u2019s questioning look, Melissa explained in her usual serious manner.\u201cSince you took the money, why didn\u2019t you take the public carriage to school?\u201d Klein had been reminded of the matter from the morning.Melissa said with a frown, \u201cWhy should I take a public carriage. It costs four pence to get to school. A return trip means eight pence. Counting Benson and you, we will be spending twenty-four pence on transportation daily. That\u2019s a whole soli! In a week, yes, without counting Sunday, that\u2019s still twelve pence. It\u2019s almost equal to our rent.\u201dStop, stop, stop! Don\u2019t flaunt your mathematical prowess\u2026 Klein lowered his palm in an amused manner.Melissa first stopped before adding, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty good walking to school. Our teacher said that everyone should exercise frequently. Besides, I can pick some damaged components on the way.\u201dKlein chuckled and said, \u201cThen let\u2019s do the math again. The public carriage costs twelve soli. The rent is twelve soli and three pence. It\u2019s a total of one pound, four soli and three pence. Using Benson\u2019s salary is enough to pay for it and there will be quite a bit of change left. Yes, he has received last week\u2019s salary\u2026 As for me, I can still earn one pound ten soli every week. Even if we eat meat every day while counting expenses like gas, charcoal, wood, and condiments, we would still have some left if we are frugal with lunch. We can even subscribe to the morning papers for just one penny.\u201d\u201cIn two months, when I make up for the advanced payment, I can save money for both you and Benson. We can have new clothes.\u201d\u201cBut! But we have to think of the possible accidents.\u201d Melissa stayed firm on her point.Klein smiled at her and said, \u201cThen, we can eat less meat. Don\u2019t you find spending fifty, no, a hundred minutes on the road a waste of time? You could use that time to read more and think over problems and improve your results.\u201cThat way, Melissa, you will be graduate with excellent grades. You will be able to find a job with a pretty good salary. When that happens, what is there to worry about?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe fully displayed his experience gained from debating with people on message boards and finally convinced Melissa. She agreed to take the public carriage to school.\u201cPhew, I\u2019ve finally suckered her into doing it. No, how can I call it suckering. This is called convincing\u2026\u201d Klein lampooned before taking over the groceries that Melissa had bought. He said with a sigh, \u201cRemember to buy beef or meat like mutton and chicken\u2026 Eat until you\u2019re full and enjoy yourself. Only then will you be equipped with a healthy body and a clever brain to match the demanding requirements needed for your studies.\u201dJust mentioning it makes me salivate\u2026Melissa puckered her lips and after a few seconds of silence, said, \u201cAlright.\u201d\u2026The next morning, after ensuring that Melissa took a public carriage, Klein and Benson separated and went to their respective companies.The moment Klein stepped into the door, he saw Old Neil and Rozanne chatting by the reception desk. The former was still in his classic black robe, without any concern for the gazes of others. The latter had changed into a casual cream-colored dress.\u201cGood morning, Mr. Neil, Miss Rozanne,\u201d greeted Klein as he took off his hat.Old Neil gave him a mischievous look.\u201cGood morning, you did not hear anything you shouldn\u2019t have heard last night, right?\u201d\u201cNo, I slept very well.\u201d Klein was also quite puzzled over that.He could only put it down to his inadequate perception\u2026\u201cHaha, don\u2019t mind that. Actually, it\u2019s not that easily heard.\u201d Old Neil pointed to the partition and said, \u201cGo to the armory. We will continue out mysticism lessons this morning.\u201dKlein nodded and followed Old Neil down the stairs and arrived at the armory to replace Bredt who had been on duty the entire night.\u201cWhat will we be learning today?\u201d asked Klein curiously.Old Neil dragged out his response and said, \u201cThe complicated and basic knowledge. But before that, let me teach you an interesting trick.\u201dHe pointed at the silver chain on his wrist. There was a pure moonstone hanging from the chain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 - Mysticism CurriculumPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 40: Mysticism CurriculumTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudios\u201cAn interesting trick?\u201dKlein asked out of extreme curiosity.Old Neil chuckled and said, \u201cI\u2019ll complete my patrol of the armory, storeroom, and archives. Use the two cups on the table to make two cups of coffee. In one of the cups, put something unpleasant. As for what it is, you can decide for yourself. Use your imagination. The only request from me is to not waste too much coffee powder. Those are coffee beans grown on the Feynapotter plateau and hand ground by me!\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Although Klein was unsure what Old Neil was up to, he happily agreed to it.He watched him open the iron gates to the armory with a copper key and then heard the echoing footsteps inside. Slowly, he settled the cups down and confirmed that there was still hot water in the kettle.He removed the silver tin can\u2019s lid and using a tiny spoon with a metallic sheen, Klein scooped a spoonful of rich aromatic coffee powder into each of the two cups. Then, he poured in the hot water and stirred it.As a transmigrator who came from an era abundant in resources, he was no stranger to coffee. However, it was only limited to instant coffee.After finishing the task, Klein pondered for a moment and sat down. He crossed his right leg and took some of the mud which had stained the bottom of his leather boots and placed it in the left cup.Then, he carefully stirred it again until the colors and smells of the two cups of coffee were practically indistinguishable.A few minutes later, Old Neil walked out the armory while swinging his keys. He then closed the iron gates with a clang.\u201cAre you done?\u201d His turned his slightly turbid dark red eyes over and looked at Klein across the table.\u201cYes,\u201d replied Klein with a nod.Old Neil chuckled and removed the silver chain around his wrist and sat down.His expression quickly turned serene. He held out his chain-holding left hand and allowed it to hang over the coffee cup to his right. The moonstone nearly touched the liquid.Amid the relaxing calmness, the moonstone trembled suddenly. It began spinning the chain in a counterclockwise manner.\u201cThis cup is the one with the unpleasant thing,\u201d said Old Neil surely.Without waiting for Klein to confirm, he put away the silver chain and picked up the other cup of coffee and took a sip.\u201cDo you like bitter coffee? I\u2019m used to having a tablespoon of sugar and a tablespoon of milk.\u201dKlein did not reply but instead asked with his interest piqued, \u201cYour divination sure is accurate. Was it because of the moonstone? That was moonstone, right?\u201d\u201cThis is known as pendulum dowsing in divination. It\u2019s also called spirit dowsing. It relies on your own Astral Projection\u2019s connection with the spirit world and space to communicate with spiritual intelligence through the aid of natural materials such as crystals, gems, or special metals. The good and bad of things can be divined\u2026 Let\u2019s talk about the two cups of coffee. A counterclockwise motion implies bad, while a clockwise motion is good. If it doesn\u2019t move, it\u2019s neither good or bad. You can write the statement on a piece of paper. Take note, it\u2019s a statement and not a question.\u201d Old Neil put down the cup of coffee and explained in detail.Klein asked as though he was thinking, \u201cDoes that mean one should use questioning sentences?\u201d\u201cYes, you cannot use \u201cis so-and-so willing to be my fianc\u00e9e,\u2019 but you should instead use \u2018so-and-so is willing to be my fianc\u00e9e.\u2019 Write it on a piece of paper and place it on the desk. Then use your dominant hand to hold the pendulum chain. Take note, use your dominant hand,\u201d said Old Neil with a chuckle. \u201cWhen doing so, keep your arm straight. Adjust the chain\u2019s length and make the moonstone hang just above the piece of paper to the point of almost touching what we wrote. Then, close your eyes and repeat the sentence seven times in your mind. Open your eyes when you are done and see if the spirit pendulum turns or not. If it doesn\u2019t, close your eyes again and repeat the process until it moves.\u201dKlein nodded slightly and asked, \u201cCounterclockwise means \u2018no,\u2019 and clockwise means \u2018yes?'\u201d\u201cIt can also be interpreted as success or failure,\u201d corrected Old Neil. He taught Klein the other usages and details of spirit pendulum divination.Klein pondered over the matter and discovered that it was a very useful divination trick. For instance, he could quickly use it in an unfamiliar environment to determine if the food he was offered was poisonous or not. He did not need any additional knowledge of field biology.Of course, such divination methods were overly simple. The answers he could receive were limited to two or three. There was no way for deeper investigation or interpretation. For example, although something could be harmful to the body, it could become very beneficial after some processing. An example was certain foods. They were indeed damaging to the body, but nothing serious. If one was on the brink of starving, eating it would not be a huge problem. These were things that spirit dowsing could not determine.\u201cI will have to quickly save money to buy crystals or pure silver to create a spirit pendulum\u2026\u201d Klein sighed.Old Neil looked at him in puzzlement.\u201cYou can apply for one directly. This is standard issue for Beyonders, especially Beyonders like us who take on a support role. There\u2019s still a topaz and pure silver spirit pendulum in the armory.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m still not a formal member of the team\u2026\u201d Klein\u2019s heart palpitated in excitement, but he felt a little hesitant.Old Neil chuckled and said, \u201cFor Beyonders, regardless of whether they are formal members or not, they have to be provided with conveniences in other areas since there\u2019s no pay rise.\u201d\u201cMaybe the word \u2018perk\u2019 is more suitable. I\u2019ll apply with Captain later!\u201d Klein clenched his fists secretly as he made up his mind.How was he to know if Captain would approve his request without trying?\u201cAlright,\u201d said Old Neil with a smile. \u201cWe can officially begin our mysticism curriculum. The basics consist of symbolism. Do you know what symbolism means?\u201dKlein recalled the bits and pieces he had heard and the things he had seen and heard from his spirit world and the gray fog. He deliberated and said, \u201cRegardless of the spirit world or the illusory stellar space, as well as the unknown realms, they are beyond our sensory world. It\u2019s not something that can be accurately described by the information our ears, nose, and eyes obtain. What we obtain are simply indescribable experiences and direct revelations. They also appear as abstract characters or pictorial symbols. These symbols represent different items and different meanings.\u201d\u201cVery accurate. As expected of a Seer.\u201d Old Neil nodded solemnly. \u201cOnly by grasping the ability to interpret the symbols can you really take the next step into the world of mysticism. Yes, the pictures on tarot cards and each of the elements in the pictures are symbols. They are man-made symbols that help us understand and interpret primordial revelations.\u201dHe pulled out a piece of paper and picked up a fountain pen beside him. He drew a short curve.Following that, he added a few vertical lines beneath the curve. He looked up at Klein and asked, \u201cDo you know what this symbol represents?\u201dKlein looked at it for quite a while before saying hesitatingly, \u201cEyelashes?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Old Neil exhaled. \u201cThis is the symbol of the Bumper Harvest constellation. This is the Thunderous constellation, and this is the Frost constellation\u2026\u201dHe casually drew a few more symbols.As Klein memorized them, he could not help but comment, \u201cThe names of these constellations are really\u2026 especially unsophisticated. Yes, unsophisticated!\u201dHow tacky and primordial\u2026Old Neil revealed a smile.\u201cEmperor Roselle thought the same back then. He always had the intention of changing the constellation names to things like Virgo, Cancer, and Scorpio. Unfortunately, he did not have the strength to go against tradition. At the very least, these constellations\u2019 old names and the corresponding dates they represent guide farming and harvests.\u201d\u201cI have to say that Emperor Roselle sure is a person with ideas.\u201d Klein was at a loss for words.Yes, Emperor Roselle was likely a decent person when he was alive\u2026Old Neil was unable to understand Klein\u2019s humor as he continued explaining the various basic symbols, such as the various constellations, the sun, the crimson moon, the brown star, the red star, and the blue star.While talking about these, he would teach Klein how to draw the divination astrolabe and indicate what things to pay attention to. He also taught the materials and creation of a crystal ball, and the choice of incantations. The teachings overwhelmed Klein.If not for his discovery that the Seer potion had improved his memory slightly, he would have long asked Old Neil to stop to aid his digesting of the information.\u201cThat\u2019s all for today\u2019s mysticism class. Think over it yourself and ask me if you have any questions.\u201d Old Neil took out a gold pocket watch and opened it with a snap to check the time. \u201cDo not forget to read the historical documents I prepared for you. To be frank, I feel fear seeing them.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein took the pieces of paper that were sketched with symbols by Old Neil. He quickly went through the mysticism knowledge he learned today to prevent himself from forgetting it.Old Neil took a sip of a newly brewed cup of coffee and said, \u201cMemory itself won\u2019t do. You have to use if often. That way, you can make the knowledge instinctual. Also, Cogitation has to be carried on every day. Only more practice and usage will allow you to grasp the power of the potion, digging into the mysteries it hides away and removing its unpleasant effects.With this raised, Klein recalled acting and the Divination Club. He probed, \u201cMy potion\u2019s abilities are related to divination. Practicing by myself will not do. I need to make contact with lots of people and divine for them to quickly grasp it. I plan on joining the Divination Club after having some spare cash\u2014the one on Howes Street in North Borough\u2014to become a real Seer.\u201dThis was not something he could hide from the Nighthawks in the future. It was better to prepare them.\u201cYour idea is very similar to Daly\u2019s. She has always clamored to be a real Spirit Medium.\u201d Old Neil shook his head and laughed. \u201cBut why must you wait till you have spare cash? You can apply to Dunn and get him to approve of the expenses!\u201d\u201cOrganizations like a Divination Club might also have cultists or members of evil organizations in them. As a civilian staff member of the Nighthawks and a standard Beyonder, your membership makes it easy for us to monitor them. It\u2019s part of the job! We would regularly monitor these places, but as we lack manpower, we can\u2019t keep watch on them for long. Now, it can be handled to you.\u201dI can do that? As he looked at Old Neil\u2019s serious expression, Klein was dumbfounded.This is making an expense claim for private matters!I know nothing about such matters\u2026Indeed, I\u2019m just a keyboard warrior\u2026\u201cYou wish to use your own money to do this?\u201d Old Neil smiled as he added when he saw Klein\u2019s face.Klein immediately shook his head as he answered firmly, \u201cI plan on reporting it to Captain!\u201dOld Neil nodded in satisfaction and looked at the cup of coffee with the unpleasant thing inside. It had not been poured away.\u201cWhat did you put in there?\u201dKlein smiled embarrassingly.\u201cIt\u2019s just some dirt underneath my boots. Its color and your coffee powder looks almost the same.\u201dOld Neil was taken aback as he suddenly clasped his mouth and roared, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you pouring it away yet!?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 - Audrey and Her SusiePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 41: Audrey and Her SusieTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosAfter pouring away the coffee and returning to the armory to take the thick stack of historical materials and explanatory transcripts from Old Neil, Klein followed the wall of lights up the staircase to the Blackthorn Security Company.Tap. Tap. Tap. His footsteps echoed in the sealed and quiet basement.After Klein left the spiral staircase, he pushed open the door and identified his bearings before heading for the second office opposite of him.After familiarizing himself for two days, he had a general understanding of the layout of the Blackthorn Security Company.The entrance brought visitors to a huge reception hall with sofas and tables. Through the partition, there was an inner region. To the left of the corridor were three rooms. From the nearest to the furthest, they were Mrs. Orianna\u2019s account room, a rest room with a few sofa beds, and the staircase that led underground.On the right were three rooms. From the nearest to the furthest was Captain Dunn Smith\u2019s office, a civilian staff office with a typewriter, and the entertainment room for formal members of the Nighthawks team.Klein had previously seen Leonard Mitchell playing cards with two other teammates in the entertainment room. He guessed that they were playing Fighting the Landlord. Of course, Emperor Rochelle had already given it a new name\u2014Fighting Evil. However, the way it was played was identical to what Klein knew.Bredt was entitled to a day of sleep after a night shift. Rozanne was at the reception desk. The carriage driver who was in charge of procuring necessities and collecting supplies, Cesare Francis, was out as usual. When Klein opened the door to the civilian staff office, the three desks inside were empty. Only the typewriter sat there silently.\u201cAkerson Company\u2019s Model 1346 typewriter\u2026\u201d Klein, who had seen similar objects in his mentor\u2019s office and Welch\u2019s place, muttered. He felt that the complicated mechanisms inside were filled with the beauty of machinery.He walked to the desk with the typewriter. After preparing himself, he attempted to type something on air.In the beginning, he often converted the local language to Chinese \u2018pinyin\u2019 instinctively. Only after he was familiar with it did he \u2018digest\u2019 the original Klein\u2019s corresponding memory fragment and no longer made mistakes.Tap! Tap! Tap!The rhythmic tapping on the typewriter sounded like a melody composed from the heavy marriage of metal and industry. Under this melody, Klein quickly typed the expenditure application.However, he was in no hurry to meet Dunn Smith. Instead, he focused his mind and read the materials provided by Old Neil seriously. It was both revision and new material.When it was almost noon, he stretched his neck and put away the documents. He then read and consolidated what he had learned on mysticism in the morning.Only after all that did he take his application to the office next door and knocked on the door gently.Dunn was waiting for lunch to be delivered. When he saw Klein hand him the document, the corners of his mouth curved up.\u201cDid Old Neil teach you this?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Klein did not hesitate to betray Old Neil.Dunn picked up his dark red fountain pen and signed it.\u201cI happen to be applying for funding for the months of July, August, and September from the Church and the police department. I\u2019ll add yours in. When it\u2019s approved, get the money from Mrs. Orianna. You can draw the spirit pendulum in the afternoon.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Klein answered simply and vigorously.His tone and eyes were obviously filled with joy.Before bidding Dunn farewell, he asked casually, \u201cShouldn\u2019t the budget for July, August, and September be applied for by June?\u201dWhy are you applying for July\u2019s budget only in July?Dunn fell silent for a few seconds before sipping his coffee.\u201cWe encountered three cases in June. I was so busy that I forgot about it.\u201dAs expected of Captain and his poor memory\u2026 Klein knew he had asked a question he should not have asked. He gave a chuckle before leaving immediately.With that, he began a simple but regular lifestyle. He would spend half an hour in the early morning Cogitating. He would have two hours of mysticism lessons in the morning and an hour and a half of studying the historical documents. After lunch, he would take a short nap in the break room to regain his energy.Following that, he would draw bullets and head to the Shooting Club. After finishing his practice, he would stroll over to Welch\u2019s place, which was not too far. He would then change routes and return to Iron Cross Street. That way, he could save on the carriage fees. If he had time, he would practice his Spirit Vision and Spirit Dowsing. On the way, he would buy groceries.\u2026In a private chemistry laboratory equipped with apparatus and items.A tall, blond Audrey was looking at the cup in her hand. There were countless bubbles and it made the atmosphere serene.Finally, the liquid in the cup precipitated into a sticky silver substance.\u201cHaha, I\u2019m indeed talented in mysticism. I succeeded in one try! I was worried of failure and prepared two sets of materials!\u201d the girl muttered to herself in delight.She put away the items she took from her family\u2019s vault or exchanged them with others. She took a deep breath and prepared to close her eyes to drink down the Spectator potion.At that moment, barking sounded from outside the laboratory. Audrey frowned instantly.She hid the cup of silver liquid in a dark corner, turned around and headed to the door.\u201cSusie, who\u2019s here?\u201d Audrey turned the doorknob and asked the golden retriever sitting in front of the door.Susie wagged her tail in an obsequious manner. Her personal maidservant, Annie, had appeared in the corridor nearby.Audrey walked out of the laboratory and closed the door. She looked at Annie and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? Do not disturb me when I\u2019m running chemistry experiments.\u201dA vexed Annie answered, \u201cBut there\u2019s an invitation from the Duchess, Duchess Della.\u201d\u201cDuke Negan\u2019s wife?\u201d Audrey took a few steps forward and asked Annie.\u201cYes. She has managed to hire the services of the palace\u2019s baker, Madam Vivi, and plans to invite you and Madam to afternoon tea,\u201d Annie recounted the invitation.Audrey tapped her cheeks discreetly and said, \u201cTell my mother that I have a headache. Perhaps I\u2019m a little dehydrated because of the scorching sun. Please get her to convey my apologies to Madam Della.\u201dAs she spoke, she acted frail.\u201cMiss, it\u2019s not only afternoon tea, but a literature salon,\u201d added Annie.\u201cBut that won\u2019t treat my dizziness. I need rest,\u201d rejected Audrey firmly.Simultaneously, she muttered deep down. If they insist, I\u2019ll faint for all of you to see. The etiquette teacher said that I can do it most perfectly\u2026 I think I heard something?\u201cAlright,\u201d Annie exhaled and said. \u201cDo you need me to help you back to your room?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need. I\u2019ll clean up the laboratory first.\u201d Audrey was yearning to return immediately to consume the potion.However, she suppressed her impatience. She only returned to the laboratory\u2019s entrance when she saw Annie leave.Suddenly, she discovered that the golden retriever, Susie, who was waiting outside, was gone. Furthermore, the door to the laboratory was half opened.\u201cI forgot that Susie can open doors with handles\u2026 What was that sound? Not good!\u201d Audrey heard crisp sounds coming from within. Suddenly, she came to a realization as she charged into the laboratory.All she could see was the cups shattered on the floor. Susie was licking the final drop of silver liquid.Audrey stood rooted at the entrance like a statue.Susie immediately sat down and looked at her owner innocently as she wagged her tail.\u2026In the seas beyond the Pritz Harbor, there was an island perennially enveloped in storms. An ancient sailboat was docked at its harbor.A blond man dressed in a robe with lightning patterns was looking at Alger Wilson opposite to him. He asked, perplexed, \u201cAlger, you could have returned to the kingdom and become a captain of a Mandated Punisher team or a reputable bishop. Why did you choose to voyage out into sea and become the captain of the Blue Avenger?\u201dAlger wore a stoic expression on his rough face. He replied solemnly, \u201cThe sea belongs to the Storm. This is the Lord\u2019s kingdom. I\u2019m willing to abide by the Lord\u2019s will and monitor this area of His kingdom.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d The blond haired man clenched his fist and struck his chest. \u201cMay the Storm be with you.\u201d\u201cMay the Storm be with you.\u201d Alger replied with the same standard salute.He stood on the deck with a few sailors and watched his companions leave the boat, walking into the distance.\u201cSainz, you do not understand because you do not know enough\u2026\u201d Alger muttered silently.Meanwhile, Audrey finished her second concoction in a panic-stricken state.Seeing that the silver potion looked nothing different from before, she was nearly moved to tears.Gulp. She quickly drank down the Spectator potion.\u2026Friday. A storm befell Tingen. The heavy rain pounded on the windows of every household.Inside the Blackthorn Security Company, Klein, Rozanne, and Bredt sat on the sofa in the reception hall and enjoyed lunch.As there was only a kettle for boiling water, there was no way to heat up leftovers. Klein could not eat rye bread every day or take the carriage home every day. If he did that, he would have to walk from Iron Cross Street to Welch\u2019s place in the afternoon and consider taking a carriage back. It was a waste of money; therefore, he began joining Rozanne and his colleagues in eating the so-called \u2018office rations.\u2019The nearby Old Wills Restaurant would punctually send a waiter at half past ten every day. He would ask for their orders and after determining the quantity, he would send it over at half past twelve. The food was contained in what resembled meal boxes. At three, he would return to take their orders for dinner and take back the utensils.The \u2018rations\u2019 included meat, vegetables, and bread. Although the quantity was lacking, it was barely sufficient to fill a person. A cost of a meal ranged from seven to ten pence depending on the different premium levels.Klein would always thicken his skin and order the meal costing seven pence. Typically, there was half a pound of wheat bread, a tiny piece of meat cooked in different ways, a ladle of thick soup with vegetables, and tiny bits of butter or margarine.\u201cWe actually only have one Nighthawk here today\u2026\u201d Rozanne said as she delivered a spoonful of thick soup into her mouth.\u201cI heard that a case with cultist elements is going on in Golden Indus. Therefore, the police department has requested for two Nighthawks\u2026\u201d Bredt said as he put down his bread.Klein used the remaining wheat bread and dabbed it into the last bits of meat juice before stuffing it into his mouth. He did not say a word.Under his left sleeve, there was a silver chain with a topaz hanging.At that moment, knocks sounded outside the half-closed main door.\u201c\u2026Please come in.\u201d Rozanne was taken aback as she put down her spoon. She quickly used a handkerchief to wipe her mouth and stood up.The door was pushed open as a man in a halved top hat came in. The left shoulder of his black formal suit was drenched.The sides of his hair had grayed. He put away his umbrella and said to Klein and company, \u201cIs this the former small mercenary squad?\u201d\u201cYou can say that,\u201d answered Rozanne like clockwork.The lanky man coughed and said, \u201cI have a mission request.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How he yearned for there to be a message board and a screen for him to share his thoughts.But he soon realized that he had once asked a similar question. The captain\u2019s answer was that they could take on jobs if they were free. The money earned could be used as funding for the team\u2019s petty cash account and bonuses for the participants.Rozanne\u2019s eyes darted around as she thought for a moment before saying, \u201cOur security personnel are all out on missions. The fastest it will take for them to return is an hour. If your matter isn\u2019t urgent, you can consider our services.\u201dAmong the six formal Nighthawk members, Captain Dunn Smith had been invited to the cathedral by the bishop for some unknown discussion. Leonard Mitchell was guarding Chanis Gate in his place.Corpse Collector Frye and Sleepless Royale Reideen had already headed to the Golden Indus Borough to assist the police in the investigation of a robbery case with cultist inklings. Sleepless Kenley White was on leave, while Midnight Poet Seeka Tron had gone to Raphael Cemetery in the north suburb for a daily patrol.As for the remaining two Beyonders, Old Neil was frail and too advanced in his years. He had not taken any missions in a long time. Klein was still a novice and was truly inadequate in various aspects.\u201cThey are all out\u2026\u201d With one hand holding his umbrella, the lanky man\u2019s expression turned gloomy as he took off his hat. He bowed and said, \u201cSorry for intruding. Goodbye.\u201dHe turned around and walked out. He went down the stairs and left 36 Zouteland Street amid the spattering rain and howling winds.\u201cWhat a bloody pity.\u201d Rozanne watched the man left and sighed regretfully.Although she would not have gotten any share of the commission, she definitely would have been able to partake in a sumptuous meal.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do about it. Chanis Gate needs someone watching it all the time.\u201d Klein put down his cutlery in satisfaction. Even though he did not like the soup mixture of turnips and vegetables, he still drank it clean. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you want Bredt to take the mission? Or yourself?\u201dRozanne rolled her eyes and giggled.\u201cBredt won\u2019t do, but you can. Our Mister Seer\u2026\u201dThe moment she finished her sentence, she immediately realized what she had just said. She covered her mouth in shock because the door had not been fully closed. It someone walked past outside or heard anything about Beyonders, it would be considered a leak.\u201cThankfully Captain isn\u2019t around\u2026\u201d Rozanne looked out the door and secretly stuck her tongue out. \u201cOr I\u2019ll have to go for confession again!\u201dBredt and Klein laughed out in unison as they exchanged looks before beginning to put away the cutlery.After everything was done, Klein, who did not bring his umbrella, decided to stay at Blackthorn Security Company due to the ongoing rain.He took out some newspapers and sat on the soft but bouncy sofa as he leisurely began his \u2018afternoon break.\u2019\u201cThe airship route from Backlund to Desi Bay is now in service\u2026\u201d\u201cThe complete anthology of the Great Detective Manseng is publishing soon\u2026\u201d\u201cAn advertisement for Lagolas Weapons? A standard model revolver carrying six bullets costs three pounds and ten soli, a double barrel gun costs two pounds\u2026\u201d\u2026Klein flipped through the Tingen City Honest Paper when a particular piece of news suddenly caught his attention.\u201c\u2026the suspect responsible for killing Mr. Welch and Miss Naya has been caught. We believe it is a much-needed reprieve from the horror that has gripped North Borough, Golden Indus Borough, and East Borough\u2026 Welch\u2019s father, Mr. McGovern, who is a banker, has escorted his youngest son\u2019s corpse back to Constant City where a grand burial will be held\u2026\u201dAfter reading it a few times, Klein suddenly sighed.From the looks of it, Welch\u2019s father had bought the police\u2019s explanations and did not hire a private investigator to investigate the matter\u2026His grief from losing his youngest son can\u2019t be any greater than that of my parents who lost their only son\u2026In a sullen mood, Klein sat there motionless for a long time.He neither found it odd that he was not invited to Welch\u2019s and Naya\u2019s burials, nor did he feel depressed.Once everything calms down, I\u2019ll find a chance to offer a bouquet of flowers to their graves\u2026 Klein was about to take a nap in the break room when a knock came from the door of the reception hall again.\u201cPlease come in.\u201d Rozanne, who was nodding off, suddenly jolted awake.The half-closed door was pushed open again. The lanky man from before walked in once again.\u201cCan I wait here? Your mercenaries, no\u2014 security personnel should be back soon, right?\u201d He asked sincerely, trying his best to hide his anxious expression.\u201cSure. Please have a seat.\u201d Rozanne pointed at the sofa nearby.Klein asked out of curiosity, \u201cWhere did you hear about our security company? Who introduced you here?\u201dHe had made two trips despite the heavy afternoon storm while still willing to wait?Yes. The Nighthawks must have easily resolved missions that might seem very difficult to others. They must have accrued quite a reputation\u2026The man left his umbrella outside the door and as he walked to the sofa, he replied with a rueful smile, \u201cI have traveled the nearby streets and paid a visit to all the mercenaries, uh\u2014security companies and private investigators. You are my only hope. The others do not have the manpower to take additional missions\u2026 To be frank, if not for the waiter that delivers meals, I really did not imagine that there was another security company here.\u201d\u2026It\u2019s completely different from what I imagined\u2026 Klein was stunned.Rozanne interjected with a question, \u201cThey are very busy? Are there that many missions?\u201dThe man sat down and sighed.\u201cYou are a mercenary team, no\u2014a security company. I believe you must have heard of the armed burglary murder at Howes Street?\u201dHowes Street\u2026 Armed burglary murder\u2026 Alright, unfortunately, I\u2019m one of the people involved\u2026 Klein nodded with a slightly heavy heart.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDue to the presence of a ferocious and cruel criminal, the rich men living in the neighboring streets, and even across all of Tingen City, are terrified. Apart from increasing the numbers of their security detail, they have also hired many more security personnel and private detectives. This resulted in a shortage of supply in your line of work,\u201d the tall and skinny man explained clearly.A standard chain-reaction\u2026 Klein and Rozanne exchanged looks and saw the self-deprecating smile from each other\u2019s faces.The security industry had entered a golden age. Yet, Blackthorn Security Company was not affected in any way. It was apparent how dismally the company was run.Of course, to a certain extent, it also proved the success of the Nighthawks in hiding themselves.After waiting for another twenty plus minutes, Klein prepared to leave since the rain was coming to a stop. He planned on practicing at the Shooting Club.At that moment, the black-haired and green-eyed Leonard Mitchell walked out of the partition. He looked curiously at the sofa.\u201cThis is?\u201d\u201cA client. Is Captain back?\u201d Rozanne asked delightfully.\u201cBack?\u201d The lanky man was taken aback when he heard that.He had been sitting there, staring at the door. How did he not discover someone\u2019s return?Rozanne\u2019s expression immediately froze as she chuckled.\u201cAs a security company, we don\u2019t only use the front door.\u201d\u201cFigures.\u201d The lanky man nodded in enlightenment.He was also not surprised by the term \u2018Captain.\u2019 Security companies were mercenary teams or small-scale mercenary guilds. It was normal for \u2018Captain\u2019 to be used.Leonard did not tuck in his white shirt. His black vest was also casually draped on. He took a glance at the lanky man when he suddenly snapped his fingers and said, \u201cI\u2019m a member of the security personnel at Blackthorn. How might I address you? How may I help you?\u201dPerhaps it was because he had long heard about the unrestrained characters of mercenaries that he did not feel the anger of being humiliated. Instead, he let out a breath of relief.He watched Leonard sit down, and organized his words.\u201cMy name is Klee, a butler of Mr. Vickroy, a tobacco merchant. His only son, little Elliott, was kidnapped this morning. We have already informed the police and the matter has been given high priority. However, Mr. Vickroy remains uneasy. He wishes to go through the channels which mercenaries, uh\u2014security personnel have, as well as your understanding of Tingen, to investigate the case from a different angle and ensure that little Elliott is rescued safely.\u201d\u201cIf you are able to find where the kidnappers are hiding, Mr. Vickroy will be willing to pay you 100 pounds. If you have the means to successfully save Young Master Elliott, he is willing to pay double. 200 pounds.\u201dLeonard Mitchell smiled leisurely.\u201cMr. Vickroy seems to only wish for us to find the kidnappers\u2019 hideout? If not, he will not think that his only son is worth a hundred pounds. A tobacco merchant who has close ties with the southern plantations will not just offer two hundred pounds.\u201d\u201cNo, Mr. Vickroy is only an ordinary merchant. He\u2019s not considered wealthy. Besides, he believes the police will be more professional when it comes to rescuing his son,\u201d Klee answered frankly.\u201cAlright. No problem.\u201d Leonard snapped his fingers again.His green eyes turned their gaze on Rozanne.\u201cMy beautiful lady, please write up a contract.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t always act like a poet. In fact, all you do is recite the works of others.\u201d Having forgotten the presence of the client, Rozanne quipped. She was used to exchanging snipes with Leonard.Of course, the Blackthorn Security Company did not really care about its clients. It was great to have them, but it was also fine not having them.Rozanne left the reception counter and entered the staff office. Soon, there were sounds of typing coming out from the office.The corners of Klein\u2019s mouth twitched a little. He found them too unprofessional.There was no standard template for a contract!This sure is tragic\u2026And more saddening is the fact that I\u2019m working at such an unprofessional company\u2026The moment these thoughts arose in him, Rozanne completed a simple contract that had only a few clauses. Then, Klee and Leonard Mitchell signed it.After Klee stamped it, she took the contract and returned to the accounting room and got Mrs. Orianna to stamp it with the Blackthorn Security Company logo\u2014something that was actually useless. Dunn typically handed it to Orianna for safekeeping. On Sunday, it would be passed to Rozanne and company.\u201cI\u2019ll wait for your good news.\u201d After receiving one copy of the contract, Klee stood up and bowed with his hat off.Leonard did not respond. He seemed to be in deep thought.He suddenly turned his head toward Klein and revealed a smile.\u201cI need your help.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Klein was taken aback.\u201cI mean you and I can finish this mission together.\u201d The corners of Leonard\u2019s mouth curved up slightly as he explained, \u201cI\u2019m good at combat, shooting, climbing, sensing, and chanting, and taking on some support roles. But that does not include looking for people. You don\u2019t expect Old Neil to go out in such weather, right?\u201dWhen he said \u2018sensing,\u2019 his voice was lowered to a mumble that Klein could barely hear.\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein did have the urge to attempt his new \u2018abilities,\u2019 while also feeling a little wary toward Leonard Mitchell.Phew. Let\u2019s hope it will be completed successfully\u2026 I wonder how useful my Seer abilities will be\u2026 He wondered with some anticipation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It would be better if you have any accessories he used to wear on him.\u201dHe tried to choose ordinary mediums, not something that would normally invite questions.But even so, Klee wore a look of puzzlement.\u201cWhy?\u201dAfter his question, he added, \u201cI have a picture of Young Master Elliott on me.\u201dWhy? Because we are divining his location\u2026 Klein was momentarily at a loss for an answer.If he answered truthfully, ignoring the fact that it violated the confidentiality clause, Klee would likely storm out immediately and rip apart the contract while cursing, \u201cThis bunch of cheats! If that works, why don\u2019t I find the most famous Spirit Medium in Awwa County!\u201dBy the side, Leonard Mitchell chuckled and said, \u201cMr. Klee, my partner, um\u2014colleague rears a unique pet. Its sense of smell is sharper than a hound\u2019s. That\u2019s why we need clothes that little Elliott wore and items he used to wear on him to aid us in finding him. As you know, clues typically bring you to a general region.\u201d\u201cAs for the picture, we would need it too. Both of us need to know what little Elliott looks like.\u201dKlee accepted the reason by nodding slowly.\u201cWill you be waiting here, or will you be going with me to Mr. Vickroy\u2019s residence in the city?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go together. It saves time,\u201d replied Klein simply.Not only was he eager to try out his abilities as a Beyonder, but he also wanted to save the child.\u201cAlright, the carriage is downstairs.\u201d As Klee spoke, he took out a black-and-white photograph and handed it to Leonard.It was a picture of Elliott Vickroy alone. He was about ten years old with rather long hair that nearly covered his eyes. There were obvious freckles on his face and he did not seem to stand out.Leonard glanced at it and handed it to Klein.Klein took a careful look and placed the photograph into his pocket. Then, he took his cane and put on his hat. He followed the two out of Blackthorn Security Company and boarded the carriage downstairs.The carriage\u2019s interior was rather spacious. It was lined with thick carpet and a tiny table to rest items on.As Klee was around, Klein and Leonard did not say a word. They quietly took in the experience of traversing the pooling roads in a carriage.\u201cThe carriage driver is quite good.\u201d Leonard broke the silence after some time with praise and a smile.\u201cYeah.\u201d Klein answered perfunctorily.Klee forced a smile and said, \u201cYour compliments are his honor. We will be there soon\u2026\u201dAs they were afraid of alerting the kidnappers, the carriage did not stop at the Vickroy\u2019s residence. Instead, it stopped at the side of a nearby street.Klee held an umbrella and returned along. After waiting for some time, Leonard talked to Klein again.\u201cMy surmise the last time was not without a goal. I was just trying to tell you that the notebook will definitely appear again. Perhaps, it might be soon.\u201d\u201cThat really isn\u2019t a happy surmise.\u201d Klein used his chin to gesture towards the carriage driver outside, indicating that he did not wish to discuss sensitive topics with outsiders around.Leonard whistled and turned his head to look out the window. He saw raindrops streak across the glass, leaving behind blurry marks. It made the world outside a complete blur.After a while, Klee returned with a bag of items. Since he walked in a hurry, the edge of his trousers were soiled and his shirtfront was slightly wet.\u201cThese are the clothes Young Master Elliott wore yesterday. This is the Storm Amulet he used to wear.\u201dKlein took it and glanced at it. He discovered it to be a miniature gentleman\u2019s formal suit\u2014a small shirt, vest, bow tie, etc.And the Storm Amulet was made of bronze. It was carved with symbols representing gales and sea waves, but they did not trigger Klein\u2019s perception.\u201cI\u2019ll recount in detail the incidents leading up to Young Master Elliott\u2019s kidnapping. Hopefully, it will let you find him easier\u2026\u201d Klee sat down and described the nightmare that happened in the morning, hoping that the helpers he went through great trouble to hire would be of help.Klein and Leonard held no interest in the specifics. All they cared about was the number of kidnappers, if anything unusual had happened, or if they had any weapons.\u201cThree,\u201d \u201cnormal,\u201d \u201carmed with firearms\u2026\u201d After obtaining the desired information, they bade Klee farewell and hired a two-wheeled light carriage.Unlike public carriages, private-hire carriages were either four-wheeled or two-wheeled. They were charged either by time or distance. The latter was at four pence a kilometer in the city and eight pence a kilometer outside. The former cost two soli per hour or part thereof. After the first hour, there were additional charges of six pence every fifteen minutes. In inclement weather or if the customer needed to go faster, the fare could even be higher.Klein had heard from Azik that in the capital, Backlund, these carriage drivers were famous for quoting outrageous prices.To him, taking a private carriage was quite a luxury. However, he did not need to worry about this at the moment since Leonard had tossed two one-soli notes to the carriage driver.\u201cCharge it by the time.\u201d After Leonard gave his instructions, he closed the carriage\u2019s door.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d The carriage driver was delighted and puzzled as he held the two notes.\u201cWait a moment.\u201d Leonard cast his gaze at Klein.Klein nodded slightly and took out Elliott\u2019s clothes. He spread it out on the carriage\u2019s floor and then wound the Storm Amulet around his cane\u2019s handle.He held the silver-inlaid black cane and hung it straight over Elliott\u2019s clothes.He gathered the sphere of light in his head as his mind rapidly turned still. His brown eyes quickly turned deeper in color as he entered a half-Cogitation state.He felt the his body\u2019s 'spirit\u201d turning light. He vaguely saw the world of spirits everywhere. He silently said, \u201cElliott\u2019s location.\u201dAfter repeating it seven times, he released his grip of the black cane, but the cane did not fall to the ground. It remained standing in front of him even though the carriage was shaking!Minute but invisible stirrings happened around Klein and he felt as if pairs of eyes were looking at him.Over the past few days, Klein had felt this sensation occasionally when he was in the state of Cogitation or Spirit Vision.With a little fear, he looked at the cane with his deep black eyes. He recited once again in his heart, \u201cElliott\u2019s location.\u201d\u201cElliott\u2019s location.\u201dAfter he finished saying that, the cane fell and pointed straight ahead.\u201cStraight.\u201d Klein held the cane and said in a deep voice.His voice sounded a little ethereal as though it could penetrate the unknown world.This was one of the divination abilities he had grasped. It was called \u201cDowsing Rod Seeking.\u201d The tool of choice had to be wooden, metallic, or a mixture of both.In ordinary circumstances, he would require two real dowsing rods. Dowsing rods were shaped like two straight metal wires tapered to an edge. He would hold on to the shorter side and turn it to ascertain the correct direction. But as a Seer, Klein realized that through practice, he could search for people directly using this method. He could also use his cane as a replacement for dowsing rods. The direction in which the cane fell was the direction of the item he was seeking.As for the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook, Klein could not remember it at all. Without the slightest impression, there was no way for him to find it.\u201cGo straight.\u201d Leonard instructed the carriage driver loudly. \u201cWe will tell you when there\u2019s a need to turn.\u201dThe carriage driver did not understand why that was necessary, but the notes in his pocket and the willingness of his passengers to hand over the money kept him quiet. He chose to follow the strange instructions.The carriage proceeded slowly, passing through one street after another.Midway, Klein used Dowsing Rod Seeking to correct their direction.After the carriage circled a building once, he finally determined that Elliott was inside. It had only been thirty minutes since they bade Klee farewell.After sending off the cane, Klein did not continue using Elliott\u2019s clothes. Instead, he placed the cane, entwined with the Storm Amulet directly onto the ground.His eyes turned dark once again as the raindrops around him suddenly spun in place.The cane fell to the front with a slant. Klein pointed at the staircase and said, \u201cThere.\u201d\u201cAt times, I really envy Old Neil. Similarly, I envy you now.\u201d Upon seeing this scene, Leonard smiled with a sigh.Klein shot him a glance and replied with a calm tone, \u201cThis is nothing difficult. If you are willing to learn, you would definitely be able to master it\u2026 Your perceptivity should be very high, right?\u201dLeonard nodded and chuckled.\u201cThat\u2019s not something good.\u201dHe quickened his pace and walked into the building amid the ending rain.Klein was afraid of drenching his formal suit, so he jogged in tow.The building only had three stories. It was similar to a unit block from Earth. The entrance to each floor was situated along the flight of stairs. There were only two units on per floor. Klein used Dowsing Rod Seeking on both the first and second floors, but the cane remained still while pointing upward.The two of them quieted their footsteps and arrived at the third floor. Klein once again placed the black cane on the floor.Whoosh!A breeze blew across the stairs as his pupils changed colors. The darkness seemed like it could suck the souls of people.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Sobs seemed to sound out around them.Klein relaxed his palm as the cane with the entwined Storm Amulet magically stood erect.He silently read \u201cElliott\u2019s location\u201d again. He watched his black cane drop silently as it pointed to the right room.\u201cThey should be in there.\u201d While Klein picked up his cane, he tapped his glabella twice.Various colors saturated as he looked at the right room. He saw all sorts of auras inside.\u201cOne, two, three, four\u2026 Three kidnappers and one hostage. The numbers match\u2026 One of their auras is short. It\u2019s likely Elliott\u2026 Mr. Klee said that they have two hunting rifles and a revolver\u2026\u201d Klein whispered.Leonard chuckled.\u201cLet me recite a poem for them.\u201d\u201cWhy be a kidnapper? Why can\u2019t you happily be civilized person?\u201dHe put down the bag with Elliott\u2019s clothes and took two steps forward. His expression suddenly turned serene and melancholic.His magnetic and deep voice gradually sounded.\u201cOh, the threat of horror, the hope of crimson cries!\u201cOne thing at least is certain\u2014that this Life flies;\u201cOne thing is certain, and the rest is Lies;\u201cThe Flower that once has bloomed forever dies\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 - FatePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 44: FateTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosLeonard\u2019s singing sounded like a lullaby as it lightly resounded through the doors and into the winding wooden stairwell.Klein\u2019s mind immediately turned torpid. He felt like he saw a silent moonlight and serene rippling lake.His eyelids rapidly turned heavy as if he were about to fall asleep standing.Amid these indistinct sensations, he also felt a strange, formless, and indifferent focus on his back. It felt like he was wandering the spirit world himself.A baffling sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu suffused as Klein suddenly found his train of thought once again. With his strong spiritual perception and extreme familiarity with Cogitation, he barely escaped the influence of the Midnight Poem.However, he remained serene and could hardly evoke any emotions.Soon, Leonard stopped singing as he turned his head with a smile.\u201cI\u2019m considering asking Captain\u2019s permission to apply for a Feynapotter lute. How can there not be an accompaniment when singing?\u201cHeh heh, I\u2019m just kidding. I can hear them asleep.\u201dThe black-haired, green-eyed Nighthawk with his poetic vibe took a stride forward and walked to the door that separated them from the kidnappers and hostage.He suddenly moved his shoulder and threw a punch at the door\u2019s lock.Crack!The wooden board around the lock shattered in a muffled manner.\u201cThis requires precise control.\u201d Leonard turned his head and smiled. He then reached his hand into the hole and opened the door.Klein, who had regained consciousness, was not as confident as him. He reached under his armpit, drew his revolver, and turned the cylinder, making sure that he could shoot at a moment\u2019s notice.As the door swung back, he saw a man sleeping on a table with a gun by his feet. Another man was rubbing his eyes in a daze while trying to stand up.Bam!Leonard slid forward and struck the awakening kidnapper unconscious.Klein planned to enter as well when he suddenly sensed something. He turned around abruptly and faced the stairwell.Tap. Tap. Tap. Footsteps were approaching from below. It became clear that 'something\u201d was a hatless man in a brown coat circling the stairwell in his progression toward the third floor while hugging a paper bag of bread.Suddenly, he stopped. He saw a gun\u2019s barrel aiming at him with a metallic luster.His pupils reflected a young man dressed in a halved top hat, black formal suit with a bow tie of the same color. It also reflected the cane which rested along the rail and the dangerous revolver.\u201cDo not move. Raise your hands. Three, two, one\u2026\u201d Klein\u2019s tone was deep but relaxed.He held the revolver with both hands as he tried to imagine the man as a target from his practice.Amid the tense atmosphere, the man in the brown coat threw the bag of bread and slowly raised his hands.\u201cSir, is this a kind of a joke? Has there been a misunderstanding?\u201d He stared intently at the finger that Klein had placed on the trigger as he forced a smile.Klein was temporarily unable to determine if he was an accomplice or a neighbor, but he did not reveal any abnormalities. He said in a deep voice, \u201cDo not attempt to resist. Someone will determine if it\u2019s a misunderstanding in a while.\u201dAt that moment, Leonard, who had finished handling the kidnappers, walked out and noticed the man in the stairwell. He said leisurely, \u201cSo the kidnappers have another accomplice responsible for buying and delivering food?\u201dUpon hearing this, the man\u2019s pupils constricted as he suddenly raised his foot and kicked the bag of bread up in an attempt to block Klein\u2019s vision.Seemingly unaffected, Klein coldly pulled the trigger like his usual training.Bang!Blood burst out from the man\u2019s left shoulder.He tumbled to the ground and attempted to escape from the second floor; however, Leonard had already reached his hand towards the handrail before leveraging himself to jump over.With a dull thud, Leonard landed on the man from above.The man fainted as Leonard swatted away some of the blood that had splattered on him. He looked up at Klein and chuckled.\u201cNice shooting.\u201dI was trying to hit his legs\u2026 The corner of Klein\u2019s mouth twitched in an indiscernible manner as he caught a whiff of the smell of blood.He discovered that despite not having any enhancements to his visual, auditory, or tactile senses after consuming the Seer potion, he could still 'see\u201d obstructed objects and \u201chear\u201d faint footsteps, allowing him to take preemptive judgment.Was this in the scope of spiritual perception? Klein nodded in thought as he watched Leonard find a sharp dagger in the accomplice\u2019s possession and \u201cdrag\u201d him into the room.With a gun and cane in each hand, Klein entered the kidnapper\u2019s room. They saw Elliott Vickroy jolt awake from the gunshot as he straightened his body and sat up slowly from a huddled position.Leonard had securely tied up the three kidnappers with the rope they used against Elliott. Bunched together, they were thrown in a corner. The lack of rope was made up by tearing their clothes.The unconscious man who had been shot in the shoulder was bandaged, but Leonard disdained getting his hands dirty, so he did not help him extract the bullet.\u201cW-who are you people?\u201d Elliott stammered in pleasant delight when he saw the scene before him.\u201cYes, you guessed right. Very precise.\u201d The genuflecting Leonard answered casually.I never expected this bastard to have some humor cells in him\u2026 Klein lowered his revolver and said to Elliott, \u201cWe are mercenaries hired by your father. You can also call us security personnel.\u201d\u201cPhew, for real? Have I been saved?\u201d Elliott said joyfully without daring to make any movements.It was apparent that he had suffered quite harshly in the short few hours of being a kidnapping victim. He did not have the kind of rashness someone his age normally would have.Leonard stood up and said to Klein, \u201cGo downstairs and find some patrolling cops. Get them to inform the tobacco merchant. I do not wish to walk out with a child and four idiots like a kidnapper.\u201dKlein, who was wondering about the aftermath, nodded. He put away his revolver, picked up his cane, and walked to the staircase.As he went down the stairs, he had a nagging feeling that he had forgotten something. In addition, he heard Leonard say to Elliott, \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. You will soon see your father, mother, and your old butler, Klee. Why don\u2019t we play a round of Quint?\u201d\u2026Klein held back his laughter and walked out into the streets. With the help of pedestrians, he found two patrolling policemen.He did not use his badge and identification as a member of the Special Operations Department; instead, he used his identity as a professional security company and recounted the happenings factually.As for him holding a gun, he was not worried at all. He had received an all-purpose weapon usage certificate the day before yesterday. His application was accelerated by going through internal channels.The two policemen exchanged looks and one of them left to gather reinforcements and inform the Vickroy family. The other policeman followed Klein to the kidnappers\u2019 room.After waiting for more than forty minutes, Leonard signaled to Klein while the policeman was not paying attention. Klein was to sneak out of the room with him.\u201cTrust me, heading to the police station is an extreme waste of time. Let\u2019s leave first,\u201d the Nighthawk with the poetic bearing explained with a relaxed look.Since Leonard was making it clear that he would take any responsibility for any repercussions, he did not retort and followed in tow.Almost five minutes later, a few carriages rushed to the building where the kidnappers were. The old butler, Klee, disembarked with his portly master, Vickroy.Up to this moment in time, he was still in a daze. He found it incredulous that news would come so fast. It felt like a dream.Suddenly, he heard a crisp snap as he turned around.A two-wheeled carriage drove past with its windows open. The black-haired and green-eyed Leonard had snapped his fingers again.After passing by Vickroy\u2019s carriage, Leonard closed the window, turned around, and looked at Klein.He extended his right hand and smiled.\u201cIt was a pleasure working with you!\u201dI don\u2019t think we are on that good terms\u2026 Klein politely shook his head.He did not expect the kidnapping case to be resolved so quickly. All he could do was marvel at the capabilities of Beyonders. Even though he was just a half-assed Sequence 9 Beyonder, he was able to do many inconceivable things.\u201cThis is a celebratory gesture of peace among aristocrats after a clash of swords,\u201d explained Leonard with a smile.\u201cI know.\u201d Klein had many aristocratic classmates.He looked outside the window and said with a frown, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we confirm with Mr. Klee? If he believes that the police rescued Elliott, our commission will be halved.\u201dA total of 100 pounds!There was no doubt about their providing of the kidnappers\u2019 location from their \u2018meeting\u2019 from before.\u201cDon\u2019t mind it. To us, money isn\u2019t that important,\u201d said Leonard with a shrug.\u2026It\u2019s very important to me!Klein forced a polite smile and said, \u201cMany poets died early from poverty.\u201dLeonard chuckled.\u201cI believe Elliott would not lie on this matter. I can tell that he still has some of his innocence left in him. However, you will not get much of the 200 pound commission either.\u201d\u201cHow much would I get?\u201d asked Klein immediately.\u201cAs the unspoken rule has always been, half of the commission would be handed to Mrs. Orianna as additional funding for the team. The remaining would be split among members. A pity you aren\u2019t a formal member; you will only get about ten percent of the remaining half.\u201d10 pounds? That isn\u2019t bad either\u2026 Klein pretended to feel the pinch as he asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you worried that the kidnappers will realize that they were under the influence of a Beyonder\u2019s powers after they wake up?\u201d\u201cThey will not suspect anything. They will only believe that the weather was good and very conducive for sleeping, leading to them dozing off. They will even believe that the song existed only in their dreams. This is something we have verified before,\u201d answered Leonard very confidently. \u201cInstead, it\u2019s your demon hunting bullets that might arouse suspicion. Of course, you being a queer who enjoys mysticism would be a perfectly reasonable explanation.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Klein was relieved. He just kept feeling like he had forgotten or overlooked something.\u2026After returning to Zouteland Street, Klein did not wait for Klee\u2019s arrival. He strolled to Welch\u2019s place and took a different route home. On the way, he bought some beef and olives for dinner.The meal was enjoyable as always, with the same three siblings chatting idly. However, there was an additional visitor.He was a worker responsible for collecting one penny for the gas meter.The evening grew dark as the siblings bade each other good night and returned to their rooms.Klein was sleeping soundly when he was suddenly awoken by something familiar outside. He opened the door in puzzlement and arrived outside the bedroom that no one stayed in.He pushed open the mottled door and saw a gray desk.There was a notebook on the table and its cover was made of hard paper. It was completely black in color.A baffling sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu arose in him as he walked over and opened the notebook.The page he flipped open to was of a picture\u2014a picture of someone dressed in gorgeous clothes and splendid headdress\u2014The Fool!Beneath The Fool was a line in Hermes.\u201cEveryone will die, including me.\u201dHorror gripped Klein\u2019s heart as he suddenly realized that the corner of The Fool\u2019s mouth was curving up!Ffffffff!He sat up in shock as he saw crimson moonlight penetrate his curtains. He saw his bookshelf and desk and the silhouette of his own bedroom. He realized that he had had a nightmare.As a Seer, he knew what dreams typically portend. Therefore, he began to seriously search through his recollections.Klein froze up when he did because he knew what he had missed out on today!While he was immersed in Leonard\u2019s singing, he had sensed a formless and indifferent focus on his back.The feeling of being observed felt different from the usual Cogitation or experience he had from using Spirit Vision. It gave him a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!According to Captain Dunn, once a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu arose in him, it probably means\u2026Klein suddenly sat straight and confirmed the feeling.Yes, it\u2019s that notebook! That Antigonus family\u2019s notebook!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 - ReturningPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 45: ReturningTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosThe Antigonus notebook is in the apartment across the kidnappers\u2019!Although it was very coincidental, Klein believed that his intuition was correct.He immediately got out of bed and rapidly changed out of the old clothes he usually wore to bed. He picked up a white shirt beside him and draped it on, quickly buttoning from top to bottom.One, two, three\u2026 He suddenly realized that he was \u201cmissing\u201d buttons. The left and right sides did not seem to match.On careful look, Klein realized that he had made a mistake buttoning the first button, causing the shirt to warp.He shook his head helplessly before taking a deep breath and slowly breathing out, using some of his Cogitation techniques to restore his calm.After putting on his white shirt and black trousers, he barely managed to wear his armpit holster steadily. He pulled out the revolver he hid under his soft pillow and holstered it.Without time to tie a bow tie, he draped his formal suit on and with a hat and cane in each hand, he walked to the door. After putting on his halved top hat, Klein gently twisted the door handle and walked into the corridor.He carefully closed his bedroom\u2019s wooden door and sneaked downstairs like a thief. He used a fountain pen and paper in the living room to leave a note, informing his siblings that he had forgotten to mention that he had to be early for work today.The moment he was out the door, Klein felt a cool breeze and his entire being calmed down.The street in front of him was dark and silent without any pedestrians. Only the gas lamps illuminated the streets.Klein took out his pocket watch from his pocket and snapped it open. It was just six in the morning and the crimson moonlight had not completely faded away. However, there was a hue of sunrise over the horizon.He was just about to seek out an expensive for-hire carriage when he saw a two-horse, four-wheeled trackless carriage approaching him.\u201cThere are public carriages this early in the morning?\u201d Klein was puzzled as he went forward and waved for it to stop.\u201cGood morning, Sir.\u201d The carriage driver stopped the horses skillfully.The ticketing officer beside him had his hand to his mouth while yawning.\u201cTo Zouteland Street.\u201d Klein scooped out two pennies from his pocket and four halfpence.\u201cFour pence,\u201d the ticketing officer replied without any hesitation.After paying for the ride, Klein got onto the carriage and found it empty. It exuded a clear loneliness amid the dark night.\u201cYou are the first one,\u201d said the carriage driver with a smile.The two brown horses widened their pace as they proceeded briskly.\u201cTo be honest, I never imagined there to be a public carriage so early in the morning.\u201d Klein sat near the carriage driver and made idle chatter to divert his attention and relax his tense mind.The carriage driver said in a self-deprecating manner, \u201cFrom six in the morning to nine at night, but all I earn is one pound a week.\u201d\u201cAre there no breaks?\u201d inquired Klein in bafflement.\u201cWe take shifts to rest once a week.\u201d The carriage driver\u2019s tone turned heavy.The ticketing officer beside him added, \u201cWe are in charge of plying the streets from six to eleven in the morning. Following that, we have lunch and an afternoon break. Near dinnertime, which is six in the evening, we replace our colleagues\u2026 Even if we do not need rest, the two horses will need it.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything like that in the past. There was an accident that should not have happened. Due to fatigue, a carriage driver lost control of his carriage and it toppled. It resulted in us having shifts\u2026 Those bloodsuckers would never become this kind so suddenly otherwise!\u201d The carriage driver scoffed.Under the illumination of dawn, the carriage drove towards Zouteland Street and picked up seven to eight passengers on the way.After Klein was less tense, he did not converse further. He closed his eyes and recalled the experiences from yesterday, hoping to notice if he had forgotten anything.By the time the skies were bright when the sun was fully up, the carriage finally arrived at Zouteland Street.Klein pressed his hat with his left hand and briskly jumped off the carriage.He quickly stepped into 36 Zouteland Street and arrived outside Blackthorn Security Company after going up the flight of stairs.The door was still closed and had yet to open.Klein took out the ring of keys by his waist and found the corresponding brass key and inserted it into the keyhole and twisted it.He pushed forward as the door slowly opened. He saw the black-haired, green-eyed Leonard Mitchell sniffing at a recently popular cigarette.\u201cTo be honest, I prefer cigars\u2026 You seem to be in a rush?\u201d the poet-like Nighthawk asked in a relaxed and cozy manner.\u201cWhere\u2019s Captain?\u201d Klein asked instead of answering.Leonard pointed at the partition.\u201cHe\u2019s in the office. As an advanced Sleepless, he only needs two hours of sleep in the day. I believe it\u2019s a potion those factory owners or bankers would like the most.\u201dKlein nodded and quickly passed through the partition. He saw that Dunn Smith had opened the door to his office and he was standing at its entrance.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Dressed in his black windbreaker, he held a gold-inlaid cane with a solemn and stern expression.\u201cThe feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu came to me. It should be the notebook. The Antigonus family\u2019s notebook.\u201d Klein tried hard to make his answer clear and logical.\u201cWhere was that?\u201d Dunn Smith\u2019s expression did not have any obvious changes.However, Klein\u2019s intuition told him that a clear and invisible stir had happened in him. This was possibly a flash of his spirit or a change in his emotions.\u201cIt\u2019s at the place Leonard and I saved the hostage yesterday. Opposite the kidnappers\u2019 room. I didn\u2019t notice it back then until I had a dream and received a revelation,\u201d Klein did not conceal anything.\u201cFrom the looks of it, I missed out on making huge contributions.\u201d Leonard, who had walked to the partition, chuckled.Dunn nodded slightly as he instructed with a solemn expression, \u201cGet Kenley to replace Old Neil\u2019s watch of the armory. Let Old Neil and Frye come with us.\u201dLeonard stopped acting frivolous as he immediately informed Kenley and Frye who were in the Nighthawks\u2019 entertainment room. One of them was a Sleepless and the other was a Corpse Collector.Five minutes later, the two-wheeled carriage that came under the jurisdiction of the Nighthawks began driving down the sparse streets in the morning.Leonard wore a feather hat, a shirt and a vest. He stood in as the carriage driver, lashing out a whip from time to time, sending out a crisp crack.Inside the carriage, Klein and Old Neil sat on one side. Facing them were Dunn Smith and Frye.The Corpse Collector\u2019s skin was so white it looked like it either had not been under the sun in a very long while or he had a severe blood deficiency. He looked to be in his thirties with black hair and blue eyes. He had a high nose bridge and his lips were very thin. He had a cold and dark demeanor and had a faint smell from often touching corpses.\u201cRepeat the situation again in detail.\u201d Dunn adjusted the collar of his black windbreaker.Klein stroked the hanging topaz in his sleeve as he began from their mission commissioning until the dream. By the side, Old Neil chuckled.\u201cYour fate seems to be entwined with that Antigonus family\u2019s notebook. I never expected you to meet it in such a manner.\u201dThat\u2019s right. Isn\u2019t this too much of a coincidence!? Thankfully, Leonard just mentioned that there was no indication of hidden factions of mysterious powers at play from the preliminary investigations of Elliott\u2019s kidnapping. It was solely a crime motivated by money. Otherwise, I would really suspect if someone had deliberately arranged for this to happen\u2026 Klein found the situation rather curious.It was too coincidental!Dunn did not express his ideas as he was in deep thought. Likewise, Corpse Collector Frye maintained his silence in his black windbreaker.Only when the carriage stopped at the building mentioned by Klein was the silence broken.\u201cLet\u2019s go up. Klein, you and Old Neil walk behind. Be careful, very careful.\u201d Dunn got off the carriage and pulled out a strange revolver with a clearly long and thick barrel. He stuffed it into his right pocket.\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein did not dare take point.After Leonard found someone to watch the carriage, the five Beyonders walked orderly into the building. With very light footsteps, they arrived at the third floor.\u201cIs this the place?\u201d Leonard pointed at the apartment opposite the kidnappers.Klein tapped his glabella twice and activated his Spirit Vision.In this state, his spiritual perception was enhanced again. He found the door familiar as if he had once entered it before.\u201cYes.\u201d He nodded in affirmation.Old Neil also activated his spiritual perception and after observing carefully, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s no one inside, nor are there any spiritual glows of magic.\u201dCorpse Collector Frye added with his hoarse voice, \u201cThere aren\u2019t any evil spirits.\u201dHe could see many spiritual bodies, including evil spirits and restless wraiths, even without activating his Spirit Vision.Leonard took a step forward and, like yesterday, punched the door\u2019s lock.This time not only did the surrounding wood shatter, even the door lock flew and fell noisily to the ground.Klein seemed to feel an invisible seal instantly vanish. Immediately following that, he caught a whiff of an intense stench.\u201cCorpse, a rotting corpse,\u201d Frye described coldly.He did not appear to suffer from nausea.Dunn reached out his black-gloved right hand and pushed open the door slowly. The first thing that they saw was a chimney. For early July, there was an abnormal heat emanating the room.In front of the chimney was a rocking chair. Sitting on it was an old woman dressed in black and white. Her head hung low.Her body was abnormally large. Her skin was blackish-green and swollen. It felt like she would explode from a simple prod, spewing a foul rotting stench from within. As maggots and other parasites squirmed between her flesh, blood, and rotting juices, or clothes and wrinkles, they appeared like points of light in Spirit Vision. They seemed to cling close to an extinguished darkness.Pa! Pa!The old woman\u2019s eyeballs dropped to the floor and rolled a few times, leaving behind a yellowish-brown streak.Klein felt disgusted and being unable to tolerate the putrid stench any longer, he bent over and puked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Eugh!Klein squatted there, vomiting involuntarily. He was soon done with his puking since he did not eat breakfast.At that moment, a tin-colored square flask that looked like a cigarette box appeared in front of him.The mouth which had lost its stopper emitted a mixture of smells akin to tobacco, disinfectant, and mint leaves. It cleared up Klein\u2019s nose and rejuvenated him.The pungent smell continued to linger, but Klein no longer felt nauseous. He soon stopped vomiting.He traced the tiny flask up and saw a pale hand that did not seem to belong to a member of the living. He saw the mouth of a black windbreaker\u2019s sleeve and saw Corpse Collector Frye with his cold and dark bearing.\u201cThank you.\u201d Klein recovered completely and with his hands on his knees, he stood back up.Frye nodded without any expression.\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine once you are used to it.\u201dHe put back the flask\u2019s stopper and put it into his pocket and turned around, walking to the highly decomposed corpse. Without gloves, he began examining the old woman. As for Dunn Smith and Leonard Mitchell, they paced slowly around the room, occasionally touching the table\u2019s surface or newspapers.Old Neil pinched his nose and stood outside the door, grumbling in a muffled voice, \u201cSeriously gross. I\u2019m going to request for additional pay this month!\u201dDunn turned his head over and touched the wall beside the chimney with his gloved right hand. While doing so, he asked Klein, \u201cDoes this place look familiar?\u201dKlein held his breath and constructed the silver pocket watch in his mind to calm down.With him already in his Spirit Vision state, he immediately felt different. A scene that came from the deepest recesses of his memories flashed past his eyes.Chimney, rocking chair, table, newspapers, the rusty nails on the door, the tin cans inlaid with silver\u2026The scenes were dark and dull, like a documentary from Earth. However, it was even more blurry and illusory.The scene quickly stacked against what Klein was seeing. The feelings of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and having been here before presented themselves clearly. An illusory and ethereal scream seemed to pass through invisible walls:\u201cHornacis\u2026 Flegrea\u2026 Hornacis\u2026 Flegrea\u2026 Hornacis\u2026 Flegrea\u2026\u201d\u201cIt feels a little familiar.\u201d Klein answered honestly while his brain felt a stabbing pain. Thankfully, he quickly tapped his glabella twice.Hornacis\u2026 The Hornacis mountain range that appeared in original Klein\u2019s diary?That is content that was deciphered from the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook\u2026The murmurs were very similar to one of the previous ones. It involved the word \u2018Hornacis\u2019 Is this a form of enticement?Klein was gripped by shock as he did not dare think deeper, afraid that he would place himself on the trajectory of losing control.Dunn nodded slightly and walked to a cupboard. He suddenly reached out his hand and pulled open its wooden door.The bread inside was moldy and there were about seven gray, stiff dead rats.\u201cLeonard, go downstairs to get patrolling cops and explain the situation here,\u201d instructed Dunn.\u201cAlright.\u201d Leonard turned and left the apartment.Following that, Dunn opened the door to two other bedrooms and did a careful search.After being certain that there were no clues as well as any sign of the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook, Frye also stood up. He wiped his hands with a white handkerchief he brought along with him and said, \u201cThe time of death was more than five days ago. There are no external injuries nor are there any clear signs that it was a result of Beyonder powers. The exact cause of death will require a postmortem.\u201d\u201cDid you discover anything?\u201d Dunn turned to look at Old Neil and Klein.The two who were no longer in Spirit Vision state shook their heads in unison.\u201cApart from the corpse, everything else is normal. Actually, no, there was an invisible energy sealing the apartment in the beginning. As you know, there will usually be similar processes when we use ritualistic magic,\u201d Old Neil thought for a few seconds before adding.Dunn was just about to say something when he looked outside the door. A few seconds later, Klein and Old Neil sensed something and turned to look at the stairwell.A few seconds later, faint footsteps grew louder as Leonard walked up with a policeman.The policeman\u2019s expression changed once he caught the noxious smell. He immediately cooperated with his \u201ccolleague\u201d from the Special Operations Department and began knocking on the doors of the residents on the second floor to gain an understanding of the situation on the third floor.Moments later, the corporal with his two silver chevrons looked at the corpse on the rocking chair.\u201cKaty Stefania Bieber. Between 55 and 60 years old. Widow. Has rented this apartment with her son, Ray Bieber for more than ten years.\u201d\u201cHer husband was formerly a gem artisan. Her son is about thirty years old and is single. He inherited his father\u2019s trade and earns about one pound and fifteen soli a week. According to their neighbors, they have not seen them in more than a week.\u201dBefore the policeman continued, Klein already knew the critical point that followed.Missing. To be more precise, it was unknown where Ray Bieber had gone to!The ancient notebook could very well be on him!\u201cDo you have a picture of Ray Bieber?\u201d Dunn looked at the police officer. He was acting as the role of a high-ranking inspector.However, it was not really acting since he was indeed a high-ranking inspector on the police department\u2019s roster. His salary and various allowances were also paid according to his rank. Of course, it did not include his salary from the Church.The police officer shook his head nervously and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2026 I\u2019ll have to return to the station to search for it. It\u2019s not typical for us to have pictures of every single person.\u201d\u201cGot it. Continue questioning the residents on the first floor. Ask them in detail.\u201d Dunn gave the order.As he watched the police officer leave, he closed the door and turned to Old Neil.\u201cI\u2019ll leave the rest to you. If not, we will have to make all the residents sleep and obtain Ray Bieber\u2019s looks. Yea, I don\u2019t really trust sketches based on verbal descriptions.\u201dOld Neil nodded. He took out a few thumb-sized bottles from a pocket in his black classic robe and scattered the liquids in a particular order.Immediately following that, he pulled out a clump of powder and scattered it in a circle around him.Strangely, a biting smell spread and was not influenced by the nauseating smells in the room. Klein also suddenly noticed that there was an invisible forcefield around him. It separated him from the environment and everyone else. It was like the room in its previous state.Old Neil half-closed his eyes as his lips mumbled a soft and indiscernible incantation. Without being prepared, Klein vaguely heard the words, \u201cGoddess, give me strength,\u201d \u201cWe look forward to the protection of the Night\u2026\u201dHum! A sudden wind tore through the windows and blew up the powder.Klein\u2019s heart quaked suddenly as he felt goosebumps all over him. He found it difficult to describe. A terrifying 'smell\u201d that made him afraid of looking directly spread rapidly.He was confused as he tensed up, unable to relax. It felt as though he had plunged into a state similar to what one would have after working on a highly advanced mathematical problem.Suddenly, Old Neil\u2019s eyes opened, his eyes pitch-black.He took out a fountain pen from his pocket and began drawing on a piece of scrap paper on the table. He was so fast that his entire body was trembling.Klein focused his gaze and saw a face with recessed eyes and a tall nose bridge rapidly appear.When the natural curly short hair was done, Old Neil wrote a single line beneath the portrait.\u201cBlack hair, deep blue eyes. Left of his mouth is a fully ceramic tooth implant.\u201dPada! The fountain pen in Old Neil\u2019s hand fell onto the paper as his body convulsed a few times.\u201cThis is the image of Ray Bieber according to what\u2019s left in the room.\u201d Old Neil whispered as the color of his eyes restored rapidly.Then, he turned back to his original spot and slowly circled it. The invisible forcefield that isolated things immediately dissipated in the form of a breeze.\u201cPraise the Lady.\u201d Old Neil tapped his chest in four spots, forming the shape of the crimson moon.Klein\u2019s taut nerves relaxed as he made more acute observations. He discovered that there was nothing special about Ray Bieber\u2019s facial features. He had a relatively mild bearing. The only thing was that his philtrum sagged clearly.\u201cI\u2019ll try using Dowsing Rod Seeking.\u201d He picked up the portrait and found male clothes in the bedroom and spread them onto the ground.Dunn, Leonard, and Old Neil did not stop him as they watched him place the black cane above the clothes and portrait. Frye was as silent as always.Klein\u2019s eyes turned from brown to black as he finished his recitation, only to release his grip.The black cane stood silently like it was embedded in the ground.\u201cRay Bieber\u2019s location.\u201d Klein silently repeated to himself again.With the sound of humming wind, the cane fell down but kept changing directions while falling. Finally, it began spinning in slight circles.Without any external help, the black cane stood stably again.Klein repeated a few times with the same outcome. All he could do was shake his head at Dunn and Old Neil.A strange power was interfering with his \u201cdivination\u2026\u201dDunn took off his black glove and said to Leonard and Klein, \u201cTake Ray Bieber\u2019s portrait and inquire the residents for a final confirmation. Following that, we will issue a warrant of arrest against him for the murder of his mother.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein held his cane and bent down to pick the portrait.After the neighbors confirmed that the portrait was indeed Ray Bieber, Dunn instructed Leonard and the police officer to finish the procedures at the station. He and Frye headed to a few bars in Tingen City to seek help via other means.Klein and Old Neil returned to Blackthorn Security Company on a public carriage. It was not even eight by the time they arrived; Rozanne had not even clocked in.After closing the door, Klein cocked his head at Old Neil and, hoping to learn and answer his questions, asked him, \u201cWhy would I send the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook to Ray Bieber\u2019s home?\u201dThis was completely in a different direction from Iron Cross Street where Welch stayed.Old Neil walked to the sofa and chuckled.\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious? Who knows what powers inside the notebook you invoked; maybe you did some described ritual out of curiosity and ended up provoking a strange existence that you should not have. The motive of this existence was to have the notebook sent to Ray Bieber and sever all clues, to prevent anyone from discovering it.\u201d\u201cTherefore, apart from you who were selected, Welch and Naya committed suicide; regarding you\u2026 To be frank, I still have no idea how you survived.\u201d\u201cI would like to know too\u2026\u201d Klein sat down as well as he deliberately replied with a wry smile. \u201cI\u2019ve also thought of the guesses you have of the proceedings. However, there\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t understand. Why did I have to hand the notebook to Ray Bieber?\u201dOld Neil shrugged and said, \u201cPerhaps his Life Path\u00a0Number <sup>1</sup> matches the requirements, or maybe he\u2019s one of the last remaining descendants of the Antigonus family. In short, there are too many possibilities\u2026 And why the notebook was sold to Tingen City would have similar reasons.\u201d\u201cI do not think it\u2019s because he\u2019s a descendant.\u201d Klein suddenly felt enlightened before he sighed. \u201cUnfortunately, I did not discover immediately that Ray Bieber and that notebook have vanished.\u201dOld Neil laughed.\u201cThis is something that Dunn has to worry about. As for you, it\u2019s something good.\u201d\u201cWhy do you say so?\u201d Klein frowned in puzzlement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That notebook is also now purportedly in Ray Bieber\u2019s hands. Furthermore, the matter has already been exposed. Regardless of whether you are alive or dead, it will hardly influence any subsequent developments. I think\u2014I believe that the surreptitious existence or mysterious power that caused all of this will not pay you any special attention. It\u2019s just like how you would not pay attention to the ants on the ground. Heh heh, as long as you do not try to make Him recall you.\u201cAnd our arrest warrant for Ray Bieber will quickly reach the Secret Order. They will also be able to guess that it is related to the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook. Believe me, for a secret organization that has been in existence for more than a thousand years, it has many channels of information. Therefore, their focus will be diverted to Ray Bieber\u2019s whereabouts, in a bid to find the notebook before us. They will not, nor is it possible for them to harass, stalk, or deal with you.\u201cLad, congratulations on stepping out from the shadows of the past. What follows will be a brand-new journey filled with sunlight.\u201dKlein nodded when he heard that as he said in a happy and relieved manner, \u201cI hope so.\u201dHaving transmigrated here, he had been enveloped in uncertainty. Now, it felt like it had finally dissipated\u2026However, Klein was still feeling uncertain because the notebook seemed to be tied to him in a certain manner. It went to the point of him bumping into remnant clues coincidentally from a normal mission of rescuing a hostage.He was afraid that there would come a day when a delivery man would send him a parcel, only to realize that it was that Antigonus family notebook after opening it up!Let\u2019s hope everything will go as Old Neil described\u2026 He silently prayed.When Old Neil heard his reply, he immediately scoffed.\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be a devout believer of the Goddess. At this moment, shouldn\u2019t you be drawing the sign of the crimson moon at your chest and say\u2014may Goddess bless us?\u201d\u201cMr. Neil, you don\u2019t seem like one either. A real devotee would not say \u2018what follows will be a brand-new journey filled with sunlight.'\u201d Having been studying mysticism under Old Neil, Klein had established a decent friendship with him, so he did not stand on ceremony to return a sarcastic remark.Both of them locked eyes and chuckled with great rapport. At the same time, they tapped their chests four times.\u201cPraise the Lady!\u201dAt that moment, they heard the grinding sounds of machinery as the main door to Blackthorn Security Company opened.The elegant Mrs. Orianna with her fashionably coiled hair stepped into the reception hall with a light-green dress.\u201cGood morning, Mr. Neil. Good morning, Klein.\u201d She held a small leather handbag as she greeted with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s another fabulous day today. A pretty good day.\u201d\u201cGood morning, Orianna. You are still as beautiful as ten years ago,\u201d replied Old Neil with a chuckle.Orianna\u2019s eyes turned to slits as she upturned her face.\u201cMr. Neil, the way you praise is still as infuriating as ten years ago.\u201dShe enunciated the words \u2018ten years.\u2019\u201cIs that so?\u201d Old Neil looked at Klein, confused. He wore a perplexed look.Never mention anything that will remind the ladies of their age\u2026 As a keyboard warrior that knew a little of everything, Klein instantly understood what had peeved Mrs. Orianna. He smiled lightly and said,\u201cGood morning, Mrs. Orianna. You are as beautiful as always.\u201d\u201cThank you, our outstanding Khoy University graduate.\u201d Orianna smiled with a nod before saying, \u201cThat old butler has already paid the mission\u2019s commission. According to Captain\u2019s rules, half of it will be used as additional funds, while the other half will be split between you and Leonard. But since you aren\u2019t a formal member, you can only take ten percent of the half. Come over later to sign for it.\u201d\u201cHow much did he pay?\u201d Klein asked happily while also feeling the pinch.\u201c200 pounds. This was what he said back then\u2014\u2019Lord, the esteemed Storm! I never imagined or believed that this was resolved just like that! This is even harder than us having a dream! Why is your security company so unknown? It\u2019s an insult to the entire industry!'\u201d Mrs. Orianna mimicked the old butler\u2019s southern accent.Klein thought seriously for a few seconds before saying humorously, \u201cThis is just too unfair for those kidnappers.\u201dTwo Beyonders had resolved the problem quickly using methods that could be described as easy and pleasant\u2026 This is like an adult bullying a few kids while in full combat attire\u2026\u201cThey were just too unlucky. They must have lost the protection of the divine,\u201d said Orianna with a soft laugh. \u201cI told the butler that we were only lucky. One of our informants happened to see the kidnappers bring the child into the hideout. Therefore, do not have too much hopes for us. We really are just a very ordinary security company.\u201dTypically speaking, the more you emphasize something is ordinary, the more extraordinary it is\u2026 Klein lampooned with a smile. He watched Mrs. Orianna walk through the partition and enter the accounting room.Old Neil puckered his lips by the side and said enviously, \u201cYou really are a lucky lad. You haven\u2019t joined us for long and you\u2019ve encountered a job worth 200 pounds.\u201d\u201cIs that very rare?\u201d Klein asked in puzzlement.Prior to this, he was either studying history or mysticism, or wandering aimlessly outside, hoping to find clues with his spiritual perception.\u201cAccording to Orianna\u2019s accounts, we might not encounter a single job an entire week. And most jobs are worth less than twenty pounds.\u201d Old Neil rubbed the moonstone by his wrist and sighed.Following that, he looked at Klein with anticipation.\u201cIf you encounter any similar jobs in the future, remember to inform me.\u201dUpon hearing Old Neil\u2019s words, Klein suddenly felt a strange feeling arise in him. Therefore, he asked directly, \u201cMr. Neil, you seem to be lacking in money. How much do you get paid a week? If you aren\u2019t comfortable telling me, just ignore my question.\u201dOld Neil leaned back into the sofa and chuckled.\u201cThis isn\u2019t something that needs hiding. I\u2019ve been here for so many years. At present, I will obtain salaries from both the Church and the police department every week; a total of twelve pounds.\u201d\u201cA weekly salary of twelve pounds?\u201d Klein blurted out in surprise.A weekly salary of twelve pounds with fifty-two weeks a year, that meant more than 600 pounds a year!Back when he read the Tingen Morning Post and Honest Paper, they had mentioned that high-profile lawyers only earned 800 to 1000 pounds a year. And those were the best lawyers!As for the managers of Benson\u2019s trading company, they only earned six pounds a week. That was already quite a decent job.\u201cYes, such a salary is actually quite generous, and we do not need to pay any taxes,\u201d added Old Neil with a smile.Klein had heard from Benson that one had to pay E-type taxes when their weekly salaries exceeded one pound. In other words, the government and corporate employees had to pay 3% of taxes if they earned one to two pounds, 5% for two to five pounds, 10% for five to ten pounds, and 15% for ten to twenty pounds, capping at 20% for those above twenty pounds.Other than that, he also read of four other kinds of taxes on the newspapers. A-type was related to land, housing, and other earnings from material items. It included property and rent. B-type was a tax paid by farmers. C-type was a tax on profits from bonds, funds, and equities. D-type was commercial, finance, or professional income.\u201cIt\u2019s something admirable.\u201d Klein echoed Old Neil.\u201cHowever\u2014\u201d Old Neil shook his head. \u201cSuch a salary is insufficient for Beyonders like us who have to frequently study the hidden mysteries, practice and attempt rituals.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t materials obtainable via application?\u201d asked Klein in puzzlement.Old Neil scoffed.\u201cThere\u2019s a limitation to it. At times, we have to give a sufficient legitimate reason. If you want to learn more and experiment in the field of mysticism, you can only spend your own dime to buy materials. It can be bought internally or at underground markets.\u201dKlein jolted in surprise as he immediately asked, \u201cThere are Beyonder materials that are sold in underground markets? I thought the Churches would not permit their existence?\u201dHe was lacking in means to obtain materials!With him having a mysterious organization in its nascent stages, he could not always have them settled via the Nighthawks, right?\u201cThere\u2019s no way to control such matters. Yeah, from the viewpoint of mysticism, all beings are sentient with their spirits and they stem from the same source. The materials we use are not limited to those extraordinary creatures. It also comes from ordinary animals, plants, and minerals. For example, the poison hemlock, gold mint leaves, and night vanilla in the bottle of Seer potion; they are items we can encounter frequently in our daily lives. They might not have any extraordinary characteristics, but they have special characteristics. Through concoction and blending, they will derive certain effects. Therefore, this is not a trade that the Church can ban,\u201d explained Old Neil in detail.Without waiting for Klein to say a word, he continued, \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not only the core of extraordinary beings that are of use. For example, the Lavos Squid. Apart from its blood, its eyeballs, skin, and tentacles are pretty good materials. Unless the Church captures it entirely with its own manpower, to completely corner and control any outflows would be a tremendous financial burden. The lower the grade of the extraordinary material, the more it is so. They can only do their best to prevent the more special materials from flowing out.\u201dOld Neil suddenly laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s another important reason. It\u2019s better to know of an underground market than not knowing of it. Under the premise that secret organizations have not been fully eliminated, this is a pretty good strategy. Besides, it can help us obtain materials we are lacking. Of course, with the existence of such markets, contraband items will appear. As long as it\u2019s not something ridiculous or overly dangerous, we will turn a blind eye to it. At most, we would use them to enrich our vaults.\u201d\u201cIs it because the few large Churches put each other in place, so no one can take excessive action?\u201d Klein guessed.Old Neil acknowledged tersely but did not elaborate.\u201cI\u2019m a Seer. In the future, I\u2019ll definitely need to practice and will need more materials. Mr. Neil, can you take me to the underground market to have a look?\u201d Klein requested with a valid reason.Old Neil appeared to be placed in a difficult position.\u201cIn fact, those guys who are active in those places are mostly not Beyonders. Some of them might be aristocrats that like mystery or rich people who have inclinations towards mysticism\u2026 Uh, alright. I have a thirty pound bill that needs paying soon. It wouldn\u2019t be convenient for me to head over there for the time being.\u201d\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Klein never expected the reason to be Old Neil\u2019s owing of money.Moments later, he said with deliberation, \u201cMr. Neil, do you need me to lend you money? I just earned a commission of ten pounds.\u201d\u201cHaha, there\u2019s no need. I\u2019ll be able to settle it.\u201d Old Neil patted the sofa and slowly stood up. \u201cSigh, age is truly an enemy that biological creatures can\u2019t fight. I\u2019m exhausted from last night\u2019s watch. Yeah, revise what I\u2019ve taught you later this morning. Read more documents. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll teach you the foundations of ritualistic magic.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein got up and bade him farewell by taking off his hat.When Captain Dunn did not return at noon, Klein pretended that he was still searching for the notebook as he roamed the streets again.Having earned ten pounds, he no longer needed to wait for the next disbursement of the funds. He could head directly to the Divination Club!Cogitation and Spirit Vision have been occasionally producing murmurings and illusions.

    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 - Hanass VincentPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 48: Hanass VincentTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosIn the Divination Club situated at the second floor of 13 Howes Street, North Borough of Tingen City.Klein saw the beautiful lady that attended to visitors once again.She was still having her brownish-yellow long hair coiled, making her look mature and elegant. It was hard to tell her age.\u201cHello, Mr. Glacis isn\u2019t here today. Would you like to change fortune-tellers today?\u201d said the beautiful lady with a smile.Upon hearing that, Klein, who had just taken off his silk hat and put it back on, was immediately surprised.\u201cYou still remember me?\u201dThat was already five days ago!The woman puckered her lips into a smile.\u201cYou are the first customer that sought Mr. Glacis\u2019s services. You are also the only one to this very day. It\u2019s hard for me not to have a deep impression of you.\u201dWas this the image of him being penny-wise, pound-foolish? Klein lampooned himself as he deliberated a question.\u201cWhen was the last time Mr. Glacis came to the club?\u201dThe lady shot a glance at him and answered seemingly in recollection, \u201cTo be honest, we are unable to grasp when our members will come and go. They have their free will and personal matters to tend to. Well, I do believe that Mr. Glacis hasn\u2019t come to the club since he told your fortune that day.\u201dI wish him the best of luck. May the Goddess bless him\u2026 Klein prayed and did not ask further. Instead, he asked with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m not here for divination services this time. I plan to join the club.\u201d\u201cReally? That\u2019s our pleasure.\u201d The lady expressed a timely look of surprise delight. \u201cFor the first year as a member, the membership fee is five pounds. It will be one pound a year thereafter. I believe there\u2019s no need for me to describe in the details again?\u201dKlein took out a five-pound note he recently received as he watched Henry Augustus I\u2019s portrait depart him.After seriously checking the anti-counterfeit watermark, the woman stored away the note seriously and handed a form to Klein.\u201cPlease feel in your detailed information. Let me prepare the receipt for you.\u201dThere\u2019s a receipt? You should bill it to Blackthorn Security Company\u2026 Klein was amused by his own thoughts as he picked up a fountain pen on the desk. With the blackish-blue ink, he filled in his name, age, address, and company information.However, he had deliberately left his date-of-birth empty. To a Seer, that provided profound mysteries about his body through his Life Path Number.After receiving the receipt and finishing his registration as a member, the lady extended her right hand.\u201cCongratulations on joining Tingen City\u2019s Divination Club. I\u2019m Angelica Barrehart, your hardworking server. This is your member cufflinks. There are special inscriptions on them which will identify you as a member.\u201d\u201cHello, Madam Angelica.\u201d Klein shook her hand and took the dark gold cufflinks.He realized that the special inscription was written with the root word for \u2018fortune-teller\u2019 in Hermes.Angelica retracted her left hand and thought for a few seconds.\u201cMight I ask what divination arts you are most familiar with? Or would you prefer to learn some divination methods from the club? We will consider inviting famous fortune-tellers of the corresponding domain to give classes. We will also introduce you members with similar expertise so that you can have a good time interacting with them.\u201d\u201cI know a bit of every divination art. There\u2019s no need to give me any special considerations.\u201d Klein replied with some embellishments. In addition, he inquired, \u201cCan I begin telling the fortunes of others? I\u2019m not a total rookie.\u201dHe was here to act as a Seer and not learn the divination methods ordinary people could learn.Angelica maintained a polite smile as she said, \u201cYou can tell the fortunes of people anytime in the club. However, before we confirm your skills, we will not promote you when our customers ask. How much do you plan on charging for your fortune-telling?\u201d\u201cTwo pence.\u201d Klein decided to gain at advantage with price while he was still unknown.\u201cWe will go by the standard of taking an eighth, so we will be taking a quarterpence for fees\u2026\u201d Angelica repeated the various rules first before writing Klein\u2019s information into the fortune-teller album which customers could choose from.After all of this was done, she pointed at the meeting room at the far end of the corridor with a smile.\u201cMr. Hanass Vincent is currently explaining astrolabe divination. You can find a quiet spot to listen in. You can also raise your questions if there are any queries.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein walked toward the meeting room with his interest piqued. He wanted to know the differences between what Hanass Vincent and Old Neil said.At that moment, Angelica chased up and whispered, \u201cMr. Moretti, would you want coffee or tea? We provide Sibe black tea, Southville coffee, and Desi coffee.\u201dKlein, who had been reading the papers regularly, knew that these coffees and black tea were considered as one of the inferior varieties, but he also knew that they were definitely of better quality than the ones he had at home. After some thought, he said, \u201cA cup of Southville coffee. Three teaspoons of sugar without milk please.\u201dLoen Kingdom\u2019s Southville was famous for its beer and red wine; many important figures were fond of them. However, their coffee was relatively unknown.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll send it to you in a bit.\u201d Angelica pointed towards the meeting room.Klein slowly walked to the half-closed door and heard a voice in a thick Awwa accent explaining, \u201cAstrolabe divination is a relatively more complex one among the divination arts\u2026\u201dBut that\u2019s only for ordinary people\u2026 Klein silently tagged on a sentence for the speaker. He saw about five tables placed in a circle inside the meeting room. It surrounded a middle-aged man in a black classic robe, Hanass Vincent.The gentleman had obvious dark circles. His brown hair was thick and hard. Each strand stood firmly like a porcupine\u2019s spikes.Apart from that, there was nothing unique about him.Upon seeing Klein enter, Hanass Vincent nodded gently without stopping his class. He only slowed down his speech.Klein had one hand in his pocket while the other held his cane. He found a seat to the sides and sat down, leaning back comfortably in the process. He scanned the circle of six members. There were four men and two women.Some of them were attentively taking notes, whispering, or returning Klein a rueful smile.After placing his cane down, Klein adjusted his halved top hat and tapped his glabella twice in the process.He cast his gaze at Hanass and saw the different colors, brightness, and thickness of his aura.\u201cDark red. He\u2019s a little worried\u2026 Actually, every other part of his body is healthy except that part. I wonder what\u2019s wrong\u2026\u201d Klein listened to the class while muttering to himself.At that moment, he clasped his right hand and covered his mouth to prevent his laughter from sounding. He suddenly felt like he was a quack.He was rather pleased with his Spirit Vision ability. Although he could only make a general judgment and not the details, it was enough to gain him many useful information.After surveying his surroundings, he tapped his glabella twice again as though he was pondering over what Hanass had just said.Astrolabe divination was one of the astromancy divination methods. However, ordinary people could also attempt to interpret things. For instance, the most basic birth horoscope was to determine the inquirer\u2019s fate by determining the positions of the sun, moon, blue and red stars at their birth, the corresponding spots in the sky, matching the representative symbols to the astrolabe, and the corresponding situations of the different constellations.This required the fortune-teller to be able to calculate the states of the planets and constellations which was rather complicated. Of course, there were publications that aided people to look up the values. Some even simplified it by making a vague read with just the constellations.Klein listened silently without interjecting or asking any questions. From time to time, he would caress the hanging topaz at his sleeve or take a sip of the Southville coffee which Angelica had brought in.After some time, Hanass rubbed his glabella and said, \u201cPerhaps you will need to attempt at creating your own astrolabe. Ask me if you have any questions. I will be in Moonstone.\u201dAfter he left, a young man in a white shirt and black vest got up with a smile and walked to Klein\u2019s side.\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Edward Steve.\u201d\u201cMy pleasure. I\u2019m Klein Moretti.\u201d Klein stood up and returned the bow.\u201cAstrolabes are too complicated. Every time I hear about it, I can\u2019t help but doze off,\u201d said Edward self-deprecatingly.Klein grinned and said, \u201cThat\u2019s because Mr. Vincent can\u2019t help but pass the knowledge he grasps to us. It\u2019s like giving us an Intis feast. It\u2019s just indigestible.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d be able to finish the Intis feast. They usually use a huge plate to serve tiny bits of food.\u201d Edward chuckled and sat up. He asked out of curiosity, \u201cAre you new? I\u2019ve not seen you in the two years I was here.\u201d\u201cI just joined the club today,\u201d answered Klein frankly.\u201cWhat are you good at? I\u2019m best at tarot and poker divination,\u201d Edward casually asked.\u201cI know a little of everything, but just a little.\u201d Klein gave a description he used to give himself.He was not being modest since there was just too much mysterious knowledge he had not grasped in the domain of divination.Just as the other members were thinking of talking about horoscope divination, Angelica walked into the meeting room.\u201cMr. Steve, someone wants you to tell their fortunes.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Edward stood up with a smile.\u201cI can tell you are an excellent fortune-teller,\u201d said Klein as he looked at him.\u201cNo, it\u2019s because my price is most suitable,\u201d said Edward with a soft chortle. \u201cWhen ordinary people come to have their fortunes told, they will absolutely not choose the most expensive ones. And unless they had their heads kicked by asses, they would definitely not be choosing the cheapest few. It\u2019s easiest to gain opportunities if you are in the middle.\u201dI\u2019m one of those that had their heads kicked by asses\u2026 When he saw Edward leave, Klein suddenly shook his head with a wry smile.It seems the price I set is problematic\u2026He stood up, picked up his cane, and left the meeting room. He found Angelica again.\u201cI wish to change the prices of my divination. Uh, set it to eight pence.\u201dAngelica took a deep look at him and said, \u201cWe will satisfy your request, but we will also tell customers that you only recently joined the club.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d Klein did not mind as he nodded.At times, mystery was also an important element for a Seer to attract customers.After changing his details, Klein returned to the meeting room.At that moment, he saw Hanass Vincent walk out of Moonstone. He held a silver-coated mirror.This well-known fortune-teller said to the five members in the meeting room, \u201cI recently learned a new divination art. Magic mirror divination. Does anyone want to learn?\u201dMagic mirror divination? That\u2019s not safe\u2026 Klein paused outside the meeting room and frowned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - Divination ArtPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49: Divination ArtTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosAs a Seer who had just stepped through the gates of mysticism, Klein did not dare to claim he knew much. However, he was certain he knew more than ordinary people. He was aware that the various kinds of divination arts could be split into three categories based on particular standards.And that standard was based on the source of the revelation!The first category of divination included tarot, poker, pendulums, dowsing canes, and dreams. By using the inquirer\u2019s own spirituality and its communication with the spirit world to gain a revelation, it could be interpreted for an answer. However, spirit pendulums and dowsing canes had very high requirements of one\u2019s spirituality, Spirit Body, and Astral Projection. Non-Beyonders were unable to obtain precise or clear revelations. Card divination provided fixed symbolism, presenting even an average person\u2019s faint revelation. Dreams were somewhere in between the other forms.The second category included Spirit Numerology and astromancy, as well as their derived forms. The fortune-teller used either the personal details of the inquirer, or changes in nature before using calculations, inference, and interpretation to answer their questions. With this method, the initiative did not lie in the inquirer, but the fortune-teller.The third category used an external third party, separate from the inquirer and the fortune-teller. The Ouija boards that Klein was familiar with from his previous life belonged in this category. They used rituals to ask for a direct answer from the unknown or the supernatural. Even though there was a high chance that an average person would not succeed, there were cases where they managed to communicate with malicious spirits or entities that drove them to insanity. These methods of divination usually led to tragedies.The magic mirror divination that Hanass Vincent mentioned belonged to the third category. In mysticism, mirrors were connected to the unknown and mystery, like they were the doors of the spiritual word. Thus, Klein stopped outside the meeting room, intending to learn how the famous fortune-teller would explain the divination. Klein wanted to ascertain if he needed to inform the captain or not, raiding him at night.Of course, there was a safe way to do the magic mirror divination; one could ask for answers from the seven orthodox divinities. Even if it was very difficult for an ordinary person to receive any real revelations, they would not be in any danger or suffer any after effects.The magic mirror divinations that were strictly controlled by the Nighthawks and Mandated Punishers were those that asked evil gods or mysterious existences for help. Furthermore, the fortune-teller couldn\u2019t randomly fabricate things. Some phrases or qualities had the potential to invite the attention of unknown entities.In the world where the powers of the Beyonders exist, such divinations would often lead to tragedy. Klein even suspected that the original Klein, Welch, and Naya had committed such a forbidden divination by following the instructions of the Antigonus family\u2019s diary.At that moment, Hanass also explained the principle behind magic mirror divination and described the actual process.\u201cFirst, you choose a suitable time and date according to the divinity you believe in. You can decide this using the Astromancy Manual. For example, we all know that Sundays symbolize the Evernight Goddess, for Sunday is the embodiment of rest. 2 to 3 in the early morning, 9 to 10 in the morning, 4 to 5 in the evening, and 11 to midnight are all related to the moon; thus, they are controlled by the Evernight Goddess. Thus, fortune-tellers that pray to the Evernight Goddess can use magic mirror divination during these times on a Sunday.\u201dQuite a good foundation\u2026 Klein nodded slightly while using the half-closed door to the meeting room to conceal himself.It had to be said that with the seven major churches keeping each other in check, some mysticism knowledge had indeed leaked. For example, many of the meanings behind the symbolism could be found in the Astromancy Manual. However, without the potions or Beyonder powers, ordinary people were unable to obtain the desired effects.\u201cSecond, we must scrutinize the mirror carefully. It must be a mirror coated with silver. You place the mirror at the position representing the moon\u2026\u201d Hanass demonstrated with the prop in his hand.No, what he needs now is spirit dowsing. First, choose a position and recite the phrase, \u2018This place is suitable for magic mirror divination\u2019 seven times in your head, then see which direction the pendulum turns. Clockwise for true, counter-clockwise for false\u2026 Of course, if you are asking for answers from a malicious supernatural entity, the position would not matter. Rather, it would depend on whether the entity is interested in answering your questions\u2026 Klein silently corrected him.At this point, he felt like a teacher listening in on a lesson\u2026Hanass Vincent could not hear Klein\u2019s mental musings as he described the preparations in detail in a normal tone.When the members finished taking notes, he continued explaining, \u201cAfter showering, confirm that you have drawn all your curtains and locked your doors. After that, light up a candle and place it in front of the mirror before sincerely praying to the divinity you believe in. Try to keep your questions simple as there\u2019s no need for fanciful embellishment\u2026 After praying seven times, pick up your mirror and gently toss it on the ground. Make sure to be gentle\u2026 Remember the way it shatters as that is a revelation from the gods\u2026 I will tell you the main symbolisms in a second.\u201dPhew, this is orthodox magic mirror divination. Klein heaved a sigh of relief as he walked into the meeting room and sat back down in his previous seat. He finished the rest of his Southville coffee in one gulp.So-called \u201corthodox\u201d divination meant that it was possible to obtain revelations, but it was impossible to truly interpret it.And for Beyonders who reached this step, they could look straight into the mirror to obtain clear information if they received a response!As there were many potential symbolisms after the shattering, Hanass taught for a long while. He was not done even when Edward Steve returned to the room after finishing his fortune-telling.Klein did not ask what Edward did for his fortune-telling or what method did he use since it was an unspoken rule among fortune-tellers. While acting as a Seer, he naturally had to abide by it strictly unless the other party mentioned it.\u201cI discovered that many a time, our interpretation is too vague, as though it\u2019s meeting different requests, allowing different people to find a description of themselves from the interpretation.\u201d Edward drank a mouthful of Sibe black tea and said with a soft sigh. \u201cFor example, those that encounter adversities and calamities will eventually see the light of hope. Heh heh, but no one knows when the light of hope will come. For example, a journey might not be very smooth-sailing, but you will definitely arrive alive. Hehe, the dead will not retort me.\u201dAs he did not listen from the beginning, he ignored Hanass\u2019s magic mirror divination class.\u201cSurvival bias,\u201d added Klein with a smile.Survival bias generally meant that a lot of statistics would only include those who were alive and lucky. The data would ignore the dead; therefore, the results would be clearly biased.\u201cRight. Emperor Roselle was really a philosopher,\u201d marveled Edward.\u2026 Speechless, Klein raised his empty cup and pretended to take a sip.The members were fully immersed in the study of horoscopes and magic mirror divination the entire afternoon. Occasionally, they would also discuss with Klein and Edward.And when that happened, Klein would try his best to meet his duty as an informal member of the Nighthawks. He would try hard to steer the topic away from anything related to Beyonders or dangerous ideas.However, he failed at the thing he wanted to do the most. A few inquirers came, but none of them picked him to do their fortune-telling.Perhaps I have to be more proactive in entertaining them. Should I use a few phrases like \u2018you are plagued with bad luck,\u2019 \u2018you have been unlucky recently,\u2019 or \u2018nothing you do will happen smoothly?\u2019 No, that\u2019s nothing like a Seer\u2026 With this in mind, Klein could not help but shake his head in self-deprecation.He picked up his cane, stood up, and left after bidding everyone farewell.At half past five, Edward Steve put on his coat and was prepared to walk out the Divination Club when he suddenly saw a familiar figure.\u201cGood afternoon, Glacis. Long time no see,\u201d he greeted with a smile. He saw his friend with similar interests as him wear his usual format suit with a black bow tie. In front of his chest hung a monocle.Immediately following that, he noticed that his friend did not look well. Even his soft blond hair looked dry.\u201cGood afternoon, Edward\u2026 Cough.\u201d Glacis with his hat in hand suddenly used his fist to cover his mouth as he coughed a few times.Edward asked out of concern, \u201cYou seem to be ill?\u201d\u201cA very serious illness. It even turned into pneumonia. If it wasn\u2019t for my wife who met an impressive apothecary and gave me a magical medicine, you would have probably had to visit me at the cemetery.\u201d Glacis\u2019s tone was filled with a lingering fear and joy.\u201cLord, I can\u2019t believe it. You were so healthy previously. Look at you, you look so frail now! I remember when I did divination on you, there were no signs that indicated that you would get a serious illness.\u201d Edward waved his cane and said with an astonished sigh.\u201cMy own divination had the same result as yours. Perhaps we are not qualified fortune-tellers. Besides\u2026\u201d Glacis suddenly recalled the happenings on Monday as his expression turned abnormally serious.At that moment, the beautiful lady, Angelica, came over and bowed with a pleasant smile.After exchanging greetings, she first showed concern for Glacis\u2019s health and provided some suggestions. Then, she mentioned in passing, \u201cMr. Glacis, Mr. Moretti, who requested your divination services previously, has joined our club as well.\u201d\u201cThe one who got me to tell his fortune?\u201d Glacis\u2019s eyes lit up immediately. \u201cLord, where is he?\u201d\u201cHe just left.\u201d Angelica and Edward were unable to comprehend Glacis\u2019s abnormal reaction.Glacis took two steps in agitation and said, \u201cThe next time he comes, please ask him when he will come if I\u2019m not around!\u201d\u201cGlacis, what happened? Did that Mr. Klein Moretti do something to you?\u201d asked Edward in puzzlement.Glacis raised his arm and stared straight into Edward\u2019s and Angelica\u2019s probing gazes. He said in excitement, \u201cHe\u2019s a very, very, very magical\u2026\u201dHe lowered his arm and said after using \u201cvery\u201d thrice, \u201cDoctor!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Would emergency matters at the security company be more dangerous?\u201d Benson forked a potato from a dish of potato-stewed beef as he raised the matter in concern.Klein carefully spat out the bones from a pan-fried dish and gave his prepared answer.\u201cA batch of historical documents needed immediate shipping to Backlund. I had to be present to handle the handover and make sure there was nothing missing. As you can guess, the bunch of fist-swinging bastards don\u2019t know any Feysac.\u201dUpon hearing his answer, Benson, who had finished chewing his food, could not help but sigh.\u201cKnowledge is truly important.\u201dMaking use of this opportunity, Klein took out the remaining five-pound note and handed it to Benson.\u201cThis is my additional payment I received today. It\u2019s time you get some decent clothes too.\u201d\u201cFive pounds?\u201d Benson and Melissa said in unison.Benson took the note and looked at it repeatedly. He said in both shock and doubt, \u201cThis security company sure is generous\u2026\u201dHis weekly salary was one pound ten soli, which meant six pounds exactly every four weeks. He only earned one additional pound from this additional payment!And with that salary, he had managed to support his siblings, giving them a decent place to stay and allowing them to eat meat two to three times a week. Every year, they could get a few new clothes!\u201cAre you doubting me?\u201d Klein deliberately returned with a question.Benson chuckled. \u201cI doubt you have the ability nor the guts to rob a bank.\u201d\u201cYou aren\u2019t someone who can lie,\u201d Melissa answered seriously after lowering her fork and knife.I-I\u2019m now someone used to lying\u2026 Klein immediately felt a little ashamed.Although it was a result of the circumstances of his reality, his sister\u2019s belief in him left him melancholic.\u201cIt was relatively urgent and important today. I also played a crucial role\u2026 which is the reason for the five pounds,\u201d Klein explained.In a way, what he said was the truth.As for the five pounds that he would be reimbursed with\u2014the one he would use to join the Divination Club\u2014he planned on concealing it. Firstly, if he brought five pounds home again, he would truly scare his siblings, making them suspect he was doing something illegal. Secondly, he had to save to buy additional materials to practice being a Seer and to grasp more mysticism knowledge.Benson bit off a mouthful of wheat bread in satisfaction and thought for more than ten seconds.\u201cThe work I\u2019m at doesn\u2019t need any decent clothes. Well, to be precise, the clothes at home are sufficient.\u201dWithout waiting for Klein to persuade him, he suggested, \u201cWith this additional income, we would truly have savings. I plan on buying a few books on accountancy and studying. Klein, Melissa, I do not wish that my weekly salary remain below two pounds in five years. Heh, as you know, my boss and manager have shit for brains. Their mouths stink the moment they open them.\u201d\u201cExcellent idea,\u201d agreed Klein. He also took the opportunity to steer the conversation. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you read some of the grammar books in my room? To be truly dignified and to earn a handsome pay, that\u2019s something rather critical.\u201dPerhaps, in the times to come, the civil servant examinations will appear in Loen Kingdom. Preparing ahead of time would give him the advantage\u2026Benson\u2019s eyes lit up when he heard that.\u201cI\u2019ve indeed forgotten about that. Here, let\u2019s toast to a beautiful future.\u201dHe did not drink rye beer. Instead, he poured clear oyster soup into three cups and clinked his cup with his siblings\u2019.After drinking the clear soup, he looked at his sister who was wrestling with the pan-fried fish. He chuckled and said, \u201cAside from Benson\u2019s books, I think Melissa needs a new dress too.\u201dMelissa looked up and shook her head incessantly.\u201cNo, I think it\u2019s best\u2026\u201d\u201cTo save it up.\u201d Klein finished the sentence for her.\u201cYeah.\u201d Melissa nodded in agreement.\u201cIn fact, if you do not seek the best fabrics and the newest designs, it would not be too expensive. We can save up the remaining money,\u201d said Klein in a manner which did not allow for disagreement.Benson added, \u201cMelissa, are you planning on wearing the old dress again to Selena\u2019s sixteenth birthday bash?\u201dSelena Wood was Melissa\u2019s classmate and good friend. She came from quite a good family background. Her elder brother was a practicing solicitor and her father was a senior employee of Backlund Bank\u2019s Tingen branch.However, the so-called bash was only a dinner invitation to friends where they chatted and played cards.\u201cAlright.\u201d Melissa lowered her head and mumbled a response. Then, she ruthlessly forked a piece of stewed beef.After a short silence, she suddenly recalled something and looked up abruptly.\u201cMrs. Shaud from next door got her maidservant to send a calling card over. She wishes to make a formal visit on Sunday, at four in the afternoon tomorrow. She wants to get to know her new neighbors.\u201d\u201cMrs. Shaud?\u201d Klein looked at his siblings, confounded.Benson rapped the side of the table with his fingers and appeared to be thinking.\u201cMrs. Shaud from 4 Daffodil Street? I met her husband before. He\u2019s a senior solicitor.\u201d\u201cSenior solicitor\u2026 Perhaps he knows Selena\u2019s brother,\u201d said Melissa with some hints of delight.We are at 2 Daffodil Street\u2026 Klein nodded slightly.\u201cIt\u2019s imperative we get to know our neighbors, but as you know, I still have to be at the company on Sunday. I only have time off on Monday. Please pass my apologies to Mrs. Shaud.\u201dWith that said, he suddenly recalled the neighbors of his former life when he was young, as well as the neighbors in the apartment from Iron Cross Street. He was amused as he sighed lightly.\u201cTo have formal visits\u2026 Shouldn\u2019t neighbors get to know each other through natural interaction?\u201d\u201cHaha, Klein, that\u2019s because you aren\u2019t aware. You have read a lot of newspapers recently, but you have not broached the magazines catered towards families and middle-aged women. They placed families with an annual income of a hundred to a thousand pounds as middle-class. They promoted it as the framework of the entire kingdom and praised how the middle-class doesn\u2019t have the arrogance of the aristocrats and the wealthy, nor are they as crass as the low-income brackets.\u201dBenson lightly and happily explained, \u201cThese magazines impart many simplified ceremonies which the aristocrats practice in their interactions. As such, it becomes a target of the middle-class. Thus, this results in the differences between intimate calls, semi-formal calls, and formal calls.\u201dAs he spoke, he shook his head and chuckled.\u201cTypically, gentlemen, madams, and ladies who view themselves in this class will be very particular about details. They will visit their neighbors and friends from two to six in the afternoon. It\u2019s known as a morning\u00a0call <sup>1</sup> .\u201d\u201cMorning call?\u201d Klein and Melissa asked in surprise.Why was a visit from two to six in the afternoon a morning call?Benson put down his fork and knife, threw his hands up, and smiled.\u201cI do not know why either. All I did was read the magazines my female colleague brought. Yeah, perhaps it\u2019s because they wear their morning gowns to make the call\u2026\u201dMorning gowns were a form of formal attire worn during Mass or gatherings. Later, it was considered as formal attire for the day, different from the formal attire for evening functions.\u201cAlright. Remember to buy some good coffee powder and tea leaves in the afternoon. Buy some muffins and lemon egg tarts from Mrs. Smyrin. We must not ill-treat our neighbors.\u201d Klein chuckled as he dipped his remaining bread into the meat sauces, grabbed some potato and put it into his mouth.\u2026The next morning was a Sunday morning.Klein finished the last mouthful of inferior tea, put down the newspapers, and wore his halved top hat. Picking up his silver-inlaid black cane, he sauntered out the door and took a public carriage to Zouteland Street.He greeted Rozanne who was planning to sleep in the break room after finishing her night duty. After which, he went all the way down to the basement.After turning a corner, he met a Nighthawk member, Sleepless Royale Reideen.She looked like a cold lady. Her brows were long and slender, sitting atop large eyes. Her hair was a silky-smooth black.\u201cGood morning, Madam Reideen,\u201d Klein greeted with a smile.Royale used her deep blue eyes to glance at him and nodded indiscernibly in return.The two quickly passed by each other when Royale stopped and said with her eyes trained forward, \u201cRitualistic magic is a very dangerous thing.\u201dAh\u2026 Klein was taken aback. By the time he turned around, all he saw was her departing back.\u201cThank you.\u201d He frowned and shouted at Royale Reideen\u2019s back.After taking a left band, he quickly met Old Neil inside the armory, as well as Bredt who should not have been there.\u201cLet\u2019s go to my place. I\u2019ve already received the corresponding materials. Bredt has agreed to watch the armory for me,\u201d said Old Neil with a chuckle.Klein was immediately surprised.\u201cWe aren\u2019t doing it here?\u201dOld Neil held a silver chest and tutted.\u201cThere\u2019s no space here to practice ritualistic magic.\u201dKlein did not ask further. He followed Old Neil up to the streets and took a public carriage to the North Borough\u2019s suburbs.Old Neil\u2019s place was a bungalow. The garden in front of it was filled with roses, golden mint, and other \u201cmaterials.\u201dThe moment he entered, there was a carpeted foyer. There were two high-back chairs and an umbrella rack.Through the foyer was an expansive living room. The walls were plastered with light-colored wallpaper. The floors were a dark brown color. In the middle of the room was a tiny carpet with floral imprints and placed above it was a heavy round table.Surrounding the table were comfortable long benches, single-seaters, and a piano.\u201cMy deceased wife loved music.\u201d Old Neil pointed at the piano and mentioned in passing, \u201cThe sofa and coffee table are in the bedrooms\u2026 Let\u2019s do the ritualistic magic in the living room.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Klein replied cautiously.After Old Neil put down the silver chest, he laughed and said, \u201cLet me demonstrate to you ritualistic magic. Make sure to observe and remember the ritual.\u201dAs he spoke, he took out a fake goatskin parchment from the chest. It was specially made and it had strange pictures drawn on it with black ink that exuded a serene fragrance.Klein kept watching and finally discovered that Old Neil was seemingly, likely, possibly drawing an IOU!When Old Neil filled in the corresponding field with the number \u201c30\u201d and the corresponding \u201c\u00a3\u201d symbol, Klein could not help but ask out of puzzlement and confusion, \u201cMr. Neil, what kind of ritualistic magic are you doing?\u201dOld Neil coughed and answered very seriously, \u201cI\u2019ll be using magic to settle that debt of thirty pounds today.\u201dYou can do that? Klein\u2019s eyes widened as his mouth gaped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Didn\u2019t Dunn tell you the maxim of the Mystery Pryers? Do as you wish but do no harm!\u201dAlthough this maxim originated from the secret and evil Moses Ascetic Order organization, Beyonders who choose the path of Moses Ascetic Order have proven that it\u2019s right through their own experiences. As long as one strictly abides to it and shows the needed fear and reverence, the risk of losing control will be minimized. The contrary has similarly been established.\u201cYour suspicion towards me is an insult to Mystery Pryers!\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201d Klein did not hesitate to apologize.He had indeed forgotten that Dunn Smith had once mentioned the maxim.Old Neil was not truly angry. In a blink of an eye, he chuckled.\u201cA pity. Very few Beyonders choose to be Seers. There is no corresponding maxim to help you.\u201dBut I have Emperor Roselle\u2019s diaries\u2026 Yes, strictly abiding to the maxim has a hint of \u201cacting\u2026\u201d Klein suddenly came to this thought as he nodded as if in deep thought.Old Neil did not continue. He removed the vases and other items from the round table and placed them in a corner.Immediately following that, he took out both a crimson red and black candle from the silver chest. He explained, \u201cIf ordinary people attempt ritualistic magic, they have to follow the results from astromancy or read corresponding manuals. They have to choose suitable dates and times. For example, the day representing the Goddess\u2014the period when She rules over the moon. But for us Beyonders, especially Beyonders good in this domain, there\u2019s no need for that. Our acute spiritual perception and potent Astral Projections are key.\u201cOf course, if you are not confident about the ritualistic magic you are attempting, it\u2019s best to choose a suitable date and time. It can increase the probability of success.\u201cAh right. This is based on a premise. Remember carefully to abide strictly by the rules!\u201dOld Neil placed two candles and turned to the side and looked at Klein, saying very solemnly, \u201cLow-Sequence Beyonders are not strong enough. Almost all the ritualistic magic they can perform are the seeking of external powers and help. Therefore, you can only consider orthodox divinities like the Goddess or the Lord of Storms. Absolutely\u2014 absolutely do not attempt to communicate with the unknown or unpredictable existences. Even if people believe in them or the promises recorded are filled with enticements!\u201cBelieve me, don\u2019t take any chances. As long as you attempt once, you will go down a slippery slope into the abyss with no return. Any work or resistance will only slow it down with no way to change the trajectory.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll remember!\u201d Klein said in a deep voice. However, he felt a little afraid.My luck enhancement ritual has apparently sought power from an unknown and unpredictable existence\u2026Furthermore, I have gained powers capable of pulling people into the fog that even a senior Beyonder like the Hanged Man finds unbelievable. Well\u2026 At least I think he is a senior Beyonder\u2026Thankfully, I haven\u2019t gone mad or have any signs of losing control\u2026While worrying over this, he proactively changed the subject.\u201cSo, Nighthawks should seek the help of the Goddess?\u201d\u201cNo one will stop you if you pray to the Lord of Storms. However, we are unable to tell from our ritualistic magic whether He replies with malicious intent or not. The outcome will be distorted in unpredictable ways.\u201d Old Neil successfully made Klein give up the idea in a joking manner.There was no so-called \u201cbest,\u201d only \u201cnecessary!\u201dAfter his exhortations, Old Neil picked up a crimson red candle and said, \u201cBy using candles made of moon flowers and dark-red sandalwood, it will represent the Goddess\u2019s identity as Lady of Crimson in the ritualistic magic.\u201dHe pointed to the black candles and said, \u201cCandles made of night vanilla and slumber flowers represent the night.\u201dAs he spoke, he placed the black candle on the top left end of the round table while the red candle was placed on the top right end.\u201cWhy do we symbolize the Goddess with only two candles? She is also the Mistress of Calm and Silence, Empress of Disaster and Horror, and Mistress of Calm and Silence.\u201dOld Neil chuckled.\u201cThat\u2019s right. This is something I wished you asked.\u201cBefore their fall, the Moses Ascetic Order had a very good relationship with the Church. Their beliefs and results on ritualistic magic have heavily influenced us.\u201cThey believe that all objects are numeric. Every number has a spirituality and in ritualistic magic, 0 represents the unknown or Chaos. It symbolizes the state of the universe before it was born. 1 represents a beginning, the first Creator. 2 represents the world and various divinities that were produced from His body. 3 represents contact between divinities and material objects to create all things. Here, using two candles represents the Goddess while the third candle is for you.\u201cWhich two candles and which two symbols to have depend on the intended effects the of ritualistic magic.\u201dThree begets all\u00a0things <sup>1</sup> ? All things stem from three? Klein could not help but recall certain things from his previous life.Seeing Klein listen attentively, Old Neil took a third candle and said, \u201cThis is the candle representing \u2018me.\u2019 It\u2019s a very ordinary candle which only has a little bit of mint added. Take note that plants like roses, lemons, mint, moon flower, night vanilla, and slumber flower are beloved and cherished by the Goddess.\u201cViewing it from another angle, the three candles represent the bodies, spiritualities and godhood of every person.\u201dAfter finishing the description, Old Neil placed the third candle in the middle of the round table.He then took out a bottle of concocted \u201cFull Moon Essence Oil,\u201d a huge cauldron engraved with the Dark Sacred Emblem, a silver knife with gorgeous patterns, a cup of water, and a saucer of coarse salt.\u201cTo Beyonders who are not good at ritualistic magic, there is a need for bells, crystal balls, silver cups, incense or other supplementary items. However, Mystery Pryers and Seers have no need for that. These artifacts are already sufficient.\u201dOld Neil placed the fake goatskin parchment with the IOU just below the cauldron and used a special quill to hold down one corner.He turned to Klein and said, \u201cRitualistic magic needs a clean spiritual environment where you will not be disturbed. And that requires us to create it. The steps are to first enter Cogitation. Focus your mind and with the supplementary items, draw out our strength, and construct it around us. For example, Ray Bieber\u2019s house had used Holy Night Powder while I\u2019ll be using a ritual silver dagger.\u201cThroughout the entire process, we have to go according to the outcome we desire to confirm the symbolism and corresponding incantation. Incantations are best done in Hermes because ancient Hermes stemmed from Nature. It\u2019s akin to ancient Dragonish and ancient Elvish. The effects are very direct, lacking the necessary concealment and protection. It easily causes the caster to fall into danger. This is also why it has been modified. However, it\u2019s more effective.\u201cAlright, I have to focus on the ritualistic magic. I won\u2019t explain things to you any further. Pay attention by watching and listening. Remember any problems and ask me when everything is done.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein took two steps back and trained his eyes on Old Neil.Old Neil\u2019s eyes rapidly darkened as invisible wind around him spun.He was silent for a moment, going from left to right, then up to down, using his psyche to cause friction and consecutively light up the three candles.Following that, he picked up the silver knife and stabbed it into the coarse salt. Then, he chanted in Hermes:\u201cI sanctify you, blade of pure silver!\u201cI cleanse and purify you, allowing you to serve me in this ritual!\u2026\u201cIn the name of the Evernight Goddess, the Lady of Crimson\u2026\u201cYou have been sanctified!\u201dAfter a short but powerful syllable, Old Neil drew a silver knife and inserted it into a cup of clear water. Then, he raised it and pointed to the space beyond the round table.He aimed the blade tip in the periphery and took a step forward, circling the round table. Every step he took made Klein feel an invisible energy spew out of the silver knife. It was filled with spirituality as it connected with the air, forming a completely sealed wall.After walking one round, the altar was completely isolated from its surroundings.Old Neil stood in front of the round table and put the silver knife down. He picked up the bottle of Full Moon Essence Oil and dripped three drops on the black, dark red, and ordinary candles.Sizzle!A thin mist emanated as everything seemed to become veiled in mystery.Old Neil put down the glass bottle and looked at the fake goatskin parchment silently for two minutes. Then, he picked up the quill and drew a mark he controlled\u2014a square that framed all the content, indicating that he was in control of the debt.Following that, he drew another \u2018cross,\u2019 indicating that it was canceled.Upon reaching this step, he picked up the parchment with one hand and tapped his glabella with the other to activate his Spirit Vision.Another invisible and exuberant energy bloomed as Old Neil whispered a chant:\u201cI pray for the power of the dark night.\u201cI pray for the power of the crimson.\u201cI pray for the Goddess\u2019s loving grace.\u201cPlease provide me with the funds to pay this IOU.\u201cNight vanilla, an herb that belongs to the red moon, please bestow your powers to my incantation!\u201d\u201cMoon flower, an herb that belongs to the red moon, please bestow your powers to my incantation!\u201d\u2026Klein was completely flabbergasted listening from the side. All sorts of thoughts arose in him.Such an incantation can work?Although it was recited from written Hermes\u2026Isn\u2019t this way too simple and down to earth?Wouldn\u2019t the Goddess be angry and multiply the debt severalfold?At that moment, the candlelight lit up suddenly!After Old Neil finished his incantation, he closed his eyes for two minutes. He picked up the Full Moon Essence Oil and dripped one drop onto each of the three candles.Immediately following that, he grabbed the parchment and pulled it close to the candle representing \u201cme.\u201d When it ignited, he immediately threw it into the cauldron.Old Neil closed his eyes again as he seemed to sense the burning of the IOU.He opened his eyes after a moment and looked toward the black Sacred Emblem on the cauldron. The parchment was already completely incinerated.\u201cPraise the Lady!\u201d Old Neil tapped his chest in four spots, forming the shape of the crimson moon. Then, he extinguished the candles in the opposite order as he lit them.After finishing everything, he used the silver knife to rip apart the invisible wall around him.A huge wind stirred immediately as Old Neil heaved a sigh of relief.\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Klein asked in a daze. \u201cHas the IOU been settled? How?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either. Anyways, it will be settled in a reasonable manner,\u201d said Old Neil with a smile as he threw up his hands.This\u2026 Klein was unsure what expression or words to use as a response.Isn\u2019t this a little unreliable?<ol>This is a Daoism saying: Dao begets One, One begets Two, Two begets Three, Three begets all things.</ol>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Let\u2019s discuss the ritualistic magic.\u201d Old Neil put away the candles, cauldron, silver knife, and other items with a relaxed expression.Klein really wanted to shrug his shoulders like the Americans in his previous life, but ultimately could not bring himself to do something that ungentlemanly.He turned his focus toward the ritualistic magic and threw out detailed questions that puzzled him, receiving answers from them. For example, the incantations had a particular format. As long as they were satisfied and the key meaning was expressed in Hermes, the rest could be left to one\u2019s creativity. Of course, blasphemy or disrespectful descriptions were absolutely forbidden.The mysticism class lasted until noon before Old Neil coughed twice.\u201cWe have to return to Zouteland Street.\u201dWith that said, he grumbled in an indistinct manner, \u201cTo get these bloody materials, I missed my beloved breakfast.\u201dKlein looked around both amused and puzzled.\u201cMr. Neil, do you have a chef? Or a maidservant in charge of cooking?\u201dA weekly salary of twelve pounds could hire several servants!According to the newspapers, with board and lodging provided, hiring an ordinary chef cost anywhere between twelve to fifteen soli a week. It did not even need a pound. A maidservant to do miscellaneous chores was even cheaper. Their weekly salaries ranged between three soli six pence to six soli. Of course, one could not bear any hope of them having any culinary skills.Uh, that\u2019s not right. With Mr. Neil\u2019s debt of thirty pounds, it\u2019s only normal he doesn\u2019t hire any chefs or servants\u2026It seems I\u2019ve asked another question I should not have asked\u2026While Klein regretted his question, Old Neil shook his head without minding it.\u201cI often attempt ritualistic magic, research extraordinary items, and read corresponding documents at home, so I don\u2019t nor is it possible that I hire ordinary people as chefs, butlers or maidservants. I only hire someone to clean up the place regularly. And if they are not ordinary people, do you think they will be willing to do such jobs?\u201d\u201cI seem to have asked a silly question. It\u2019s possibly because I will not do anything that involves mysticism at home,\u201d explained Klein in a self-deprecating manner.Old Neil had long stood up, wore his round felt hat, and while walking out the door, rambled on.\u201cI seem to smell pan-fried foie gras\u2026 Once the IOU is completely settled, I\u2019ll definitely have one set! For lunch, I\u2019ll definitely eat roasted pork glazed with apple juices. No, that\u2019s not enough. I must have a sausage infused with mashed potatoes\u2026\u201dYou are making me hungry\u2026 Klein swallowed his saliva as he caught up to Old Neil and headed for the nearby public carriage stop.After returning to Zouteland Street, Old Neil suddenly grunted after stepping down the carriage.\u201cWhat do I see? Goddess, what am I seeing?\u201dHe was suddenly as nimble as a seventeen or eighteen-year-old lad. He quickly came to the roadside and picked up an item.Klein leaned close out of curiosity and looked carefully. He realized it was a wallet with fine workmanship.With his lack of experience, he could barely tell if the dark brown wallet was made of buffalo skin or sheepskin, but he noticed a small light-blue logo embroidered on the side of the wallet\u2014a white dove spreading its wings as if ready to take off.That was Klein\u2019s first impression. The second thing he noticed was the stack of paper notes in the bulging wallet.There were more than twenty gray notes imprinted with black ink\u2014gold pounds!Old Neil opened up the wallet and pulled out the notes. When he looked at it carefully, he immediately chuckled.\u201cTen-pound notes. The honorable Founder and Protector, William I. Wow, Goddess, there\u2019s a total of thirty notes. There\u2019s also a few five-pound notes, one-pound and five-soli notes.\u201dMore than three hundred pounds? That\u2019s a huge amount of money in every meaning of the word! I might not even earn that much in ten years\u2026 Klein\u2019s breathing turned heavy involuntarily.As the amount of gold pounds was immense, picking up such a wallet was equivalent to picking up a briefcase of banknotes in his previous life.\u201cI wonder which gentleman dropped it\u2026 He can\u2019t be someone ordinary,\u201d analyzed Klein calmly.Such a wallet was clearly not a woman\u2019s.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to care who he is,\u201d said Old Neil with a chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we attempted to divine and take money that doesn\u2019t belong to us. We should wait here for a moment. I believe the gentleman will soon be back searching for it. It\u2019s not something that can be given up no matter who it is.\u201dKlein heaved a sigh of relief. He had a brand-new understanding of Old Neil\u2019s morals.He was rather worried that he would have used the Goddess\u2019s bestowment as an excuse and paid off his debt. He was still wondering how to prevent it and persuade him otherwise.Is this \u201cdo as you wish, but do no harm?\u201d Klein suddenly learned something new.The duo did not wait more than a minute by the streets when a luxurious four-wheeled carriage zoomed over. Its side had a light blue logo with a dove spreading its wings.The carriage stopped, and a middle-aged man dressed in a black formal suit with a bow tie of the same color alighted. He looked at the wallet, took off his hat, and said politely, \u201cSirs, that should be my master\u2019s wallet.\u201d\u201cYour logo is proof of everything, but I need to make additional verifications. This is to be responsible for all parties. Might I ask how much money is there in the wallet?\u201d replied Old Neil politely.The middle-aged man was taken aback as he said in a self-deprecating manner almost immediately, \u201cAs a butler, I do not know how much money Master had in his wallet. Sorry. Please permit me to ask.\u201d\u201cAs you wish.\u201d Old Neil gestured for him to do as he pleased.The middle-aged man walked to the carriage\u2019s side and through the window, conversed with the person within.He approached Klein and Old Neil again and smiled.\u201cMore than 300 pounds, but less than 350 pounds. My master does not remember the exact number.\u201dDoes not remember\u2026 That\u2019s really some filthy rich guy. If I had that much money on me, I would definitely be counting it again and again\u2026 Klein was filled with envy.Old Neil nodded and handed the wallet back.\u201cWith the Goddess as proof, this belongs to you.\u201dThe middle-aged man took the wallet over and did an estimate before pulling out three ten-pound notes.\u201cMy master is Sir Deweyville. He wishes to commend your morals. This is what an honest person should receive. Please do not reject it.\u201dSir Deweyville? The one who established the Deweyville Trust? The Sir Deweyville who provided cheap rental apartments to the working class? Klein immediately remembered the name.He was a knight that his brother respected but did not believe was grounded in reality.\u201cThank you, Sir Deweyville. He is a kind and generous gentleman.\u201d Old Neil did not stand on ceremony as he received the three notes.After watching Sir Deweyville\u2019s carriage depart, he turned to look at Klein when he saw that there was no one around. He flicked the notes and chuckled.\u201cThirty pounds. The IOU is settled.\u201cI said it will be settled in a reasonable manner.\u201cThis is the power of magic.\u201d\u2026Holy f**king power of magic! That actually works!? Klein was once again flabbergasted.A few minutes later, he entered the building\u2019s stairwell and while heading to the security company, he asked puzzledly, \u201cMr. Neil, why didn\u2019t you ask for more money?\u201d\u201cDo not be greedy. One must take care not to be greedy when doing ritualistic magic. Temperance is a critical trait needed by every Mystery Pryer if they wish to live long,\u201d explained Old Neil happily.\u2026In a huge ballroom, candles were burning on a few chandeliers, emitting a fragrance that soothed the minds of people. By the sheer number of candles, they produced a light in no way inferior to that of gas lamps.There were long tables with pan-fried foie gras, grilled steak, roasted chicken, fried tonguefish, Desi oysters, mutton stew, cream soup, and other delicacies. In addition, there were bottles of Mist Champagne, Aurmir grape wine, and Southville red wine. They were all glistening with a tempting glow under the light.Servants in red vests carried trays with crystal cups and shuttled between the gentlemen and ladies dressed both elegantly or gorgeously.Audrey Hall was wearing a collared, high-waisted, pale-white dress with engageantes. Her corset was tightly fitted, while her voluminous layers were puffed up perfectly with a cage crinoline.Her long blond hair was coiled up in an elegant bun and the earrings, necklace, and rings she wore sparkled brightly. At her feet were a pair of white dancing shoes that were stitched with roses and diamonds.How many petticoats am I even wearing? Five? Six? Wearing white-silk gloves, Audrey caressed her crinoline gently with her right hand.Her left hand was holding a glass of clear champagne.Audrey was nothing like her usual self, usually placing herself center-stage of banquets and making her the focus of attention. Instead, she avoided the bustle and quietly stood in the shadows of hanging curtains by the French windows.She took a sip of champagne as she watched the crowd as though she did not belong.Count Wolf\u2019s youngest son is chatting with Viscount Conrad\u2019s daughter. He likes to move his forearm to reinforce what he says. Hmm, the bigger the movement of his forearm, the more unbelievable his words. That is something gleaned from experience\u2026 He can\u2019t stop trying to elevate himself by putting other people down. However, he can\u2019t help but feel guilty. It can be seen by the way he talks and his body language\u2026Duchess Della has repeatedly covered her mouth while laughing with her left hand today. Ah, I see. She is showing off her pure ocean-blue sapphire\u2026Her husband, Duke Negan, is discussing the current situation with a few Conservative nobles. Since the banquet began, he has searched for Duchess Della once\u2026They almost never make eye contact. Maybe they aren\u2019t as in love as they pretend to be\u2026Baron Larry has made Madam Parnes laugh seven times. That\u2019s very normal, nothing strange about it, but why does she look at her husband with guilty eyes? Oh, they have gone their separate ways\u2026 That\u2019s not right, the directions they are headed leads to the garden\u2026\u2026In the extravagant banquet, Audrey saw many details she never noticed in the past.There was an instant where she nearly believed that she was watching an opera.Everyone is a good opera actor\u2026 She sighed silently as her eyes remained limpid.At that moment, she suddenly sensed something and turned her head. She cast her gaze onto a dark corner in the large balcony outside.In the shadows was a huge golden retriever sitting there silently. She was looking inside at Audrey while half her body was hidden in the darkness.Susie\u2026 The corners of Audrey\u2019s mouth twitched as her expression instantly changed. She could no longer maintain her state as a Spectator.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, regardless of how the typhoons rampaged or how terrifying the waves were, it continued sailing peacefully without any signs of tilting.Alger Wilson stood on the empty deck as he looked at the massive waves that resembled mountains. His thoughts were a mystery.It\u2019s going to be Monday again\u2026 he muttered silently to himself.It was the day belonging to Mother Earth, the beginning of a series of waxing and waning.However, it meant something different to Alger. It belonged to a mysterious existence forever enveloped in grayish-white fog.At least I haven\u2019t been reduced to a madman\u2026 He stopped looking around as he gave a self-deprecating chuckle.At this moment, one of the only few sailors he had leaned over and asked reverently, \u201cYour Grace, where are we setting course for this time?\u201dAlger surveyed his surroundings and said in calm voice, \u201cPursue the Listener from the Aurora Order.\u201d\u2026The storm subsided as mist emanated. On a strange sailboat with cannons on board, an eight or nine-year-old boy with soft yellow hair was looking at pirates around him in fear. They were disorderly\u2014some enjoyed barrels of beer, some swung around with ropes, others mocked each other, and some even fought with their fists.He turned to look at a black-robed man standing in the shadows. He suppressed his voice and asked, \u201cFather, where are we going?\u201dFive days ago was his first time seeing his father, a father who proclaimed to be an adventurer.If not for the oil painting his late mother left him that confirmed his father\u2019s identity and the fact that the orphanage had opened its doors to him, he was absolutely unwilling to leave his hometown and follow his only kin who was also nearly a stranger.The man in the shadows lowered his head and looked at his son. With an amiable expression, he answered, \u201cJack, I\u2019m bringing you to a holy place, a holy residence where the Creator once lived.\u201d\u201cIs that the Kingdom of God? We mortals can only enter by winning His grace\u2026\u201d Jack had been well-educated by his mother and knew this much. He was both surprised and fearful about the matter.Standing in the shadows, the man had an unforgettable jawline as though he was a sculpture chiseled by the best artisan.He placed his hand to his ear and made a listening pose. He replied in a tone that sounded like sleep-talking, \u201cJack, mortals are a wrong concept. The Creator created this world and He is everywhere. He exists in every living being. Therefore, all beings have godhood. Once the godhood attains a particular level, they can become an angel. The seven fake gods at present are only powerful angels.\u201cLook, I can now hear the teachings of the Creator. Ah, how extraordinary is this revelation! Life is only a tour of the spirit. When the spirit is sufficiently potent and resilient, we can find our godhood and fuse with even more godhoods\u2026\u201dJack could not understand the complicated description. He shook his head and asked another question he previously did not have the chance to.\u201cFather, I heard from Mother than after the Creator created this world, He split into all beings and does not exist in actuality. Then, why does His holy residence exist?\u201dAs a seven to eight-year-old child, he was logical.The man with the chiseled face was taken aback. He turned his head away as though he was listening to more murmurings.Suddenly, he slumped down, knees on the deck. His exposed skin protruded black shards.He clenched his head with both hands as his expression warped and he shouted in extreme pain, \u201cThey are lying!\u201d\u2026After lunch, having had Old Neil promise him that he would bring him to the underground market the next time he went, Klein slowly returned to the Blackthorn Security Company. He chose the two options of reading the documents in the staff office and practicing his abilities or take the opportunity to go out and act as a Seer in the Divination Club before Captain Dunn stopped him.However, before he could make the decision, he saw Dunn Smith walk in. He was dressed in the usual black windbreaker and halved top hat.\u201cCaptain, any updates?\u201d Klein thought of the whereabouts of the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook as he asked with concern.Without showing any signs of fatigue in his gray eyes, Dunn said, \u201cThe facts have corroborated that the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook is in Ray Bieber\u2019s hands. However, he has vanished completely.\u201cI have already informed the various Nighthawk teams of this matter through a telegram. They were requested to pay attention to the various piers and steam locomotive stations. The first batch of printed portraits was mailed out yesterday afternoon and will be printed in various major newspapers.\u201dHow nice it would be if there were phones, fax machines, surveillance cameras, and big data\u2026 What a pity. I know how to use all of them and even understand a little of the logic behind it\u2026 Klein exhaled silently.\u201cBut regardless, we can consider ourselves as having found the notebook. And this is all thanks to you. Of course, it still needs another round of confirmations. I have already sent a telegram to the Backlund diocese, requesting them to escort Sealed Artifact 2-049 here. It was once a dangerous item of the Antigonus family. It can help us know if Ray Bieber is a descendant of the Antigonus family.\u201dA Grade 2 Sealed Artifact\u2026 Dangerous\u2026 They can be used with care and moderation. Klein had originally wanted to ask about the Sealed Artifact, its special abilities, and the danger it posed out of curiosity, but he instantly recalled that he lacked the necessary clearance. He had no choice but to give up.\u201cMay Goddess bless us.\u201d Klein tapped four spots on his chest, forming the sign of the full moon.Dunn pushed open the door to his office and said with a slight nod, \u201cThe Goddess has always been protecting us. Klein, if you had not chosen Seer, you would be a formal member after this matter is verified. You could have chosen Sleepless, but pity\u2026 To be frank, I\u2019m still puzzled over your choice. Although Corpse Collector is quite off-putting, you have seen Daly as well. You should know that Spirit Mediums vary in strength. As for Mystery Pryers, they\u2019re a good choice too. At the very least, you have Old Neil as a role model, so he will make sure the risk of losing control is minimized.\u201dWith regards to this question, Klein had prepared an answer from the beginning. He just never had a chance to use it since Dunn did not ask. He was only able to answer in passing.He organized his words and said, \u201cMy considerations stem from the fact that Seers and Mystery Pryers are considered Beyonders with a support role. They do not need to always face enemies for that\u2019s too dangerous. And both you and Old Neil said that in the domain of mystery and Beyonders, curiosity and experimentation usually brings about terrifying outcomes. Describing Mystery Pryers as prying mysteries made me worried, so\u2026 Heh, as you know, I was only an ordinary graduate not long ago. A lack of guts is the only reason I made such a choice.\u201d\u201cI have to say that this is a very reasonable answer that goes beyond my expectations.\u201d Dunn massaged his temples and chuckled.He turned halfway as his gray eyes sized up Klein.\u201cContinue going out for now. Do not limit yourself to the paths leading from Welch\u2019s place to Iron Cross Street. Perhaps you might sense the notebook and help us confirm Ray Bieber\u2019s location.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein realized that he no longer need to be in a dilemma.He bade Dunn farewell and turned around, his heart beginning to count.Three, two\u2026\u201cHold on,\u201d shouted Dunn.Klein turned his head and smiled.\u201cCaptain, is there anything else?\u201dDunn coughed slightly and said, \u201cWell, support Beyonders have to fight their enemies from time to time. Although Seers sound like they can avoid such battles, they are not to be ignored. You have to maintain your shooting skills and work on increasing your strength.\u201d\u201cThis is what I\u2019m working hard towards.\u201d Klein pointed outside. \u201cI\u2019ll be leaving.\u201d\u201cAlright. Uh, wait a moment.\u201d Dunn shouted for him once more. As he pondered, he said, \u201cPerhaps I have to consider hiring a combat trainer for you. Of course, this matter is under the premise that you become a formal member.\u201dKlein responded tersely before asking carefully, \u201cCaptain, is there anything else?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Seeing Klein\u2019s unbelieving eyes, Dunn shook his head and smiled. He emphasized again, \u201cReally, nothing.\u201dOnly then did Klein walk past the partition divider. He bade farewell to Rozanne and Mrs. Orianna and headed to the Shooting Club for practice.With all of this done, he went to the Divination Club and saw the beautiful Angelica standing there reading newspapers leisurely.\u201cHome\u201d\u2026 Klein silently read. With the cane in hand, he walked over and greeted with a smile,\u201cGood afternoon, Madam Angelica.\u201d\u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Moretti.\u201d In no rush, Angelica put down her magazine. She stood up and said, \u201cNot long after you left yesterday, Mr. Glacis came. He just recovered from a major illness.\u201dKlein heaved a sigh of relief as he smiled.\u201cThat sure is something worth celebrating.\u201dUpon hearing this, Angelica, who was secretly observing him, lowered her voice and asked out of curiosity,\u201cMr. Glacis said that you are a very, very, very magical doctor. Are you?\u201dWhat? Klein looked at the lady in front of him, suspecting if he was hearing things.What made him think I\u2019m a doctor?Even I do not know\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Mr. Glacis mentioned that you were able to tell of an ailment in his lungs simply from observation\u2026\u201dHer voice softened until she finally shut up.Observation? A dark glabella? Klein was instantly enlightened as he shook his head with a chortle.\u201cI believe Mr. Glacis was mistaken.\u201dHe was planning on being perfunctory, but after recalling that no one sought his divination services the entire afternoon yesterday, his mind whirled. It affected his goal of acting as a Seer, so he explained, \u201cIt\u2019s actually a form of divination.\u201d\u201cDivination? But Mr. Glacis only mentioned that you observed his face. That\u2019s also considered divination?\u201d asked Angelica in shock and doubt.Klein smiled, composed.\u201cAs a member of the Divination Club, you should know about palm-reading, right?\u201dPalm-reading was not patented by the Foodaholic Empire. Even on Earth, India and old Europe had developed similar principles, much less in a world with Beyonder powers.\u201cI know about it, but it seems you did not read his palm? Were you observing him in secret?\u201d asked Angelica curiously.\u201cI was using face-reading.\u201d Klein cooked up a lie. \u201cIts principles aren\u2019t very different from palm-reading at a fundamental level.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Angelica\u2019s eyes were filled with disbelief.In order to develop his career as a Seer, Klein chuckled. He pretended to be in thought as he tapped his glabella twice.He focused his eyes and Angelica\u2019s aura presented itself. Her head was purple, her limbs were red, her throat was blue\u2026 There was no problems with her health except for some colors being duller. However, that was a manifestation of ordinary fatigue.Klein then looked at her emotions. She saw orange mixed in with some red and blue. It also meant warmth coupled with some excitement and thought.Thankfully\u2026 After realizing that there was nothing abnormal about her, Klein planned on deactivating his Spirit Vision. But it was at that moment when he suddenly saw rich darkness hidden in the depths of her emotional colors.Furthermore, she is lacking a little of white\u2014an eagerness to improve\u2026 Klein nodded while in thought.\u201cMr. Moretti, were you reading my face?\u201d Seeing the young gentleman in black in front of her turn silent abruptly while seriously sizing her up, Angelica keenly noticed something. She asked in a half-curious and half-worried manner.Klein did not immediately reply. Instead, he tapped his glabella lightly as he wore a look of scrutiny.Just as Angelica was feeling unease, he said warmly, \u201cMadam Angelica, there are some sorrows and pains which you should not seal in your heart.\u201dAngelica\u2019s eyes widened as her mouth turned agape. However, she did not say a word.She looked at Klein in his halved top hat with an apparent scholarly bearing. He heard him use a deep, comforting and warm voice to say, \u201cYou need to either go mountain climbing, a game of tennis, or perform a tragic play to exhaust your body due to exercising. Let your tears flow down uninhibited, then cry and scream. Express all those emotions.\u201cThat will be very helpful to your health.\u201dThe moment those words entered her ears, Angelica felt like she had transformed into a statue. She stood there motionless.She tried hard to blink as she lowered her head in a fluster, saying deeply, \u201cThank you for your suggestion\u2026\u201d\u201cIt seems like there are many members here today?\u201d Klein did not continue. As though he had not done any divinations prior, he turned to his side and looked to the meeting room at the end of the corridor.\u201cSunday afternoon\u2026 at least fifty members\u2026\u201d Angelica\u2019s voice sounded a little hoarse. She only mentioned the key terms.She paused as her vocal pace gradually returned to normal.\u201cDo you want tea or coffee?\u201d\u201cSibe black tea.\u201d Klein nodded slightly. He politely took off his hat and slowly walked to the meeting room.Only when he vanished behind the door did Angelica exhale slowly.\u2026The Divination Club\u2019s meeting room was very large. It was nearly twice the size of Klein\u2019s high school classroom.In the past, only five or six members would be present, making it look extremely empty. Now, there were dozens of fortune-tellers sitting in different spots. They filled up most of the room.Sunlight shone into the room through the few oriel windows. The members were either discussing softly among themselves or asking Hanass Vincent questions. Otherwise, they were practicing and attempting divination or drinking coffee and reading newspapers by themselves.Such a scene made Klein feel like he was back to his schooling days on Earth. The difference was that it was noisier and more rowdy back then, without the tranquility of the meeting room.He looked around, but he didn\u2019t see familiar faces like Glacis or Edward Steve. So, he casually picked up a divination textbook, found a corner, and started flipping through it leisurely.Very soon, Angelica came in with a cup of tea and left it on the table before Klein.As she was leaving quietly, she suddenly saw Mr. Moretti take out an exquisite-looking silver chain from his left sleeve. There was a chunk of pure topaz hanging on the silver chain.What is he doing? Angelica slowed down subconsciously and focused her gaze at Klein.Klein held the silver chain with his left hand and allowed the topaz to hang above the Sibe black tea, just short of touching the surface of the liquid.With a serene expression, he half-closed his eyes and the atmosphere around him suddenly turned quiet.The topaz started moving slightly, along with the special looking silver chain, in a clockwise direction.Upon seeing this, Angelica found Mr. Moretti extremely mysterious.\u201cThe black tea you provide is great,\u201d Klein said softly after he opened his eyes with a smile.His actions were intentionally done for Angelica to see!If he wanted people to select him for his divination services, Angelica\u2019s recommendation was a very crucial factor!Since he wanted to act as a Seer, Klein no longer had any reservations. He completely personified the identity.\u201cYes, Mr. Vannas is very picky about the quality of tea,\u201d Angelica said, stunned.Klein put away his spirit pendulum by winding it properly. Then, he raised the white porcelain cup with floral design. With a smile, he gestured politely at her with his cup.\u2026Angelica returned to the reception hall, but she no longer had the mood to read magazines. She sat there, gazing into the distance. It was a wonder what she was thinking about.This continued until there were knocks on the door. She jolted awake and hurriedly looked at the entrance, only to see a lady dressed in a light-blue dress.The lady took off her veiled hat with a powder blue ribbon. She looked calm and melancholic.\u201cGood afternoon, esteemed lady. Would you like to join the Divination Club, or are you looking for a divination?\u201d Angelica asked like clockwork.\u201cI want a divination.\u201d The lady had a beautiful pair of eyes hidden with sorrow, and she bit her lower lip as she spoke.Angelica guided her to the sofa and explained to her how the Divination Club worked in detail.She picked up an album and handed it over.\u201cYou can pick anyone.\u201dIn her low spirits, the lady flipped through the album seriously. As there were too many club members there that day, there were too many choices. It left her quite upset.\u201cCan you recommend one? From these few pages.\u201d She pointed at the middle section of the album, omitting the fortune-tellers priced above two soli and those below four pence.Angelica took the album and looked at it for a few minutes. She deliberated her words before saying, \u201cI suggest this gentleman.\u201dThe lady who looked uneasy took a glance and realized that it was a fortune-teller named \u201cKlein Moretti.\u201d\u201cMr. Moretti just joined the club\u2026 Is his divination reliable?\u201d she asked worriedly.Angelica nodded with great affirmation.\u201cAnother member of the club and I are certain that Mr. Moretti is an outstanding fortune-teller. If it wasn\u2019t for his just joining the club, he wouldn\u2019t take such low fees.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d The depressed girl nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll pick Mr. Moretti for a divination then.\u201d\u201cAlright, please hold on for a second.\u201d Angelica took the album and walked towards the meeting room.She came next to Klein and said with a suppressed voice, \u201cMr. Moretti, someone wants you to divine for them. Which room would you like to use?\u201dThat was effective. My first \u201cbusiness\u201d is here. Klein put down his teacup and nodded calmly as he said, \u201cTopaz room.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Angelica walked slowly ahead of him and led him to Topaz room before opening its wooden door.Klein sat behind the table that had various divination tools on it. He waited less than a minute before he saw a woman in a light-blue dress walk in. She looked down and melancholic.Seizing the opportunity when she was closing the door, he tapped his glabella twice.The yellow color in her stomach seems a little dull\u2026 The dark color of her emotions is very heavy, mainly worry and anxiety. Klein looked her over carefully and leaned backwards. He then lifted his hand to cut off his Spiritual Vision.\u201cGood day, Mr. Moretti.\u201d The woman in the light-blue dress sat down.\u201cGood afternoon, how may I address you?\u201d Klein asked politely, not carrying much hope of getting an answer.As a keyboard warrior, he knew that many people were not willing to use their real names during divination.\u201cYou can call me Anna.\u201d The girl put her veiled cap aside. She looked at Klein with mixed anticipation and doubt, and said, \u201cI would like to divine about my fianc\u00e9\u2019s situation. He traveled to the Southern Continent in March for a business deal. He sent me and his family a telegram last month on the third, saying that he was going to set sail and return. But he did not return after twenty days. At first, I believed that his delay was due to the Berserk Ocean\u2019s weather, but as of today, it has been more than a month. The ship he took, the Alfalfa, still hasn\u2019t arrived at Enmat Harbor.\u201dThe ocean that separated the Northern and Southern continent was called the Berserk Ocean. It was well known for natural calamities and its countless dangerous currents. If it was not for Emperor Roselle, who sent men to discover a few safer sailing routes, countries in the Northern Continent would still have yet to enter the age of colonization, let alone lay an underwater cable to complete a transoceanic telegraph.Klein looked at his very first client of his career as a Seer and asked carefully, \u201cWhich divination method do you wish to use?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 - RevelationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 55: RevelationTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosAnna, with her beautiful eyes, hesitated for more than ten seconds.\u201cYou can choose any type that you believe will be accurate. You are the fortune-teller, while I\u2019m not. Of course, apart from cards, including tarot, I have also attempted studying them at home. I always felt they were more like toys or a game.\u201dKlein thought for a moment, his wrists leaning on the edge of the table. He steepled his hands before his face, his gaze peaceful. He said softly, \u201cThen we shall use the astrolabe.\u201dHe pointed to a fountain pen and stack of white paper on the table and said, \u201cWrite down the name of your fianc\u00e9 as well as his facial features, address, and date of birth. It would be even better if you can remember the specific time he was born.\u201dFrom her clothes, makeup, and demeanor, Klein did not believe that she was illiterate.Anna did not reply. She extended her hand and took a piece of paper. She lifted the pen and dipped it in some ink. She started writing, pausing occasionally to think.Two minutes later, she pushed the paper toward Klein.Klein received it and turned it around. The information on the paper read: \u201cJoyce Meyer, 15th September 1323, 2:00PM. Tingen City, East Borough, 8 Stevens Street. Short blond hair, aquiline nose\u2026\u201dWith just a short glance, Klein quickly calculated the person\u2019s spiritual number:1+5=6In the study of Spirit Numerology in mysticism, adding the numbers of the day the person was born was called their Birth Day Path Number, affecting the person\u2019s life before 27. Birth Month Path Number (calculated by adding the numbers in their birth month) affected their life from 27 to 54 years old, while the Birth Year Path Number (calculating the numbers in their birth year) affected their life from 54 years old onward.It was July 1349, so Joyce was not yet 27; thus, Klein immediately calculated the Birth Day Path Number.The number six represented a balanced and harmonious life, with a heart for giving and a decent marriage or engagement.Following this, he quickly calculated Joyce\u2019s Year Path Number.The so-called Year Path Number was calculated by replacing the birth year with the current year. The digits were then added with his Birth Day Path Number and Birth Month Path Number to get a general understanding of the person\u2019s luck for the year.1+3+4+9=17, 1+7=8; 8+9 (Birth Month Path Number)+6 (Birth Day Path Number)=23; 2+3=5; His Year Path Number is 5, signifying that he would meet with change and accident. He would be required to take certain risks\u2026 Klein made a silent judgment after consolidating the facts. He confirmed that the information Anna gave was correct.He retracted his gaze from the paper and turned it toward Anna, \u201cMr. Meyer set off on his journey on the 3rd of June?\u201d\u201cIf he did not lie, that is indeed the case.\u201d Anna bit her lips.\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein took the fountain pen and made a note of that.He looked at Anna with his dark brown eyes and said gently, \u201cI will begin creating the astrolabe now. I will need some time and absolute silence; do you mind waiting outside? Angelica will provide you with a cup of tea or coffee.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Anna knew that some fortune-tellers had their eccentricities, so she stood up unsurprised. She took her hat with the light blue ribbon and left the Topaz room.Klein locked the door and returned to the table. He followed the information and set up the astrolabe, including elements such as his horoscope and locations of the corresponding planets and stars.Throughout the entire process, he did not open the Astromancy Manual. He completed the set up based on his memory.Over the past few days of his mysticism studies, Klein realized that he could easily grasp and understand anything about divination, quickly turning it into instinct.Perhaps that is the ability of a Seer\u2026 He completed the astrolabe and felt satisfied. He felt as though his body, heart, and soul had relaxed considerably.As he looked at the outcome, he followed the path of the horoscopes and planets, as well as other supporting details to roughly deduce that Joyce Meyer had met with an accident but would ultimately survive it.At this point, the divination was technically complete. But Klein wanted to pay much attention to his first business transaction. He hoped to build a reputation to aid in acquiring future jobs. He picked up the pen and wrote a sentence in Hermes: Joyce Meyer\u2019s current situation.He read the sentence silently and memorized the information on the piece of paper, repeating it again and again.After seven times, Klein grabbed the piece of paper and leaned back into his chair.He imagined the sphere of light, and his eyes became darker, allowing him to quickly enter a state of Cogitation.The surroundings took on an ethereal quality. A formless, boundless fog stretched above him.Klein recalled the contents of the piece of paper, then relaxed. He fell into a deep sleep in this state.He was using a dream divination technique!Repeating the question, remembering the details, and then allowing his Astral Projection to roam the spirit world in a dream would allow him to gain revelations!Ordinary people also had this sort of experience sometimes, but it was hard for them to recall, as the signs in their dreams were more complicated and garbled. A Seer would not have such a problem, for they could see the images directly.The surroundings began to turn hazy as Klein turned half asleep.In the contorted fantasy, he saw a blond young man with an aquiline nose. He was swimming frantically in a sea of blood, nearly engulfed by the waves. But in the end, he managed to escape to shore.The image shattered and changed. Klein saw a blue house with a toy windmill at the door. That blond young man was entering the house slowly, seemingly in joy.At this moment, the image changed once again. Klein realized that he was inside a magnificent palace.The walls were destroyed and damaged beyond repair. Moss and weeds grew in multiple areas. Through the holes in the walls, he could see a mountain peak and clouds clinging close to it outside.Atop the palace was a huge throne carved out of stone. It was adorned with dull gemstones and gold. It looked as though it was not prepared for a human.This giant throne was empty and mottled, as if it had been washed over by the ages.Klein looked around in confusion. He did not understand why he would be dreaming of such a scene.His turbid mind turned sharp as he subconsciously walked out of the palace in an attempt to ascertain where he was.Suddenly, he felt a gaze fall upon him. It was a gaze that came from behind!Klein suddenly turned around and stared towards the giant stone throne, only to see a scene of countless transparent maggots slowly twitching and growing.Klein gasped.He opened his eyes and woke up from his dream.Crystal balls, tarot cards, and the prepared astrolabe entered his vision. Reality quickly replaced fantasy.The initial dream was the result of the divination, but what was the later dream about? It seemed to be targeted at me? Klein put the piece of paper down. He rubbed his temples and contemplated.He could confirm that it wasn\u2019t his fear projecting itself in the form of a dream, for he was doing the divination himself.A palace not meant for humans on the peak of a mountain\u2026 The silent stare\u2026 The contorted and weird scene of the maggots\u2026 Klein silently guessed as he recalled.Has the luck enhancement ritual communicated with that existence? Or is it a result of the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook\u2026 Right, that notebook mentioned the Nation of the Evernight in the Hornacis mountain range! The palace in the dream was on a mountain peak!He made a simple deduction and was relieved that he had picked Seer. According to Old Neil, Mystery Pryers could also divine through dreams, but they weren\u2019t as effective as a Seer.Sigh, it sure isn\u2019t letting me go\u2026 All I can hope for is the early capture of Ray Bieber\u2026 Klein collected himself and picked up the piece of paper with the diagram of the astrolabe. He slowly walked towards the door.He opened the door and headed to the reception area. He saw Anna looking out the window, completely ignoring her cup of black tea.\u201cAh, Mr. Moretti, is there a result?\u201d She saw Klein in her peripheral vision and stood up in a hurry.Klein did not answer her immediately. Instead, he asked according to the revelation he received from the dream, \u201cDoes your house, or Mr. Meyer\u2019s house, have a toy windmill?\u201dAnna\u2019s eyes widened, shocked into silence.After a while, she muttered, \u201cThat was a present he gave me. It is by the door at my house. How did you know that\u2026\u201dC-can this be divined?Klein smiled and spoke with a gentle tone, \u201cCongratulations Miss Anna, Mr. Joyce Meyer is currently a guest at your place. If you rush back, you should still be able to meet him. He just experienced a calamity, an unimaginably painful journey. What he needs now are not questions, but consolation and a warm hug.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Anna asked in disbelief.The fortune-tellers she knew would never speak with such certainty or give such firm conclusions.\u201cYou will know if you go back immediately,\u201d Klein replied with a gentle tone and smile.\u201cOh, Lord of Steam, is that true? Has my poor Joyce returned? Are you certain? No, I cannot believe it\u2026\u201d Anna froze for a moment and said a few delirious words.She took out a one-soli note from her purse and did not wait for Klein to give her the change. She broke into a small jog as she left the Divination Club, taking a carriage back home.\u201cDoes this include my tip?\u201d Klein looked at the note and shook his head with a laugh.\u2026A two-wheeled carriage steered quickly across the streets and entered East Borough.Anna watched the streets sweeping past her, feeling a mixture of unease, anticipation, and fear. It did not take long before the toy windmill entered her field of vision.She got off the carriage, showing no care for her bearing. She staggered quickly towards the door and rang the doorbell.The door creaked open, revealing a blond young man dressed in a black formal suit. He was haggard, but his eyes carried a glint of joy. He had an aquiline nose.\u201cI thought that I would miss you today,\u201d Joyce said with a smile.\u201c\u2026Oh, Exalted Steam, you really are back!\u201d Anna rubbed her eyes, exclaiming in pleasant surprise.What the fortune-teller said was true!No, that was a real seer!It was simply fascinating!Thoughts welled in her mind as Anna pounced forward with tears in her eyes and gave her fianc\u00e9 a warm hug.The two of them hugged silently outside the grayish-blue house. The toy windmill turned slowly, seemingly tossing all their difficulties far away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 - Escape from the SeaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 56: Escape from the SeaTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosIn a rather spacious living room, Anna and Joyce were seated on different sofas, separated by Anna\u2019s parents.Joyce sighed with a satisfied expression and said, \u201cExalted Steam, I am so lucky to come back alive, to be able to see Anna again.\u201d\u201cMy poor Joyce, what happened?\u201d Anna couldn\u2019t help but ask with concern.Joyce took a glance at his fianc\u00e9e, and his expression turned grave.\u201cI still feel terrified to this day. I keep waking up from my dreams again and again. Five days after the Alfalfa left Caesar Pier, we came across pirates, scary pirates. The only fortunate thing was that their leader\u2019s name was Nast.\u201d\u201cThe pirate that calls himself the King of the Five Seas?\u201d Anna\u2019s father, Mr. Wayne, asked in shock.Although Joyce had already been there for half an hour, he did not volunteer details about his ordeal. He appeared to be fearful, perturbed, and uneasy. It was only after Anna returned and hugged him that he finally appeared to put it behind him.\u201cYes, due to his declaration of being a descendant of the Solomon Empire, the King of the Five Seas, Nast didn\u2019t believe in killing captives. Hence, we were only robbed and didn\u2019t lose our lives. His subordinates even left us sufficient food,\u201d Joyce said as he recalled the ordeal.His body started to quiver, but he continued to describe his deepest and scariest nightmare.\u201cI didn\u2019t lose much of my wealth. I believed that my misfortune was over, but as we continued towards our destination, a heated conflict erupted among the Alfalfa\u2019s passengers and crew. From disagreement, to fighting, to drawing revolvers, and raising swords to kill each other\u2026 I saw nothing but blood during that period. One after another, people beside me fell with eyes opened, never to be closed. Their limbs, hearts, and intestines were scattered across the floors.\u201d\u201cThose of us who were unwilling to turn into savage beasts, the rational group, had nowhere to hide and nowhere to escape. We were surrounded by deep blue waves and the boundless ocean\u2026 Some wailed, some begged for mercy, some sold their bodies, but their heads were hung from the mast either way.\u201cAnna, I reeled in despair back then. I thought I would never see you again. Fortunately, in such a nightmare, there was still a hero. The captain took us to hide in the sturdy keel of the ship, and we relied on the stored water and food there until the maniacs reached their limits. Mr. Tris encouraged us, courageously leading us in an assault against those murderers\u2026\u201cAfter an unforgettable bloody battle, we survived. But the Alfalfa strayed off course, and only a third of the original sailors remained.\u201d\u2026When he depicted the most horrible and darkest side of the human psyche, Joyce couldn\u2019t help but recall the \u201chero,\u201d the man that called himself Tris. He had a round and amiable face. He was shy like a girl and enjoyed staying in a corner. Only people whom he was familiar with knew that he was a very good conversationalist.But it was such an unremarkable boy who stood in front of everyone with determination in the worst of days.\u201cOh, Exalted Steam, my poor Joyce, you went through such a heartbreaking ordeal. Thank God, praise be to God, He prevented us from eternal separation.\u201d Tears welled up in Anna\u2019s eyes as she constantly dotted three points to form a triangle, the Sacred Emblem for Steam and Machinery.Joyce revealed a faint pale smile.\u201cThis is the reward for our faith. The Alfalfa then went through storms, lost its course, and after surmounting one challenge after another, arrived at Enmat Harbor.\u201d\u201cDue to the bloodbath that had taken place on the boat, those of us that survived were held captive by the police and questioned separately. We didn\u2019t have a chance to send telegrams home to update our loved ones. When they released us this morning, I immediately borrowed some money from my friend and took the steam locomotive back. Thank God for letting me set foot on the land of Tingen again, allowing me to see all of you again.\u201dThen, he looked towards his fianc\u00e9e in confusion.\u201cAnna, when you saw me, I could feel your happiness and surprise, but I couldn\u2019t understand why you rushed towards the door so excitedly right after you got off the carriage. Heh, I had planned on giving you a huge surprise.\u201dAnna thought about what had happened earlier, and continued in disbelief, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to hide, Joyce. As I was worried about you, I went to the only divination club in Tingen City today for a divination. That fortune-teller\u2014no, the seer told me, he said, \u2018Your fianc\u00e9 has returned; he\u2019s in the house with a windmill.'\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d the Wayne couple and Joyce exclaimed simultaneously.Anna covered her face and shook her head.\u201cI can barely believe it either, but it happened. Exalted Steam, perhaps there really are miracles in this world.\u201d\u201cJoyce, that seer asked me for your name, characteristics, address, and birth date. He told me he was going to do an astrolabe divination. Then, he asked me if the house with a toy windmill was yours or mine. When I confirmed it was mine, he said, \u2018Congratulations Miss Anna, Mr. Joyce Meyer is currently a guest at your place. What he needs now are not questions, but consolation and a warm hug.'\u201d\u201cGod\u2026\u201d Joyce found it unbelievable and incomprehensible. \u201cDoes he know me? Did someone send him a telegram? Could it be that he is familiar with the police in Enmat Harbor? No, that doesn\u2019t explain it. How did he know that I came to your place? How could he possibly know that you would seek a divination? Did you make an appointment?\u201d\u201cNo, I made a selection at the last minute,\u201d Anna replied with a vacant-looking expression.\u201cPerhaps a good seer needs to be in control of vast amounts of information, even if it cannot be used any time soon. Perhaps, that is the fascinating aspect of divination.\u201d Anna\u2019s father, Mr. Wayne sighed and concluded. \u201cIn the known history of more than a thousand years and in the uncertain Fourth Epoch, divination has existed and has yet to disappear. I think there must be a reason for that.\u201dJoyce shook his head lightly and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s that seer\u2019s name?\u201dAnna thought and said, \u201cKlein Moretti.\u201d\u2026In the reception lobby of the Divination Club.As Klein had spoken softly, Angelica knew not to go close. Therefore, she only saw Anna leave as though she had lost her soul, wearing shock and confusion on her face.Angelica briskly walked to the sofa and asked out of curiosity, \u201cWas the result good?\u201dShe did not dare ask the actual result, afraid of violating the unspoken rule of fortune-tellers.\u201cYeah.\u201d Klein nodded and took out three copper coins from his pocket. \u201cOne-eighth of one soli is one and a half pennies, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Angelica looked at the copper coins and realized that one of them was a penny and two of them were halfpence. She quickly held it out and said, \u201cThere\u2019s an additional halfpence.\u201dKlein smiled faintly and said, \u201cThank you for taking care of my customer. She gave me a tip, so it\u2019s only right I give you one.\u201dIt \u2018 s also to thank you for recommending me\u2026 he added in his heart.\u201cAlright.\u201d Angelica felt an unknown fear of Klein, but since the reason was appropriate, she didn\u2019t refuse the offer.Klein returned to the meeting room, believing that there would be more people requesting his divinations.However, he did not receive a second customer by forty minutes past five.It wasn\u2019t because the Divination Club\u2019s business was poor, but because most people had already chosen a fortune-teller.They likely were recommended by others and had long determined whose services to hire\u2026 In short, I\u2019m still lacking in reputation\u2026 Klein laughed at himself for using game terminology.He finished his third cup of Sibe black tea, grabbed his top hat and silver-edged walking stick, and walked leisurely out of the meeting room.Angelica suddenly recalled Glacis\u2019s instructions, and she quickly moved to intercept him.\u201cMr. Moretti, when will you next visit the club? Mr. Glacis would like to thank you in person.\u201d\u201cI will come over whenever I\u2019m free. If fate permits us, he will definitely meet me,\u201d Klein replied, using the tone of a psychic charlatan, as though he was in character.Then, he left the club before Angelica could respond and took the public carriage home.When he stepped through the door, Klein found Benson reading the newspaper and Melissa putting together bits and pieces of gears, bearings, and springs in the evening sunlight.\u201cGood afternoon. Did Mrs. Shaud visit?\u201d Klein asked casually.Benson didn\u2019t put down his newspaper; instead, he lifted his head.\u201cMrs. Shaud\u2019s visit lasted fifteen minutes. She brought some gifts, and she was very happy with the muffins and lemon cake that we prepared. She also invited us over whenever we have the chance to. She is a friendly, well-mannered lady. She knows how to carry a conversation very well too.\u201d\u201cThe only problem is their belief in the Lord of Storms. They believe that girls shouldn\u2019t go to school, but should be homeschooled instead,\u201d Melissa complained.It was obvious that she was very upset about it.\u201cDon\u2019t mind that. As long as she doesn\u2019t disturb us, she will still be a good neighbor,\u201d Klein comforted his sister, smiling.The Loen Kingdom was a multi-religious nation, unlike the Frosac Empire in the north which only believed in the God of Combat or the Feynapotter Kingdom in the south which only worshiped Mother Earth. It was inevitable that the congregations from the three major churches of the Lord of Storms, the Evernight Goddess, and the God of Steam and Machinery had conflicts in beliefs and customs. After a thousand years of this, they restrained each other, making coexistence possible.\u201cOkay.\u201d Melissa pursed her lips and redirected her focus onto the pile of parts again.After dinner, Klein continued revising history. Only when Melissa and Benson showered and returned to their rooms did he wash up, enter his bedroom, and lock his door.He needed to organize and summarize what he had learned and the problems that he encountered to prevent himself from forgetting or missing out any critical points. Only by doing so would he be able to respond to subsequent developments in the future with a clear train of thought.Klein flipped open his notebook, took out his pen, and started writing in Mandarin.\u201cWhy is the key to digesting potions acting?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - Organization and SummaryPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 57: Organization and SummaryTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosAfter pausing for a moment, Klein continued writing.\u201cThe essence to resolving the problems with potions is through digestion, not simply controlling it. This can be understood in a straightforward manner.\u201cMerely controlling it would be akin to using the power of potions as an external tool. A tamed beast no matter how well controlled would ultimately not be a part of a person. The risk of it turning on them would be ever present. As for digestion, it is to view the downed potion as a part of them. They can break it down, fuse with it, absorb it, and form an overall system.\u201cI am currently certain of this point. What is more important is how \u2018acting\u2019 helps in digestion.\u201cAccording to my experience as a Seer today, I can make two hypotheses. They can be verified in the future.\u201d\u201cOne: Acting based on the potion\u2019s name changes the state of one\u2019s body, heart, and soul, making them closer to the remnant headstrong psyche of the potion\u2019s core. This results in resonance which allows gradual assimilation and absorption.\u201cTwo: The remnant headstrong psyche spirit of the magic medicine might be like a computer with complete defensive mechanisms. If one wishes to attack it and break it down, they will need to find a bug, security hole, or key. The name of the potion provides a corresponding clue; thus, we can disguise our body, heart, and soul as \u2018part of the system\u2019 through acting, and so we deceive the system\u2019s defenses. This line of thought is similar to Emperor Roselle\u2019s description.\u201cNo matter which guess is right, there is no escaping the body, heart, and soul, for they are the only bridge between acting and the power of potions.\u201dKlein put down his pen and looked at the paragraph of text. For a moment, he even wanted to thank the education he received from the Foodaholic Empire.No matter if he chose science or engineering for his further education, he was equipped with the basics of logical thought. Otherwise, there was no way he could have become a keyboard warrior, nor would he have been able to analyze his current situation.\u201cActing might have an effect, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see for the specifics,\u201d Klein guessed.After that, he wrote down his second question.\u201cWhy would a Seer, being more well-learned and professional in the domain of mysticism, be lacking in means when it comes to direct combat? Wouldn\u2019t being more well-learned and professional make a Seer even more powerful, giving them the ability to discover a way to defeat their enemies?\u201cThe reasons could be\u2026\u201cFirst, just like the web novels I\u2019ve read in the past, I have transmigrated to a game world that has become reality. Thus, different \u2018jobs\u2019 come with different specialties that have to be balanced against each other. But up to this point, there has been no sign of this world being a game, nor are there signs of mission-like developments. I\u2019ll put this reason on hold, but it\u2019s very unlikely.\u201cSecond, the fundamental law of this world is balance. The Creator made this world with the core idea of balance.\u201cThird, potions at the same Sequence level would have the same level of power. It is the most optimal state based on what our forefathers found out and summarized. Exceeding this level of power would make it easier for one to collapse and lose control. Below this level of power would make it such that one would not obtain the desired Beyonder powers. Thus, under the situation of a balanced power level, being stronger in one area would naturally mean that one is weaker in another area.\u201cFourth, everything in this world originated from the same source; they were formed by the remnants of the Creator. Thus, everything in this world is technically fragments of the Creator, and the fact that they have to complement each other would mean that there are inherent shortcomings to an individual.\u201cI am leaning towards the third and fourth reasons, but the latter stems from an unconfirmed myth and can only serve as a guide.\u201cThus, I shall use the third reason as a guide, and try to ascertain it using my current knowledge and future studies.\u201dAt this point, Klein had already written two full pages but did not stop. Instead, he penned a new question.\u201cFrom what I learned today, my luck enhancement ritual is categorized as a classic ritualistic magic.\u201cSimilar kinds of ritualistic magic can be split into three parts, the first being a sacrifice that sparks the interest of a corresponding existence. The second is comprised of incantations specifically describing the existence in question. The third is using simple formatting and symbols to convey what one is asking for.\u201cUsing this as a benchmark to analyze the luck enhancement ritual, there\u2019s an obvious problem. \u201cThere is no third part!\u201cIt has the sacrifice aspect in the placement of staple foods and walking a square in a counterclockwise manner with four steps. There is also a clear indication who the incantation is for, such as the phrase, \u2018Blessings Stem from The Immortal Lord of Heaven and Earth.\u2019\u201cBut all I did after was close my eyes and wait. There was nothing in the ritual that described the goal of enhancing my luck.\u201cIn other words, the corresponding existence has no way of knowing what the so-called luck enhancement ritual is asking for, and can only do as they see fit\u2026 Do as they see fit\u2026\u201cWhat a troll! Isn\u2019t that darn \u2018Quintessential Divination and Arcane Arts of the Qin and Han Dynasty\u2019 too much of a troll?\u201cI must have had rocks in my head back then for trying\u2026\u201dKlein stopped writing and took two deep breaths, trying hard to calm himself down.He spat out a foul breath and continued writing.\u201cI can consider re-designing the ritual, making it more complete. The motive of the ritual shall be to return to Earth, back to the world with my parents and friends.\u201cThen here comes the question: was the entity truly acting on a whim? Or is there a deeper meaning to it?\u201cAlso, is the entity that the descriptive incantations point towards in this world the same one from Earth?\u201cIf so, the difference in results between the first and second ritual could be explained as the entity doing as it wishes. But the results of me appearing above the gray fog during the second and third time, while being able to connect to Justice and The Hanged Man has basically no differences. Why would that be so?\u201cIf the fourth ritual tomorrow afternoon shows me the same stable results, that would mean that the effects are consistent. That would mean that the unknown entity has an agenda I do not know about. If that is the case, adding new descriptions and requests would not get me a clear response. In fact, it might complicate the ritual and result in adverse effects.\u201cWould the difference between the first ritual and the subsequent rituals\u2014under the premise that the entity I called upon is the same one\u2014mean that the results would be different depending on the world I\u2019m in? It is like I am using a different interface\u2026\u201cThen how can I design it to obtain my desired outcome?\u201cIf I think that the entities behind the first and subsequent rituals are different, some of the questions can be perfectly answered. But similarly, the stability of the results in the second and third rituals would mean that the entity I am praying to has a certain agenda, and there is no way I can change that for the time being.\u201cThe most important question is the identity of the entity that the ritual is directed. Where is He, and why doesn\u2019t He give me any clues or guidance?\u201cCould He be deep in the world of fog?\u201cHmm, can I treat Him as an entity in slumber, an entity that would give fixed responses if I give Him a certain stimulus, but would not interfere with what I do other than that?\u201cThen I can introduce a different ritual as a stimulus and conclude whether the feedback I receive is regular. That way, I can find the correct method of returning.\u201cBut the problem lies in the possibility that He is not asleep. In that case, such tests might result in terrifying outcomes. It might be really dangerous.\u201cThe first attempt must be conducted with extreme caution. The design must not anger the being\u2026\u201cWhat a headache. I need more knowledge.\u201dKlein sighed and gave a summary.Finally, he wrote down other miscellaneous items.\u201cThere are always formless voices resonating in my ears, shouting \u2018Hornacis and\u2026 uh, was it saying Frygrea or Feygrea?\u201cHornacis is the mountain range dividing the Loen Kingdom and the Intis Republic. Its main peak is six thousand meters above sea level.\u201cAccording to the records in the Antigonus family\u2019s diary, there existed a Nation of the Evernight in the Fourth Epoch. Is the Nation of the Evernight related to the Evernight Goddess\u2014is there any connection between the two? Are they allies or enemies? Was the Antigonus family obliterated by the Church of the Evernight Goddess due to Nation of the Evernight?\u201cDid I hear murmurings coming from the diary, from the howls of the Antigonus family over one or two thousand years?\u201cWhat then does Frygrea, uh\u2014Flegrea mean?\u201cAn interesting question. To be able to leave behind such a diary, to leave behind Sealed Artifact 2-049 implies that the Antigonus family had possession of a relatively powerful Beyonder power. If that is so, which Sequence did they possess? Was it complete or not complete?\u201cMy realization that the diary is in the hands of Ray Bieber was a bit of a coincidence, but without any indication of it being arranged, could my fate really be tied up with that diary\u2019s?\u201d\u2026His ideas were penned on the pieces of paper. Klein tried his best to write down the events he had experienced and his guesses about their meaning.He wrote a total of four pages on both sides of each page.Rip! Klein suddenly tore off the four pages and read them from top to bottom, sometimes marking certain sections with his pen, adding a few sentences at other times.Time flew quickly. The crimson moon was temporarily covered by dark clouds. Klein picked up the pocket watch on the table, snapped it open, and looked at the time.He put down the watch and took out a box of matches from his drawer. He lit one and brought it close to the four pages of notes.The orange flame ignited the edges of the paper and quickly spread.Klein placed the notes on top of the wooden dustbin and watched the ashes drop.He then released his fingers, allowing the papers to fall. In just ten seconds, everything had disappeared. All that was left was the still-swirling ash and the charred bottom of the dustbin.As there was Emperor Roselle\u2019s secret diary in this world, Klein did not dare leave behind any evidence that he knew how to write Chinese\u2014if Old Neil and the rest discovered the four pieces of paper he wrote, he would have no idea how to explain the matter.And while writing the confidential questions, Klein was worried that the one paying attention to his dreams would be able to see and decipher the contents no matter which language he used, be it Loen, ancient Feysac, or Hermes. Therefore, he could only write notes in Chinese to organize and summarize. After he was done with the task, he burned the notes to leave no traces.And precisely because there was no way of saving, he set up a plan for himself. He would do this summary once a week just in case he forgot anything.As he watched the ashes fall, Klein pulled out a white piece of paper. He wrote the title: \u201cTo my respected mentor,\u201dHe wanted to write to Senior Associate Professor Quentin Cohen, asking if he had any relevant historical information about the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 - A Train of ThoughtPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 58: A Train of ThoughtTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosThe next day, a Monday morning.Klein, who had the day off, didn\u2019t leave home. Instead, he gave Melissa his letter directed to Mentor Cohen Quentin and more than enough money to buy stamps. He entrusted her with the job of mailing the letter at the post office near the Tingen Technical School where she studied.After breakfast, he slept in to make up for the lack of sleep caused by the previous night\u2019s \u201cwork.\u201d He only woke up because of his stomach\u2019s grumblings close to noon.He heated up some leftovers from the night before and ate them with a loaf of rye bread. Klein grabbed a newspaper and entered the bathroom on the second floor.Whenever he did that, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh at the lack of a cell phone.After about seven or eight minutes, he left the toilet refreshed and washed his hands. He then returned to his bedroom and locked his door.Klein drew the curtains, lit up the gas lamp, and cogitated for half an hour. After practicing his Spiritual Vision, spirit dowsing, and dowsing rod for half an hour, he spent another hour mentally reviewing the mysticism knowledge he had gained recently.After doing that, he ripped up the old newspaper and crumpled them into a few balls. He wrote on them, \u201cMoon Flower Candle,\u201d \u201cFull Moon Essence Oil,\u201d and other names of materials. He followed the prescribed steps of ritualistic magic in his head in order to master every little detail. Until he was entirely familiar with it, he didn\u2019t intend to try ritualistic magic because it was both a waste of materials and also easily attracted danger.He repeated again and again until he picked up his silver pocket watch patterned with vine-leaves and took a glance. He realized that it was a quarter to three.He considered for a few seconds and brought the scraps of old newspapers to the kitchen on the first floor to burn them. While doing so, he made sure he was in an optimal state of mind as he prepared for the Tarot Gathering.Locking his bedroom door once again, Klein didn\u2019t wait for the clock to strike three. He planned to enter the area above the gray fog ahead of time.He wanted to seize the chance to explore the place thoroughly!As Klein stood in an empty spot in his room and started walking counterclockwise, he suddenly worried that Justice and The Hanged Man had yet to enter a suitable environment. He thought of a particular matter.Would they be disturbed or discovered?He had previously mentioned to allow Justice and The Hanged Man to apply for \u201cleave\u201d ahead of time if they needed to be absent from the Gathering for some reason such as being unable to find time alone or unexpected circumstances.It would have been an almost unsolvable problem for Klein in the past. There was no way he could build an entire server-based Internet by hand in a different world, right? Any technology beyond the telegram could expose him.But now, he had suddenly found inspiration from ritualistic magic.\u201cRitualistic magic borrows the powers of others by seeking the help of different existences. Similar incantations would make it clear who it is directed to in the beginning, such as the Evernight Goddess or the Lady of Crimson. It would be a description of the unknown and clandestine existences.\u201d\u201cThen, can I amend the chant and redirect the beginning of the chant towards myself?\u201d\u201cDirected at me\u2026\u201d\u201cThis way, even if Justice and The Hanged Man conduct the ritual in different locations, I would receive their messages.\u201dKlein suddenly felt fresh insight as he began analyzing the likelihood of the method working.\u201cThere are two difficulties. First, I am not an incredibly strong high-level Sequencer. Even if the description of the incantation was directed to me, I couldn\u2019t possibly receive the \u2018request.'\u201d\u201cSecond, how can I ensure that the description of the chant is directed at me accurately, and doesn\u2019t stray away and hit some other unknown existence that fits the description? That would be incredibly dangerous.\u201dKlein paced back and forth, deep in thought for a possible workable solution.He went in circles with silent footsteps. Then, he naturally linked the matter with the mysterious world of the gray fog.\u201cEven if I can\u2019t receive the message, that doesn\u2019t mean the gray fog can\u2019t. Its connection with the crimson stars can \u2018drag\u2019 a person into the space directly, regardless of where they are in the physical world.\u201cI could consider tying myself to the mysterious space together during the directed description\u2026\u201cIn accordance with this train of thought, even though I might not immediately receive the \u2018request\u2019 when the other party is holding the ritual, I will still be able to see the corresponding messages whenever I enter the gray fog.\u201cTo put it simply, it is the difference between being online and offline on an instant messaging system.\u201dKlein became more excited the more he thought. He felt that his idea was worth a try.\u201cHmm, what kind of description could be used to precisely direct a message to me and to the gray fog world?\u201d He started thinking about the actual details.In fact, he had an incantation that would definitely work. It was none other than the Loen translation of \u2018Blessings Stem from The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth.\u2019 But herein lies the problem: he would lose control of the gray fog and lose his leading role. He could only exclude it.\u2018Fool from an alternate world\u2019? No way. It is quite accurate, and there is almost no other existence that fits the criteria, but it would expose my biggest secret\u2026 Klein thought of one incantation after another, but he crossed off each one.After about seven to eight minutes, he finally decided on the description of the first paragraph that directed to him.\u201cThe Fool that doesn\u2019t belong to this era.\u201dIt was obviously not accurate enough; therefore, Klein quickly added, \u201cThe mysterious ruler above the gray fog.\u201dThe combination of the two lines practically limited it to him. Furthermore, he had tied the gray fog to him.\u201cIt\u2019s still a little short. I cannot eliminate the possibility that there are multiple spaces and rulers above the gray fog. I cannot eliminate the fact that the description might be directed to the spirit world\u2026\u201d Klein creased his eyebrows and planned on making it more certain.Hmm\u2026 He thought for a full minute and finally decided on the last part of the description.\u201cThe King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck!\u201dIt shared a similar meaning to \u201cBlessings Stem From The Exalted Thearch of Heaven and\u00a0Earth <sup>1</sup> .\u201d If the incantation purely depended on that part of the description, it might end up being directed away and provoking unknown dangerous existences. But with the first two lines as a limitation, and his experience of arriving above the fog through a similar incantation, he believed that the target\u2019s description could result in a perfect lock on.Klein wasn\u2019t sure if casting the ritualistic magic with those three descriptions would be effective, but he was definite that it would not attract the attention of another existence, It wouldn\u2019t throw Justice and The Hanged Man into danger.Klein heaved out a long sigh and recited the incantation that he had decided upon.\u201cThe Fool that doesn\u2019t belong to this era, you are the mysterious ruler above the gray fog; you are the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck\u2026\u201dHe nodded his head slightly and took out his pocket watch to confirm the time.\u201cIt\u2019s already 2:58\u2026\u201d Without further thought, Klein put away his pocket and entered Cogitation. Soon he chanted and took four steps counterclockwise to form a square.The most ferocious noises and heart-stirring roars were heard once again. He felt the headache that was even harder to deal with than the pain of consuming the Seer potion.The pain was not a sharp pain that tore through his head. It was a throbbing pain that made him manic and irrational. It was a pain that left him in chaotic confusion.Klein controlled himself using Cogitation and tried hard to ignore the voices.The muttering and murmurs receded like the tides. His body became ethereal, along with his spirituality. Everything seemed to float.The boundless gray fog appeared before his sight, the crimson stars at varying distances from him, just like pairs of eyes.Above the gray fog stood the palace, lofty and towering like the home of a giant. It was as though it had been there for millions of years.All Klein did was will it and he disappeared from where he was, reappearing at the Seat of Honor at the long bronze table with twenty-two high-back chairs.\u201cThe effect of the ritual is definitely fixed\u2026\u201d Klein muttered. He tapped his glabella gently and allowed the fog to engulf him, ones thicker than before. According to the description of The Hanged Man, if Justice had become a Spectator, it would be best not to reveal any of his tics before her.Without any time for exploring, Klein extended his right hand and formed an invisible connection, connecting him to the two familiar crimson stars.\u2026On the roaring blue waves of the Sonia Sea, an ancient sailboat was sailing with the wind.Alger Wilson locked himself in the captain\u2019s cabin and made ghost ship provide him the best protection.He opened the pocket watch before him and laid it next to the brass sextant. The clock was ticking without joy as it exuded nervousness.When the hour hand, minute hand, and second hand aligned, there was an explosion of crimson before Alger Wilson. It ignored the layers and layers of protection he had placed over himself.Sigh\u2026 His sigh reverberated across the captain\u2019s room.\u2026Backlund, Empress Borough.Audrey Hall laid against a down-feather pillow and glanced at the yellow paper in her hand. Her gemlike eyes looked like they had two souls spiraling slowly in them.Her gaze was calm and cool, as if she were waiting for a play to begin.As the crimson red erupted, she looked at herself being swallowed with complete detachment.\u2026Above the gray fog, in the magnificent palace, on the ancient and mottled long bronze table.Klein, who had already activated his Spiritual Vision, looked over when Audrey Hall\u2019s figure began to form. He was not surprised to see that the colors deep in her aura had blended together. It became pure and serene, like a lake that was clear and reflective.She really did become a Beyonder\u2026 Klein was just about to move his gaze away when he suddenly saw the chair belonging to Miss Justice change.The bright stars on the back of the chair moved swiftly, forming an illusory constellation that didn\u2019t belong to reality.That constellation was familiar to Klein because it was one of the symbols of mysticism.It was a symbol that represented \u201cGiant Dragon\u201d!Spectator\u2026 Giant Dragon\u2026 Klein restrained himself from shaking his head and looked over at the back of The Hanged Man\u2019s chair.Typically speaking, it was impossible for him to see the back of the chair from his angle, but this was where he was in control. Everything presented itself according to his will.The constellation on the back of the chair had not changed, but since Klein had grasped the basics of mysticism, he wasn\u2019t as ignorant as before. He could recognize that it was the symbol of \u201cWindstorm.\u201dSailor\u2026 Keeper of the Sea\u2026 Windstorm\u2026 That\u2019s reasonable. The color deep in The Hanged Man\u2019s aura is much purer than it was\u2026 Has he leveled up? Oh yeah, what about the symbol behind my chair?Klein suppressed his impulse to look, rapped the edge of the long table thrice just like before, and smiled as he said, \u201cCongratulations, Miss Justice, you are a Beyonder now.\u201dHe can tell straight away? Audrey was stunned and smiled faintly.\u201cThank you, Mr. Fool, and thank you, Mr. Hanged Man.\u201d\u201cThat was much faster that I thought,\u201d Alger Wilson said honestly.Klein didn\u2019t continue the topic but tapped his glabella and said with a smile, \u201cLady, Sir, have either of you found Roselle\u2019s diary?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, she widened her crystalline eyes and glanced at The Hanged Man with a scrutinous attitude.Alger subconsciously subdued his body motions. After a few seconds of silence, he said, \u201cI found two pages of the Emperor Roselle\u2019s diary and have memorized their contents.\u201d\u201cI have one page,\u201d Audrey, whose vision was obscured by the fog, said as though she was removed from the conversation.\u201cPretty good.\u201d Klein did not allow his joy or his disappointment be noticed from his voice.He felt joy as there were three full pages, but disappointment also because there were only three pages. Their initial search for the diary was definitely easier, for all they had to do was ask through their connections and channels they were already familiar with. Collecting the pages would become more and more difficult as time went on as it would involve more and more elements.\u201cShould we \u2018express\u2019 them now?\u201d Audrey inquired with a calm tone.\u201cYes.\u201d Klein simply nodded.He maintained his posture without any change. He had to be cautious in front of a Spectator.As he finished his sentence, pieces of yellowish-brown goatskin parchment and dark red fountain pens appeared in front of Audrey and Alger.The two of them picked up their pens and started to recall the symbols they had seen. They also infused the emotions of expressing them out.Silently, lines of text appeared on the goatskin. Some of them appeared proper, some delicate, others slanted.In a mere minute, the contents that Alger and Audrey had forcibly memorized were all written.Klein willed the three pieces of parchment into his hands.He gave the pages a cursory glance and realized that some of the grammar was wrong. There were also missing and wrong words in the content.But experimentation had proved that incorrect sequencing of words to some extent did not affect the overall comprehension of Chinese. Klein was also not afraid of missing words since he often read web novels filled with censored asterisks.\u201c8th April. I stood at the bow of Black King and stretched my arms, saying to Grimm and Edwards, \u2018My fortune is yours for the taking, but you\u2019ll have to find it first. I left everything I own at the ends of the Fog Sea!\u2019 They did not understand my humor at all and even asked if I really had other treasures. How boring. You can\u2019t be my Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse if you keep at that!\u201d\u201cApril 11th. I discovered a nameless island that was not on a safe sea route. There are a good number of extraordinary animals there, no\u2014I prefer calling them extraordinary beings; it feels more impressive that way. Other than that, there are several weird creatures on the island. I believe that if Darwin had been transmigrated there, there is no way he could have written his Theory of Evolution.\u201d\u201cApril 15th. Grimm has suddenly become a little odd. Has he been infected by something?\u201dWhen did the Emperor Roselle, who was born in the Intis Kingdom, set off on a voyage? The Fog Sea should be the sea west of the Intis Republic\u2026 Yea, I need to use historical information from the library to cross reference this\u2026 Klein quickly finished reading a page, casting his gaze to the back of the piece of paper.At this point, he no longer hid the fact that he could decipher Emperor Roselle\u2019s secret symbols since this ability fitted the persona and status of The Fool. Audrey and Alger did not speak. They waited silently, as if unsurprised by such a revelation. In fact, they even believed that it was only right.\u201cOctober 2nd. They actually wanted me to marry Matilda from the Abel family without even consulting me first! Heavens, I have not even met her! No, I must decline! Even if I were to run away from home and survive on my own and suffer the vicissitudes of life, I must fight against this marriage!\u201d\u201cOctober 5th. Miss Matilda is really pretty.\u201d\u201cOctober 6th. Her personality and her demeanor is just my type. I am starting to look forward to the marriage.\u201dHey, Emperor, where is your integrity? Klein leaned back into his seat, not allowing his emotions to pass through the fog.He realized that Gustav did not write in his diary every day early on. Most of the time, he would only write in the diary when there were certain events that he needed to lampoon, record, or to vent his emotions.He shifted his gaze downward. Klein looked at the last sentence of this page.\u201cOctober 9th. They actually called me the Son of the Steam. I like that very much.\u201dKlein was a little disappointed that the information in the first two pages was of little value.But he did not turn sullen. He moved the third page to the top. This page had content written on both sides of the paper.\u201cMay 21st. The Church of the God of Craftsmanship gave me two choices, two beginning Sequence pathways. One of them is the Savant. It is a complete Sequence pathway they possess. The other is Mystery Pryer, which they obtained from the Moses Ascetic Order, but it lacks the higher Sequences.\u201d\u201cMay 22nd. My choice was easy: Savant! The Savant has a complete Sequence pathway! Although wielding more information on mysticism can aid my return home, the problem is that if I am not strong enough, there is a need to acquire external help for transmigration. And I do not know if this external entity would be good or bad, benevolent or malicious. I cannot control it, and thus it could be very dangerous. In that case, why not strengthen myself and return by relying on my own powers? Thus, the complete Sequence was the most important factor in my considerations!\u201d\u201cMay 23rd. I have become a Savant. With the power of the potion, I actually recalled all the knowledge I had learned in the past, such as physics, chemistry, etc\u2026\u201cI have not only recalled the knowledge, but I understand it more deeply, as well as its possible applications and implications. Haha, this is a \u2018job\u2019 specially tailored for a transmigrator like me from an alternate realm. I will be able to express my advantage to the greatest extent! I have to say that if I were to return in my present state to the third year of high school, I would definitely become top scholar. If I could further specialize in an area, it wouldn\u2019t even be too hard for me to become a scientist.\u201d\u201cMay 26th. I am enjoying my status as a Savant. Something odd worth mentioning. When I address myself as a Savant, doing things that are in line with this role, the murmurings that drive me crazy become considerably softer. I have also been able to control my occasional temper outbursts. I have also recalled the matter regarding the diary.\u201cIs this the \u2018acting\u2019 that the mysterious Mr. Zaratul mentioned? This could be key in resolving the side effects posed by potions.\u201dAs Klein read the diary page, he had a deep realization that there was a fundamental difference between how he and the Emperor Roselle did things.For example, regarding the matter of returning home, Klein considered grasping in-depth knowledge of mysticism to avoid risks and accomplish his goal, while Emperor Roselle preferred to rely on himself and face the risk.I have to say, I envy people like that sometimes. Perhaps everyone yearns for something they do not possess\u2026 Of course, I also have to consider strengthening myself; both of these are important, Klein thought, sighing a little.The description provided by Emperor Roselle about acting instilled Klein with confidence that the conclusion he made about acting yesterday was more or less correct.He put the three diary pages down, looked up at Justice and The Hanged Man. He smiled and said, \u201cMy apologies, I was too absorbed in reading them.\u201dAudrey calmed the envy in her heart and smiled faintly.\u201cI can understand. I hope to one day be able to exchange information about the diary\u2019s contents.\u201d\u201cThat will require a price.\u201d Klein smiled and glanced at Justice, then swept his gaze towards the silent Hanged Man.Audrey put her palms together and placed them in front of her.\u201cMr. Fool, Mr. Hanged Man, I have three questions to ask. If you think that the answers warrant a high price, tell me what you want, I will try my best to seek it.\u201d\u201cNo problem,\u201d Alger answered succinctly.Klein nodded and leaned back further, making himself comfortable.Audrey thought for a few seconds and said, \u201cThe first question is, what does \u2018acting\u2019 really mean? I realize that the remnant psyche in the potion has minute effects on me; is that because I\u2019ve been acting as a Spectator all this while?\u201dAlger did not speak; instead, he looked at The Fool, as though waiting for him to give an answer.Klein rubbed his finger on the edge of the table and said in a relaxed tone, \u201cLet me explain this with an analogy. Imagine the core powers of your potion as a tightly guarded castle. The remnants of the psyche that can cause a lash back resides within that castle. Our goal is to get rid of it and become the true master of the castle.\u201cThere are two ways we can do that. The first is to forcefully invade the castle. There is no guarantee that this will work, and you will most definitely injure yourself unless you can suppress it with absolute power. But of course, we are not equipped to do that.\u201cThe second way is to get the owner of the castle to extend an invitation. This invitation can allow us to slide through the scrutiny of the guards and infiltrate the castle. We can then easily finish off the enemies. But the problem lies in the fact that this invitation specifies the facial features and characteristics of the guest. Thus, we have to disguise ourselves and act as the guest, do you understand?\u201dAlger immediately asked, as if he had anticipated this reply, \u201cThen the aforementioned invitation is the name of the potion\u2019s Sequence?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Klein answered with great affirmation.Audrey froze for a moment, having the sudden feeling that she completely understood what \u2018acting\u2019 meant.She immediately exited her Spectator state due to her excitement. She praised in joy, \u201cWhat an exceptional method, I think\u2014I think it fits your title. Its style is very compatible with The Fool\u2026 I would never have believed that acting would have such an effect. Luckily, I have been acting as a Spectator the past few days.\u201dShe paused for a moment before saying, \u201cI think that this is a very valuable answer; my heart is not at ease accepting it for nothing. Mr. Fool, what do you need in exchange? Of course, I still remember that I owe you a page of Emperor Roselle\u2019s diary.\u201d\u201cMore pages of Roselle\u2019s diary, or\u2026\u201d Klein paused for a moment.He had wanted to get information about the Sequence regarding the Seer but felt that such a low-level request would ruin the mystical image of The Fool. Thus, he chose to give up on it and planned to ask them discreetly some other day.I just advanced recently and have yet to completely digest the Seer potion\u2026 He consoled himself and added on without expression, \u201cAnything regarding the Antigonus family, even if I\u2019m already aware of them myself.\u201dAlger remained silent for a few seconds. He looked at the top of the long bronze table for a moment before slowly opening his mouth.\u201cMr. Fool\u2026 I believe I can pay you back immediately with the information you requested just now.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 - Second Blasphemy SlatePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 60: Second Blasphemy SlateTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudios\u201cNo problem.\u201d Klein tried to maintain his unchanging deep tone.He rested his left elbow on the armrest of his chair and supported his forehead slightly with his fingers, posing as though he was listening calmly.Alger deliberated over his words and said, \u201cThe Antigonus is an ancient family. Their history can be traced back to the Cataclysm Epoch before the Fourth Epoch and is related to the second Blasphemy Slate.\u201dThe second Blasphemy Slate? There\u2019s a second Blasphemy Slate? How many are there? Klein\u2019s pupils shrank, and he nearly changed his posture.According to what The Hanged Man and Justice have said previously, the Blasphemy Slate contained the profound mysteries of the twenty-two paths of the divine!There are two of such important items, or even more?Twenty-two paths of the divine\u2026 Sequences and pathways\u2026 Could these two nouns mean the same thing? Every complete Sequence pathway leads straight to the throne of the divine?At that instant, the description of the second Blasphemy Slate gave Klein numerous thoughts. He believed that if not for the thick grayish-white fog concealing him, his emotional reaction would probably have been discovered by Miss Spectator.As for the words Cataclysm Epoch, he was no stranger to that term as a historian. It was the name of the third epoch.After his recent revision, Klein even knew that the third epoch was separated into two eras: the Glorious Era and the Cataclysm Era.\u201cA second Blasphemy Slate?\u201d Audrey plainly revealed her ignorance on the matter.Before she calmed her emotions, she returned to her Spectator state.Nice question! Klein secretly cheered for Miss Justice.It was a question inconvenient for him to ask as The Fool.Alger stole a glance at The Fool and noticed that his posture remained the same, nor did he make a sound. Hence, he thought and answered, \u201cThe first Blasphemy Slate appeared in the Dark Epoch, which is the second epoch where we humans struggled to survive under the protection of gods. The second Blasphemy Slate appeared at the end of the third epoch. It could even be said that its appearance symbolized the end of the Cataclysm Epoch.\u201cThe content of the two Blasphemy Slates is kept secret by the seven major churches. I only know bits and pieces of it. I only know that they involve the pathways to godhood, but I am not sure of the differences between them.\u201d\u201cWas the Blasphemy Slate that Emperor Roselle saw the first or the second?\u201d Audrey asked curiously.Upon hearing that, Klein recalled what Alger said about the potion names during the first Gathering. He said that the names of the Sequence potions were derived from the Blasphemy Slate!Similarly, Captain had also mentioned that the formation and completion of the potion system was thanks to the birth of the Blasphemy Slate\u2026 That indirectly confirms that the pathways to godhood are the Sequence pathway! Klein answered his earlier question silently.Then Alger simply replied, \u201cThe second one.\u201dThe glint in Audrey\u2019s eyes diminished and she returned to her Spectator state. She did not continue asking questions; instead, all she did was focus her gaze on The Hanged Man.It was obvious that her scrutiny made Alger uncomfortable, but he suppressed the emotions within him. He lowered his voice and continued, \u201cDuring the Solomon Dynasty in the Fourth Epoch, although the Antigonus family was considered an illustrious part of the aristocracy, they didn\u2019t do anything very memorable until they supported the establishment of the Tudor Empire. They then stood right in the middle of the stage of Northern Continent.\u201cIn that period, Antigonus, Amon, Abraham, Jacob, and others were illustrious names of the human kingdom. However, after the War of the Four Sovereigns, the Blood Emperor from the Tudor Empire perished. They fell from the top of their pedestal and are now hunted by the seven gods.\u201cI am not sure about the actual process, but I do know that the Antigonus family was destroyed at the hands of the Church of the Evernight Goddess. Mr. Fool, if you\u2019d like to know more, I am afraid that you can only obtain the information from the Church of the Evernight Goddess or from the few ancient secret organizations. You know which few I am referring to.\u201dI don\u2019t\u2026 Klein nodded while feeling bitter inside.\u201cOkay.\u201dThe Secret Order is one. Captain and Old Neil mentioned the Moses Ascetic Order. I wonder if the Psychology Alchemists count\u2026While he mentally checked off the candidates, Alger provided him with the last bits of information.\u201cI similarly have no idea which Sequence pathways the Antigonus family held. There are only two adjectives that appear repetitively in the descriptions of the Antigonus family, and those are 'strange\u201d and \u201cterrifying.\u201dStrange and terrifying\u2026 Thinking back to the notebook, the original Klein and his classmates, and what happened to Ray Bieber\u2019s mother, it really is aptly worded\u2026 Klein continuously rapped the edge of the long table with the tip of his finger a couple of times.Then, he slowly began to speak.\u201cVery well, I am satisfied with the payment.\u201dThe reason he continuously rapped the long table lightly with his fingers was to emphasize the action, to make Justice and The Hanged Man believe that he had a habit of rapping in order to conceal the fact that the same motion was used to activate and deactivate his Spirit Vision.\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d Alger did not say anything else.Audrey took a look at The Hanged Man and then The Fool. She smiled faintly and said, \u201cThen, I shall ask the second question: what is the name of the subsequent potion for Spectator? Where can I find the clues?\u201dI\u2019d also like to ask so straightforwardly, but different choices lead to different difficulties\u2026 Klein did not speak but cast his gaze towards The Hanged Man.Alger remained silent for a few seconds before saying, \u201cI\u2019ll answer the question for free because I led you on this pathway.\u201cThe subsequent Sequence for Spectator is Sequence 8 Telepathic. The ancient name of Sequence 7 is Psyche Analyst but is called Psychiatrist now. This is what I found out from a member of the Psychology Alchemists. I think they should have quite a number of potion formulas for this pathway.\u201dPsychology Alchemists\u2026 Spirit Medium Daly was rather approving of their theory, but Captain thought of them as evil and crazy\u2026 Klein listened while in deep thought.\u201cDo you know the whereabouts of that particular Psychology Alchemists member?\u201d asked Audrey as her eyes beamed with joy.Be it Telepathic or Psychiatrist, both names appealed to her aesthetics.Alger gave a rare laugh.\u201cI do. He\u2019s immersed in the seas around Sonia Island. I sank him with my own hands.\u201cIf you would like to look for the Psychology Alchemists, I have to apologize since I severed the clues.\u201dHe was not worried that Justice would find his identity through his description because he did that on his own, out of the public eye.\u201cSank\u2026\u201d Audrey was at a loss how to reply or what expression to wear.She drew a deep breath and suddenly failed to maintain her Spectator state. She asked bashfully, \u201cThe third question. If\u2014and I\u2019m saying if\u2014a normal animal were to drink a Sequence 9 potion, what would happen?\u201dWhat kind of a question is that? Klein tapped his glabella unnoticeably with his finger that was supporting his forehead.Very quickly, he saw the changes in color and noticed that Audrey\u2019s emotions had turned frantic, nervous, and a little ashamed.Could she have done something that stupid? Klein was astounded, but didn\u2019t find it strange.After the past two Gatherings, he was certain that Miss Justice was quite an airhead.The Hanged Man, Alger, was obviously dumbfounded as well. He took a while to reply.\u201cNormal animals do not have the brains of humans. They wouldn\u2019t be able to learn Cogitation in a timely manner. Therefore, it would most likely lead to immediate death or a breakdown into a monster. However, if they survived the initial ingestion of the potion, they should become an extraordinary creature. If the potion has the ability to enhance their intelligence, they can even become smarter.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Audrey breathed out a silent sigh and nodded while saying with a relaxed tone. \u201cI have no other questions.\u201dAlger considered for a moment and did not mention matters regarding the Aurora Order or the Listener. Similarly, he shook his head and said, \u201cNor do I.\u201d\u201cI have something.\u201d Klein didn\u2019t change his posture but said with a smile, \u201cIt will require your cooperation.\u201dHe had yet to turn off his Spirit Vision, and he immediately saw that The Hanged Man was showing signs of nervousness, while Miss Justice was too simple-minded to show fear or carefulness.Before they could reply, Klein comforted them, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s trivial. If it succeeds, it will be beneficial to you, so I wouldn\u2019t be paying extra remuneration.\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201d Audrey instinctively entered the Spectator state, but she couldn\u2019t see through the thick gray fog engulfing The Fool.\u201cAs you will,\u201d Alger replied, steadying himself.Klein moved his fingers and smiled when he said, \u201cPreviously, I said that we would do some experiments to enable you to ask for a leave of absence. That way, you do not have to worry if you have to be somewhere inappropriate on a Monday afternoon.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s our wish.\u201d Audrey loosened her tightly knitted eyebrows.Alger thought and said, \u201cWhat do you need us to do?\u201d\u201cYou could try a piece of ritualistic magic during your free time. It need not be too formal. As long as you are in an environment that won\u2019t be disturbed\u2026 Put four brand new candles on an altar, placed on four corners respectively. It\u2019s best if they are candles with a sandalwood scent. Put a loaf of white bread near the candle on the top left corner, a bowl of Feynapotter noodles near the candle on the top right corner, paella by the candle on the bottom left corner, and a Desi pie by the candle on the bottom right corner\u2026 Use a silver knife to make a sealed spiritual environment\u2026\u201dKlein described his modified version of the luck enhancement ritual and taught Miss Justice how to create a spiritual environment for free.To be frank, as the ritual was targeted at himself, Klein believed that the former part, which was intended to attract the interest of an entity, could be omitted completely. However, he still worked hard to make the procedure seem important. Of course, it didn\u2019t comply with what Old Neil taught about gods being second and oneself being third.\u201c\u2026Mix moon flowers, gold mint, slumber flowers, fingered citron, and rock-rose together then distill it. Extract it for its essential oil, then pour a drop onto each candle\u2026\u201dAudrey listened with piqued interest as she recorded all that he said. When he was done, she asked, \u201cWhat about the incantation? Mr. Fool, what\u2019s the corresponding incantation?\u201dAlger stopped writing with the fountain pen in his hand as well. He turned his head to look at The Fool.Klein, who was immersed in the gray fog, tapped the edge of the long table with his finger lightly and said calmly and monotonously in Hermes, \u201cThe Fool that doesn\u2019t belong to this era, you are the mysterious ruler above the gray fog; you are the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She suddenly felt a tumultuous wave of emotion go through her, preventing her from maintaining her Spectator state.As an aficionado of mysticism, she had learned Hermes that was used in rituals and had tested out the rituals that fellow noble aficionados mentioned in private gatherings before she was pulled into the gray fog or made formal contact with Beyonder powers.None of those rituals had any effects, but they had given Audrey a basic understanding of the structure of incantations.Thus, she knew clearly what these three incantations described and signified.The descriptions usually described one of the seven gods that looked over this world!Thus, The Fool\u2019s incantation was claiming status equal to the Lady of Crimson, Mother of the Secrets, and the Empress of Disaster and Horror!Is Mr. Fool the unknown, mysterious, powerful, godlike entity that Glaint spoke of? The source of danger that we must avoid in rituals? Audrey quickly recalled the comments made during the strange rituals which she and her friends did not dare attempt back then. She was momentarily at a loss for words.Alger Wilson, who knew and understood much more than Audrey, shivered from the bottom of his heart.If the ritualistic magic which Mr. Fool designed truly points to him to allow him to accept our requests, w-we would have to be addressing him with Him. He is to be addressed in the third person, which is reserved for gods\u2026How lucky, how smart I was to act in concert with him and not do anything foolish. Even when I was testing him, I did not step beyond the boundaries of normalcy\u2026Could he perhaps be an ancient, mysterious, horrifying existence, only that he does not appear before us in his true form and name\u2026 The Primordial Demoness, the Hidden Sage, or the true Creator which many mysterious churches believe in?Alger understood that The Fool he was looking at now might not be his true form. He might not even have a gender or be a humanoid creature.Klein propped his forehead up with one hand and tapped on the table with the other hand. He acutely noticed the changes happening to The Hanged Man and Justice.But he acted as though nothing happened, as if everything was within his expectations. He continued without any care.\u201cI pray for your help.\u201cI pray for your loving grace.\u201cI pray for you to give me a good dream.\u201cMoon flower, an herb that belongs to the red moon, please bestow your powers to my incantation!\u201cFingered citron, an herb that belongs to the sun, please bestow your powers to my incantation.\u201d\u2026He finished describing the incantations that belonged to another type of ritual. After he was done, he smiled.\u201cLady, sir, have you memorized it?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Audrey exhaled. She quickly covered her mouth and recalled seriously.With her improved memory as a Spectator, she quickly processed the information and repeated the incantations as a form of confirmation.Alger acted more normally. His pen did not stop for a moment, no matter what he was thinking about.After Klein confirmed that Audrey was correct, he smiled and said, \u201cIf this test is successful, then we shall modify the ritual next time to achieve what we want to do.\u201d\u201cI hope that you will have the time to complete the ritual no later than Wednesday. \u201dHe intended to come in here again on Thursday night to ascertain if the ritualistic magic was successful.As for why he did not allow The Hanged Man and Justice to directly request a leave of absence, Klein was worried that he would be unable to discern if the results were from them asking for leave or merely the outcome of an attempt of the ritualistic magic. Was he to pull them into the Gathering if that happened?\u201cBy your will.\u201d Audrey and Alger replied respectfully, collecting themselves.\u201cAccording to The Hanged Man\u2019s suggestion last week, we shall have a time for casual conversation after all official issues have been discussed. Who shall begin?\u201d Klein gave a hand gesture signaling for someone to start.Audrey sighed and said, \u201cMr. Fool, the suggestion you made regarding the exam selection and the separation between civil and political matters has received the approval of many members of parliament. Perhaps it could become a reality. Of course, with the efficiency of this government, the bill will only appear half a year from now at the earliest.\u201dShe was not worried that The Hanged Man would track her down using this piece of information. She had intentionally and intermittently dropped hints and guided those proud wives to think that they had conceived the idea. Those ladies had rushed to tell their husbands, their fathers, and their brothers.At that moment Audrey felt as though she was watching a flock of golden peacocks showcasing their tail feathers.She believed that those women would drill it in themselves that they came up with the idea to claim the glory for themselves. They would soon forget about what Audrey\u2019s role in the matter was, fighting among themselves to see who thought of the suggestion first.Using this remarkable way to change the system of a kingdom gave Audrey a weird sense of satisfaction, as if she had found a way for a Spectator to influence the plot of a play.\u201cLet\u2019s hope so,\u201d Alger replied sarcastically.He paused for a few seconds, then glanced at The Fool. He deliberated before saying, \u201cIn recent decades, the amount of activities of the various secret organizations has seen an upward trend. In fact, there are even new secret organizations appearing, some of them having reached scale with a good number of Beyonders.\u201dAre you trying to ask me for the reason? I have not even gained access to information about illegal organizations\u2026 Klein merely smiled without commenting on The Hanged Man\u2019s news. He changed the subject and said vaguely, \u201cAn ancient power is about to wake from its slumber.\u201dFor example, the power represented by the Antigonus family diary\u2026\u201cIs that so\u2026\u201d Alger muttered softly to himself, as though he recalled something.Klein swept his gaze toward The Hanged Man, then past Justice and said with a smile, \u201cIf there is nothing else to share, then let\u2019s end today\u2019s gathering here.\u201d\u201cBy your will.\u201d Audrey and Alger stood up together.Klein moved his finger and severed his connection with the dark red stars. He watched as the two figures vanished from the magnificent palace.He stood up and turned toward his own chair which was also the back of the Seat of Honor at the bronze table. He looked at its symbol.Radiant stars formed a strange symbol. It was not a symbol that fit anything in Klein\u2019s present understanding of mysticism.He observed it closely before identifying the \u201cPupil-less Eye,\u201d a symbol representing secrecy. He also saw contorted lines that represented change. Each of the symbols were missing a portion and were overlapped with each other, creating a new symbol.An incomplete secret and an incomplete change\u2026 What do we get when we add them together? Klein creased his brows and muttered to himself, unable to come up with an answer.He retracted his gaze and walked along the ancient, magnificent palace. His eyes scanned every corner of the palace.\u201cBack when I casually imagined this place, it was merely a rough concept; I did not describe the shape of the palace, table, or chairs\u2026 Where does this design come from? The best choice? The first prototype? Or are they a reflection of reality?\u201d Klein suddenly had a question he neglected previously as he looked at the palace.Sigh, I have to say that even though I am a keyboard warrior, I am lacking experience in many areas. I am also not observant enough, to the point of only realizing this question now\u2026 With such a self-reflection, Klein made a serious effort to examine every corner of the palace, but did not find any other living things or anything strange.Klein did not dare to venture deeper, which seemed to be an illusory land without boundaries. He was afraid that he would end up completely lost.Wow, this place is indeed filled with mysteries\u2026 Who knows if there will be any changes to this area when I become more powerful\u2026 Klein sighed. He unleashed his spirituality and enveloped himself within, causing him to feel the rapid rush of plummeting.Everything flew past quickly. All kinds of illusions shattered. He tore through the grayish-white fog and saw reality. He saw the table, curtains, and clothes rack in his room.\u2026Backlund, Empress Borough.Audrey saw the oil painting that hung on the wall. She felt the softness the down-feathered pillow under her head provided.She did not stand up immediately; instead, she seriously recalled what had happened during the gathering, as if she was watching a play she had already watched.\u201cMr. Fool had a certain confidence in his tone when he told us to try the ritual and gave us the descriptions of the mysterious ruler, the King of Yellow and Black\u2026 Confidence\u2026\u201d Audrey exhaled as she was analyzing this silently, her body shuddering slightly.Forget it, since I cannot fight it, there\u2019s no need to think too much about it\u2026 Mr. Fool has always appeared friendly; he should be an entity that has a respect for order\u2026 Audrey\u2019s mood improved rapidly. She thought about her acting, and the weakening backlash of the potion.She hummed a merry tune and got off her bed. She walked toward the door and adjusted her state of mind, taking on her state as a Spectator.As she opened the door of the room, she saw a maid walking past. She saw the old calluses on her hands, the marks on her face, and other similar details. She could deduce many things from these observations.At this point, Audrey had a strange feeling. She quickly turned to look at the shaded corner of the balcony.She saw her golden retriever Susie sitting there, silently observing her, just like how she observed the maid.My Goddess\u2026 Audrey\u2019s lips twitched as she sighed. She wanted so much to hide her face.\u2026On the Sonia Sea, in the heavily protected captain\u2019s quarters.Alger woke up and noticed that nothing had changed around him. It was as if nothing had happened.He sighed and thought to himself, An ancient existence?\u2026Klein, who had exited the ritual, pulled open the curtains. He took out his notebook and began writing once again.He recalled the contents of Emperor Roselle\u2019s diary, hoping to reinforce the memory through writing and prevent himself from forgetting it in the future.Klein reread the notes several times after he finished writing. Finally, he tore the notes up and incinerated them.I shouldn\u2019t forget the most salient points if I do this once a week. But with time and the increasing complexity of my missions\u2026 How unfortunate, I do not have better ideas for the time being. I have not learned any cryptography\u2026 Klein collected himself and stretched his neck. He planned on heading to the Divination Club.A Seer was defined differently by different people. No one could say that another person\u2019s methods were wrong. So, Klein, who did not know which kind of Seer fit the requirements of the potion, could only correct it as he experimented to ascertain which one was the best fit!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then, he washed his white shirt, changing into a similar linen shirt along with the only decent cheap coat he had. He then briskly walked out onto the street.First, Melissa\u2019s dress. Then, Benson\u2019s suit. Only then can I consider a second suit for myself. Money is never enough\u2026 Besides, we need to save money to buy porcelain tableware to receive our guests\u2026 Plus, I have to save money to buy a variety of materials related to mysticism\u2026 Klein sat on the public carriage and took note of the financial status at home. The more he did the math, the more he shook his head.He reckoned he needed at least a year to let himself, his brother, and his sister live as a middle-class family.Of course, that was without taking promotions and pay rises into consideration.The public carriage drove past the streets and stopped opposite to the Divination Club on Howes Street.Klein pressed down on his black top hat and hopped off the carriage. He walked along the familiar street and entered the club located on the second floor. He then saw the beautiful brunette, Angelica.There was a hint of swelled redness to her eyes, but she looked extremely relaxed.Klein raised his hand to tap his glabella lightly and carefully examined her. He found out that the grayness deep in Angelica\u2019s emotional colors had greatly dispersed. It had been replaced with sunlight-like whiteness.After taking it in, Klein walked over, took off his hat, and smiled.\u201cMadam Angelica, it\u2019s a lovely day today, isn\u2019t it?\u201dAngelica lifted her head and was briefly shocked. She then beamed and said, \u201cYou are just like Mr. Vincent\u2019s cat. You don\u2019t make any sounds while walking, do you? You managed to tell? Hehe, I forgot that you are a fortune-teller skilled in face-reading\u2026\u201dShe paused, then she gently bit her lip before bowing.\u201cThank you. Thank you for your suggestion yesterday. I feel much better. I haven\u2019t been this relaxed, happy, and contented in a year.\u201dUpon hearing her show her sincere gratitude, Klein was infected with the joy and happiness she had. The corner of his lips lifted, and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure.\u201dAs he spoke, he could feel his spirituality relax and turn livelier.Is this what the Seer potion wants? A Seer that can really help the inquirer? Klein pinched his glabella as though he was thinking before secretly tapping twice.It had to be said that he found the action of activating and deactivating his Spirit Vision in practice insufficiently inconspicuous. However, the problem was that he hadn\u2019t thought of a better solution yet. As he had just become a Seer recently, his spiritually had yet to reach its limit, and the same was applied to his mastery. Hence, there didn\u2019t seem to be many suitable locations for an activation switch for his Spiritual Vision. The glabella was the best option by far.When I become a true Seer after fully digesting the potion, I should be able to design a more inconspicuous activation motion\u2026 Klein nodded unnoticeably and walked towards the half-opened meeting room.\u201cCoffee or tea?\u201d Angelica asked hurriedly.\u201cDesi coffee.\u201d Klein answered. He planned on trying out all the drinks the Divination Club had to offer.Then, he saw that there were six or seven members present, but not Hanass Vincent who was almost always was.\u201cMr. Vincent isn\u2019t here?\u201d Klein stopped in his tracks and asked a passing question.Angelica was taken aback as she said, \u201cMr. Vincent doesn\u2019t come every day. He accepted an invitation to give a lecture for a divination organization at Enmat Harbor. Are you looking for him?\u201d\u201cNot at all. I was just curious. After all, I\u2019ve seen him every time I\u2019ve come here.\u201d Klein shook his head with a smile.Meanwhile, he realized that there was a familiar face among the seven members present.Glacis, who had divined for him before, was present!Glacis was reading some information on the table with his monocle when he suddenly sensed someone looking at him. He lifted his and head cast his gaze.Obvious joy suffused his face as he propped himself up with both hands and stood up. He dashed towards Klein and stopped before him.\u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Moretti. I have been wondering if you would come today.\u201cI heard from Angelica that you are not a doctor, but a fortune-teller who is good at face-reading?\u201dKlein smiled.\u201cThat\u2019s not the only thing I\u2019m good at. Mr. Glacis. You no longer seem plagued by your ailment?\u201dHe pinched his forehead and tapped his glabella twice. He noticed that Glacis\u2019s health colors had returned to normal.\u201cYes, I was very regretful for not taking your suggestion back then. Luckily, there is a very amazing apothecary near my place. He gave my wife a magical medicine which brought me away from death,\u201d Glacis said emotionally.As a quasi-member of the Nighthawks, Klein asked out of occupational interest, \u201cVery amazing apothecary? Very magical medicine?\u201dMagical? How magical? Is it within the range of Beyonders?\u201cHe said that it was a kind of folk medicine from Lenburg. In short, it helped with treating my illness a lot,\u201d Glacis answered, without noticing anything abnormal about the question.Folk medicine apothecary? Klein tapped his glabella as though he was thinking.\u201cWhat\u2019s his name? Where does he stay? As you know, even a fortune-teller can\u2019t guarantee that they would remain in the pink of health all the time. Perhaps, I will need to go to purchase some medication from him in the future.\u201dKlein learned from his teacher and classmates that the current health system in the world was in a nascent state. There was almost no cure to many diseases, so the magical medications and miraculous apothecaries still controlled the market. There was no harm in knowing more, since it could one day serve useful.Glacis answered honestly, \u201cHis name is Lawson Darkwade. He has a tiny store at 18 Vlad Street in East Borough, named Lawson\u2019s Folk Herb Store.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Klein remembered it and spoke sincerely.Glacis turned around and invited him to sit beside him. At that moment, Angelica came over to serve the coffee she brewed.Compared to Southville coffee, Desi coffee is more fragrant, but has quite an inferior taste\u2026 Klein took a sip and savored it for a moment.Glacis hurriedly deliberated his words when he saw Klein put down his white porcelain cup.\u201cMr. Moretti, can I request a divination from you? I will pay according to a price you set.\u201d\u201cEight pence is sufficient. I will not raise the price out of the blue.\u201d Klein was hoping that someone would request his divination services. \u201cDo you need a divination room?\u201d\u201cAlright. Topaz.\u201d Glacis led the way with much more familiarity.After entering the divination room and locking the door, Klein sat behind the long table. He asked in a serious voice, \u201cMr. Glacis, what would you like the divination to be about?\u201d\u201cI have an investment opportunity, but the amount of money it involves is huge. If it fails, my family and I will take a heavy hit. I wish to know if it will be a successful investment.\u201d Glacis volunteered the information. \u201cI have divined using tarot cards previously. Hmm, a divination after purifying my soul. The result was pretty good. Yes, I did the interpretation myself, but I did not violate the principles of those symbols.\u201dKlein thought and asked curiously, \u201cIt\u2019d be great if you could describe the entire situation once more and give me your information again. It\u2019d be best if you have the other party\u2019s information, too. We will do an astrolabe divination.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Glacis organized his words and said, \u201cWhen Mister Lanevus examined the Hornacis mountain range, he discovered a gigantic mine rich in high-quality iron ore. He poured in all his savings to buy that land and hired a professional company to survey it. The result was a heartening one.\u201d\u201cHe lacks funds needed for subsequent developments, so he formed a steelworks company and intends to apply for a loan from the bank using the project. At the same time, he will also issue a corresponding number of shares to raise its initial capital. The plan is still in its preparatory stage and promises fat returns.\u201dKlein, who had been reading the newspaper recently and also happened to be a \u201chistory expert,\u201d knew that there were shares in this world. He also knew that the concept of shares was derived from Emperor Roselle. Yeah, him again.During the colonization of the Southern Continent, he had set up the Siberon company and solved the nation\u2019s fiduciary matters successfully by raising funds from the public through the issue of shares. As such, he had the first-movers advantage from colonization.Because the returns were great, this development continued on. For example, there were railway shares, mining shares, steam development shares, and so on and so forth. There were some that succeeded and there were some that failed. Hence, it catalyzed the formation of organizations like the Backlund Stock Exchange.Besides that, the Emperor Roselle had created national bonds, unit trusts, and other financial products. The former had become the most stable form investment, with a return of four to six percent interest.Klein remembered that Benson had once said that if he could inherit three thousand pounds, there was no need to work hard any further. The stable annual interest of about five percent would result in an annual fixed income return of 150 pounds, roughly equivalent to Klein\u2019s annual income at present.This is known as rentier capitalism\u2026 Klein sighed and asked carefully, \u201cAre you sure there\u2019s nothing wrong about this? Is Lanevus trustworthy?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen his property papers and the inspection report. There is the Sivellaus county government\u2019s stamp and an endorsement of a professional company. Plus, inside Mr. Lanevus\u2019s office is a group photo of him with Sir Deweyville and the Mayor.\u201d Glacis nodded in reply.Group photo? That doesn\u2019t mean anything\u2026 Klein, who was born in an era of information explosion, had seen too many similar incidents. He didn\u2019t buy the story because of that.However, it didn\u2019t matter if he believed it or not. He could only pick up a pen and draw a corresponding astrolabe according to the crucial time and information that Glacis had provided him with.After a long while, Klein pointed to the astrolabe and said, \u201cYou should be able to tell that this will be a very unsuccessful endeavor. Below the flourishing surface is a cliff, a chasm. My divination suggestions going around it, to avoid it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Glacis fell into silence, his mouth turning agape a few times before he closed it.A few minutes later, he said with a rueful smile, \u201cI\u2019ll consider it carefully when I\u2019m back.\u201dUpon hearing this answer, Klein could only shake his head with a silent sigh. He realized the helplessness of a Seer.A Seer could only give suggestions and not make the decision for others.Just as the two left the Topaz room, Angelica walked over and said, \u201cMr. Moretti, someone wishes for your divination.\u201dWhen she said that, she added with a whisper, \u201cHe did not ask for my recommendations. Nor did he view the album.\u201dHas my reputation spread? Klein turned towards the reception hall in puzzlement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was dressed in a formal black suit and a halved top hat. He held a gold-inlaid wooden cane and his short blond hair flared from the sides. His nose was aquiline like a hawk\u2019s beak.Anna\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2026 The Joyce Meyer that went through a terrifying ordeal. Klein, who had seen him in his dream divination, immediately greeted with a smile, \u201cGood afternoon, Mister Meyer.\u201d\u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Moretti.\u201d Joyce took off his hat and bowed in greeting. \u201cThank you for the advice you gave Anna. She cannot stop praising how miraculous you are.\u201dKlein chortled and said, \u201cI did not change a thing. You should be thanking yourself. Without your determination and your hope for a better tomorrow, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to overcome such an ordeal.\u201dAfter the exchange of pleasantries, Klein could not help but lampoon inwardly.Does this count as mutual professional bootlicking?\u201cIn all honesty, I still find my coming back alive a dream. I still cannot believe that I survived wave after wave of terrifying ordeals.\u201d Joyce shook his head wistfully.Without waiting for Klein\u2019s reply, he asked curiously, \u201cYou knew who I was the moment you saw me. Was that because of my unique nose, or because you divined that I would visit you?\u201d\u201cI had your detailed information. That is enough for a seer,\u201d Klein answered vaguely, behaving like how a charlatan would.Joyce was indeed stunned. More than ten seconds later, he squeezed a smile.\u201cMr. Moretti, I wish to request a divination from you.\u201dThe moment he finished his sentence, he suddenly realized something.Mr. Klein Moretti had addressed himself as a seer, not a fortune-teller. A seer!\u201cAlright, let us head to Topaz.\u201d Klein gestured.At that moment, he felt as though he should have worn a long black robe. He tried to keep his words to a minimum to accentuate the mystique of a seer.Joyce Meyer locked the door behind him after entering the divination room. While he observed his surroundings, Klein seized the opportunity to tap his glabella twice and activated his Spirit Vision.Joyce sat down and set his cane down beside him. He pulled on his black bow tie and said hoarsely, \u201cMr. Moretti, I wish for you to interpret my dream.\u201d\u201cDream interpretation?\u201d Klein acted as though it was within his expectations, but was merely asking for confirmation.He saw that the colors representing Joyce\u2019s health were dull, but none of them signified an impending illness. The colors symbolizing his emotions were predominantly blue, and its darkness showed that he was obviously high strung.Joyce nodded seriously.\u201cI have had the same horrific dream every night ever since the Alfalfa arrived at Enmat Harbor. I know that this could be associated with the trauma of the ordeal and that I should go see a psychiatrist, but I suspect that this is no ordinary dream. A normal dream would definitely have some details that are different even if they recur every night, but this dream is, at the very least, constant in the parts which I can recall.\u201d\u201cTo a seer, these kinds of dreams are seen as revelations given by the divine,\u201d Klein said, half consoling and half explaining. \u201cCan you describe the dream to me?\u201dJoyce clenched his fists and up to his. He thought deep for a moment before saying, \u201cI dreamed that I was falling from the Alfalfa into the ocean. The ocean was dark red, as if it was filled with rotting blood.\u201cAs I fell, I was grabbed by a person on the boat. I could not identify him, but I know that he was very strong.\u201cAnd I was also holding onto a person in an attempt to save him from falling into the sea. I know that person. He was a passenger of the Alfalfa, Younis Kim.\u201cBecause of his weight and his struggling, I could not bear the weight and could only release my hands and watch him get devoured by the sea of blood.\u201cAt that moment, the person above me also released his hand. I flailed my arms, hoping to grab onto something, but there was nothing. I could only plummet rapidly.\u201cThen I wake up in horror, sweat covering my back and forehead.\u201dKlein held his forehead and gently rapped it as though he was thinking. He then organized his words and said, \u201cMr. Meyer, nightmares, similar nightmares, and repeated nightmares, these are all psychological problems and have a corresponding source. The same nightmare recurring time and time again is a reminder from your spirituality. It is also a revelation given to you by the divine.\u201dUpon seeing Joyce appearing confused, he elaborated, \u201cDo not have any doubt, an ordinary person\u2019s spirituality is also capable of giving reminders.\u201d\u201cI do not know what exactly happened on the Alfalfa, but I can see that it was a tragedy of blood and steel. It has left a deep trauma in you.\u201dSeeing Joyce nod slightly, Klein continued, \u201cYou must have been very horrified, very fearful on the ship. It is easy for a person to lose their observational skills when overwhelmed by such intense emotions; thus missing signs that they should not have been missed. This does not mean that you have not seen those signs, but you have disregarded them, you understand? Disregarded.\u201cIn your subconscious, in your spirituality, the details that you have missed are present all the same. If the thing that the detail is pointing toward is important enough, then your spirituality will remind you in the form of a dream.\u201dPreviously, I had similar case of disregarding a feeling, only to later realize that the diary was with Ray Bieber\u2026 But I was more sensitive and had stronger spirituality. I was also more knowledgeable about mysticism and thus could make a deduction more quickly\u2026 Klein paused for a few seconds and looked into Joyce Meyer\u2019s eyes.\u201cDid Mister Younis Kim, who you let fall into the sea of blood, requested you of something on the boat, but was ultimately unable to escape his fate?\u201dJoyce fidgeted his body unnaturally. He opened his mouth several times before answering,\u201cYes, but I do not pity him. Perhaps a few days or a week from now, you will see in the newspapers how cruel and evil he was. He raped and murdered at least three ladies and tossed a baby into the raging sea. He also led a bunch of savages who had lost their rationality and brutally massacred the passengers and crew of the boat.\u201cHe was scheming, strong, and evil. I did not dare, nor could I stop him. I would only have forfeited my life.\u201d\u201cI am not doubting what you did,\u201d Klein said, making clear his stand. Then he explained, \u201cBut your dream is telling me that you are feeling regret and sorry. You believe that you should not have released your hand back then. Since you believe that killing him was an act of justice, then why are you feeling regret and sorry for it, so much so that you have recurring dreams about you releasing your hand?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either\u2026\u201d Joyce shook his head, confused.Klein crossed his hands and placed it under his chin. He attempted to analyze the situation.\u201cIncorporating what I just described, it seems you have missed certain details. For instance, anything that Younis Kim mentioned, his contents of his plea, the way he presented himself, et cetera. I cannot recall the incident for you, so please think about it carefully.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing\u2026 All he could say back then was \u2018spare me, I surrender\u2019\u2026\u201d Joyce muttered in puzzlement.Klein did not know exactly what happened, so he could only guide him based on what he understood from the dream.\u201cPerhaps you felt that Younis Kim was more useful alive, that he could prove something or to explain something?\u201dJoyce knitted his brows. It was a while before he said, \u201cPerhaps\u2026 I still find the conflict that arose on the Alfalfa happened too suddenly and turned intense too quickly. It was as if the passive evil in everyone\u2019s heart just erupted uncontrollably\u2026 It was too abnormal, very abnormal\u2026 Perhaps\u2014perhaps I wished to interrogate Younis Kim why he acted as though he was possessed by the devil in the first place\u2026\u201dKlein suddenly had a stroke of inspiration after hearing Joyce\u2019s dreamy description. He spoke mysteriously with a tone unique to charlatan\u2019s.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not the only reason.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Joyce seemed shocked.Klein crossed his hands and held his chin up. He stared straight into Joyce\u2019s eyes and said with a slow, yet forceful tone,\u201cNot only did you find the matter abnormal, but you also saw some things that you disregarded. And putting together these things that you disregarded results in a terrifying conclusion.\u201cYour spirituality is telling you that there is someone who should be under the highest suspicion. And that person is the one who had grabbed you but ultimately released his hand in the dream. You do not suspect him subconsciously, and thus you are unable identify him. He is your partner. He once had control over your fate, or maybe, even saved you before!\u201dJoyce leaned back suddenly, slamming into the back of the chair with a dull thud.His forehead slowly became laced with sweat, his eyes filled with confusion.\u201cI\u2026 I see it\u2026\u201dJoyce suddenly stood up noisily, causing his chair to wobble and nearly fall.\u201cMr. Tris\u2026\u201d He used all the energy in him to utter the name.He was a friendly and bashful little boy with a round face. He was the hero that saved the survivors\u2026Klein did not interrupt Joyce\u2019s thoughts. He leaned back slightly and waited.Joyce\u2019s expression changed several times, finally returning to normal, a normal that had a little paleness.He revealed a rueful smile.\u201cI understand now. Thank you for interpreting my dream. Perhaps it is time for me to make a trip to the police station.\u201dHe took out his leather wallet and fished out a one-soli note.\u201cI do not think that money can fully represent your worth, and I can only give you the price you asked for. This is for you.\u201d Joyce pushed the note toward Klein.I wouldn\u2019t have minded if you gave me 10 pounds\u2026 One soli, you sure are like your fianc\u00e9e\u2026 Klein kept up his mysterious vibe as a charlatan and said nothing, smiling as he pressed on the note.Joyce took a deep breath, wore his hat, and turned to walk toward the door.As he was unlocking the door, he suddenly turned back and said with sincerity,\u201cThank you, Master Moretti.\u201dMaster? Klein laughed to himself. He watched as Joyce left the divination room and said silently to himself,Whatever happened on the Alfalfa seems extraordinary\u2026 If only the Captain was here. He would be able understand everything that happened in Joyce Mayer\u2019s dreams\u2026\u2026Tuesday at dawn. Backlund, Empress Borough.Audrey, who woke up earlier, beckoned her golden retriever Susie over. She said with a serious tone, \u201cSusie, you are also a Beyonder now. We are the same kind, ew\u2014no, what I mean is that we have to help each other. Guard the door later and don\u2019t let anyone disturb me. I have to conduct a ritual.\u201dSusie looked at her mistress and shook her tail in exasperation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She too was uncertain if the ritualistic magic would result in anything odd.\u201cLet\u2019s do this\u2026\u201d Her eyes turned calm as she used her state as a bystander to view the imagined process. Soon, she came to a new arrangement.Audrey unlocked the door to her bedroom and said to Susie, \u201cSusie, sit here. If Annie and the rest try to barge their way in, immediately go to the bathroom to inform me.\u201dIn order to prevent any accidents, her personal maidservant had the key to unlock her door.Susie looked at her enigmatically and wagged her tail thrice.\u201cVery good. I will let you choose anything you want for lunch today!\u201d Audrey pumped her fist gently.After exhorting Susie, she entered the bathroom. The square bathtub was three to four meters on each side. There was clear water rippling gently in it with steam emitting from it. It was quite a dreamy sight.Audrey tidied up a rectangular table with many bottles placed on it. Then, she went back out and moved candles, sacrificial items, and a white robe over.Immediately after that, she closed the bathroom door.With everything done, Audrey heaved a sigh of relief and picked up a translucent light-blue bottle beside the four candles.The cylindrical bottle shimmered dreamily under the light. In it was the essence oils she had distilled from a mixture yesterday. As an aficionado of mysticism, she had no lack of research regarding such items. She had many different kinds of pure dew, flower essence, perfume, essential oils, and incense that she brewed herself at home. As such, she had already finished the initial preparations according to The Fool\u2019s instructions.\u201cMoon flowers, gold mint, slumber flowers, fingered citron, and rock-rose\u2026 What an odd concoction\u2026\u201d Audrey mumbled softly. \u201cOh, one has to cleanse one\u2019s body and calm their mind before engaging in ritualistic magic. This is a form of reverence to the divine\u2014uh, to the target.\u201dAs she went through the entire process in her head, she placed the ritual\u2019s essential oil beside her bathtub. She reached out and began disrobing what she wore at home.Pieces of her silk clothing fell into the laundry basket one after another. Audrey coiled up her hair into a bun and tested the water\u2019s temperature with her hand. Then, she carefully stepped into the bathtub, allowing her body to slowly sink into the water\u2019s warm embrace.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d She exhaled comfortably, finding herself warm all over. She felt abnormally relaxed.I don\u2019t even want to move a single finger\u2026 Audrey forcefully pumped herself out as she grabbed the translucent light-blue bottle beside her and dripped a few drops into the water.A waft of fragrance dispersed, filling the silence with a refreshing smell. Audrey breathed in a few times and nodded in satisfaction.\u201cNot bad. It smells really good.\u201cHow relaxing. How comfortable\u2026\u201cI don\u2019t want to move at all. All I wish is to lie here in silence\u2026\u201cSilence, in silence\u2026 si\u2026lence\u2026\u201dAfter losing her sense of time, Audrey suddenly heard barking.She opened her eyes in shock, looking to her sides in a daze. She had no idea when Susie had opened the door and entered. She was squatting outside the bathtub, looking at her with an exasperated look.As she rubbed the corners of her eyes, Audrey felt that the water had cooled down quite significantly.I-I fell asleep? She subconsciously asked herself.Susie looked at her without barking or wagging her tail.\u201cHaha, the effects of that bottle of ritual essential oil sure is great. Yeah, really great!\u201d Audrey chuckled dryly as she explained with a cheerful tone.She stood up, retrieved a towel, and as she wrapped and wiped her body, said to the golden retriever beside her, \u201cSusie, continue keeping watch. Do not let Annie and the rest enter!\u201dOnly when the golden retriever left did she secretly stick out her tongue. She threw her towel aside and wore a clean white robe.After closing the door to the bathroom, Audrey recalled the ritual she had memorized.She picked up four candles and placed them on the four corners of the table.A loaf of white bread at the top left corner, a bowl of Feynapotter noodles at the top right corner. Smells great, but it\u2019s a little cold\u2026 No! It\u2019s not time to think of this! Paella at the bottom left corner and Desi pie at the bottom right\u2026 Audrey set up the altar according to The Fool\u2019s descriptions seriously, shaking her head twice during the process.After she was done with the preparation, she left her four candles lit. She picked up a silver knife and stabbed it into a pile of coarse salt.After narrating the sacred incantation in Hermes, Audrey raised the knife with beautiful patterns and placed it into a cup filled with clear water.After focusing her mind, she pulled out the silver \u2018sacred blade,\u2019 cogitating her spirituality to spew out and spread from her blade.Invisible energy spewed out as Audrey held the knife and circled the altar once. When she felt that a spirituality wall was fully erected around her, she expelled all the uncleanliness and distractions outside.Maintaining her Spectator state, she prevented her excitement and joy from affecting the ritual.She put down the silver knife and picked up the tiny light-blue crystalline bottle and dripped a drop on each candle.Sizzle!A faint fragrance emanated as Audrey\u2019s body, heart, and soul seemed to attain tranquility.She drew a breath as she lowered her head in reverence and began chanting the incantation in Hermes.\u201cThe Fool that doesn\u2019t belong to this era,\u201cYou are the mysterious ruler above the gray fog,\u201cYou are the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck,\u201cI pray for your help.\u201cI pray for your loving grace.\u201cI pray for you to give me a good dream.\u201cMoon flower, an herb that belongs to the red moon, please bestow your powers to my incantation!\u201cFingered citron, an herb that belongs to the sun, please bestow your powers to my incantation!\u201d\u2026Right after Audrey chanted the incantation and hoped to cogitate the contents of her plea, she felt there was a stir within the spirituality wall. She saw a dark red star swirling on the back of her hand.Her heart leaped as she hurriedly closed her eyes and calmed her heart to plead sincerely.When everything was over, she surveyed her surroundings wondrously, but did not find anything odd.\u201cIs that all?\u201d Audrey knitted her eyebrows slightly as she whispered.\u2026The King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck\u2026 The Fool that doesn\u2019t belong to this era\u2026 In the Blue Avenger\u2019s captain cabin, Alger Wilson in his windstorm robe was silently reciting the three lines of description he had heard in the afternoon. He seemed to be attempting to find clues of the person\u2019s identity through it.He shook his head and stood up in a clearly vexed manner, but ultimately did not do anything.Alger was not at ease inside the Blue Avenger, an ancient ship that was a relic from the Tudor Dynasty. Although he was already in control of the ship, he had a gut feeling that there were still many hidden secrets, just like the Blood Emperor.Therefore, he planned on using the ship to test The Fool\u2019s powers but did not wish to attempt the unknown ritualistic magic on the ship.Alger ruminated for a few minutes before leaving the captain\u2019s cabin and went on deck. He said to the few sailors, \u201cWe will be reaching the Rorsted Archipelago soon. We will be anchoring there for a day.\u201dThe sailors immediately cheered as they shouted in unison, \u201cThank you, Your Grace!\u201dAs the ghost ship did not need sailors, there were very few sailors on board. There was no need to worry about their supplies, being able to enjoy fresh food and clean water. However, day after day of voyaging at sea and the nearly unending vistas exhausted them both physically and mentally. It felt like they were always repressed and tolerating something until they lost control.As for the Rorsted Archipelago, it was a famous colony on the Sonia Sea. Their business was booming, and they had all kinds of industries.\u201cI simply can\u2019t wait!\u201d A crew member gyrated his hips and sniggered a meaningful laugh that all men would understand.\u2026On the public carriage toward Zouteland Street, Klein, who was reading the newspapers leisurely, suddenly jolted. He seemed to hear an ethereal voice calling out to him.Shapeless murmurs resounded in his mind as his forehead throbbed uncontrollably.The contents of the calling that could not be heard left as fast as it came. In just ten seconds, it was gone. Klein pinched his forehead and resisted the throbbing pain deep in his brain.Is this the murmurings of unknown existences that Old Neil mentioned? A result of having enhanced spiritual perception? Thoughts flashed through Klein\u2019s mind as he suddenly saw four black dots appear on the back of his right hand. They were like tiny inconspicuous moles.The four black dots that stemmed from the luck enhancement ritual quickly sank, dimmed, and vanished.Klein looked at it in surprise and had an additional guess about what had just happened.Justice or The Hanged Man has attempted the ritualistic magic I gave them?Was my train of thought right?Those three descriptions have precisely pointed towards me through the mysterious space above the gray fog?But I\u2019m far from powerful enough. I can\u2019t hear the contents of their requests\u2026 I wonder if the information is \u2018stored\u2019 above the gray fog\u2026Yes, I should confirm it by entering tonight.Klein felt a little perturbed and agitated. He quickly raised his newspaper and hid his face, preventing anyone from seeing the changes to his expression.Soon, he arrived at Zouteland Street and entered the Blackthorn Security Company.Before he could greet Rozanne, Klein saw Captain Dunn Smith walk out. He held a piece of paper with a portrait on it.\u201cTake a look at this internal warrant of arrest. A very cruel and vicious Beyonder has entered Tingen.\u201d Dressed in his black windbreaker, the hatless Dunn swept his gaze over and handed the piece of paper in passing.Klein received it and the first thing that entered his vision was a portrait sketch.The sketch was of boy with a round face. He looked amiable with a tiny hint of bashfulness and was fairly young, probably about eighteen or nineteen years old.\u201cTris, a suspected Beyonder. The initial estimate is that he\u2019s a Sequence 8 Instigator and we are not eliminating the possibility that the Theosophy Order is behind it. The culprit behind the massacre of the Alfalfa\u2026 According to a witness testimony, he came to Tingen after leaving Enmat Harbor. His current whereabouts are unknown\u2026\u201dTris\u2026 Alfalfa\u2026 It\u2019s actually a crime committed by a Beyonder? Klein suddenly recalled the dream interpretation from yesterday afternoon and Joyce Meyer\u2019s description. He immediately said, \u201cCaptain, I know one of the witnesses. He might very well be an important witness.\u201d\u201cI know. Joyce Meyer. My help was requested by the Machinery Hivemind last night. I saw you in Joyce\u2019s dream. Many details have led to the confirmation that the Alfalfa tragedy was a result of Tris.\u201d Dunn\u2019s gray eyes looked unperturbed as he chuckled.How uninteresting. Captain\u2026 thankfully it was my rest day yesterday and not me acting as Seer during working hours\u2026 Klein lampooned. He barely missed the horror of being caught skiving by his direct superior.He asked instead, \u201cWhich Sequence pathway is Instigator? What kind of organization is the Theosophy Order?\u201dWas instigating others to kill each other the method Tris used to eliminate the side effects of the potion or was it a requirement needed to advance?Dunn thought for a few seconds and said, \u201cCoincidentally, it\u2019s about time for you to learn the relevant information regarding Beyonders and the mysterious organizations. You shouldn\u2019t be ordered by Old Neil to keep reading the historical documents all the time.\u201dCaptain, wasn\u2019t the reason for recruiting me to be your \u2018history expert?\u2019 Klein did not dare point out the problem as he nodded seriously.\u201cAlright.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 - Beyonder InformationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 65: Beyonder InformationTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosWith a document signed by Dunn, Klein went underground and turned into the armory.\u201cDunn is right. It\u2019s time you understand the different Beyonders and the various secret organizations.\u201d Dressed in a black classic robe, Old Neil read the note without finding it surprising. Instead, he supported the captain\u2019s decision.He then added immediately with a smile, \u201cAfter all, you will be heading to the underground market with me tomorrow night.\u201d\u201cTomorrow night?\u201d Klein did not conceal his pleasant surprise as he asked to confirm.Old Neil nodded and said with a sigh, \u201cI\u2019m a person who can\u2019t sleep when in debt. I always wish to settle them as soon as I can.\u201dYou did not seem to act so previously. You left it to the last moment before using ritualistic magic to resolve the problem\u2026 So, I\u2019m not the only one suffering from procrastination\u2026 Wait, is there a need to euphemize \u2018afraid to spend away the money to repay a loan?\u2019 Klein did not expose Old Neil and instead urged, \u201cMr. Neil, I\u2019ll be troubling you to retrieve the corresponding information from Chanis Gate.\u201dThere were mostly archaeological and historical documents in the armory. There were documents involving Beyonders and mysterious organizations, but few in number. Furthermore, they were mostly basic knowledge.Old Neil slowly took a sip from his hand-ground coffee and smacked his lips. He then walked out the armory with the signed and stamped document. Klein watched the place on his behalf.About ten minutes later, Old Neil returned with a huge stack of documents.\u201cThey can only be read in here. They are not to be taken out,\u201d he warned as he placed the information on the desk.\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein gave a firm nod. He extended his hands and quickly flipped through the pages and did a general read through.Very detailed\u2026 As expected of the Nighthawks\u2019s internal documents\u2026 As expected of a Church with four thousand years history or even more\u2026 Klein sighed inwardly as he glanced through the documents.Not only did the documents introduce the various secret organizations, it also listed down many of the Sequence pathways. It was very complete. Some of them only wrote the potion name of the corresponding Sequence while others only described the Beyonder abilities of the corresponding Sequence. Some were completely missing and left blank.While holding back his excitement, Klein found the Sequence pathway that led from Seer.He ruffled through the pages and soon found a familiar word.Then, his delighted expression quickly froze because there was no corresponding potion name\u2014Sequences 7 and 8\u2014after Seer!Thankfully, the abilities of the two following Sequences are present\u2026 Klein silently exhaled as he calmed his mind and read the description seriously.\u201cSequence 8: Potion name unknown. The corresponding Beyonder is good at fighting with artifice and very crafty.\u201dGood at fighting with artifice? This is the next advancement of Seer? Why does it feel odd\u2026 I\u2019m not a hunter\u2026 Am I going to become a melee mage? What does crafty mean? My intelligence is enhanced, making me good at fooling the enemy? Klein was stunned. He even suspected that the Nighthawks\u2019s information was wrong.There were corresponding case studies appended, but he could not find a reasonable explanation despite reading it repeatedly.He cast his gaze lower as the description of Sequence 7 entered his eyes.\u201cPotion name unknown. The corresponding Beyonder is good at many spells that can be quickly cast. Fuses one\u2019s body\u2019s skill and supernatural powers as one.That\u2019s more like it! This is what an advancement of a Seer should sound like! Klein heaved a sigh of relief.After seeing the case studies of Sequence 7, he cast his eyes to the overall description of the pathway.\u201cThis Sequence pathway was first established by the Solomon Empire\u2019s Zaratul family. During the conflicts of the Fourth Epoch, the family was not fully destroyed. The family\u2019s name was occasionally heard in the history of the Fifth Epoch\u2026 It is suspected to be connected to the ancient organization, the Secret Order.\u201dZaratul? Upon seeing this name, Klein\u2019s eyes constricted.He had just seen this name appear in the remnant diary pages of Emperor Roselle yesterday afternoon!Roselle\u2019s acting came from a reminder by the mysterious figure known as Zaratul!Because of that mysterious Zaratul, Emperor Roselle regretted not choosing Seer? Therefore, I was indirectly influenced, turning me into a Seer. It makes acting return to the embrace of the Seer\u2026 It feels like it was all predestined. Klein knitted his brows and felt that things were somewhat different.Just from the logical chain, he did not feel that there was anything wrong in any aspect. However, in the domain of mysticism, pre-destiny often manifested things and involved new problems.In addition, transmigration is quite a baffling matter\u2026 It\u2019s just confusing\u2026 And the guy I\u2019ve possessed tried to commit suicide because of the lost notebook of the Secret Order\u2026 Klein thought for quite a while and had many guesses, but lacked the information needed to prove them.Phew\u2026 After repeatedly reading the information, he finally suppressed his ideas and read the other records.He first found the Sailor Sequence and discovered that it indeed belonged to the Lord of Storms.For an old opponent that they haven\u2019t faced for perhaps more than two to three thousand years, the Nighthawks\u2019s internal records were rather detailed.\u201cSequence 8: Folk of Rage. Ancient name\u2014Guardian of the Windstorm. The corresponding Beyonder can release several strikes that exceed ordinary thresholds when enraged. Their strength and speed are greatly enhanced\u2026 Facing them is like facing a storm\u2026\u201cSequence 7: Seafarer. Ancient name\u2014Windstorm Priest. The corresponding Beyonder is also a scholar of astronomy and geography. They have an intuitive grasp of magnetic fields, ocean currents, wind direction, and clouds\u2026 A boat with a Seafarer will never get lost at sea\u2026 They are even more beloved by the oceans and gain enhancements in every aspect at sea\u2026\u201cThey are friends of water. They can act freely underwater for more than half an hour\u2026 They can cast a limited number of water-related spells. Some are a result of their own capabilities and some are a bestowment from the Lord of Storms, for example\u2026\u201dA Sequence 7 Seafarer is very powerful\u2026 Klein nodded while in deep thought.He suspected that The Hanged Man was a Guardian of the Windstorm, if not a Seafarer. From how he has recently advanced, it was more likely he was the latter.This also indicated in a way that The Hanged Man was either a member of the Mandated Punisher or a pirate who had been secretly absorbed by the Church of the Lord of Storms.Impressive. Impressive\u2026 Klein flipped back a few pages and found the advancement of Spectator. He discovered that the description was identical to what The Hanged Man had said.Sequence 9 Spectator was like a Seer. They lacked direct combat means and could only observe a target to obtain information, gleaning the true thoughts of the target. By doing so, they could provide subtle influences and guidance to cause situations to develop in a way they wish.Sequence 8 Telepathic was the advancement of Spectator. Their observation was not only limited to superficial details, but deeper into one\u2019s aura, Ether Body, or other mysterious domains. The combination of the two allowed a Telepathic to precisely understand a person\u2019s thoughts as though they could read their minds. In front of them, it was difficult to have any secrets.Sequence 7\u2019s Psychiatrist, which was also known as Psyche Analyst, had further enhancements above the Sequence 8 foundations. They could begin directly influencing a target. For instance, they could treat a target\u2019s maniacal problems or alternatively, cause them to turn maniacal and lose their reason.\u201cA Beyonder that is very difficult to be noticed\u2026\u201d After reading the description, Klein made a reasoned judgment.After understanding the relevant information concerning the Gathering members, he flipped to the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery. This was because Emperor Roselle had chosen their Savant Sequence.\u201cSequence 9: Savant. The corresponding Beyonder believes that knowledge is power. They have a rough understanding of the supernatural, but are more knowledgeable about aqua regia, nitroglycerin, and complicated bolts and gears. They seem to know everything.\u201dIt is no wonder that the Emperor Roselle said that this potion suited him perfectly, allowing for him to press his advantage to the fullest\u2026 Klein understood completely as he shifted his eyes down.After several case studies, the corresponding Sequence 8 finally appeared in Klein\u2019s vision.\u201cArchaeologist. They possess a good deal of knowledge about history and outdoor survival, as well as forbidden knowledge about ruins. They have a strong enough body and ability to face everything\u2026\u201d\u201cSequence 7: Appraiser. They can intuitively understand the powers and problems of most extraordinary items, and can use them while keeping danger at its lowest\u2026\u201dAs Klein\u2019s security clearance was insufficient, he only had access to Sequence pathways up to 7. It left him a little frustrated, but there was no other way around it. He only wished that Backlund would quickly send over the Sealed Artifact 2-049 to determine if Ray Bieber was a descendant of the Antigonus family.That way, he would have a chance of becoming a formal member and obtain a higher security clearance.Collecting himself, Klein read the material seriously from cover to cover. He knew that the sequences following Corpse Collector were Gravedigger and Spirit Medium. He also knew that there was no information about the Sequence 8 of the Mystery Pryer path. Not only was there no name for the potion, but even the description had been left blank. There was a name for Sequence 7 of that path: Warlock!Sounds impressive\u2026 Klein slowly flipped the page and saw Apprentice and Marauder which Emperor Roselle had lingering thoughts for. Their records only reached Sequence 8 and nothing more.\u201cSequence 9: Apprentice. Their abilities are rather strange. It can only be confirmed that this is the originating pathway of a mage. They are rarely trapped and very difficult to be stopped. They often are able to escape and pass through obstacles every time\u2026\u201cSequence 8: Trickmaster. They wield all kinds of strange but impotent spells\u2026\u201d\u201cSequence 9: Marauder. Difficult to separate these Beyonders from ordinary bandits or thieves. Perhaps the means available to them are more impressive, but their goal of stealing riches is not for enjoyment or survival. It\u2019s more like answering a calling\u2026\u201d\u201cSequence 8: Sequencers. We have also discovered traces of Beyonders in fraud investigations. They gain enjoyment from swindling\u2026\u201dGain enjoyment from swindling\u2026 This is \u2018acting\u2019 in a different form, isn\u2019t it? If I had the choice, I might have chosen Apprentice\u2026 Klein silently said to himself. Suddenly, he discovered the corresponding Sequence potion of the culprit of the Alfalfa tragedy, Tris\u2014Instigator.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They are adept at triggering the evil desires deep in people\u2019s hearts, causing contradictions and inciting conflict, thus resulting in bloody massacres\u2026\u201dThe description isn\u2019t detailed enough. From the looks of it, the Nighthawks do not understand the capabilities of this potion well enough\u2026 But it does match the characteristics of the Alfalfa tragedy\u2026 Klein cast his gaze up and read the corresponding Sequence 9 for Instigator.\u201cSequence 9: Assassin. Can transform their bodies in a short period of time and become light as a feather. They can also utilize vision equal to that of an eagle. Every Assassin is adept at hiding in the shadows. They have dexterous steps and have the ability to release all their strength in one blow\u2026\u201dAfter reading the description, Klein was left completely confused.Assassin\u2026 The advancement from Assassin is Instigator?This advancement is just as odd as how a Seer advances to a class that is good at fighting with artifice\u2026Some Sequence pathways advance in a very ordinary fashion, such as Spectator. Yet, there are Sequence pathways that seem to violate intuition and logic?Well, that might not be completely true. Perhaps I just haven\u2019t discovered some of the hidden common points\u2026For instance, Assassins and Instigators can both bring catastrophe to others\u2026But I can\u2019t figure out the advancement of Seer! Hey! Could it be of the\u00a0Gandalf <sup>1</sup> lineage? After adding some supportive magic, the other attribute points are dumped into strength and techniques?As Klein lampooned in a speechless manner, he silently shook his head. He flipped to the section about the secret organization, the Theosophy Order that involved Instigators.\u201cTheosophy Order. A secret organization that appeared in the Fifth Epoch, which is the early era of the current epoch. They believe that the mind is fundamental to a person, while the physical flesh is a cage that restrains the mind. The reason why humans do evil is a result of the physical body\u2019s influence. One has to use their spirituality to obtain knowledge, allowing the mind to gradually extricate from the body. Then, through the trials of the stars, they will eventually be separated from the material world, returning to the purest and truest self, obtaining eternal redemption.\u201d\u201cTherefore, many extremist members of the Theosophy Order will make destroying the bodies of others their goal, which has led to many bloody massacres\u2026 It is obvious that they possess two Sequence pathways. The first is the more common Apprentice and Trickmaster potions among their members. The other Sequence comprised of Assassin and Instigator rarely appear\u2026 There is currently no evidence that indicates that the Theosophy Order possesses Sequence 7 or higher potions.\u201cIt is unknown how the Theosophy Order established itself. Their possible origins can only be analyzed using the two Sequence pathways. Firstly, the Apprentice and Trickmaster Sequences easily remind people of the Abraham family of the Trickmaster Dynasty in the Fourth Epoch. The Tamara family, tied to the Abraham family through marriage for extended periods of time, cannot be eliminated as well. Secondly, Assassin and Instigator point towards the Demoness Sect.\u201dThe Abraham, Tamara, Antigonus and Zaratul families, the Solomon Empire\u2019s Dark Emperor, the Tudor Dynasty\u2019s Blood Emperor, the Trunsoest Empire, and the Jacob and Amon families that the Hanged Man had mentioned\u2026 There are really lots of secrets buried in the history of the Fourth Epoch. There might be a lot of facts too\u2026 Klein was astounded from what he read. He had a deep appreciation for how the history of the Fourth Epoch was clouded in fog.The outline he could see through the fog left him shuddering involuntarily. It was as though he could imagine a thriving era of Beyonders, an Epoch with blood and strangeness in a concerted dance or horror and distortion in a symphony.Klein drew in a silent gasp and flipped through the book, but did not discover any corresponding descriptions of the Demoness Sect.He looked up and saw Old Neil wrestling with some filter paper with his hand-ground coffee. He asked sincerely, \u201cMr. Neil, what organization is the Demoness Sect? I can\u2019t find any introduction about them in the documents.\u201dOld Neil was in no hurry to respond. After wrestling with his coffee, he chuckled and said, \u201cYour security clearance isn\u2019t high enough. Even with Dunn\u2019s permission, you would not be able to read the relevant information. It can also be said that a lot of the information is only available in the Holy Cathedral and isn\u2019t stored behind Tingen City\u2019s Chanis Gate. Perhaps wait till the day you become a captain of the Nighthawks. You would be sent to the Holy Cathedral for training and would then be able to access them.\u201cI do not understand much about the Demoness Sect. All I know is that they worship the Primordial Demoness. They believe that this secret existence is the true inheritor of the Creator. She was born out of the Chaos and was the earliest to be born from the Creator\u2019s body. She is also the ultimate Ender that ends everything.\u201cTheir Sequence pathways are related to this because to obtain the favor of the Primordial Demoness and to approach this secret existence, the upper echelons are all female. This is also why they are called the Demoness Sect.\u201cAnything else is not something a formal member like me will know. I\u2019ve heard that the demonesses make it their mission to spread catastrophes.\u201dSpread catastrophes\u2026 This does match the hidden commonality of Assassin and Instigator\u2026 But this Mr. Tris\u2019s future seems bleak. The subsequent potions seem to be more suited for females\u2026 Klein\u2019s nodded slightly before he continued reading the information.After he finished reading, he realized that the secret organizations were a lot more than he imagined. But on second thought, he found it very ordinary. After all, this world had so many years of history underlying it. There was once an era when Beyonder powers were extremely active.According to the provided information, Klein categorized the secret organizations into three based on era.First were the ancient organizations born in the Fourth Epoch. They included but were not limited to the Moses Ascetic Order, Secret Order, and the Blood Sanctify Sect which were followers of the Devil. However, the information only mentioned the Demoness Sect.The second was the secret organizations early in the Fifth Epoch, the present Epoch. For instance, the Theosophy Order or the Death-worshiping Numinous Episcopate. There is also the Life School of Thought which employs a master-disciple heritage and the Rose School of Thought known among Beyonders for its bloody sacrifices.The third category were new organizations that appeared in the recent century or two. They include the Aurora Order, the Iron and Blood Cross Order, the Element Dawn, and the Psychology Alchemists, which Klein learned about much earlier.Apart from them, there were other organizations that did not do anything major.\u201cBenson and Melissa must have never imagined that the world is so dangerous\u2026 it\u2019s not only limited to wars\u2026\u201d Klein shook his head with a wry smile. He stacked the classified documents neatly before pushing it to Old Neil.Meanwhile, he added silently in his heart.Please don\u2019t let my Tarot Club be on the list\u2026Old Neil never suspected that a leader of a secret organization was sitting opposite to him. He chuckled and took the documents and headed to Chanis Gate.Klein sat there and wondered if he should divine the location of Instigator Tris. But he abandoned the thought after less than twenty seconds. After all, he only had a vague idea of Tris\u2019s appearance and did not know if the name was genuine. If he could figure out his location with that, he would not be a Seer, but a Prophet!By the time Old Neil returned, Klein had straightened his thought processes and continued his revision of mysticism studies to grasp even more forms of ritualistic magic.He spent the day studying and revising. He did not participate in the joint operation needed for capturing Instigator Tris. He did hear that the delivery of Sealed Artifact 2-049 from Backlund had been delayed due to some reason or another. The actual time of arrival was still pending.As he had earned nearly two soli from yesterday\u2019s divination, Klein spent ten pence to buy a two-liter barrel of Enmat Beer for Benson on the way home. He also bought some lemon cakes fresh out of the oven for Melissa.\u201cKlein, I know you care for us deeply, but there\u2019s no need. There\u2019s no need to keep spending money on such matters,\u201d said Benson after he saw the tiny barrel of beer and deliberating over his words.Melissa stood beside him and nodded slightly.This is probably how our consumerist habits differ\u2026 Klein sighed in amusement.\u201cBenson, Melissa, don\u2019t worry. This was bought with my additional reimbursement. Yeah, I earn an additional two to four soli every week.\u201dI can\u2019t tell them that these are the earnings I got from doing divinations for others, right\u2026 He added inwardly.\u201c\u2026That job of yours is much better than I imagined.\u201d Benson was taken aback as he made an objective assessment.That\u2019s right. I even learned divination from it\u2026 Klein mused silently before turning toward the kitchen.Under the combined efforts of the trio of siblings, a sumptuous dinner was ready for eating.After having their fill, Klein, Benson, and Melissa lay slumped in the living hall. It took them quite a while before they got up to clean up, chat, and study.When Benson and Melissa fall asleep, I\u2019ll head above the gray fog to see the effects of the ritual\u2026 As Klein revised his history textbooks, he shot a glance at his siblings.\u2026West Borough. Iron Cross Street Lower Street.A three-storied apartment was immersed in darkness. There were no street lamps or any additional light.Suddenly, a figure leaped out of a window from the third floor. It landed gently on the ground like a feather without causing so much as a stir.His body crouched and suddenly vanished as though he had blended into the shadows. All that could be seen was the outline of his body.As he traveled quickly, the figure arrived at the harbor. He headed for a corner devoid of anything except for a pile of goods.He seriously observed for a moment, circling the area twice before the leaving the darkness and entering the corner.One could see his round and amiable face. He was Instigator Tris, who had single handedly caused the tragedy of the Alfalfa.\u201cHow does it feel?\u201d A mysterious figure wearing a black hooded robe walked out of the shadows. The hoarse voice obviously belonged to a woman.Tris revealed a friendly and satisfied smile.\u201cFeels great. It was a scene I dreamed and yearned for.\u201cI think I have appropriately completed the mission and have taken the necessary preparations for the advancement.\u201dThe black-robed woman nodded indiscernibly and said, \u201cVery well. According to the promise, I\u2019ll hand you the Sequence 7 formula and the three main ingredients. You will have to gather the rest by yourself.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d Tris answered, seemingly prepared.The mysterious woman raised her hand and handed a book-like object to Tris.The \u201cbook\u201d had an ancient and mottled bronze exterior cover with a strange star-shaped lock on its side.Tris knew that inside the \u201cbook\u201d was the formula and ingredients. He instantly became thrilled.He tried hard to compose himself as he looked curiously at the potion\u2019s name on the bronze outer cover.\u201cWitch!\u201dTris exclaimed. He found it unbelievable that the word written in ancient Hermes was \u201cWitch.\u201dWitch? I\u2019ll advance to become a Witch? What a joke!The mysterious woman covered her mouth and let out a chortle. It took her quite some time before she answered, \u201cWeren\u2019t you always curious? Curious about why our upper echelons are all female\u2026\u201cThat is the answer.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It illuminated Tingen City, the city of universities, as it gradually fell silent.Klein stood in front of his desk and looked through his oriel windows to see the empty Daffodil Street. He heard the sound of carriages quickly galloping far away without causing a din.He picked up his vine-leaf patterned silver pocket watch and snapped it open. He took a glance at it and drew the curtains, making the yellowish lights of the gas lamp reflect back into the bedroom.Klein turned around at an adequate speed, locked his room, and switched off the gas valve.The room was immediately covered in darkness. Only a sliver of red moonlight penetrated the curtains. It gave rise to an atmosphere perfect for many late-night folk tales.Klein took out the silver knife he had applied for. He imagined the spherical light and entered a half-Cogitation state.He focused his mind according to his previous practice, allowing his spirituality to spew out from the tip of his blade. Then, he allowed their motion to miraculously fuse with his surroundings, sealing off the room.He was doing it to prevent any abnormal stirrings that could wake Benson and Melissa.Following that, Klein put down the knife and walked four steps in a counterclockwise manner. Every step was accompanied by the incantation from Earth.The unchanging roars and murmurs inundated him. With the same mania and pain inflicted on him, he did his best to control himself and withstood the most grueling and dangerous stage in his half-conscious state.The grayish-white fog was endless. The dark red stars were at varying distances from him. The towering divine palace stood erect like a dead giant. Nothing seemed to have changed. The silence and antiquity that had accumulated over thousands of years swarmed him.No, there is a change! Klein silently muttered to himself. His gaze locked onto a dark red star near him.That was the star symbolizing Justice!The star\u2019s deep redness began to pulse. It did so with average amplitude, but did not stop.Klein carefully spread out his spirituality towards the deep redness.The moment the two made contact, he felt a hum in his head. He saw a blurry and distorted scene and heard the illusory but stacked voice of prayers.\u201cThe Fool that doesn\u2019t belong to this era;\u201cYou are the mysterious ruler above the gray fog;\u201cYou are the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck;\u201cI pray for your help.\u201cI pray for your loving grace.\u201cI pray for you to give me a good dream.\u2026\u201cI pray for you to give me a good dream.\u2026\u201cI pray for you to give me a good dream.\u201d\u2026The female voice resounded constantly in an intermittent fashion. Klein\u2019s psyche turned more irritable and chaotic. It was akin to listening to someone upstairs pounding on the floor when he had just fallen asleep.He repressed his emotions and used Cogitation to calm the urge. He carefully discerned the blurry scene that appeared before him.It was a girl dressed in white robes. She had a head of beautiful golden hair. She was standing before four flickering flames, her head lowered as she kept chanting.From the distorted image, Klein barely recognized her to be Miss Justice!At this point, he confirmed that the ritual incantation he had created could precisely point towards the gray fog, towards him!This gave him a huge sense of achievement, going from nothing to having something.I won\u2019t praise myself for being awesome\u2026 Klein\u2019s mood turned for the better. He felt that the pleading voice that echoed in his ears like a buzzing fly was now acceptable.With a thought, he attempted to create a response in his mind, transferring it through the intricate connection to the dark red star.\u201cI\u2019m aware.\u201d\u2026The gray layer emanated before him. A distorted and blurry figure stood in the deepest depths.The spot where his eyes ought to be swirled with deep redness as his voice resounded repeatedly in the vast and empty world.\u201cI\u2019m aware.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m aware.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m aware.\u201d\u2026Audrey Hall was jolted awake suddenly. She sat up with her blanket wrapped around her as her mind was fully occupied with the scenes she saw in her dream.She knew very well that she had dreamed of the Fool, the mysterious being that lived above the fog!\u201cIs this a response to my morning prayers?\u201d Audrey, who quickly entered her Spectator state, calmed down and analyzed.Although she did not understand why The Fool did not respond on the spot and only did so at night, she was still shocked that the ritualistic magic was effective with the few lines of incantation.In the past, she had prayed to the Evernight Goddess, but had never received any response!Even if Mr. Fool was not a god, he is likely not far from being one\u2026 Audrey slowly inhaled before slowly exhaling.Since he was a powerful existence that she had no means of resisting, she quickly threw aside her worries. She began considering what to do next.\u201cFirst, I have to completely digest the Spectator potion\u2026 My acting is still pretty good.\u201cSecond, I have to seek out the Psychology Alchemists.\u201cThird, I should try to obtain the Telepathist potion formula from Mr. Fool or clues regarding the Psychology Alchemists elsewhere.\u201cHowever, every godlike existence should have a complete Sequence pathway that belongs to them. They might not know the formulas of other Sequence pathways\u2026 A new Beyonder organization like the Psychology Alchemists might not be able to garner Mr. Fool\u2019s attention\u2026\u201d\u2026With the connection severed, Klein sat at the bronze table\u2019s seat of honor in a rather good mood.He was completely covered in gray fog. He leaned back and clenched his fist to cover his mouth. He recalled and analyzed the process.At that moment, he was the only living being in the world of the gray fog. Apart from that, there was absolute silence.It seems I can only pass information over and am unable to use the powers in here\u2026 From the looks of it, my idea of manipulation would not work. Klein kept prodding his mouth as he silently made a conclusion.He had originally planned on attempting to bind his body with the world of the gray fog in the same manner if the incantation and ritual proved effective. As such, he could then leverage all the power of this mysterious space.If that happened, he could pray to himself, and through such a manipulative manner, he could go around the limitations, the mysteries, and the danger, allowing him to fully use the gray fog world.For example, he could first conduct a ritual and pray to \u201chimself\u201d for spells. Following that, he could come above the gray fog and answer his own request and bestow it.From the looks of it, I was being too idealistic\u2026 My understanding and control of the gray fog world has not reached that level\u2026 Klein shook his head in a self-deprecating manner and planned on leaving.At that moment, he saw the dark red star that represented the Hanged Man begin to pulse. He heard an ethereal and formless voice spread out.\u201cI coincidentally chanced upon The Hanged Man\u2019s ritual?\u201d Klein nodded in thought.He sat at the seat of honor of the long bronze table and extended his hand to tap on the star.His spirituality spread as it touched the pulsing deep redness.He heard The Hanged Man\u2019s heavy and repeated prayers along with a blurry scene.The Hanged Man was draped in a pure-black robe in the scene. He stood in front of four plumes of fire. The surrounding spirituality had formed a wall, isolating him from any external influence.Klein did not immediately respond. All he did was watch and listen silently.\u201c\u2026You are the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck;\u201cI pray for your help.\u201d\u2026After The Hanged Man finished his prayer, he waited for a while. Seeing that there was no response, he began dismantling the spirituality wall, extinguished the candles, and tidied up the altar.Finally, he swiped his extended hand as aqueous light spread out, making the altar table look brand new.Water-based spell\u2026 The bestowment of the Storm\u2026 The Hanged Man is indeed at least a Seafarer\u2026 Klein nodded slightly. Before the scene vanished, he responded via the method he imagined, transmitting it through the blob of dark redness.\u2026Alger Wilson was situated in the Rorsted Archipelago\u2019s City of Generosity.He had not gone with the sailors to the famous Red Cabaret. Instead, he stayed inside the hotel and sealed the door and windows shut to attempt the ritual The Fool had described.After familiarly finishing the prayer, Alger waited patiently for a moment, but did not receive any response.\u201cIt seems this attempt isn\u2019t too successful\u2026 Mr. Fool needs to change methods\u2026\u201d He was both overjoyed, but also a little disappointed.After everything was done, Alger planned on going downstairs for a bottle of Langsky Proof\u2014alcohol that could aid a Folk of Rage to unleash his powers. Mandated Punishers of the Lord of Storms were rather fond of this sort of beverage.Pulling open the door, Alger was about to walk out when his vision blurred. He saw gray fog billow in the corridor and a hazy human figure sitting in the deepest depths of the fog, as if on a high throne.\u201cI\u2019m aware.\u201d The familiar deep voice reverberated around Alger\u2019s ears, causing him to freeze where he stood as his head slightly throbbed in pain.Alger\u2019s eyes suddenly turned dark. He looked around but realized that nothing had changed. There was still the same squeaky floorboard, the same aged wall candle stands, and the same unclean corridor.I\u2019m aware\u2026 The voice was still resounding by Alger\u2019s ears.His expression sank as he hit his chest lightly with his fist but did not say any words of respect to the Lord of Storms.After a long silence, Alger\u2019s expression was restored to normal, but his gaze seemed deeper.\u2026Klein did not spend too much time above the gray fog. When all the remnant voices returned to normal, he enveloped himself in his spirituality and plunged into the gray fog, plummeting into the material world.The lights before him flew by rapidly, like the scenes of a movie played back at a speed tens of times faster than normal. After Klein felt faint, he saw curtains that let crimson moonlight through along with the blurry outlines of the desk and bookshelf.He picked up the silver knife again and removed the spirituality wall in the room. Then, a sudden gust of wind opened the door and went through the corridor.He was completely relieved when he saw that there were no stirrings from Benson\u2019s or Melissa\u2019s room.This luck enhancement ritual is really indispensable for traveling\u2026 It\u2019s concealed and mystical\u2026 Klein silently murmured and closed the door again, walking towards his bed.His mission tomorrow was to head to the underground markets for Beyonder items with Old Neil.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Old Neil, in his usual classic black robe and felt black hat with a rounded edge, ignored the gazes of others and walked diagonally to the Evil Dragon Bar in ahead of them.Even though the bar was slightly far away and the heavy doors were tightly shut, Klein still heard wave after wave of rapturous shouts. They appeared to be cheering on a hero.When he came close, he suddenly sensed something. He turned his head towards the warehouse opposite to the bar. He saw a stocky man dressed in a uniform standing at a hidden corner on the rooftop.The man carried a huge grayish-white mechanical box and held a thick rifle in his hand.The grayish-white mechanical box was obviously connected to the same-colored rifle via piping.\u201cSteam-pressured rifle?\u201d Klein muttered in shock. He looked at Old Neil and said, \u201cThis bar can actually obtain such weapons?\u201dThat was a military-controlled item!Although it used extracted\u00a0phlogiston <sup>1</sup> , the size and weight of the steam backpack were still shocking, something only a true warrior of blood and iron could withstand. The rifle had an extremely high muzzle velocity and shocking destructive power too.Matched with a suitable scope, it was nearly equivalent to an inferior sniper rifle.\u201cWhat?\u201d Old Neil squinted his eyes as he looked over, having a confused look too. \u201cDid something happen here?\u201dSomething happened? Klein surveyed his surroundings and discovered a few more men holding repeating rifles who were searching for something.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Old Neil approached the bar and asked the brawny man guarding its door outside.The brawny man obviously knew Old Neil and smiled wryly.\u201cThe bar was nearly destroyed earlier.\u201cApparently a wanted man was here trying to buy materials and was recognized. And this was what resulted from it. Oh Lord, what did he do, and how dangerous was he to receive such treatment? My legs went limp seeing all those firearms, limper than after spending an entire night with Ginger Sunny!\u201dHe did not know the identity of the wanted man, much less know that the people who came to buy materials had Beyonders mixed in.\u201cWanted man? Do you know his name?\u201d Old Neil asked in interest.\u201cI think it was Tris or something?\u201d the brawny man answered uncertainly.Instigator Tris? Klein nodded in enlightenment, having understood what was happening.Tris did not know that Joyce Meyer had cast his suspicion on him; therefore, he had sauntered right into the market to purchase materials without heed. He was likely recognized by an informant of either the Machinery Hivemind or the Nighthawks, resulting in an intense clash.\u201cWas he caught?\u201d Klein tapped his silver-inlaid black cane.Based on the surrounding situation, likely not\u2026The brawny man shook his head slightly and gestured with his chin to the rooftop of the warehouse opposite him.\u201cHe rushed out before those terrifying guys arrived. Bloody hell, I\u2019ve never seen a man run faster than he did!\u201dYou haven\u2019t seen the true skills of an Assassin, or you might be taken away to some indescribable place for further reeducation\u2026 Klein thought.\u201cIs the market still open?\u201d Old Neil changed subjects and asked.\u201cIt just restored operations,\u201d replied the brawny man affirmatively.\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d Old Neil quickened his pace and extended his right hand, pushing open the heavy door.Klein followed closely in tow and walked in. He nearly fainted at the stuffiness and smell of alcohol that inundated him.In the middle of Evil Dragon Bar was a boxing ring. Two half-naked men were in an intense brawl and surrounding them were dozens of customers shouting and cheering on the side they supported with no lack of vulgarities.Old Neil ignored them and led Klein around the boxing ring and walked into a billiard room at the back.In the billiard room, there were two people holding cue sticks, having a casual conversation. When they saw Old Neil enter, they instantly fell silent for a few seconds.After confirming the visitor\u2019s identity, they moved aside and let Old Neil and Klein pass through the secret door behind them.After passing through a few rooms, the sight before Klein\u2019s eyes opened up. He saw a place that was about the size of a lecture hall from his previous life.Some vendors had set up roadside stalls with bottles and cans all over. Passers-by strolled through them, either scrutinizing their goods, chatting, or comparing prices.\u201cThey have to give five percent of their profits to Swain. Ah, he is the boss of Evil Dragon Bar, former captain of a Mandated Punisher squad and older than I am. He\u2019s someone who wishes to drink himself to his death,\u201d Old Neil explained in a garrulous manner.Klein thought and gave an honest evaluation.\u201cA rather profitable business.\u201dAfter all, his only expense was providing the venue and protection.\u201cIf any item catches your fancy but you lack the money, you can borrow from Swain. But of course, he charges a very high interest\u2026\u201d Old Neil trailed off as he gnashed his teeth.As expected, it\u2019s like running a casino, they would provide usuries\u2026 Klein held his walking stick and looked around as he asked curiously, \u201cMr. Swain is a Seafarer?\u201dThe captain of a Mandated Punisher squad was likely a Sequence 7.\u201cNo, he is only a Folk of Rage. Tingen is not a coastal city, so the Church of the Goddess is much more powerful than Lord of Storms here.\u201d Old Neil scoffed. \u201cActually, Swain had the chance of becoming a Seafarer, but was afraid that he would lose control so he chose to give up.\u201dJust as Klein was about to ask if the boss of the bar had any experience of nearly losing control, he suddenly felt a strange phenomenon happen on his left.There appeared to be something hidden there, muttering and recounting.Klein turned his head and saw a pale young man. He was wearing an old linen shirt and blue jeans that the working class normally wore. His eyes looked demoralized with a hint of craziness, and he was constantly mumbling.\u201cHis spiritual perception is very high\u2026 or perhaps, distorted?\u201d Klein creased his eyebrows and muttered.It was the young man\u2019s spiritual perception that triggered his own spiritual perception!Generally speaking, spiritual perception sensing something causes some interaction. It was nearly impossible to conceal it from others, but \u201cothers\u201d referred to Spirit Mediums who had cast their abilities, as well as powerful figures with similar special traits. A Beyonder like Klein would actually find it hard to detect, only detecting if one\u2019s spiritual perception reached a certain heightened level, or an abnormal distortion happened.They made eye contact and the pale young man with messy black hair walked towards him with an expression looking as though he was half-sleepwalking and half-insane.He stopped before Klein and stared at him.Suddenly, he guffawed.\u201cHaha, it\u2019s the smell of death, death\u2026 Ah!\u201dBefore he was done talking, he suddenly screamed tragically. His eyes shut tightly as liquid with the color of blood flowed out.\u201cAh! Darn it!\u201d The young man covered his eyes and hugged his head. He struggled on the ground and only calmed down after a while. He then lay there panting.During the entire process, not a single customer or stall vendor looked over.Klein pressed down his halved top hat and looked at Old Neil. Klein\u2019s mouth was hanging open in shock, using his actions to demonstrate his shock and to request for advice.\u201cDon\u2019t mind him. He\u2019s Ademisaul, an orphan, nicknamed \u2018monster.\u2019 He was born with high spiritual perception, and he has always been able to see things that he shouldn\u2019t, hear voices that he shouldn\u2019t. Hence, he is always raving and often getting hurt.\u201d Old Neil shook his head as he explained.He could tell that my body was once dead? Klein knitted his eyebrows and lowered his voice as he asked in doubt, \u201cHaven\u2019t the Nighthawks, Mandated Punishers, or the Machinery Hivemind ever thought of taking him in?\u201d\u201cNo, we do not have the Sequence potion that suits him,\u201d said Old Neil with a sigh.Right, he was born with the starting point of half a Sequence\u2026 Klein asked again curiously,\u201cWhat Sequence pathway suits him?\u201d\u201cThe Sequence 9 that suits him is called \u2018Monster.\u2019 His nickname came from there. It\u2019s a pity that only the Life School of Thought has control over the Sequence pathway\u2019s beginning,\u201d Old Neil replied softly.He tried to keep the conversation between him and Klein from the people around them to avoid leaking information to mysticism aficionados.Life School of Thought? Klein recalled the information he had previously read.The secret organization appeared in the beginning of the current epoch. Its actual origins were unknown, but it was mainly passed down via master and disciple.Their theories and beliefs were hardly known. Klein only knew that they separated the world into three layers: the definite rational world, also known as the absolute truth world, the spirits\u2019 world, and the material world.Rumor had it that the secret organization had once produced a Soothsayer\u2026 Wasn\u2019t that a Sequence pathway that corresponded to Seer? Confusing, really confusing\u2026 Klein shook his head and saw Ademisaul struggle to get up and then wander off to another corner.He reorganized his thoughts and followed behind Old Neil. They walked past one stall after another. There were plants like moon flower, fingered citron, night vanilla, and mineral resources like silver, topaz, ruby and so on.\u201cIt\u2019s really very well equipped\u2026\u201d Klein muttered softly.The mysticism aficionados of all ages and genders around him would be stopping, distinguishing, or talking at times. It gave the area a bustling vibe.\u201cWalk around on your own. I am going to settle my bill.\u201d Old Neil pointed at one of the two rooms at the end.\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein nodded without thought.He strolled with his black cane and came before a stall which sold self-made amulets. He took a careful look at it for a while.Just when Klein prepared to speak with the seller, he suddenly heard someone asking the stall behind him, \u201cIs this powder ground from cow teeth paeonol?\u201dCow teeth paeonol? Isn\u2019t that one of the supplementary ingredients of the Spectator potion? Klein thought, then turned around to look at the inquirer.Justice had repeated the formula for the potion several times, so Klein had been left with a remarkably clear impression of the ingredients.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 - Protection AmuletPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 69: Protection AmuletTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosKlein looked over and saw the person inquiring about the cow teeth paeonol.The man was less than a meter away from him. He was wearing a black suit and a halved top hat of the same color. He had a cane adorned with silver in his hand and a pair of gold-framed spectacles on his face. He had a refined bearing.\u201cYes, do you need it? This can here costs three soli.\u201d The owner of the stall was wearing a long black robe, one filled mysticism traits.The inquirer whose sideburns were pale yellow thought for a moment before saying, \u201cCan it be cheaper? I still need to buy other ingredients too. For example, this bottle of white-edged sunflower petals.\u201dThe stall owner considered for a few seconds before grudgingly replying, \u201cTwo soli and six pence. I don\u2019t think you can find a price cheaper than that.\u201dKlein immediately felt that he was overthinking things after seeing how the bespectacled man was buying ingredients other than the cow teeth paeonol.However, he still tapped his glabella twice as an act of caution. He swept the man with his Spirit Vision.No problems. He looks very healthy. His emotions are alright too. Mister, you need to keep this up\u2026 Klein retracted his gaze, turned around, and looked at the stall selling homemade amulets once again.The amulets were placed neatly before him. Some of them were made of pure silver, some with steel, others forged from gold.But only a few of the amulets had a weak aura emanating from them, some crimson, some pale white, some golden.This meant that some of them had weak traces of spirituality and were definitely effective to a certain extent!Klein looked at the amulets carefully and confirmed that the stall owner making the amulets had some foundation in mysticism.The stall owner did not make any mistakes matching the different energy sources to the different incantations. He was also extremely accurate at choosing the materials that corresponded to the different energy sources.Of course, a mere mysticism aficionado would definitely make some mistakes. Klein noticed that the stall owner did not fully understand the incantations. One could not create an incantation simply by translating the content of the prayer into Hermes. The incantations had to follow a certain format that followed unique rules.The other problem was that the stall owner had made mistakes of varying degrees when he was choosing a suitable symbol for the energy sources. That explained why there were only two or three amulets releasing the faint light out of the dozens that were laid before him.As for how much of an effect the two to three amulets would have, Klein could only say that it was better than nothing.An amulet that was truly equipped with obvious effects needed the craftsman to release his spirituality from a blade while carving the incantations and symbols!If one wanted even better results, they would have to supplement it with ritualistic magic.And these two things were not something an ordinary person could achieve.Klein tapped his glabella twice, then pointed at the upper left corner of the stall with his black cane.\u201cHow much for these two?\u201dHe did not ask about the amulets that had a rudimentary colored aura, but half-completed items. Other than external shape, they had not been carved with incantations or symbols.To Klein, there was no reason to purchase the amulets that had weak effects. What he wanted to do was to transform the half-completed amulets into true amulets.Hmm, I\u2019ll make amulets that can protect a person from danger, one each for Benson and Melissa. As for my own, I can ask the Nighthawks to supply me with the ingredients\u2026 Man, I must have been influenced by Old Neil. I don\u2019t feel any guilt when doing something like that\u2026 Klein\u2019s mind wandered as he watched the stall owner pick up the half-completed silver amulets.The first silver amulet was elongated and had a cavity in the middle. Around it were patterns of angel-like feathers. The craftsmanship was intricate and was very beautiful. The other was simple, almost completely devoid of any additional decorations or carvings. It had a vertical line representing the night, and a circle representing the crimson moon.Klein, who paid much attention to appearances, took a liking to them immediately.\u201cThis is six soli,\u201d the middle-aged stall owner said, pointing to the intricate amulet. He was a man of few words.After pausing for a while, he rubbed the simpler piece and said, \u201cThis is five soli three pence.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too expensive. They are still far from being an amulet.\u201d Klein had slowly been influenced by Benson and Melissa, so he had begun cultivating the habit of haggling.After a battle of words, he bought the two silver accessories at five soli six pence and four soli nine pence respectively.Yeah, they can only be considered silver accessories for the time being\u2026 Klein had that in mind.The ten soli three pence was deducted from the reimbursement he received for his Divination Club membership.Klein received the two silver accessories and placed them into his pocket. He was about to head to another stall when he heard a gentle voice.\u201cSir, why are you not buying a completed amulet?\u201dKlein turned his head over and found a teenage girl asking him the question. She was about fifteen years of age and wore a lacy yellow dress while holding onto a veiled hat with a ribbon.\u201cIt\u2019s because I intend to make my own amulets. As you know, that is the wish of every aficionado of mysticism,\u201d Klein minced his words and answered.He did not wish to make the stall owner think that he was trying to snatch his business, even though he had considered using his 'skill\u201d to earn a quick buck.The teenage girl had naturally curly brown hair, and her face was adorable due to her baby fat. She looked at Klein with her light blue eyes and asked sincerely, \u201cCan I seek your advice on choosing an amulet? Well, I was introduced here by a friend. I\u2019ve been here several times and have a deep interest in mysticism. But I still do not know too much about it, and she, my friend, is going to turn sixteen soon. I wish to select an amulet as a gift to her. I didn\u2019t bring her along as I want it to be a surprise\u2026 I had previously sought her advice, but I cannot remember a lot of the critical points.\u201dKlein gave a gentlemanly smile.\u201cWhat kind of protection amulets are you looking for? Something to avert disasters? Something to avoid illnesses? Something that gives fortune? Different requirements would require different energy sources which means that they must point to different gods. Different gods would have different corresponding constellations, and the different constellations would mean that different materials have to be used.\u201cFor example, the incantation for averting disasters would belong to the Empress of Disaster and Horror, who is the Evernight Goddess. As mysticism aficionados, we all know that the symbol of the Evernight Goddess is the moon. The corresponding metal would thus be pure silver.\u201cTherefore, if we hope to avert disasters, it is best that we choose an amulet that is made of pure silver and has the corresponding incantations.\u201dWe would also have to make sure that the incantations are of the correct language and format. The corresponding symbol of the Empress of Disaster and Horror means the Path Number, the spell\u2019s characteristic, and the relative positions of the symbols, etc, must also be correct\u2026 But this is too complicated, and there\u2019s no need for me to explain this for you\u2026 Klein added inwardly.The girl\u2019s eyes sparkled. She asked with a little doubt, \u201cCan a follower of the Goddess wear an amulet belonging to another god?\u201d\u201cNo problem. The gods do not mind such small matters,\u201d Klein consoled her.It was not a problem for the person wearing the amulet, but the person creating the amulet had to be careful. If a believer of the Lord of Storms were to craft an amulet of the Eternal Blazing Sun, they would most likely receive something malicious.Of course, these referred to amulets requiring the aid of ritualistic magic. The craftsman need not pay much attention to this otherwise.The teenage girl heaved a sigh of relief.\u201cI hope to get her an amulet for good health; which deity should I choose from? The Eternal Blazing Sun, Mother Earth, or the God of Knowledge and Wisdom?\u201d\u201cThere should be no problem with the Eternal Blazing Sun and Mother Earth. The former is represented by the sun while the latter is represented by the Brown Star.\u201d Klein smiled as he said, \u201cThe material of the sun is gold, while the metal that symbolizes the Brown Star is lead. I would suggest the sun, but I do not know if you brought enough money along with you.\u201dThe reason for his suggestion was because he had noticed that among the three amulets with a rudimentary spiritual glow, one of them was a health amulet that came under the domain of the sun.\u201cIsn\u2019t this\u2026\u201d Before the teenage girl finished her sentence, she stopped and warily looked at the stall owner who was waiting silently.She thought for a moment before asking, \u201cAfter I decide on the material, how should I distinguish the incantation and corresponding symbols?\u201d\u201cDo you know Hermes?\u201d Klein asked instead.\u201cI just started learning it,\u201d the teenage girl replied, a little embarrassed.\u201cThen let me choose it for you.\u201d Klein pointed at the health amulet made of gold and said, \u201cThis one has no problems, be it in the incantations or the representing symbol.\u201dThe teenage girl lifted the edges of her dress and squatted in front of the amulet. She picked up the health amulet with designs of the sun\u2019s rays around its edges. She felt as though the amulet was nourishing her, making her feel completely relaxed.\u201cThank you, thank you.\u201d She stood up and curtsied in gratitude.Klein laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019ll leave the rest to you and the stall owner. I have other things to tend to.\u201dHe looked at the stall owner as he spoke and noticed that the man had a weird look in his eyes, as if deciding if he had to give a cut of the profit to Klein.With a smile, Klein did not bother with the matter anymore. He continued touring the underground market, but he didn\u2019t notice any true extraordinary materials.At this point, Old Neil had already paid off his debt. He was holding a dark colored wooden box in his hands.He pointed to the other room behind and said after he noticed Klein\u2019s look of doubt, \u201cGo there if you wish to buy or sell extraordinary materials. After all, no one wishes to let others know what extraordinary items they are purchasing.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Klein nodded as though in thought.There was no need for him to go there for the time being. He headed toward the exit of the underground market together with Old Neil.\u201cHow much for these elf flowers?\u201dA query suddenly entered Klein\u2019s ears.Elf flowers\u2026 That\u2019s also an ingredient for the Spectator potion\u2026 Klein thought as he glanced sideways. He once again saw the refined bespectacled man.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Old Neil asked curiously.\u201cNothing much.\u201d Klein retracted his gaze.Although he was a quasi-member of the Nighthawks, he did not feel that all Beyonders had to be absorbed by the Churches or locked up. He believed that it had to depend on the situation. Spectators definitely posed little danger to society or the kingdom, and the chances of losing control as a Sequence 9 were very slim.\u2026After leaving Evil Dragon Bar, Klein and Old Neil took a public carriage and left the harbor. They then split ways at the North Borough and headed back to their respective homes.The public transport steered into Daffodil Street and stopped by the side of the road. Klein was about to get off the carriage when he suddenly saw a young lady wearing a grayish-white dress about to board the carriage.This lady had smooth black hair, her face a little round. She had thin eyes and unassuming features. But paired together, she gave off the feeling that she was sweet and gentle.Klein noticed her not because of her beauty, but because he discovered that her body was shuddering slightly. It was an unnatural shudder.\u201cMiss, are you alright?\u201d Klein asked in concern.The young lady shook her head abruptly.\u201cNo, I-I am just too tired.\u201dThe people behind Klein were urging for him to get off, so Klein could only leave the carriage.When he found his footing, he paid attention to the situation from before again. He pinched his glabella twice, planning to determine if the lady was indeed alright.He had the intention of sending her to the hospital if she had a serious illness that was going to act up soon.Activating his Spirit Vision, the colors of the auras started to surface. Klein turned around and prepared to look at the sweet and gentle young lady.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70 - 2-049's ArrivalPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 70: 2-049\u2019s ArrivalTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosClip-clop, clip-clop.The horses widened their paces as the wheels began rolling in tow. Despite activating his Spirit Vision and turning around, hoping to observe the refined and sweet lady, Klein did not have his wishes fulfilled. All his eyes reflected were brown figures moving past him.Meanwhile, the passengers from the stop had already boarded the carriage. The carriage door was closed tightly as it gradually departed.Within the carriage, twenty to thirty people stood closely to each other, their energy fields overlapping and shielding each other. Hence, it was an explosion of colors in Klein\u2019s vision, making it difficult for him to differentiate.He shook his head quietly and raised his finger to tap his glabella to deactivate his Spirit Vision.To him, it was simply help he could provide if he happened to chance upon it. However, if he were to miss it, and the situation was not especially clear, there was no point taking it to heart and delaying his own matters.While bathing in the crimson moonlight, Klein strolled back home on the still bustling Daffodil Street. He returned to see Melissa sitting beside the dining table. She was busy doing her homework under a bright gas lamp.She bit at the fountain pen and frowned, appearing deep in thought.\u201cWhere\u2019s Benson?\u201d Klein asked casually.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Melissa looked up. She blanked out for a few seconds before saying, \u201cHe said he went around a few boroughs today and was covered in sweat. He\u2019s taking a nice relaxing bath.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein chuckled. Suddenly, he realized that she was wearing a dress he had never seen before.It was entirely beige in color. It had fashionable engageantes. The collar and edges of her top had thin frills. Apart from that, it was a rather simple design, the type one wore as daily casual clothing. It fully accentuated the youth of a sixteen or seventeen-year-old.\u201cNew dress?\u201d Klein asked with a smile.It was a purchase that he and Benson had insisted upon.Melissa answered in the affirmative tersely.\u201cI just took it back from Mrs. Rochelle. I was thinking that since I had to wash it later, I might as well try it on first.\u201dKlein was rather puzzled when he heard that.\u201cMrs. Rochelle?\u201dWasn\u2019t she our former neighbor?Melissa nodded and explained in all seriousness, \u201cMrs. Rochelle is actually a seamstress, but she was quite unlucky. She had no choice but to sew and mend clothes for others at home. She leads a pretty tough life. I knew that she had pretty good skill and the price she quoted is cheaper than at a women\u2019s clothing store. Furthermore, it\u2019s very well-tailored to my figure, so I ordered a new skirt from her. It only cost nine soli and five pence and took only a few days. A dress of a similar style would cost three halves of a pound at Harrods Department Store!\u201dWhat a frugal girl\u2026 Sis, I know that at least half the reason is due to your pity of Mrs. Rochelle\u2026 Klein did not reproach Melissa for deciding things for herself. Instead, he said with a smile, \u201cWhen did you go to Harrods?\u201dThat was at Howes Street, near the Divination Club. It was somewhere where the middle-class shopped.\u201c\u2026\u201d Melissa was momentarily at a loss for words. It took her a long while before she said, \u201cIt was Selena and Elizabeth. They insisted I accompany them. Actually, well\u2014I actually prefer gears more. I like places with steam and machinery. Yeah.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s quite, well\u2014nice for a girl to occasionally shop at a department store.\u201d Klein laughed as he comforted his sister.After some idle talk, he briskly walked to the second floor, hoping to wash away the repulsive mixed smells from the bar.Just as he was about to return to his bedroom to get a change of clothes, he suddenly heard sounds coming from the bathroom close to the balcony.A few seconds later, Benson stepped out while drying his gradually receding hairline.\u201cHow was it? Did you compliment Melissa\u2019s new dress?\u201d He shot a glance at Klein and asked with a smile.\u201cI guess I forgot. All I did was ask where it was done\u2026\u201d Klein thought for a moment as he said.Benson immediately chortled and shook his head.\u201cHow unbecoming of an elder brother. When Melissa received the dress, she couldn\u2019t bear putting it down. After rushing to cook and wash the dishes, she immediately wore the dress and has refused to take it off ever since.\u201d\u2026Wasn\u2019t she planning on changing after showering? She can wash and starch the clothes while doing so\u2026 Klein subconsciously refuted with the explanation that Melissa had given.\u201cTsk.\u201d Benson sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s been scorching the past few days. She was busy in the kitchen for a long time, so I believe she would feel much better doing her homework after a shower.\u201dThat\u2019s right\u2026 Klein was suddenly enlightened as he gave his brother a knowing smile.So that\u2019s what kind of person you are, Melissa\u2026 There\u2019s nothing wrong with a girl caring for her appearance. There\u2019s no need to find excuses\u2026 The corners of his mouth curved up as he shook his head gently before walking into his bedroom.While he was showering, Klein faintly heard knocking downstairs. He immediately wondered.Doesn\u2019t the worker who\u2019s in charge of collecting coins for the gas meter come only once every two weeks?Could it be Mrs. Shaud from next door? That can\u2019t be. It\u2019s said that this lady strictly abides by the etiquette of middle-class society. She would not visit at an inappropriate time.In his puzzlement, Klein wiped dry his body. Wearing old but comfortable shirt and trousers, he came down the stairs.He surveyed the area but did not notice any strangers. He asked, \u201cWas someone at the door just now?\u201dBenson, who was reading the newspapers casually, said with a smile, \u201cIt was Bitsch Mountbatten, one of the policemen in charge of Iron Cross Street. He asked if we met an eighteen or nineteen-year-old boy who has a rotund face. Heh, he even gave us a sketch to identify. Unfortunately, neither one of us have seen him, or we would have received a reward. What about you?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d Klein had a general idea what was happening.Instigator Tris had successfully escaped the Evil Dragon Bar at the harbor. He had escaped somewhere close to Iron Cross Street and Daffodil Street; therefore, the police were making visits from door to door.And to go this far made it clear that the operation of nabbing the Instigator had completely failed!Klein did not bother himself with the situation. He had yet to begin combat training. He only had basic mastery of shooting, so to consider dealing with a natural \u2018Assassin\u2019 was simply using his life as a joke.He did not sleep well that night. He kept worrying that the Instigator would infiltrate their house to hide, causing another massacre.Thankfully, Daffodil Street was quiet the entire night, with the morning sun rays dispersing all the fog.The relaxed Klein changed into formal attire, wore his top hat, held his cane, and went all the way to Zouteland Street. He greeted Rozanne at the reception hall.\u201cGood morning, Klein,\u201d replied Rozanne happily. She suppressed her voice and said, \u201cI heard the huge operation last night failed?\u201d\u201cThe operation to nab Instigator Tris?\u201d Klein asked in curiosity.\u201cYeah!\u201d Rozanne nodded heavily. She shot a glance at the partition and said, \u201cApparently an informant of the Mandated Punishers discovered the Instigator at the harbor\u2026 They were planning on waiting for additional Beyonders and another Special Operations squad from the police to arrive before beginning the operation to do the deed instantly without alarming the commoners. Unfortunately, that Instigator was extremely sharp. He charged out of the encirclement when he noticed something amiss, successfully escaping as a result.\u201d\u201cAt such times, they need a Beyonder with tracking abilities, such as me.\u201d Klein made a joke.\u201cThere was no lack of trackers back then.\u201d Dunn Smith\u2019s voice suddenly sounded.Rozanne turned her head abruptly and saw the captain wearing his black windbreaker. He was glaring right at her with his deep pair of gray eyes while leaning against the partition\u2019s frame.She hurriedly raised her hands to cover her mouth. Then, she shook her head incessantly, expressing her futile innocence.Dunn turned his gaze to Klein and after some thought, he said, \u201cThere were a total of six Beyonders from the Mandated Punishers, the Machinery Hivemind, and us Nighthawks. We traced the injured Tris to Iron Cross Street\u2019s Lower Street. We found his temporary residence, but the clues ended there. Be it Beyonder methods or ordinary investigations, nothing worked. It was as though he evaporated into thin air, disappearing completely.\u201d\u201cDo you need my help with divination?\u201d Klein asked probingly.Dunn shook his head gently.\u201cThe Machinery Hivemind had a Machinery Hivemind. He is a senior Beyonder as good as Old Neil. I even suspect that he\u2019s already at Sequence 8. I\u2019m just unaware what the name of the corresponding potion is.\u201d\u201cThe Theosophy Order\u2019s heritage to this day must have something special about it,\u201d consoled Klein.For the rest of the morning, he continued his mysticism curriculum, read the historical information and documents, and practiced various techniques just like always.With lunchtime almost approaching, Klein\u2019s mind began to wander.Another few minutes later, he put away the documents, having heard the summoning of his stomach.At that moment, Dunn Smith came into the clerk office. He said in a deep but mild manner, \u201cKlein, follow me to Chanis Gate. Sealed Artifact 2-049 has arrived. The subsequent operation might require your sensing of that notebook.\u201d\u201c\u2026Alright,\u201d Klein got up and replied.His thoughts became scrambled. He imagined how the sealed item would look or if the operation would be dangerous.While in this rather tense silence, he followed Dunn down the stairs and into the tunnel.After going straight at the intersection, Dunn suddenly stopped and turned his head, saying sternly, \u201cDo this action together with me. Keep doing it and absolutely do not stop. Remember, absolutely do not stop. This is for your own safety!\u201dWhile speaking, Dunn bent his arm followed by extending it. He repeated this action without stopping.Klein looked at the captain demonstrate in a befuddled manner. Suddenly enlightened, he asked, \u201cHas this got to do with the uniqueness of the Sealed Artifact?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Dunn nodded with abnormal seriousness. \u201cRepeating such an action will allow us to discover if anything happens to you immediately. Saving you in time will not result in any life-threatening dangers.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Klein did not hesitate further as he began the repeated action of bending and extending his arm.\u201cIf your arm is sore, use the other one,\u201d added Dunn.Sealed Artifact \u201c2-049\u201d sure is odd\u2026 What meaning does this action have? It seems very dangerous\u2026 These thoughts flashed past Klein\u2019s mind as he looked solemnly at the captain.\u201cAlright.\u201dHe had too many questions on his mind, but since Chanis Gate was in sight, he had no choice but to bear with it.Besides, with my security clearance, I\u2019ll probably not learn of the details. I can only do as I\u2019m ordered\u2026 Klein exhaled as he followed Captain Dunn to the Keeper room outside Chanis Gate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 - Sluggish PhenomenonPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 71: Sluggish PhenomenonTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosKlein repeatedly bent and extended his arm as he watched Dunn push open the Keeper\u2019s room with his body sideways.The captain\u2019s carefulness and high alertness, as well as the ridiculous and laughable \u201cprotective actions,\u201d left him feeling abnormally tensed. The feeling was identical to what he felt when taking tests of courage that required him to walk through spooky cemeteries at night in his youth.A Grade 2 Sealed Artifact. Dangerous. To be used with care and moderation\u2026 It is something even a formal Nighthawk member does not know the details to\u2026 It is unknown how dangerous it is\u2026 Amid his tense nerves, Klein found it impossible to curb himself from overthinking.At that moment, his brain suddenly turned numb as though a power switch had been flicked off.Everything in Klein\u2019s vision turned slow. Even his arm actions shared the same fate.He saw Captain Dunn stop in his tracks. He came close to him as though in slow motion, extending his palm out slowly before pushing him in the shoulder.Suddenly, Klein\u2019s thought processes and vision were restored to normal at the same time. It was as though everything from before was just an illusion.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he whispered amid his fright and confusion.Dunn shook his head and said in a deep voice, \u201cObserve carefully.\u201dThe moment he finished his sentence, he turned around and walked into the Keeper\u2019s room. Klein followed closely behind and saw four other people in the room; they were either seated or standing.One of them was the Midnight Poet, Leonard. The other three were people Klein had never met before. However, all of them shared a common trait. They were all doing the extending and bending arm \u201cexercise\u201d with utmost seriousness.\u201cKlein Moretti has a miraculous connection with the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook.\u201d Dunn gave a brief introduction.Then, he pointed to the other three strangers and said, \u201cThese lady and gentlemen are colleagues from the Backlund diocese. They escorted Sealed Artifact 2-049 here. This is Madam Lorotta, Sequence 8 Gravedigger. She is a master sharpshooter.\u201dAt that moment, the black-haired woman who looked about thirty nodded at Klein in a friendly manner.She looked pretty good. She did not wear a hat and was dressed in what appeared like male attire\u2014a black coat with a white shirt, tight black trousers and black leather boots. The corners of her mouth were slightly curved up.After Klein exchanged greetings, Dunn pointed to a man seated behind the desk.\u201cAiur Harson, someone just like me.\u201dBefore he finished his sentence, Klein saw Mr. Aiur Harson in his gray windbreaker turn sluggish with his arm motion. It was as though a gear had lost its lubricant or a joint covered in rust.What\u2019s wrong\u2026 Amid Klein\u2019s daze, he saw Lorotta push Aiur Harson. Only then did the gentleman\u2019s actions return to normal.Was I like that previously? Klein was first taken aback before he came to the realization.This indicated the dangers that Sealed Artifact 02-49 held!What would happen if one was not awoken in time?Would one become a zombie?Filled with questions, Klein greeted the charming middle-aged Aiur Harson.\u201cBorgia,\u201d Dunn said as he pointed to the last Nighthawk.Borgia was a cold man with a knife scar on the side of his face. His sharp brown eyes were like an eagle\u2019s. He was constantly observing everyone in the room.\u201cLet\u2019s set off. The faster we end this, the faster we can seal 2-049,\u201d the handsome Aiur Harson said as he stood, his eyes revealing some wrinkles.So, where is 2-049? Klein surveyed his surroundings curiously but did not notice any traces of the Sealed Artifact. Of course, he could not see the areas obscured by the table without activating his Spirit Vision.\u201cAlright,\u201d Dunn turned and looked at Leonard Mitchell. \u201cYou\u2019ll be in charge of driving. It is best not to involve Cesare with matters like this.\u201dCesare was the clerk in charge of procuring and collecting supplies for the Tingen Nighthawks while standing in as a carriage driver. He was the one who drove Klein to Welch\u2019s home to meet the Spirit Medium Daly.\u201cNo problem.\u201d Leonard stopped acting frivolous and nodded seriously.At that moment, Klein saw Aiur Harson bending over. He picked up a black metal chest which had been obscured by the table.The chest was carved with resplendent stars and the crimson full moon. It was as though there was a formless barrier around the chest.The Sealed Artifact should be inside there? I wonder what 2-049 looks like\u2026 Klein observed the chest curiously.Thump!Thump! Thump!Violent knocking sounds suddenly erupted from the black chest. Even the surface of the chest bulged time and time again.Thump! Thump! Thump!It was as though something horrifying had awakened within the chest and was pounding wildly. The sound of the knocking was beaten into the hearts of everyone present.It\u2019s alive? Just as Klein had a thought, he saw Captain Dunn\u2019s arm exercises turning sluggish, as if his joints were layered with glue.Borgia, the Nighthawk from Backlund, pushed Dunn\u2019s shoulder, allowing him to recover.It\u2019s like doing the robot dance when one is affected by 2-049\u2026 If all of us are under its influence, wouldn\u2019t we be some awkward dance squad\u2026 Luckily, 2-049 seems capable of only influencing one person at a time\u2026 Klein lampooned to relax his tense nerves. He did not dare halt his arm exercises.He followed Dunn\u2019s lead and left his cane behind. He then followed behind the five Nighthawks through the tunnel and up the stairs to the second floor of the Blackthorn Security Company.Leonard had gone ahead and notified everyone in the front of the buildings, so Rozanne and the rest had all made their way to the third level. These incidents rarely involved them, but they were not completely alien to them. Another Nighthawk, Kenley, had replaced Dunn in his watch over Chanis Gate.Klein heaved a sigh of relief when he reached the carriage. He looked suspiciously out the window and said, \u201cWon\u2019t 2-049 affect the ordinary people on the streets?\u201dFrom their journey underground to the carriage, Sealed Artifact 2-049 had already caused six sluggish incidents, two of which were targeted at him. He had been jolted awake by Captain Dunn and Leonard Mitchell respectively. The rate of the sluggish effect was rather alarming!\u201cNo worries, 2-049 will target humanoid creatures within five meters of it first. The closer you are to it, the easier it is for you to be chosen. As long as there are three people surrounding it, people who happen to be around when the carriage steers past will not be affected,\u201d the beautiful, black-haired lady Lorotta explained with a lazy tone.What a weird Sealed Artifact\u2026 Klein thought as he continued his arm exercises.Dunn and the rest of the Nighthawks did not speak on the journey to Ray Bieber\u2019s house. They were paying close attention to each other\u2019s condition. Only Lorotta wore a nonchalant look. At times, she took in the sights of Tingen\u2019s not-so-clean streets, and at other times, she praised Backlund\u2019s underground water system.Soon after, the familiar building finally entered Klein\u2019s line of sight. The group of six made their way to the third level while observing each other.The door to Ray Bieber\u2019s house was labeled with the Tingen Police Department\u2019s symbol, indicating that entry was forbidden to unauthorized personnel.As Dunn did his stretching exercises, he took out a key. He opened the newly changed lock, then turned around, allowing Aiur Harson who was carrying the black chest to enter first.Thump!Thump! Thump! Thump!The Sealed Artifact in the black chest knocked violently once again, even more violent than before. This made Aiur Harson\u2019s arm waver from side to side uncontrollably. It even made Klein suspect that the chest would be pounded open in time.Thump! Thump! Thump!Klein quickly noticed that Captain Dunn\u2019s movements were becoming sluggish. He was about to wake him up when a buzz sounded in his brain. His brain became numb, the scenes before his eyes played as though they were in slow motion.Didn\u2019t they say that\u2026 that it only affects one\u2026 person at a time\u2026 Klein\u2019s thoughts quickly became sluggish.At this moment, the prepared Lorotta and Borgia woke each of them up respectively by pushing them.Having his thought processes and vision restored, Klein looked around with lingering fear. He nearly blurted out.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that 2-049 can only affect one person at a time?\u201dThankfully, I did not stop my stretches!\u201cWhen Sealed Artifact 2-049 enters its berserk mode, it can affect up to two people at once. We can confirm that Ray Bieber is indeed a descendant of the Antigonus family,\u201d Aiur Harson said with a mechanical tone.Lorota let out a faint laugh. She looked at Klein and said, \u201c2-049 becomes very agitated when it meets a descendant of the Antigonus family, even if only their scent remains. Its abilities would also increase considerably. I believe you would be able to understand its feelings.\u201dWell, I don\u2019t\u2026 Klein asked curiously, \u201cSo, is it a living creature?\u201dLorotta smiled but did not reply him directly.\u201cYou\u2019ll know in a while. As long as Ray Bieber hasn\u2019t escaped Tingen, 2-049 will lead us to him.\u201dKlein could only put his other questions on hold as he walked around the room with the Nighthawks.Amid the loud and violent thumping from the chest, they locked the door, walked down the stairs, and returned to the carriage.Aiur Harson looked out the window several times and confirmed that there were no pedestrians within a five-meter radius of them. He then placed the black chest on the ground and twisted the mechanical switch to release its spiritual restraints.The violent thumping stopped suddenly, slipping the entire carriage into silence. Not even the breaths of the Nighthawks could be heard.Klein held his breath as the black chest opened slowly. A sharp creak that hurt his ears could be heard.Creak!The chest fell as a slender brown arm extended out of the chest. It was about the length of a child\u2019s finger.Two arms pressed forward one after another as an object about the size a normal human being\u2019s palm appeared bit by bit in front of Klein and company.It had clear elbow, finger, and knee joints. Covered in an oil-stained brown cloth, its face was painted with the colors of a clown\u2014red and yellow.It was a wooden puppet with a weird appearance!2-049 lifted its head and looked at Klein with its pure black eyes.Its rigid mouth slowly parted to reveal a clown-like smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The corners of its mouth were upturned high, revealing an abnormally comical smile.Its lips parted to reveal a dark and deep mouth. Klein, who had locked his gaze with it, felt his hair stand as intense horror leaped out of his heart in an uncontrollable manner.Everything before his eyes grew dull, as though he was looking at the world through a piece of thick brown glass.Klein\u2019s thoughts slowed down gradually, and he instinctively wanted to ask for help, but his neck seemed to be held tight by a rope. He couldn\u2019t make a single sound, and the single word was trapped in silence.Just then, Dunn noticed his arm exercises becoming sluggish and pushed him heavily.The brown glass before Klein\u2019s eyes shattered in an instant. He blurted out the word \u201chelp\u201d which had remained dormant in his throat. It reverberated within the carriage, with sharp panic.\u201cIt\u2019s getting stronger,\u201d Klein spoke in a very certain tone.Being next to a strange Sealed Artifact like 2-049 really placed on in terrifying peril if they were not careful. No, it was totally impossible to guard against it. It could only be avoided through other methods!\u201cIt\u2019s normal,\u201d Aiur Harson said steadily, nodding.Lorotta chuckled.\u201cIt seems to like you? Don\u2019t worry. It is a relatively less dangerous Grade 2 Sealed Artifact.\u201dIn her naturally languid voice, the puppet whose joints clearly reflected a human\u2019s stood up. It began tottering towards its left.Its action was incomprehensible, just like a steam engine that someone had rusted due to a lack of lubricating oil.Robot dance\u2026 Klein suddenly had the few Chinese words pop into his head. He had a new guess of the danger 2-049 posed.It assimilates the living things that it seizes control of?If I am not woken up in time by the others, would I have become a human-sized puppet, a real-life Barbie doll?Just as thoughts flooded Klein, Aiur Harson was awoken by Dunn. He extended and bent his arms as he pointed in the direction that the puppet was walking slowly towards. He said to Leonard who was driving the carriage, \u201cOver there!\u201dLeonard couldn\u2019t make the carriage pass through the building, so he had to detour. During the detour, 2-049 constantly adjusted the direction that it was facing. It acted like a compass that pointed towards the Antigonus family.Upon seeing the scene, Klein, who was constantly \u201cexercising\u201d his arms, nearly burst out laughing under the tension.I heard that 2-049 was created by the Antigonus family\u2026 Is this an act of loyalty or the perfect example of screwing things up?Leonard drove the carriage according to Aiur Harson\u2019s occasional instructions.Whenever the strange puppet 2-049 walked to the edge of the carriage, Aiur Harson would pull it back and start it all over again.Every time that happened, its mouth would open and two people would be under its influence simultaneously.Klein\u2019s taut feelings gradually began to relax. He realized that Sealed Artifact 2-049 was not as scary anymore. As long as there were more than three people present and they constantly maintained their arm motions, if they made sure to wake their partners in time, 2-049 was merely a puppet with slightly unique characteristics.The carriage traveled at high speed, and quickly arrived at the harbor, where warehouses were clustered.After circling a few times, they confirmed that 2-049 intended to enter the innermost grayish-white warehouse. Aiur Harson\u2019s expression turned solemn. He grabbed the puppet carefully and stuffed it back into the black chest.Thump! Thump! Thump!Under constant ferocious knocking, Aiur woke up again and again with the help of Borgia and Lorotta as he activated the mechanism with great effort. He then injected his spirituality and activated the star and crimson symbols on the chest.At the reappearance of the formless seal, Aiur Harson let out a long heavy breath.\u201cLet\u2019s get down,\u201d Dunn Smith said with a low and mild voice. \u201cLeonard, tying the horse here will do.\u201dDressed in windbreakers, suits, or shirts, the six left the carriage and walked into the innermost warehouse. As they walked, they uniformly stretched and bent their arms.This added a comical and ridiculous vibe to the rather tense situation.The Nighthawk Awkward Dance Squad\u2026 Klein could only complain inwardly to ease such a feeling.However, there was no other way around it. According to his observations, 2-049 first affected the upper body. Therefore, to detect it in time to prevent a more dangerous situation from developing, they only had the choice of extending and bending their arms, shake their necks or bodies. However, the latter only made one look like a hooligan.As for actions like blinking eyes and striking one\u2019s eyebrows, they were either too easily ignored or the action was too big. Neither was a good option.This awkward dance squad is better than Causeway\u00a0Bay <sup>1</sup> triad members\u2026 Klein sighed in resignation and followed Captain Dunn Smith and company.As they approached the warehouse\u2019s door, the deeper his anxiety and worry became.No one knew what kind of effect the notebook had on Ray Bieber!If something dire happened, Klein did not dare pin his hopes on transmigrating again.Furthermore, he discovered that he could still be injured and bleed while chopping ingredients for dinner. The speed at which he recovered at was normal too. He wasn\u2019t some kind of monster that was impervious to combat or death.As they walked, Dunn suddenly lowered his non-moving hand and made a pressing gesture to beckon everyone to stop ten meters away from the warehouse\u2019s door.\u201cKlein, divine if there is any danger in the warehouse. It\u2019d be better if you could tell the level of danger,\u201d Dunn said as he turned his head to Klein.His gray eyes looked deep as usual; there was no fear.Klein gave an unnoticeable nod and stopped the hand exercise. He extended his right hand to his left cuff and removed the silver chain that had a hanging piece of topaz.As he was still moving his arms, Dunn realized his sluggish actions in time and woke him up with a nudge.Klein held the silver chain with his left hand and allowed the topaz to hang down naturally. Simultaneously, he moved his right arm, but with a much smaller range of motion.When the topaz stabilized, he half closed his eyes, outlined the spherical light, and entered Cogitation. He then mumbled, \u201cThere\u2019s danger in the warehouse.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s danger in the warehouse.\u201d\u2026After seven times, he opened his eyes and saw the hanging topaz slowly going in clockwise circles.It turned faster and faster, and in the end, Klein felt like it was pulling his left hand.\u201cThere\u2019s danger, great danger,\u201d Klein replied honestly.Clockwise meant affirmation to the chanted statement, while counter-clockwise meant denial.To other Beyonders, even a Mystery Pryer, using spirit dowsing could only determine if there was danger, but it was unable to obtain information regarding the level of danger.However, Klein discovered that when he used spirit dowsing, the pendulum would spin at different speeds, revealing the degree of the answer.Although it was not very accurate and extremely vague, it allowed one to have a rough assessment of the actual situation.As expected of a Seer potion\u2026 Klein was rather happy with the outcome.Just as he was about to put away the topaz pendulum, Leonard Mitchell, who had maintained his silence, suddenly spoke.\u201cDivine if there is danger around us also.\u201dDunn nodded in agreement. \u201cYes, I am worried that the Secret Order will not give up and that it has placed Ray Bieber\u2019s house under constant surveillance. They could have followed us here and could cause trouble at a critical moment.\u201dKlein took a deep breath and entered a calm, ethereal state once again.When the silver chain turned stable once again, he recited in his heart, \u201cThere is danger surrounding us.\u201d\u2026\u201cThere is danger surrounding us.\u201d\u2026After repeating the statement, Klein opened his eyes and looked at the silver chain.In his dark brown eyes, the topaz pendulum first moved counterclockwise with difficulty. Then, it suddenly paused and started moving clockwise.\u201cThere is danger surrounding us.\u201d Klein felt a tug on his heartstrings as he spoke carefully.Furthermore, someone had tried to intercept his divination, but had lost to him in the invisible fight!Just as he spoke, an orange-yellow fireball the size of a fist flew towards them.It came crashing towards the middle of the group with its blazing speed.Dunn Smith, who had already drawn his long-barreled revolver before Klein did his divination, immediately raised his hand, aimed, and pulled the trigger.Bang!The fireball didn\u2019t seem to be affected by the gunshot but continued its original trajectory, as though it was forcing everyone to scatter from dodging.Klein originally thought nothing of the troublemaker who was following them. After all, there were six Beyonders present. They were not even short of Sequence 8 and Sequence 7 experts. It was a lineup that was practically unstoppable in a small city like Tingen.But when the fireball smashed down, he came to a sudden realization.To them, the most dangerous enemy was not the tracker nor the troublemaker, it wasn\u2019t even Ray Bieber who was in the warehouse in an unknown state, but the Sealed Artifact 2-049!Once they dispersed and the battle began, they wouldn\u2019t be able to wake each other in time. Then, they would turn into real-life puppets one after another!As these chaotic thoughts bombarded him, Klein was pulled by Leonard aside to dodge the fireball.Without the time to feel anguish for his clothing, he saw the Nighthawks split off into two groups while dodging. It was done very orderly.Poof!The orange-yellow fireball landed on the ground but didn\u2019t stir one bit of dust. It disappeared as though nothing had happened.An illusion? Just as this thought came to him, Klein saw Aiur Harson lift the black chest and threw it least ten meters away.\u201cStay away from it! Watch it!\u201d Aiur shouted.Before he finished his shout, Leonard and Borgia had separately approached it. They stood at least seven meters from the chest to prevent anyone from approaching.As for Dunn and Lorotta, they each held guns. They stood beside Aiur Harson who had drawn a thin silver sword. They took up a formation resembling a crescent as they rushed towards the origins of the fireball, while taking note of the peripheral regions.Upon seeing this scene, Klein, who needed to do the arm exercises without his cane, immediately heaved a sigh of relief. He realized he had overlooked an important matter.2-049 had a limited range of influence. As long as they were at a sufficient distance from it, they did not need to worry about the danger.Klein rolled over and stood up. He stuffed his topaz pendulum into his pocket with one hand while he reached into his holster for his revolver with the other.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He went into a shooting stance, allowing the light to reflect from the bronze body of the revolver.He held the revolver with one hand, and moved his other arm, cautiously paying attention to anything that could happen around him.At the same time, he was a little worried for Captain Dunn and Mr. Aiur Harson. After all, both were Nightmare Beyonders who specialized in influencing the enemy from the shadows. He did not know if they were adept at direct combat.Just as Klein was having these considerations, Aiur Harson slowed down, his expression becoming serene and peaceful.He opened his mouth and recited a peaceful poem, one that seemed to place a person into the night.\u201cWhen once the sun sinks in the west,\u201cAnd dewdrops pearl the evening\u2019s breast;\u201cAlmost as pale as moonbeams are,\u201cOr its companionable star,\u201cThe evening primrose opens anew\u201cIts delicate blossoms to the dew;\u201cAnd, hermit-like, shunning the\u00a0light <sup>1</sup> \u201d\u2026The recital reverberated around them. Klein nearly lost his tense feelings and completely relaxed.He was lucky that he had experienced something similar before and was not facing Aiur Harson. Thus, he quickly collected himself and entered a half-cogitative state to combat the influence of the poem.Phew\u2026 He let out a sigh of relief. He no longer had any doubts about Dunn\u2019s and Aiur\u2019s direct combat abilities.As he had only advanced recently and still did not have a deep understanding of Sequence potions, Klein had forgotten that the Sequence 7 Nightmare was the advancement of Sequence 8 Midnight Poet. They could keep whatever abilities they had before and, in fact, enjoy a small increase in their abilities.The impression Klein had of Midnight Poets all came from Leonard Mitchell. He knew that this \u201cjob\u201d inherited the unique traits of a Sleepless. They were good at combat, shooting, climbing, and sensing. They were also adept in influencing the living creatures around them through the use of various poems. In simpler terms, they were violent poets.While Aiur was reciting his poem, the large wooden crates stacked up around them seemed to suddenly ripple like water. A man wearing a black tuxedo and halved top hat appeared.But this man\u2019s face was painted in three pastel colors\u2014red, yellow, and white. The sides of his lips were arched high like a clown, forming a ridiculous contrast with his formal wear that was suitable for joining an evening banquet.Thud! Thud! Thud! The black-haired Lorotta who had been introduced as a sharpshooter charged forward quickly. She had a gun in one hand and had clenched the other into a fist. She made it within inches of the suited clown in a few steps.The suited clown seemed to be affected by Aiur Harson\u2019s poem. His body was swaying, and he had a peaceful expression in his eyes. He did not have any desire to retaliate.Lorotta tilted her body with a boxing maneuver as she pulled back her fist, then punched toward the suited clown\u2019s face.Bang!The air crackled as the suited clown shattered suddenly like a mirror, pieces quickly evaporating and vanishing into thin air.At this moment, the suited clown quickly appeared once again in the shadows of the wooden crates a few steps away. The suited clown\u2019s figure outline quickly appeared again.The person under the influence of the poem was only an illusion! It was a performance!The suited clown grinned again. It had a comical look as he pressed down on his halved top hat with one hand and pointed a finger gun with the other.Bang!The sound of a shot rang from the finger gun. Lorotta fell to the left and rolled on the floor, dodging the attack.But nothing had happened, except for the fake gunshot.Bang! Bang! Bang!Dunn and Aiur each lifted their guns and fired steadily. The suited clown dodged adeptly, sometimes to the right and left, sometimes rolling on the ground. It was as if he was an acrobat act in a circus.Suddenly, Lorotta surprisingly charged forward again. Despite being called a sharpshooter, she was still using her fists.Bam!The suited clown could not dodge the attack in time and could only lift his left arm to block the fist.Seeing the clown stop, Dunn and Aiur did not hesitate to each take aim and pulled the trigger.At this moment, the arm that the suited clown used to block Lorotta\u2019s fist ignited with an orange-yellow flame.In an instant, the flame enveloped the suited clown and spread towards Lorotta.Bang! Bang! Dunn and Aiur fired their revolvers, hitting the ball of flame.The flames burned rapidly and soon, all that was left were black ashes floating in the sky. But the suited clown once again appeared behind the stack of wooden crates close by.He lifted his right hand and pointed a finger gun once again.Bang!Amid the illusory gunshot, Lorotta suddenly stopped in her tracks. She did not charge forward. Mud was splattering in front of her as a bullet appeared.The suited clown was no longer delivering an illusion with this strike!It was hard to discern real from fake, reality from illusion.Bang! Bang! Bang!The suited clown shot at Dunn and Aiur repeatedly while hiding away and appearing at random times.Upon seeing this, Lorotta squinted and lifted the dull gold revolver in her left hand.Bang!The suited clown suddenly squatted down, avoiding the fatal shot. His halved top hat was sent flying backward, falling to the ground. The bullet had left a visible scorch mark on the hat.After rolling a few times on the floor, the suited clown scaled the stacks of wooden crates with the agility of a monkey. He shot air bullets out of his finger gun from the high ground.Aiur Hanson took a few steps back and lowered his gun. He began his recital once again.\u201cWastes its fair bloom upon the night,\u201cWho, blindfold to its fond caresses,\u201cKnows not the beauty it possesses.\u201d\u2026The suited clown jumped repeatedly between the crates. He suddenly raised his hand to scratch his ears and looked at Aiur with a comical smile.Could he have stuffed his ears? The Sequence potion that the Secret Order possesses sure is weird\u2026 Klein observed the fight from far away as he made silent guesses.Just as his thoughts flashed through him, he suddenly saw a figure appear at the top of a warehouse beside him. Furthermore, it was running straight inside where Ray Bieber was hiding.That figure was dressed in a grayish-white uniform, one which workers at the docks wore. His face also appeared to be painted red, yellow, and white.The suited clown is responsible for distracting Captain and the rest while the other person retrieved the diary? Klein instinctively raised his right hand and shot at the figure on the roof.He had just taken aim when the figure suddenly squatted, switching from running to rolling on the ground.Bang!Klein did not stop pulling the trigger. He saw the figure suddenly pause, blood blooming in a spurt.The figure looked at him in shock. While bearing the pain, he continued charging into the warehouse.That felt like a lucky shot\u2026 Klein twitched his lips and pulled the trigger once again. This time, the bullet hit the wooden roof beside the figure.Bang! Bang! Bang!Leonard and Borgia also shot but did not hit the figure.Klein wanted to criticize how terrible their shooting skills were as compared to his when he suddenly stopped pulling the trigger.That\u2019s right! Why must we stop him?Didn\u2019t I divine that there is grave danger in the warehouse just now? Wouldn\u2019t it be great if we let that guy be the vanguard and step on the land mine for us?Leonard and that Mr. Borgia must have had the same idea\u2026With this thought, Klein lifted the barrel of his revolver and shot at the sky.Bang! Bang! Bang!As the gunshots rang, the figure managed to reach the innermost region of the warehouse unobstructed.He lunged downwards, slamming into the roof as he fell down with the collapsing roof.Immediately following the commotion, the black-haired Lorotta\u2019s eyes suddenly turned black. Her left hand began making a strange pulling action.The suited clown\u2019s jumping actions suddenly came to a pause as his ankle seemed to be grasped tightly by an invisible hand.Dunn did not shoot immediately and instead pointed his revolver downward.He opened his mouth and by simply using his spirituality to resonate the air around him, he produced a strange, faint and ethereal voice without the use of his throat.\u201cThus it blooms on while night is by;\u201cWhen day looks out with open eye,\u201cBashed at the gaze it cannot shun,\u201cIt faints and withers and is gone.\u201d\u2026The suited clown suddenly became limp, as if he had lost the desire to live.Aiur Harson lifted his handgun and took aim, his finger pulling the trigger immediately.In that split second, there was an abnormal and tragic wail that came from the warehouse.\u201cAh!\u201dThe cry contained immense fear as though he had encountered an unimaginably terrifying matter.The hair on Klein\u2019s body stood on end. The tragic cries came to a sudden stop as silence was restored in the deepest parts of the warehouse. It was a skin-crawling silence.Bang!Affected by the cry, Aiur only managed to shoot the suited clown in the belly.Haaa\u2026 Haaa\u2026 Haaa! The silence was once again broken from the deepest depths of the warehouse. What should have been soft panting sounded. It reached a crescendo that tightened everyone\u2019s nerves.Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!Inside the black chest, 2-049 had reached a frenzied state.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Haa! Haa!Thump! Thump! Thump!The loud panting and the intense knocking alternated first before they resounded together. It made Klein and company extremely nervous, as though they were hearing some evil murmur.Taking advantage of the moment Aiur, Dunn and Lorotta had their attention redirected, the suited clown suddenly pulled out a long piece of paper from his pocket.Pa! He threw it with his right hand as the slip of paper ignited into a black fiery whip. Then, he lashed it towards the side of his ankle.A fleeting but tragic scream sounded as the suited clown escaped the invisible shackles and did a backflip.Bang! Bang! Bang!Dunn, Aiur, and Lorotta shot but their bullets only ended up hitting the wooden crates.The suited clown did not stay any longer as he pressed down on his wound with his right hand while escaping in a direction opposite the warehouse.He was so fast that in the blink of an eye, all that was left was a hint of his back.And before he vanished, his right hand which pressed down on his abdomen moved towards his left arm. The wound on his stomach had already vanished, looking completely fine.The location on his left arm which he touched with his right hand suddenly became badly mangled, and a silver bullet appeared in the torn flesh.Dunn and the rest didn\u2019t chase after him because the panting from the innermost warehouse was so loud that it was making them nervous and insecure.Bang!The door of the innermost warehouse suddenly exploded and flew in all directions.Then, something wrapped with a torn cloth flew out and landed not far from Klein.When Klein cast his gaze over, he realized that it was an arm. Its bloody flesh had been chewed on and its white bones were cracked in an irregular fashion as they jutted outPa! Pa! Pa!One item after another flew out. First it was a spray of blood, followed by a dilated eye and an ear which had been ripped out brutally. Finally, half a beating heart and intestines filled with yellowish-brown objects came out.If Klein had not seen the more gruesome giant cadaver at Ray Bieber\u2019s place, he would have probably vomited there and then.His nerves were on the brink of a breakdown. After a great deal of effort to hold back his urge to shoot into the pitch-black entrance, he ejected the empty shells from his revolver and reloaded with new demon hunting bullets.Bang!Dunn drew close as he stably shot into the warehouse.However, his bullet was like a shot into the sea. There was no audible response.Haa! Haa! Haa!The loud panting sped up as grayish-white colors filled the opened door.With another two loud shots, Aiur Harson\u2019s and Borgia\u2019s bullets tore through the whiteness, but failed to prevent the \u201ccolor\u201d from spilling outwards. It did not leave any wounds or cause liquid to seep out.Klein held his breath and kept himself from shooting blindly. He watched as the whiteness slowly revealed a complete outline.It was a humanoid creature more than two meters tall. Its limb joints were all unnaturally twisted. It was as though they had been snapped by someone forcefully.White bones poked out from under its skin as the entire grayish-white surface was filled with gullies, like a human brain that had been stripped from its shell.The monster had grayish-white, rotting, sticky liquid flowing all over it. Its head looked relatively normal, with deep wrinkles and pale skin.As it opened and closed its mouth, Klein could see a porcelain false tooth that looked close to falling out, a few strands of bloody saliva, and bone and flesh that had been minced.Was\u2026 Ray Bieber still even f**king human? Klein drew a silent gasp as he felt his heart pound rapidly.Bang!Leonard\u2019s demon hunting bullet hit Ray Bieber\u2019s forehead and tore right through it, leaving behind a deep hole.Grayish-white liquid flowed out and dripped onto the ground. The liquid wriggled and turned into fat cream-colored maggots.But the monster appeared completely unaffected. It was neither fast nor slow when it pounced at Borgia who was closest to it. Its actual target appeared to be the black chest that contained Sealed Artifact 2-049.\u201cLoss of control of Beyonder powers\u2026\u201d Dunn shouted in a deep voice. \u201cLorotta, it looks like a dead soul, so quickly look for its weakness!\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Lorotta did not speak further as she raised her hands to press down on her eyes.Her pupils turned gray then colorless, as though she had entered the world of spirits and a kingdom of dead souls. She looked down at the enemy from a higher vantage point as she searched for a \u201cnode.\u201dKlein saw that a normal gunshot was ineffective, so he did not bother wasting more of his bullets. He lifted his hand to tap at his glabella to activate his Spirit Vision. He planned on helping Gravedigger Lorotta.From his vision, Monster Bieber only had one kind of spiritual glow left. It was purely grayish-white, a whiteness filled with craziness.Apart from that, Klein saw nothing else.At that moment, Aiur Harson and Leonard Mitchell sang simultaneously.\u201cOh, the threat of horror, the hope of crimson cries!\u201cOne thing at least is certain\u2014that this Life flies;\u201cOne thing is certain, and the rest is Lies;\u201cThe Flower that once has bloomed forever dies\u2026\u201d\u2026The power that allowed one to enter a peaceful slumber emanated. The twisted grayish-white monster gradually slowed down as though it could not fight against the charm of the poem.Then, it opened its mouth and let out a shrill cry that ordinary people were deaf to.\u201cAh!\u201d\u2026Bang! Klein felt a sharp pain in his head as he automatically exited his Spirit Vision state.He felt warm liquid flowing out of his nose, and when he subconsciously wiped it with his hand, he discovered the back of his hand covered in blood.Aiur and Leonard fell back to the ground at the same time. They had blood stains lining the corners of their lips, noses, and eyes.Borgia, Dunn, and Lorotta each took a step or two back, the color in their face draining.That monster only screamed once, but it appeared to exceed what the six Beyonders could withstand. They instantly turned extremely weak.Bam!It closed in on Borgia and suddenly swung its twisted joint.Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!Borgia and Dunn shot twice each, but they didn\u2019t cause any damage to Monster Bieber.Bang! A blow sent Borgia flying out as his long-barreled revolver fell to the ground.He tried to stand up a few times, but failed to do so.The corner of Monster Bieber\u2019s mouth had stringy liquid oozing out as it leaped towards the black chest.Bang!At that crucial moment, Aiur Harson shot a bullet at the box to knock it some distance away, preventing Monster Bieber from grabbing it. Its momentum brought it forward by more than ten meters.The black chest cracked and as the thumping within turned more intense it grew more obvious.\u201cFound it!\u201d The black-haired Lorotta finally spoke. \u201cI need you to control it for at least three seconds.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Dunn didn\u2019t delay any further. He extended his hand to tap his glabella and closed his eyes.He seemed to fall asleep as shapeless waves slowly rippled out one after another.In that instant, Monster Bieber paused and the craziness in its eyes quickly receded. Its thin transparent eyelids began to close uncontrollably as well.Dunn\u2019s body started quivering, and something popped up under his clothing and wriggled on the spot. It was as though he hid slippery scaleless snakes within.Lorotta rushed over and with a roll, arrived under Monster Bieber.She supported herself with one hand while raising a clenched fist, bombarding Monster Bieber\u2019s crotch like artillery.Poof!She ignored the corrosive pain but supported herself against the ground and directed more strength once again. She went higher a little as her fist drilled deeper in.Rip! Lorotta pulled out her forearm as she dragged out an intestine filled with brownish-yellow blood stains.In the intestine, there was an ancient notebook.\u201cAh!\u201dMonster Bieber let out a blood-curdling scream, and his body suddenly lit up as though it was melting.\u201cGet down!\u201dJust as Aiur Harson\u2019s hurried shout ended, Klein saw Monster Bieber suddenly swell up.Boom!Amid a loud explosion, the distant Klein was tossed into the air by the shockwave and landed heavily.He struggled to stand against a swirling headache, and he saw Monster Bieber turn into a pile of disgusting, rotting flesh. Then he saw Dunn and Lorotta, who were a dozen meters away, looking like they had been knocked out.Aiur Harson, Borgia, and Leonard Mitchell were on the ground too. Some groaning in pain, some struggling to stand up but failing.Klein was just about to relax when he suddenly saw a familiar object about two or three meters away from him.The black chest had stopped rolling, and cracked surface was facing the sky.A skinny brown arm extended out.Sealed Artifact\u2026 2-049\u2026 F**k! Klein\u2019s heart tensed up as he immediately leaped in the opposite direction in a bid to escape 2-049\u2019s effective range.The blast from before had thrown the black chest near him!And at that moment, Klein\u2019s head suddenly buzzed as his thoughts turned sluggish.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019ve been controlled by the puppet!Captain and company are either unconscious\u2026 or have yet to recover. They can\u2019t even get up\u2026 They will not be able to\u2026 wake me up in time\u2026No\u2026 I have to\u2026 save myself!Everything before Klein\u2019s eyes was happening in slow motion. All his joints and his brain seemed to have been coated with an ever-thickening layer of glue.He had no interest in becoming a human-version puppet, so he seized the opportunity of not being fully controlled by trying his best to seek a way to save himself.I definitely can\u2019t\u2026 hit myself\u2026 There must be an\u2026 external force\u2026External force\u2026 I\u2019ll give it a try\u2026 There\u2019s no time for hesitation\u2026 Without the luxury of time to think through things, Klein came to an idea in less than three seconds. He moved his \u201crusty\u201d knee joint and took a counterclockwise step.At the same time, he did not try to escape the invisible rope that \u201chung\u201d around his throat. All he did was recite inwardly.Blessings Stem\u2026 From The\u2026 Immortal Lord of\u2026 Heaven and Earth\u2026He wanted to use the mysterious world above the gray fog to awaken him and escape Sealed Artifact 2-049\u2019s assimilation!Creak! Creak! Creak! Klein\u2019s knees and ankles let out an involved ear-piercing sound. With a slow contorted step, he took another step counterclockwise.Blessings Stem\u2026 From The Sky Lord\u2026 of Heaven and Earth.Klein\u2019s thoughts turned increasingly sluggish as he felt as though he was a computer that had all sorts of bloatware and every antivirus software installed. He lifted his left foot in a jerky manner as he took another step in the required spot.Blessings Stem\u2026 From The\u2026 Exalted Thearch\u2026Klein\u2019s thought processes turned more and more rigid and sluggish. He took the final step purely out of instinct.At that point, he knew he was almost fully under the puppet\u2019s control. Even if Aiur Harson could get up in time to save him, he would probably be unable to be awakened.But his strong desire to live made him chant the final line of the incantation.Blessings\u2026 Stem\u2026 From The\u2026 Celestial\u2026 Worthy\u2026Just as he finished his incantation, the extremely chaotic and hysterical shouts and murmurs sounded. They quickly took over every corner of Klein\u2019s sluggish thoughts, shattering them in the process and reducing them to thoughts he had no control over.Klein\u2019s brain became a boiling pot of potpourri as his stiff body turned light while his spirituality lifted.Endless grayish-white fog and the dark red stars of varying distances appeared once again before his eyes. It was vast, mysterious, vague, and blurry.Klein\u2019s confused mind quickly settled down as he finally regained his ability to think, only to see the magnificent palace.\u201cPhew\u2026 Thankfully, it worked.\u201d he whispered with a lingering fear.According to his previous observations, he knew that once someone fell under the control of Sealed Artifact 2-049, it was equivalent to death. Normally, there was no medicine that could save the victim.Luckily, his luck enhancement ritual and the mysterious world above the gray fog was not considered normal at all!After pacing a few times, Klein began considering the situation he was in.I can\u2019t just stay here the entire time, right?By the time Captain and company wakes up and gather over, I won\u2019t be able to explain the situation\u2026As things are right now, I only have the shell of my body, nothing more zombielike than a zombie\u2026But if I were to take the risk and return, there\u2019s no way to guarantee my safety\u2026 What if I get controlled by 2-049 again?\u2026While suffering from his dilemma, Klein suddenly smacked himself in the forehead and could not help but chuckle softly.\u201cIt looks like I haven\u2019t gotten used to my status as a Seer!\u201dBefore he finished his sentence, he appeared at the seat of honor in front of the long bronze table, sitting on the high-back chair with the strange symbol.Klein extended his hand as a fountain pen appeared out of thin air.He scribbled a sentence on an illusory piece of paper.\u201cReturning to the real world is very safe.\u201dImmediately following that, Klein pulled out a projection of a spirit pendulum from his packet. After a few Gatherings, he discovered that the items he brought on him were projected above the gray fog, but they were relatively illusory.Klein held the silver chain with his left hand as he allowed the topaz to nearly touch the paper.He calmed his breathing and half closed his eyes. He calmly repeated the words on the piece of paper.\u201cReturning to the real world is very safe.\u201d\u2026\u201cReturning to the real world is very safe.\u201d\u2026After repeating it seven times, Klein completed the divination with spirit dowsing.He opened his eyes and saw the topaz slowly oscillating, guiding the silver chain in a clockwise spin.Clockwise is an affirmation while counterclockwise is negative\u2026 Returning to the real world is very safe\u2026 Klein heaved a sigh of relief as he habitually stored the chain away. Then, he released his spirituality and wrapped his body as he simulated a plummeting state.The hazy fog and deep red stars turned ethereal and charged upward. Klein soon saw himself still in a daze in his original position. He saw the brown puppet, halfway out of the chest. He also noticed that the Sealed Artifact had apparently stopped all motion.His physical senses reached to his brain and just as he was about to try to move his arm to determine his condition, he suddenly heard a voice concealed within the wind.\u201cDo you wish to be awakened? You can be saved as long as you promise me one thing.\u201cThis one thing is to help me take that Antigonus family notebook.\u201cNod if you agree. I know you are still capable of completing that action.\u201dWho is it? Yes\u2026 2-049 doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s attempting to control me\u2026 That\u2019s right. It will not repeatedly influence the same person. There will be a break\u2026 Klein was shocked, but he did not show it on his face.At that moment, the voice added quickly, \u201cYou can obtain additional rewards if you complete this matter. I know you are a Seer. I also know that the Church of the Evernight Goddess does not have Sequence 8 that succeeds Sequence 9. But our Secret Order can give it to you.\u201cHeh, to be honest, I was a Seer before. If not, I wouldn\u2019t have dared return. To show you my sincerity, I can now tell you that the corresponding Sequence 8 of Seer is Clown.\u201dClown? Secret Order\u2026 Klein nearly did not maintain his \u201cpuppet\u201d state.He never made the connection between Seer and Clown.Were they about to become the head honchos of a circus?\u201cAlright, make your choice. Believe me, you no longer have much time left to waste.\u201d The voice sounded with the wind again. The distant Dunn and Lorotta were still unconscious. Borgia seemed heavily injured as he moaned without moving. Aiur Harson and Leonard Mitchell were in relatively good shape as they attempted to sit up.Why me? The Secret Order\u2026 Is it that suited clown from before? After he escaped, he secretly returned in a bid to fish in troubled waters\u2026 Upon hearing the voice, all sorts of doubts instantly flashed through Klein\u2019s mind.Since the person said that he was a Seer, Klein attempted using the thought processes of a Seer to analyze the situation.He dared return because he divined \u2018hope.\u2019 He believed that Monster Bieber would be destroyed and that we would suffer a heavy setback.He did not take the notebook by himself or deal with us directly because he likely divined that it would contain immense risk. Therefore, he is suspecting Captain and Madam Lorotta are feigning their unconsciousness, or that this is a trap laid out for him.He did not make further divinations to determine my present state partially because firstly, he might not have the time. If he waited any longer, Mr. Aiur Harson and company would have regained some of their combat strength. Secondly, he belittles me and thinks it unnecessary.He understands a Seer very well and is confident that I\u2019m unable to escape the puppet\u2019s control\u2026 He is using me as cannon fodder to probe for any traps\u2026From another angle, this also means that the luck enhancement ritual does not cause any abnormal appearances\u2026With his brain no longer sluggish, Klein felt that his line of reasoning was clear. He was quite confident of the thoughts and goals of the suited clown.As for the clown\u2019s promise, he believed not one bit of it. Cannon fodder did not have any human rights!As the thoughts flashed through his head, Klein controlled his neck and difficulty nodded.As he did this action, he confirmed that he had escaped the control of Sealed Artifact 2-049.Just after he nodded, a transparent \u201ccurtain\u201d stirred two to three meters to his side. It revealed the suited clown who had his face painted with a clown\u2019s pastel colors. It was none other than the Secret Order member who had fled previously.At that moment, as Klein had previously turned around in an attempt to leap out of 2-049\u2019s effective range, his back was facing the black chest and the puppet. The suited clown was in front of him to his side. First, it was to stay away from the Sealed Artifact and second, to avoid his revolver\u2019s barrel. It was clear that he was very careful.The suited clown pulled out a long paper slip from his pocket and shook it vigorously until it turned straight like a wooden pole.He held the wooden pole and at a distance of two to three meters, he gave Klein\u2019s shoulder a prod in an attempt to wake him.This fellow knows 2-049 very well. He knows that if the scent of an Antigonus family descendant is present, the puppet would go ballistic and control two at a time\u2026 He also knows that throwing a rock doesn\u2019t seem effective. At the very least, I\u2019ve seen Captain and company attempt similar means\u2026 Although Klein did not know why 2-049 had stopped assimilating him again, he did not dare stay within five meters of it any longer. Therefore, he waited as he held his breath.Just as the wooden pole was about to touch his shoulder, Klein suddenly raised his left hand and grabbed the edge of the pole and yanked it backwards.The suited clown was caught by surprise as his body was pulled forward. He staggered a few steps forward as the gap between him and Klein contracted once again. He was now less than two meters away.At the same time, the prepared Klein squeezed his right finger on the revolver\u2019s trigger.Bang! Bang!He shot twice but did not aim at the suited clown. Instead, he had aimed behind him, shooting to the side of Sealed Artifact 2-049!Before the gunshot rang, the suited clown had taken the initiative to roll from his staggering state. He had instinctively backed off.Klein released his hand which had grabbed the wooden pole as he took several steps away rapidly and rushed out the danger zone.Just as the suited clown rolled twice and was about to jump backwards, his head went abuzz as his thoughts rapidly turned sluggish.No good!He forced me to\u2026 dodge in the direction of the Antigonus puppet!I\u2019m within\u2026 five meters\u2026How could he\u2026 not be\u2026 controlled by\u2026 the Antigonus\u2026 puppet\u2026\u2026The suited clown stopped from his rolling as he attempted to crawl out with his seemingly rusty joints.At that moment, Klein had already turned around. He held his revolver with both hands as he aimed at the slowly-moving target.To him, that was equivalent to shooting a fixed target.Having seen the suited clown\u2019s battle with Dunn, Aiur, and Lorotta, Klein knew that he was agile and good at rolling. Therefore, even when they were just a meter or two apart, he had carefully given up on shooting directly. Instead, he forced the clown to dodge to the \u201ckill zone\u201d he imagined\u2014where Sealed Artifact 2-049 was!If the puppet had been ineffective, the suited clown would have determined that he had fallen into a trap. He would then escape by leaping backwards and not pose any significant threat.Bang!Reflected into the indescribable eyes of the suited clown, the black-suited Klein pulled the trigger calmly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 - Dealing With The AftermathPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 76: Dealing With The AftermathTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosBang!The silver bullet traversed the short distance of a few meters and accurately bore into the suited clown\u2019s neck. Large amounts of blood spewed out, dyeing his skin and bow tie red.The suited clown was unable to let out a cry as his throat seemed to produce sounds of him gasping for breath. He wished to raise his arm to divert the fatal wound, but his joints appeared to be filled with glue. His motions were slow and jerky.Bang!Having entered a half-Cogitation state, Klein was not stunned by the appearance of blood. He pulled the trigger once again calmly, as though it was his usual daily practice.A grisly hole appeared on the suited clown\u2019s forehead as crimson red spewed out. The luster in his eyes dimmed as the intricate revolver\u2019s might was far higher than what Klein had imagined to be.As his knees buckled and his arms hung down, the suited clown gradually fell to the ground. His eyes were frozen with a dazed look.His body convulsed a few times before it slowly relaxed and stopped moving.Having delivered a headshot, Klein turned around in a cool manner. He spun his revolver and allowed the empty shells to fall down.Then, dressed in his black formal suit and halved top hat, he walked towards Aiur Harson. He pulled out the final silver demon hunting bullet in his pocket and inserted it into the revolver\u2019s chamber.The reason why he did not turn back to look at the suited clown\u2019s tragic fate was solely because of his discomfort with his first kill. However, it was necessary. He did not know what would happen if the suited clown was under the full control of the puppet.Furthermore, he did not dare risk entering Sealed Artifact 2-049\u2019s effective range. After all, no one knew if something odd would happen that prevented his self-rescuing luck enhancement ritual to fail.As for the items on the suited clown, Klein only cared if there was the so-called Clown potion formula or the relevant clues. However, this was not something he was in a hurry to carry out. In a while, he could do it together with Dunn, Aiur, and company. If the Nighthawks had it, it also practically meant that he had it. There was no way that they would be unwilling to share the potion formula of Sequence 8. At most, he would be required to accumulate his contributions over time. After all, he had only become a Seer recently; it would still be a long time until he fully digested it.As his thoughts churned, Klein quickly walked next to Aiur Harson. The gentleman in his gray windbreaker struggled to sit up but failed at every try. He was covered in dust and mud from the fall.\u201cMr. Harson, what do you need me to do?\u201d he asked, squatting down. He pointed the revolver in his hand at the ground in case of a misfire.Aiur gasped for air and sighed.\u201cThe monster was too strong; if not for its weakness\u2026\u201dThen, he pointed at a sky-blue metal bottle beside him and said in a self-deprecating laugh, \u201cI was trying to consume some medicine, but my hand shook\u2026\u201dThe sky-blue bottle was about the size of Klein\u2019s finger. It was not longer than five centimeters long and a cap that hid spiral patterns had fallen to the side. The liquid had completely spilled.Klein reached out to pick up the bottle. As he looked at it with narrowed eyes, he answered helplessly, \u201cMr. Harson, there are only a few drops left in the bottle.\u201d\u201cGo to\u2026 Borgia and search his body. In his inner pockets.\u201d Aiur said as he gasped for breath.\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein stood up and casually asked, \u201cIs this restorative medicine?\u201dAn item from mysticism?\u201cNo, it only has certain restorative effects. The main goal is to stimulate our minds and squeeze out the potential\u2026 of our bodies. It allows to maintain a decent state for a short period of time until we return, where we can receive treatment.\u201d Aiur attempted to sit up only to fail again. \u201cIt\u2019s name is the Goddess\u2019s Gaze\u2026 Remember to let Borgia drink half a bottle.\u201dKlein did not delay any further as he turned around. He briskly arrived at Borgia who was groaning in pain. He found the uniform sky-blue metal bottle from the Nighthawk\u2019s pocket.After removing the cap, he carefully held the bottle to Borgia\u2019s mouth.Having sensed it, Borgia tried hard to open his lips.The bottle was held up as dark red liquid flowed in Borgia\u2019s mouth.Klein estimated the quantity and stopped just in time. He then screwed the cap back on.The medicine was rather effective. It only took Borgia a few seconds after drinking to regain the spirit in his eyes. Furthermore, he whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201dWith that said, he pressed down on the ground as he slowly sat up. He first dealt with his wounds before walking to the unconscious Lorotta and Dunn. Then, he retrieved the Goddess\u2019s Gaze from the latter\u2019s inner pocket.Klein returned to Aiur\u2019s side and fed him the remaining half bottle.After Aiur panted a few times, his actions suddenly became nimbler. He stood up as though he had never been injured.\u201cI\u2019ll help Borgia. Help that partner of yours.\u201d The gentleman with the charm of a middle-aged man pointed at Leonard Mitchell.Klein had no objections to it. He turned around and jogged to the \u201cpoet,\u201d Leonard.\u201cThere\u2019s no need. I can drink it by myself.\u201d Leonard, with his disheveled hair, smiled as he raised the sky-blue bottle.Upon seeing Leonard agilely get up by pushing up with one hand, Klein, who wanted to lampoon, was suddenly stunned.Leonard\u2019s injuries are lighter than I expected\u2026He had the ability to consume the medicine from the very beginning!That also means that he could see me walk counterclockwise as I did the luck enhancement ritual!No, that\u2019s still alright. I had chanted inwardly and the luck enhancement ritual does not appear odd in any way, or the suited clown would not have fallen for it\u2026But even so, Leonard, who had long recovered but chose to watch by the sidelines, had seen quite a lot. Things like me not being affected by 2-049 and my sneak attack on the suited clown\u2026Just as Klein\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly, Leonard, who was walking in his direction, stopped beside him and chuckled softly.\u201cI actually wanted to save you but discovered that you didn\u2019t need it.\u201cDon\u2019t mind it. There are many special people in this world that can always do things others can\u2019t, such as you\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026and me.\u201d Leonard smiled as he went past Klein and walked to the awakening Dunn and Lorotta.Narcissist\u2026 Klein thought silently as he felt a lot more relaxed.From the looks of it, Leonard Mitchell hid quite a bit of secrets\u2026 As he regrouped with the rest while deep in thought, he saw Captain Dunn wear a cloth and pick up the Antigonus family notebook that was covered in yellowish-brown blood stains.The notebook\u2019s cover was completely made of thick black paper. It suffused an aura from an ancient and distant time without any signs of softening or rotting. It was nearly identical to the one he saw in his dream. He even suspected that flipping it open would only make him see the Fool wearing splendid headgear.However, he soon realized that he was overthinking things since Dunn had flipped open the notebook to make a final confirmation.Klein was unable to discern the words on it due to his poor angle, but he was certain that there was no drawing of the Fool with his gorgeous clothes and splendid headdress.\u201cAhem. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it.\u201d Dunn closed the notebook and held it securely. Then, he looked at Aiur and company. \u201cLet\u2019s store this notebook and Sealed Artifact 2-049 behind Tingen\u2019s Chanis Gate. We can wait until all of you are recovered or Backlund sends someone over.\u201dUpon hearing that, Klein felt a little disappointed once again, but also felt happy. He wished to see the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook once more and figure out the reason for the death of the original Klein, Welch, and Naya. However, he also felt that the ancient item was filled with misfortune. It often brought catastrophe, so he did not dare touch it.Handing it to the Church\u2019s headquarters and sealing it is considered the best choice\u2026 He secretly heaved a sigh of relief.\u201cAlright.\u201d Aiur Harson, Borgia, and Lorotta nodded in unison. They then turned around and arrived beside Sealed Artifact 2-049.They woke each other up and stuffed the puppet which had resumed moving into the black chest with an opening as they monitored it strictly.\u201cEverything is back to normal.\u201d Aiur sounded a little more relaxed.Inside the dimly lit black chest, the puppet wrapped in oil-stained cloth flipped over with its body creaking as it aligned its clown-painted face with the light source.On the creepy face, under the black pupil-less eyes, two hardly noticeable crimson cracks appeared.Meanwhile, Dunn, Leonard, and Klein, who had mustered his courage, began searching the suited clown\u2019s corpse. They found paper flowers, handkerchiefs, poker cards, glass pieces, and all sorts of strange items.However, apart from that, he did not seem to carry anything of worth or potential clues.Hmm, other than the wallet with seventy to eighty pounds and ten plus soli\u2026 Klein secretly sighed.With money in mind, he immediately looked down and inspected himself. His face nearly fell literally.His formal suit that cost several pounds had torn in five to six spots which required mending due to his rolling on the ground. Furthermore, it was covered in dust and dirt stains.Dunn shot him a glance as the corner of his lips curved up.\u201cLosses during a mission can be reimbursed.\u201dReimbursed\u2026 Upon hearing the term \u201cinvented\u201d by Emperor Roselle, Klein instantly felt wonderful.Yeah. This suit just needs some proper cleaning and mending before it can be worn again. It will still be presentable\u2026When the reimbursement comes, I can buy another set and I can take turns wearing them!Hmm, I am not the kind of person that uses a reimbursement for something other than what it was intended for\u2026However, I should consider getting a set of clothes for combat in the future, such as a black windbreaker like Captain\u2026 Clothes with slightly poorer material would be much cheaper than a tuxedo\u2026 Tsk, has the reason why the bastard, Leonard, doesn\u2019t like wearing formal suits been due to him having such considerations\u2026\u201cLet Frye take care of the dead body. We\u2019ll see if he can find what the man originally looked like or find any relevant clues.\u201d Dunn touched the suited clown\u2019s face paint with his gloves.Then, they searched the innermost warehouse and saw that there were a splotches of bloody flesh that looked like they had been smashed by boulders. They also saw one white bone after another that had been strewn everywhere.\u201cRay Bieber was absorbing the power in the notebook via an ancient ritual, just like how we would consume a higher-level Sequence potion. A ritual like that is full of danger. It must be performed in an environment isolated from all disturbances, and the ritual would have required him to enter a deep sleep for a certain amount of time. That was probably why he had yet to leave Tingen.\u201d Dunn guessed at the possibilities after inspecting the warehouse.Upon hearing such a description, Lorotta laughed. Her black hair contrasted sharply with her pale face.\u201cSuch a pity, we awakened him ahead of time. His anger at being woken up truly left a deep impression on us.\u201d\u201cThis is a kind of losing control,\u201d Dunn looked towards Klein and told him, as both an explanation and a lecture.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he just leave Tingen and try to absorb it elsewhere?\u201d asked a perplexed Klein.Aiur laughed and pointed to his head.\u201cPeople influenced by ancient or sinister powers often are lacking in this department.\u201dAt that moment, Dunn inhaled and said while hiding his pain, \u201cLeonard, you are still in good condition. Stay here and do not allow ordinary people to come close\u2026 The rest of us will immediately search for items among Ray Bieber\u2019s remains. We will return with them and the Sealed Artifact, as well as the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook. We will then get Frye, Royale, and the police to come here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 - Remnant ItemsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 77: Remnant ItemsTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudios\u201cAlright,\u201d answered Leonard with a relaxed expression when he heard Dunn\u2019s suggestion.Following that, everyone walked out of the warehouse and came close to where Monster Bieber had 'self-destructed.\u201d With him at the origin, they began searching outwards radially.\u201cCaptain, what are we looking for?\u201d Klein looked at the rotting flesh and blood that was strewn everywhere. He held back his urge to retch as he looked at Dunn Smith beside him ponderingly.Dunn did not look up. Instead, he used his deep gray eyes to sweep the ground.\u201cAwakening ahead of time, losing control, and becoming a monster. This means that Ray Bieber did not fully absorb the Beyonder powers provided by the notebook. It also means that a part of his body is considered extraordinary, making it prime material.\u201d\u201cIf you ever encounter something similar, make sure not to miss out on doing a search. It might be a relatively important item.\u201dSo that\u2019s the case\u2026 Klein nodded slightly in enlightenment.In the blink of an eye, he thought of another matter.If the part where Monster Bieber had concentrated the Beyonder powers were some indescribable part, wouldn\u2019t that be awkward\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t it be extremely disgusting to concoct it into a potion\u2026Just as Klein\u2019s mind wandered, Borgia with his sharp eagle-like eyes suddenly shouted.\u201cFound it. Ahem.\u201dDunn and company immediately turned and closed in. Driven by his curiosity, Klein walked over to Borgia with a quickened pace.Soon, he saw the item before Borgia. It was a grayish-white item about the size of a fist. Its surface was filled with gullies and it looked soft but ductile. It looked like a brain that had been extracted out of a living being.Although Klein was unable to make out the extraordinariness of the blob of grayish-white, he was certain that Borgia had not made a mistake since it had remained intact despite the violent explosion it had undergone.Dunn carefully observed it and squatted down. As he extended and bent his right arm, he used his black-gloved left hand to carefully grab the grayish-white item.The moment it was touched, the blob of grayish-white immediately spread out into an extremely sticky liquid.At that moment, Aiur Harson took out a tin-colored square case, removed the cigarettes from them and placed them into his pocket.Then, he handed the square case to Dunn and smiled.\u201cI know, you only like pipes.\u201dDunn chuckled and took the square case. Then, he \u201cpoured\u201d the grayish-white sticky liquid into the case for temporary storage.After storing it away, everyone did a cursory sweep of the area.After confirming that they had not missed out anything, they left. When they came out, they saw the horses digging their hooves into the ground, clearly spooked and nervous. They had nearly escaped their reins.\u201cI\u2019ll drive.\u201d Borgia covered his mouth with his hand and coughed softly.\u201cI know you are good at placating animals,\u201d said Aiur with a smiling nod.After boarding the carriage, Dunn, Lorotta, Aiur Harson, and Klein, who continued their \u201carm exercises,\u201d temporarily had nothing to say as they fell into silence.When the trotting of the horses sounded while the carriage wheeled off, Dunn looked at Klein and deliberated over his words before saying, \u201cI know you are filled with curiosity about the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook. You wish to understand what happened.\u201dNo, not at all\u2026 Klein subconsciously denied.It was an ancient relic filled with misfortune!Without giving him time to answer, Dunn continued and said, \u201cHowever, I have to first report this to the Holy Cathedral. Only after they determine the confidentiality level of the notebook can we consider if this can be shown to you.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d Klein gave a short and simple reply.Dunn continued his arm exercises as he thought before saying, \u201cI once promised that you can be made a formal member of the Nighthawks when we confirm that Ray Bieber is a descendant of the Antigonus family clan. Now, not only have we determined Ray Bieber\u2019s identity, we have even eliminated the monster and spoiled the Secret Order\u2019s conspiracy.\u201cIn this entire process, your performance was outstanding. You personally killed a member of an evil organization. Therefore, I will fulfill my promise and immediately make an application to the Holy Cathedral. We\u2019ll wait for their approval.\u201cRight, I forgot something important. I still need to ask if you are agreeable to it.\u201cMr Klein Moretti, are you willing to formally join the Tingen Nighthawks as one of its members? Your salary will increase severalfold, reaching six pounds a week. Furthermore, you will get a raise every subsequent year.\u201cYour salary will be paid by the Church and Awwa County\u2019s Police Department equally. You will also gain the identity of a probationary inspector. It will be very useful at times.\u201cAs a support-type Beyonder, you do not always need to face enemies, but you will have to guard Chanis Gate once a week\u2026\u201cWithout the squad\u2019s permission, you are not to leave Tingen without permission. Furthermore, you have to keep this a secret from your family\u2026\u201d\u2026By the time Dunn finished listing the restrictions and benefits, Klein was already thinking deeply for more than ten seconds.\u201cI wish to become a formal Nighthawk.\u201dOnly by doing so could he continue to gain more access to mystery, such as the situation regarding the Secret Order!After reading the gathered Roselle diaries, Klein had some changes in thoughts about himself. \u201cBeing skilled in mysticism knowledge to seek a way home was an immutable goal of his. Raising his strength further to more safely make the mysterious space above the gray fog do his bidding before using it to return home was a new addition to his goals.Just as Emperor Roselle said, simply relying on external powers was very dangerous!Furthermore, after becoming a Seer and obtaining Beyonder powers, Klein sensed that he had a better grasp of the mysterious space. For example, he could pull another person into the Gathering.This forced him to consider what possibly beneficial changes would happen to the mysterious space above the gray fog when he reached Sequence 8, Sequence 7, or an even higher Sequence.Of course, Klein knew very well that this was built on the premise that he completely resolved the side effects of the Seer potion. He could not rush or be rash.\u201cVery well. Once the Holy Cathedral approves of it, you will become one of us.\u201d Dunn\u2019s gray eyes were tinted with a hint of joy.At that moment, Aiur Harson, who was listening in, interrupted.\u201cKlein, don\u2019t mind me calling you Klein. Your performance today was really excellent. You managed to kill a Beyonder from the Secret Order. I even suspect that he has reached Sequence 7. How did you do it? I really find it incredulous.\u201dThe question has finally been raised\u2026 Having long prepared for it, Klein acted as though he was organizing his thoughts.He knew that it was indeed incredible and enigmatic that he had killed a Beyonder that ran rings around Dunn, Aiur, and Lorotta. Aiur and company were not blind or dumb, so it was a matter of time before they inquired about the process. However, he never expected them to wait till this moment.That\u2019s right. Captain and Mr. Harson were previously injured and their situations could have worsened at any time. At that moment, any matter that could result in conflict had to be put on hold. It was to prevent me from acting desperately because of my exposed 'secret.\u201d Only after I expressed my attitude and showed that I was willing to be a Nighthawk were they at ease enough to ask\u2026 How crafty. They did not have any obvious communication between themselves, but they had made the same tacit decision\u2026Klein answered as though in thought, \u201cIt\u2019s an extremely lucky event. The clown in the tuxedo had made a fatal misjudgment.\u201cBack then, Sealed Artifact 2-049 was thrown near me as a result of the explosion\u2019s blast. It looked about five to six meters from me, but it was only a crude observation. It was very easy to come to the conclusion that I was within the Sealed Artifact\u2019s area of influence.\u201cAnd back then, I was feeling faint because of the explosion. My actions turned sluggish and looked as though I was being controlled.\u201cIt was unknown when that suited clown came close to me in an invisible state. He tried to entice me by offering to save me and the corresponding Sequence 8, Clown, of the Seer potion. He wanted me to help him retrieve the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook. Right, he said that the Secret Order is in control of the Seer potion\u2019s corresponding Sequence pathway and that he was once a Seer.\u201d\u2026Klein recounted the situation back then in detail. He even described the theories he had back then, including how he believed that the suited clown had divined that taking the notebook would be an extremely risky endeavor; thus, he had changed his plans.Of course, all the truths were used to conceal the lie made in the beginning\u2014that he had been controlled by Sealed Artifact 2-049.\u201cDivined that it was extremely risky to retrieve the notebook? Yes, it\u2019s indeed highly risky. However, the risk was actually because of you,\u201d said Lorotta with a chuckle as she covered her mouth. \u201cHis divination was right, but it caused him to end up in a fatal situation. This sure is an interesting account.\u201dKlein was taken aback before he nodded seriously.\u201cIndeed. Divination is never crystal clear. And that vagueness only means that an interpretation can be wrong.\u201dYes, I have to take note of that!\u201cHow did you finish him off after that?\u201d asked Dunn while he did his arm exercises and leaned back.Klein smiled.\u201cI pretended to agree to him and made him awaken me. However, he did not dare enter the effective range of the Sealed Artifact. He stayed two to three meters away and used a strange paper slip in an attempt to push me.\u201cI seized the opportunity and pulled at his paper slip, causing him to be thrown into 2-049\u2019s effective range. I then complemented it with repeated shots and completed my goal. Heh, it\u2019s quite an embarrassing matter for me. I didn\u2019t even have the confidence of hitting him despite being only two to three meters away from him.\u201dAiur nodded slightly.\u201cWith his evasive abilities, a distance of two to three meters is not an absolute guarantee. You might be able to strike him but fail to hit him in a vital spot. That would only make things worse\u2026 Your choice back then was impeccable. It can even be said to be outstanding. If I were in your shoes, I might not have been able to do it better than you.\u201dHe did not ask further. After all, the suited clown\u2019s entry into the Sealed Artifact 2-049\u2019s area of influence basically sealed his fate. He became a living target.\u201cThe subsequent Sequence of Seer is Clown\u2026 How odd\u2026\u201d Dunn suddenly said with a sigh.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 - TraumaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 78: TraumaTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosAiur Harson added, \u201cExactly, it is hard to imagine that the subsequent Sequence of Seer would be Clown. According to normal logic, no one would link them together.\u201d\u201cIs that strange? I remember that quite a number of Sequence potions also seem to lack similarities between their different levels.\u201d Lorotta covered her mouth as she yawned. It was obvious that her injuries were more severe. Not even Goddess\u2019s Gaze could help her to maintain her vibrant energy.\u201cNo, Lorotta. This is completely different. Even if the other Sequence potions are lacking a connection, we can also find common points if viewed from a different angle. However, I cannot comprehend it for Seer and Clown at all,\u201d said Aiur Harson as he shook his head and sighed.Klein listened to their discussion and laughed.\u201cNo, there\u2019s still a common point.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Aiur asked curiously. Even Dunn\u2019s arm exercises clearly slowed down.Klein replied without hesitation, \u201cBe it a Seer or a Clown, both of them can be found at the circus.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Aiur, Dunn, and Lorotta were stunned.\u201cPfft\u2026 Quite a good answer. I like young man like you!\u201d Lorotta was the first to return to her senses as she burst out laughing.Aiur also smiled as he shook his head.\u201cIn this era, the number of gentlemen who are equipped with the spirit of self-deprecation is decreasing. Thankfully, we have met one today.\u201dDo you think I like to engage in self-deprecation\u2026 It\u2019s not like I figured out any commonality between the two\u2026 Klein complained internally as he replied with a wry smile, \u201cI only wish that the potions of the Sequence pathway would not have names like Beast Tamer, Acrobat, or Magician. That would really form a circus.\u201dFurthermore, it\u2019s a one-man circus\u2026\u201cHaha.\u201d Dunn and company were immediately amused. It filled the carriage with a joyous atmosphere.The carriage proceeded straight for Zouteland Street. Klein, who was not injured, was the first to enter Blackthorn Security Company.\u201cGoddess! What happened to you? Why are you like that?\u201d Rozanne exclaimed when she caught sight of him.Klein looked down at his dirty and tattered suit. He replied with his heart aching, \u201cThere are always all kinds of accidents during a mission. Thankfully, the Goddess blessed us and it ended beautifully.\u201d\u201cPraise the Lady!\u201d Rozanne devoutly drew the crimson moon across her chest.Before waiting for Klein to continue, she asked, \u201cDo you need us to hide in the third floor again? Is the Sealed Artifact really that dangerous?\u201d\u201cTrust me. It\u2019s far more dangerous than you can imagine,\u201d replied Klein with a lingering fear.If not for his even more mysterious luck enhancement ritual, he would have perished under the proverbial hands of 2-049!\u201cGoddess\u2026\u201d Rozanne\u2019s lips quivered as though she had still a million things to say or questions to ask, but in consideration of how the captain was waiting downstairs, she held back her compulsion. She informed Mrs. Orianna and company to head upstairs to the third floor. The neighbors of Blackthorn Security Company were either estates of the Church, or devout clergymen who vaguely knew of the situation.When all the civilian staff dispersed, Klein did not rush to the entertainment room to inform the other Nighthawks. He immediately returned and helped the captain and the rest escort Sealed Artifact 2-049, Monster Bieber\u2019s remnants, and the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook to the second floor.Through the partition, Dunn pushed open the entertainment room\u2019s door and said to the two Nighthawks who were playing Gwent cards, \u201cFrye, Royale, both of you are to immediately head to the harbor\u2019s Tyrell Warehouse and aid Leonard in dealing with the aftermath.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Royale with her raven-black hair and cold expression was the first to stand up.Corpse Collector Frye, with his black hair, blue eyes, and pale skin stood up next.They put down their Gwent cards and walked out the entertainment room and when they passed through the partition, they clearly paused.\u201cWait,\u201d Dunn shouted, not letting down their expectations.\u201cWhat else is there?\u201d Sleepless Royale turned her head back and asked without an expression.\u201cRemember to inform the police. Let them seal off the road. Prevent anyone from coming close until you are done with the scene and move the corpse back,\u201d Dunn said, smacking his forehead.\u201cAlright.\u201d Royale turned around and took two steps before pausing once again.She turned her head, blinked and confirmed coldly, \u201cCaptain, is there nothing else?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Dunn answered categorically.Royale nodded unnoticeably and walked towards the entrance.As for Corpse Collector Frye who exuded coldness and darkness, he maintained his adequate pace.At that moment, Dunn added, \u201cRemember to tell Rozanna, Mrs. Orianna, and company that they can come down.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d Frye calmly replied as though no emotions stirred in him.Klein watched as the two Nighthawks walked out the door and went upstairs before heaving a secret sigh of relief. He followed the captain and the rest underground. They proceeded straight to Chanis Gate.As Dunn gestured for Sleepless Kenley to open Chanis Gate, he instructed Klein, \u201cGo to the armory and get Old Neil here. We need his ritualistic magic to heal ourselves.\u201dAs the effects of the medicine began to wear off, his mental state gradually waned.\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein did not wait for the captain to continue, as he added, \u201cI will watch the armory in Old Neil\u2019s place. I will also request for at least twenty demon hunting bullets and also wait for the Holy Cathedral\u2019s approval, curbing my curiosity about the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Dunn was instantly at a loss for words.\u201cCaptain, is there anything else?\u201d asked Klein with a smile after beating Dunn to it.Dunn shook his head and remained speechless.He pulled out his cane and turned around. After walking a certain distance, Klein turned into the armory and recounted the happenings generally to Old Neil who was drinking plain water.\u201cHe became a monster that lost control\u2026 You even killed a Beyonder?\u201d Old Neil quickly tidied up his desk. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m listening to the script of a play.\u201dHe mumbled as he circled around the desk and walked straight towards the corridor without waiting for Klein\u2019s answer.Klein asked out of curiosity, \u201cMr. Neil, doesn\u2019t the Church have real restorative medicine? Why would ritualistic magic be needed?\u201d\u201cNo medicine made with ordinary ingredients can provide the permanent restorative effects of a ritual. Extraordinary ingredients are very rare, and most of them are not suitable for restorative medicine,\u201d Old Neil explained casually. \u201cYou should know about Goddess\u2019s Gaze, right? When the medicine is first made via a ritual, it would be a standard, real restorative medicine. But every minute after its completion, its effect evaporates until little of its efficacy is left.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Klein nodded disappointedly.As a former \u201ckeyboard warrior\u201d and avid gamer, it was a habit to yearn for a medicine with magical healing properties.He watched Old Neil leave and sat down, taking in the tranquility that he had not had in a very long time.In the midst of his peace, he recalled the tragic death of the suited clown. He recalled himself shooting coldly, the gruesome wound and the spewing of fresh blood.Klein\u2019s body shivered as he felt discomfort. He first stood up, then sat down, then slowly repeated the process. He also did some pacing back and forth in between.Phew\u2026 He let out a breath and decided to occupy himself with something so that he could stop thinking of those negative images.Klein took off his silk hat and formal suit. He then took out a handkerchief and a brush to clean off the dirt and mud.After an uncertain amount of time, he heard Old Neil\u2019s familiar footsteps. Old Neil\u2019s gait involved him walking on his heels, and it made a distinctive noise as he ambled down the hall.\u201cHow tiring\u2026\u201d Old Neil complained as he walked into the room.\u201cTell the rest that no one is to come here within the next hour. I need to rest,\u201d he instructed casually, glancing towards Klein.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you rest upstairs, and I keep watch here?\u201d Klein suggested out of kindness.Old Neil shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s too noisy upstairs. Rozanne is a lady who just can\u2019t stop talking.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein did not insist. He put on his coat and hat, picked up his cane, and returned to the corridor. Then, he pulled the armory\u2019s door ajar.Tap. Tap. Tap. He slowly walked on the empty path when he suddenly saw many rooms he had never seen previously by the side.\u201cThere is a secret door here\u2026\u201d Klein stopped at a spot around a bend as he looked at the room.He discovered that Corpse Collector Frye had already returned. He was carefully examining a completely dissected corpse.Corpse? Klein\u2019s heart stirred as he mustered his courage and approached the room. He knocked lightly on the opened door.Knock! Knock! Knock!Frye stopped his actions and turned around, looking over with his blue but ice-cold eyes.\u201cSorry for disturbing you. I just wish to know if this is a corpse of a Beyonder,\u201d asked Klein as he controlled his tone.\u201cYes.\u201d Frye\u2019s lips opened and closed, but only spat out a single word.Klein\u2019s gaze reached beyond him and landed on the corpse. Indeed, he discovered the familiar gruesome wound on the forehead.It\u2019s that suited clown\u2026 Klein secretly exhaled and said, \u201cAny discoveries?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d answered Frye in an abnormally simple manner.The mood instantly turned awkward. Just as Klein was about to bade farewell, Frye took the initiative to say, \u201cIf you feel uncomfortable, you can come in to take a look. You will discover that it\u2019s only a corpse.\u201dAfraid that I\u2019ll be traumatized? Klein nodded in thought.\u201cAlright.\u201dHe entered the room and came in front of the long white-clothed table as he looked at the corpse.The suited clown\u2019s red, yellow, and white paint had been cleaned off, revealing an unfamiliar face that did not look anything special. He was in his thirties and had black hair and a high nose bridge.At that moment, Frye went to a square table by the corner of the wall and picked up a pencil and piece of paper.He returned to the corpse and placed the paper down and began drawing with the pencil.Klein glanced at it in curiosity and found that Frye was sketching the suited clown\u2019s head.It did not take long before Frye stopped moving the pencil. On the piece of paper, there was a lifelike portrait. Compared to the corpse, the only difference was the lack of a wound with the addition of blue eyes.What a talented genius\u2026 Klein marveled in surprise.\u201cI never expected you to be that good at sketching.\u201d\u201cMy dream was to become an artist before becoming a Nighthawk.\u201d Frye\u2019s tone was completely placid.\u201cThen why don\u2019t you fulfill your dreams?\u201d asked Klein curiously.Frye put down his pencil and said with the suited clown\u2019s portrait in hand, \u201cMy father was a priest of the Goddess. He wished that I become a priest. It\u2019s a presentable job.\u201d\u201cYou became a priest?\u201d Klein asked in surprise.He found it unimaginable that Frye could become a priest with his personality and the vibes he exuded.\u201cYeah, I did quite an okay job.\u201d Frye wore a cold expression as the corners of his mouth curled up a little as he replied. \u201cLater, I encountered and experienced some things and ended up a Nighthawk.\u201dKlein did not plan on infringing on his privacy, so he asked, \u201cYou were once a priest of the Goddess, so why not choose to be a Sleepless?\u201d\u201cA personal reason,\u201d answered Frye frankly. \u201cFurthermore, Madam Daly is a good role model.\u201dKlein nodded and just as he was about to change the subject, he heard Frye say, \u201cHelp me watch this room. I have to immediately hand the sketch to Captain\u2026 Closing a secret door is very troublesome.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Although Klein was a little afraid facing a corpse alone, he braved his fear in agreement.With Frye gone, the room turned quiet. The corpse laid there as Klein\u2019s heart turned heavy.He took a few breaths and, in a bid to defeat his fears, approached the long table.The suited clown lay there silently with his pale face. His eyes were tightly shut, and he had lost all signs of breathing. Apart from the gruesome wound, he emitted the unique coldness of a dead man.Klein observed for a moment as his emotions gradually settled as he was calming down.He swept his gaze and discovered a strange brand on the suited clown\u2019s wrist. Gathering his courage, he extended his hand to touch it, hoping to turn it around to see it more clearly.Just as the ice-cold touch reached from Klein\u2019s fingertips to his brain, the pale palm that had lost all vibrancy shot up suddenly, grabbing him by the wrist.It grabbed at his wrist tightly!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 - Another MurmuringPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 79: Another MurmuringTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosKlein instantly felt his hair stand on end as the icy hand tightened around his wrist. He instinctively pulled his wrist back in a desperate attempt to escape.A heavy sensation bore down on him as Klein used every fiber of strength in his entire body to yank his arm back.Bam!The pale, naked corpse was yanked so forcefully to the side that it fell from the autopsy table.However, the white, ice-cold fingers\u2019 grip remained firmly latched onto Klein\u2019s wrist.Klein momentarily lost the ability to think; the only thought that went through his mind was to draw his revolver and riddle the corpse in holes.However, as he could not retract his dominant hand, he threw his black cane and desperately tried to retrieve his revolver from his holster to no avail.At that moment, the corpse\u2019s eyes rose, revealing a pair of calm, blue eyes.His mouth moved as he muttered, \u201cHornacis\u2026 Hornacis\u2026 Hornacis\u2026\u201dAfter those three words were said, Klein was completely flustered as he felt that the fingers gripping onto his wrist began to loosen before dropping limp.The suited clown\u2019s eyes were shut once again, as though nothing had happened at all.If the pale corpse wasn\u2019t lying on the stone floor, Klein would have imagined that he had been struck by a hallucination spell.He staggered backwards a few steps and felt that most of his body was trembling as a result of the shock and fear.Phew\u2026 Phew\u2026 Klein gasped for air as he slowly regained control of his mental facilities. He looked at the corpse on the ground in alarm and fear.He drew his revolver and carefully retreated from the room, one step at a time. After confirming that the corpse was motionless, he took a glance at his wrist of the hand holding onto his revolver.There were five deep, red finger marks imprinted on his wrist. They silently described his encounter.Klein calmed down as vulgarities filled his mind.F*cking hell. I almost died from the shock!After panting for more than ten seconds, he began assembling items in his mind to quickly compose himself.He carefully recalled everything that he encountered and pieced them together.Although he did not understand the reason for the suited clown\u2019s \u201cresurrection,\u201d he acutely noticed an important point. The corpse had repeated the words \u201cHornacis!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Hornacis again\u2026\u201d Klein knitted his brows. \u201cThe Antigonus family\u2019s notebook has records of a Nation of the Evernight in the Hornacis mountain range. While in Cogitation or Spirit Vision, I would hear sounds that I shouldn\u2019t be able to hear, and among those sounds is the word \u2018Hornacis\u2019\u2026 Is the answer to all these questions on the Hornacis mountain range?\u2026 There might be massive danger lurking there. For example, an evil god might be sealed within and was using various forms of \u2018attraction\u2019 to achieve freedom.\u201dWhile considering this, Klein carefully entered the room and touched the corpse a few times to verify that it was completely dead.He didn\u2019t want Corpse Collector Frye to see him mess up the place, so he mustered his courage to move the corpse back onto the autopsy table.Klein couldn\u2019t help but feel as though his heart was in his mouth throughout the process. The slightest movement could snap his tense nerves. Furthermore, the ice-cold feeling given out by the corpse felt particularly disgusting.After finishing the mission with great difficulty, he recalled the reason he approached the corpse. Therefore, he focused on the suited clown\u2019s wrist and looked at the strange brand.It was unknown when the brand had slipped off, shrinking into a spherical blob of blood which had tint of blue.The spherical blob of blood was the size of a thumb. It floated in midair silently in defiance of the laws of physics.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Klein muttered, but he didn\u2019t dare to touch it rashly.He had no intention of hiding the strange blood sphere. Firstly, he didn\u2019t know if it was a good or bad thing. Secondly, he was certain that Frye, who had examined the corpse, would have long discovered the brand on the wrist. It was even likely that he knew what the strange blood sphere was.And even if Frye doesn\u2019t know, reporting it to Captain and letting the Nighthawks research it is definitely better than me making random attempts\u2026 That was Klein\u2019s train of thought.Being in an organization meant he had to know how to make use of the organization\u2019s powers to its fullest.Klein waited nervously for a few minutes before he saw the black-haired, blue-eyed, and thin-lipped Frye return.He instantly noticed the strange blood sphere, and asked Klein a question he had previously asked himself.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cNo idea.\u201d Klein shook his head honestly. He recounted what had happened without hiding anything.\u201cThe brand slipped off into a blood sphere\u2026\u201d Frye nodded, seemingly deep in thought. \u201cThe corpse of a Beyonder always tends to have some strange transformations\u2026\u201dHe looked up and said to Klein, \u201cBring the Captain here. Inform him about the contents that the corpse murmured as well.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein was already itching to leave.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to return with the Captain,\u201d Frye added. \u201cI believe you won\u2019t like to see what happens next.\u201dAs he spoke, he picked up a silver surgical knife beside him.Klein nodded with some lingering fear.\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d say that.\u201dHe picked up his cane, wore his hat and hobbled over to the Chanis Gate. At the Keeper\u2019s room, he saw the no longer frail Captain Dunn.After Dunn heard his recollection of what happened, he nodded indiscernibly.\u201cI\u2019ll report the matter to the higher ups and let the Holy Cathedral deal with it. Maybe they\u2019ll send people to the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range to take a look.\u201dKlein answered briefly in confirmation. Seeing that only Sleepless Kenley and the Captain were in the Keeper\u2019s room, he casually asked, \u201cAre Mr. Aiur and the others resting?\u201dDunn nodded and said, \u201cAiur and Borgia are at Saint Selena Cathedral. Lorotta is probably looking for a coffee shop.\u201d\u201cCoffee shop? Madam Lorotta hasn\u2019t recovered from her injuries, right?\u201d Klein asked in surprise.Dunn massaged his nose bridge and said with a laugh, \u201cLorotta has three hobbies\u2014coffee, dessert, and maidservants. She says she needs these three things to speed up her recovery.\u201d\u201cMaidservants?\u201d Klein asked, perplexed.Does Madam Lorotta have a particular fetish?Dunn shook his head helplessly and said, \u201cShe likes maidservants. Yeah, that\u2019s right. Furthermore, she likes ones with big breasts.\u201d\u201c\u2026She sure is weird.\u201d Klein had no idea what kind of expression he should show in response.Dunn didn\u2019t delay any further as he headed out the Keeper\u2019s room. As Klein watched his back, he silently waited for him to turn.Meanwhile, he noticed at the corner of his eye that Sleepless Kenley had fished out his pocket watch and opened it.Three, two, one\u2026 The moment Klein finished counting down silently, Dunn stopped and turned around.\u201cAnother thing I forgot. Klein, you went through a lot today. Once you relax, you\u2019ll feel exhausted. There\u2019s no need for you to be here in the afternoon. Go back and get some rest. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll submit the application listing the detailed losses.\u201d\u201cAlright. Don\u2019t worry too much about your killing of a Beyonder. Killing him was equivalent to saving more lives.\u201d\u201cAs a matter of fact, I\u2019m actually feeling much better.\u201d Klein silently exhaled.Dunn nodded slightly and just as he turned around, he smacked himself in the forehead.\u201cI\u2019ve also handed the Beyonder\u2019s sketch to Leonard. He and the police department are in charge of the follow up investigations. I believe that the Beyonder must\u2019ve rode on carriages, eaten food, and had somewhere to stay.\u201cWherever he goes, whatever he touches, whatever he leaves behind, even unconsciously, will serve as a silent witness against him. Emperor Roselle\u2019s words are truly sensible.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d Klein answered, stupefied.After the captain walked far away, he left the Keeper\u2019s room and slowly walked to the second floor.Along the way, he suddenly recalled something as he experienced an additional bout of fear.That suited clown claimed that the Secret Order controlled the corresponding Sequence pathway of Seers\u2026 Even if he was exaggerating and they didn\u2019t have the higher Sequence potion formulas, they definitely have the lower Sequence ones.It also means that they have a number of Seers.Then, wouldn\u2019t they divine that I killed the suited clown and secretly exact revenge against me?If they can\u2019t deal with the Nighthawks, can\u2019t they deal with me, a Seer without any direct measures against enemies?Klein stopped in the stairwell and began thinking about the problem seriously. Soon, he discovered that he was worrying over nothing.Firstly, the Secret Order doesn\u2019t know who are members of the Nighthawks.Secondly, even if they know one or two, they definitely wouldn\u2019t include a civilian staff member like me.Thirdly, under the present circumstances, unless they have a prophet, there\u2019s no way they can divine who the murderer is.He heaved a sigh of relief and left the Blackthorn Security Company. He took a public carriage back to Daffodil Street.Even though he hadn\u2019t eaten lunch yet, he still lacked the appetite.After entering his bedroom, Klein removed his damaged suit first. Then, he took off his half top hat, got into bed and tried to go to sleep.His mind remained active as though his entire existence couldn\u2019t relax. His mind wasn\u2019t repeating the scene of him shooting the suited clown to death, but of the scene of him moving the corpse, and that hair-raising experience.He no longer felt uncomfortable about killing for the first time, but more of a disgust when he thought about it.\u201cThis was probably Frye\u2019s goal. He hoped that I would approach the corpse and face it directly to overcome my trauma\u2026 But, even though the trauma from before is gone, I\u2019ve been traumatized by something new\u2026\u201d Klein gave a self-deprecating laugh as he gradually felt his nerves calm down.He had no idea when he dozed off, but when he woke up, his stomach was groaning in protest.\u201cI feel like I can eat an entire horse!\u201d Klein muttered as he looked at the sun setting in the west as though the sky was alit.Changing into old but comfortable casual clothes, he briskly walked to the first floor. Before he could consider what to make for dinner, he heard the door open.Melissa\u2026 The corners of his mouth curled up at the thought.Ever since she began taking the public carriage, his sister no longer returned home late.The key twisted as the door opened. Melissa walked in with her bag that contained her books and stationery.She looked at the kitchen and said, \u201cKlein, there\u2019s a letter for you. It\u2019s from your mentor.\u201dA letter from Mentor? Right. I wrote to him asking about the relevant historical situation of the Hornacis main peak\u2026 Klein was taken aback at first before he recalled the matter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He used a small letter opener to open the letter he received from his mentor.Melissa was sitting by the dining table at the time, working hard on a textbook problem, with the gas lamp for illumination. Benson was cradled in a single seater, reading Accountancy for Beginners.Klein found three pages in the letter that he read with both fear and anticipation.\u201c\u2026very happy to receive your letter. It reminds me of the good old days over the past few years. Unfortunately, Welch and Naya have left us forever\u2026\u201d\u201cI attended their burials separately and could feel their parents\u2019 anguish. The two of them were young adults who were supposed to have beautiful, bright futures ahead of them\u2026\u201d\u201cFate is always so unpredictable. No one can know what will happen to you next. I\u2019ve experienced more as I\u2019ve grown older, and I can increasingly sense the weakness and helplessness of humanity.\u201d\u201c\u2026Regarding the historical information revolving around the Hornacis main peak, I recall that the archaeologist, Mr. John Joseph, once published a monograph detailing it. It includes his accounts of his time at the Hornacis main peak. He discovered a few ancient buildings that are more than a thousand years old.\u201d\u201cWhat shames every historian and archaeologist is our inability to precisely date the era. We can only make a crude estimate based on the architecture style, the characteristics of the murals, and a few of the texts that we can decipher.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s quite unbelievable that such a tall mountain peak would have humans living there. Mr. Joseph has ample evidence to prove that those humans developed a civilization that they can call their own. As for the details, it is hard to fully describe them in this letter. I suggest you try borrowing this monograph from the Deweyville Library. Trust me, Sir Deweyville\u2019s donation to this library makes it have more books in its collection than the one built by the city government.\u201d\u201cThe monograph\u2019s title is Research of the Hornacis Main Peak\u2019s Relics. It is published by the Loen Publishing Firm.\u201d\u201cIn addition, there are some papers that discuss something of relevance. They are published in the journals\u2014New Archeology, Archeology Summary. The exact issue and journal volume is\u2026\u201d\u2026Klein read every word, and repeated the names of the monograph and paper names silently.Immediately afterwards, he found some paper and an envelope, as well as a fountain pen before penning his gratitude.\u201cMelissa, help me send this letter out. This is the money for the stamps.\u201d Klein placed the sealed envelope and more than enough money for the stamps on his sister\u2019s desk.Melissa took a glance and curled her lips.\u201cKlein, stamps don\u2019t cost that much.\u201d\u201cYes, stamps don\u2019t, but a girl should have some allowance.\u201d Klein replied with a smile. \u201cI believe Selena has mentioned this to you before.\u201dNoticing that Melissa was about to protest, he quickly added, \u201cIt can be used to buy the materials and tools you need.\u201d\u201cTools\u2026\u201d Melissa repeated softly again and again before casting her gaze back onto her books. \u201cAlright,\u201d she said as she nodded imperceptibly.The corners of Klein\u2019s mouth immediately curved upwards as he briskly walked back to the sofa.\u201cExcellent persuasion skills. You precisely pinpointed Melissa\u2019s weakness.\u201d Benson gave a thumbs up as he said with a suppressed laugh. Klein cleared his throat and said in all seriousness.\u201cThen how shall I persuade you? Your self-study should emphasize language and ancient literature. Of course, basic mathematics and logic are equally important.\u201dAccording to the curriculum of the public schools and grammar schools, as well as the material tested for in college admissions, Klein was very confident about the general direction in which the upcoming \u2018civil servant examinations\u2019 would focus on.Benson touched his hairline and said with a self-deprecating smile, \u201cI feel like a curly-haired baboon in front of those books.\u201d\u201cBut they\u2019re really useful,\u201d Klein said with a determined smile.At that moment, Melissa put down her fountain pen, stood up, and walked to the sofa.\u201cBenson, Klein. This Sunday is Selena\u2019s birthday. She and her parents wish to invite all of us to their place for a banquet. Are both of you free?\u201d\u201cShould be fine for me,\u201d Klein said after some thought.He could take the opportunity to be acquainted with his sister\u2019s friends. It could prevent him from being utterly clueless whenever something happened to her.\u201cMe too,\u201d Benson said as he combed his hairs with his fingers. \u201cIt looks like we\u2019ll have to think of a birthday present for Miss Selena.\u201dKlein smiled.\u201cThis should be left to Melissa. She knows Miss Selena better than us. Besides, what we need to do is what a gentleman ought to do\u2014pay for it.\u201d\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve heard someone describe laziness in such a pleasant manner,\u201d Benson said as he shook his head and chuckled.Klein returned with a smile.\u201cThis is the purpose of language and ancient literature.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Benson never expected Klein to return to the subject at hand; it left him momentary speechless.\u2026The next day, Klein wore his cheap formal suit and held his black inlaid silver cane as he climbed up the stairs and arrived at the Blackthorn Security Company\u2019s entrance. His tuxedo had already been sent to the tailors.Klein was just about to greet Rozanne when he saw Captain Dunn walk out of the partition.\u201cGood morning Klein. Did you have a good night\u2019s sleep?\u201d Dunn asked with concern.Klein answered honestly, \u201cBetter than I expected. I didn\u2019t even have nightmares. But I still feel heavy and a little disgusted when I recall it.\u201d\u201cVery good. I feel assured hearing that,\u201d Dunn said with a nodding smile.After chatting about the weather, he raised a matter.\u201cThe Holy Cathedral has replied to my telegram. Antigonus, Lorotta, and company are to immediately escort Sealed Artifact 2-049 and the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook back to Backlund. They\u2019ve also sent an additional Nighthawk yesterday afternoon via steam locomotive to help.\u201d\u201cI believe that they\u2019ve already set off by now.\u201dAlready set off by now? Does that mean I\u2019m completely free from the traumatizing Antigonus family\u2019s notebook? Klein was taken aback. He found it surreal as though he was dreaming.This is more relaxing than I imagined\u2026It\u2019s unlikely that there will be any follow up, right?\u201cMay the Goddess bless them and that they will have a smooth journey.\u201d After a few seconds of silence, Klein made a gesture on his chest in the sign of the crimson moon.Dunn wore his hat and pointed out the door.\u201cI have to patrol the Raphael Cemetery Garden. Heh, I forgot one thing. The investigations of Leonard and the police department has borne fruit. They found the carriage driver that drove them. We have confirmed their temporary residence in Tingen City, but they are rather cautious. They didn\u2019t leave behind any valuable clues.\u201d\u201cAs expected of an ancient secret organization,\u201d Klein echoed wistfully.Dunn nodded and turned to head to the door.He stopped three seconds later and turned his head.\u201cAlso, the Holy Cathedral needs another two to three days before they notify us of your application to become an official member. Heh heh, this is dealt with by a different department, separate from the one that deals with the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook. They have different levels of efficiency.\u201d\u201cI understand,\u201d Klein replied sincerely.Meanwhile, he helped his captain add inwardly.Remember to submit the compensation application today!Watching Dunn leave, Klein heard the brown-haired Rozanne exclaim.\u201cGoddess! Klein, are you becoming a formal member? You haven\u2019t even joined us for a month!\u201dKlein smiled.\u201cAfter I consumed the Seer potion, it was only a matter of time.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s reasonable\u2026\u201d Rozanne fell into a daze for a few seconds before suddenly sighing. \u201cI was praying that you finished your mysticism lessons so that you could be added to the roster for watching the armory, but\u2026 Goddess, I have to be on duty every two days. I\u2019m not a Sleepless! My skin, my state of mind. Goddess, save me!\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be very familiar to such a lifestyle? Before I joined, it has always been you, Bredt, and Old Neil who took turns, right?\u201d Klein asked, puzzled.Rozanne shook her head with a depressed look.\u201cNo, there were four previously, five even earlier. Unfortunately, Kenley chose to become a Sleepless. Viola did not choose to extend her contract last month and joined the Khoy Noel Machinery Company. She\u2019s a gifted girl when it comes to creation. She only lacked the opportunity and money. Five years as a civilian staff allowed her to have enough savings.\u201dHaving said this, Rozanne suddenly glanced at Klein and laughed with her mouth covered.\u201cI\u2019ve thought of a good solution. Klein, get married as soon as possible. Then, accidentally expose the secret of Beyonders to her. This is considered a very minor leak so there won\u2019t be any particularly heavy penalties. After all, who can lie to a person who shares the same bed with you over prolonged periods of time. You can introduce her to us when that happens make her a civilian staff member! What a perfect plan!\u201dThe corners of Klein\u2019s mouth twitched.\u201cMiss Rozanne, you can also quickly find a husband. It should be even easier. I believe you have the adequate means to divulge the secret to him.\u201dRozanne\u2019s eyes widened and her mouth turned agape when she heard him.\u201cHow can I? Marriage is a very serious matter. I have to carefully pick and observe him over a period of time to ensure that he\u2019s alright.\u201dThat\u2019s not what you said a second ago\u2026 Klein didn\u2019t bother engaging in sophistry with Rozanne. He smiled as he engaged in a little small talk before bidding farewell and heading underground.At the armory, he saw Old Neil wrestling with the handground coffee. So, he sat down and waited patiently.\u201cSoon you\u2019ll be an official member, right?\u201d Old Neil asked casually as he filtered the coffee.\u201cCaptain said that another two to three days are needed. It\u2019s still a question of whether the Holy Cathedral will approve of it,\u201d Klein said frankly.\u201cHehe.\u201d Old Neil chortled. \u201cThe Holy Cathedral won\u2019t deny cases like these, especially when you\u2019re already a Beyonder.\u201dWith that said, he turned his head and faced Klein. He said with a chuckle, \u201cYou must be mentally prepared. There\u2019s a ritual every official Nighthawk member has to undergo. They have to complete a mission independently. Of course, Dunn would definitely choose the easiest and simplest ones for a rookie. Besides, you\u2019re a support-type Seer.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only then will I get a pay rise\u2026Old Neil sniffed at the coffee and shot a glance at him.\u201cIt\u2019s only a ritual among Nighthawks. After all, we stand at the peak of Beyonder danger and don\u2019t want our teammates to act like children who require constant care. This won\u2019t affect the salary that you\u2019ll receive as an official member, or your privileges needed to fulfill your duty.\u201dSo it\u2019s just a ritual to gain the recognition of the other Nighthawks\u2026 But, Mr. Neil, why did you emphasize that it would not affect my pay grade as an official member\u2026 Did I make it that obvious? Klein touched his face and gave an embarrassed smile before asking, \u201cDoes it have to be a mission of the Beyonder variety?\u201d\u201cThat should be the case, but your performance yesterday was truly outstanding. You ingeniously killed a Beyonder that\u2019s at least at Sequence 8. I believe Frye, Royale, and the rest have already acknowledged you. Therefore, Dunn might just assign you to an ordinary mission,\u201d Old Neil said before suddenly sighing. \u201cYou\u2019ll have your salary increase several-fold. I\u2019ll never encounter something like that again in my lifetime.\u201dKlein chuckled as he raised the matter about his Sequence pathway.\u201cMr. Neil, do you think that the corresponding Sequence 8 of Seer is Clown?\u201dIn fact, thinking back to the description from the confidential documents, it did seem to add up.A job good at fighting with artifice\u2026\u201cI can\u2019t give you any guarantees, but I think it\u2019s highly likely. Firstly, it matches up with what\u2019s said on the documents. Their agile movement and deception based battle style are key points. Next, other Sequence pathways have similar situations. Do you know the corresponding Sequence 8 for Mystery Pryer?\u201d Old Neil asked with a chuckle.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not written in the information provided by the Church.\u201d Klein shook his head honestly.Old Neil chuckled briefly before saying, \u201cI\u2019m close friends with two old guys from the Machinery Hivemind. They mentioned it in passing, as a joke. The corresponding Sequence 8 potion of Mystery Pryer is Melee Scholar. Did you hear that? Melee Scholar. Goddess, I don\u2019t like melee combat at all. This doesn\u2019t suit the image of a Mystery Pryer at all!\u201d\u201cI can understand\u2026 Mystery Pryer\u2019s pursue the mysteries behind things. Melee combat is one of those mysteries,\u201d Klein said after some thought.Old Neil finished his handground coffee. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s not waste time. Let\u2019s continue our mysticism studies. You still have a lot of ritualist magic that you need to grasp. You also need to learn how to create amulets and charms.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein sat down and planned out his schedule for the day.In the morning I\u2019ll study mysticism and read through all sorts of historical records. I\u2019ll submit the compensation request. After lunch, I\u2019ll practice at the Shooting Club. Then, I\u2019ll head to the Deweyville Library at Golden Indus Borough and see if I can borrow the corresponding monograph and journal regarding the Hornacis main peak. After doing all that, if I have time, I\u2019ll spend some time at the Divination Club. I can\u2019t slack off on my \u201cacting.\u201dOnce the compensation request is approved and I receive the money, I\u2019ll be able to buy a new suit on the way home.Yes\u2026 I\u2019ll apply for the materials tomorrow morning and try to make a protective amulet to ward off danger for Melissa and Benson.\u2026In a dining hall adorned with a chandelier and elegant decorations.A few friends were congratulating Joyce Meyer on his escape from danger and his return to Tingen.\u201cWe all read the news. Just the written description alone was enough to scare me,\u201d a man with a short stubble on his chin said wistfully. \u201cJoyce, I can\u2019t believe you went through such an ordeal. Cheers. The tragedy is over now, and the sunlight shines down upon us. Exalted is the Steam.\u201dJoyce and his fianc\u00e9e, Anna, raised their cups and clinked them together with their friends. Then, they gulped down what little champagne they had left.\u201cAnna was extremely worried at the time. I suspect that she cried every night. Whenever I invited her for some afternoon tea, she was always absent minded. Thankfully, you\u2019re finally back now. Otherwise, I reckon she would\u2019ve passed away just like that,\u201d a young lady, with a cute small nose and coiled brown hair, said to Joyce as she glanced at Anna.\u201cIf Anna were to experience something like that, I\u2019d be the same. I might be in an even worse state.\u201d The aquiline-nosed Joyce gave his fianc\u00e9e, who was sitting beside him, a gentle look.Anna wasn\u2019t used to expressing her emotions in front of others. She looked at the opposite end of the table and said, \u201cBogda, why have you been keeping your head down this entire time? I can sense how terrible your mood is.\u201dThe young lady with a petite nose answered in Bogda\u2019s place.\u201cBogda is sick. The physician told him that there\u2019s something seriously wrong with his liver. He can only use medicine to reduce the pain but it doesn\u2019t treat his illness. He needs to undergo surgery.\u201d\u201cLord, when did this happen?\u201d Anna and Joyce asked in surprise and concern.Bogda was a young man with short hair, but his face was sallow. His usually brilliant red eyes were replaced with a dim glow.\u201cIt happened last week. Since Joyce wasn\u2019t back yet, I told Irene not to tell you,\u201d Bogda explained with a rueful smile.Joyce asked staidly, \u201cHave you decided when you\u2019ll undergo surgery?\u201dBogda\u2019s expression changed a few times as he said, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t decided yet. As you know, those surgeons are practically butchers. The patient is like a piece of meat on a chopping block, allowing them to butcher people as they please! I\u2019ve read a lot of reports. They\u2019ll even use an ax for amputation! Lord, I suspect I might very well die on the operating table.\u201d\u201cBut if you delay it further then surgery might not be able to save you,\u201d the man with a stubble said as he tried to persuade him.At that moment, Anna interjected, \u201cBogda, perhaps you can consider doing a divination. If the divination indicates that everything will go smoothly, then proceed with the surgery as soon as possible. If the outcome of the divination is bad, seek other means. Seek it with the help of the fortune-teller. I know of a real, mysterious fortune-teller. No, I should address him as a Seer. I believe he can definitely help you.\u201d\u201cFor real?\u201d Bogda returned with a question, clearly looking doubtful. Their other friends shared the same attitude.\u201cYes.\u201d Anna nodded without hesitation. \u201cI hired his divination services, and after divining Joyce\u2019s situation, he told me to return home. \u2018Your fianc\u00e9 is at home waiting for you.\u2019 Back then, I was like all of you, filled with doubt. But when I returned home, I really saw Joyce. He was really back!\u201d\u201cI can testify on this point,\u201d Joyce echoed.He didn\u2019t mention that he had sought Klein\u2019s help in interpreting his dreams. This was because the police had informed him that Tris hadn\u2019t been caught yet. Therefore, he had to keep it a secret in order to prevent revenge from being exacted upon him.\u201cLord, this is absolutely unbelievable!\u201d\u201cIs divination really that magical?\u201d\u2026Amidst the shouting, Bogda thought deeply for a moment before saying, \u201cPerhaps I should get a divination. Anna, Joyce, could you tell me the Seer\u2019s name and address?\u201dAnna heaved a sigh of relief and said, \u201cYou made a very wise choice.\u201d\u201cThat Seer is at the Divination Club at Howes Street.\u201cHis name is Klein Moretti.\u201d\u2026Golden Indus Borough. Deweyville Library.Klein used the introduction note from his mentor\u2019s letter to successfully apply for a borrowing pass.As he flipped the tiny card in his hand, he asked a few librarians, \u201cDo you have the Research of the Hornacis Main Peak\u2019s Relics here? It was published by the Loen Publishing Firm.\u201dA librarian immediately answered, \u201cPlease wait a moment. Let me check the records.\u201dHe turned around and looked at the drawers. He pulled open the letter that matched Hornacis and flipped through a card that was filled with single words that followed a particular order.On careful inspection, he shook his head and said, \u201cSorry, Sir. We do not have this book in our collection.\u201d\u201cHow regretful,\u201d Klein answered in clear disappointment.From the looks of it, I need to write to the Loen Publishing Firm or pay a visit to the Khoy University\u2026Meanwhile, he sighed inwardly at how dated the management of the libraries of this world was.You people need a computer. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t produce one\u2026 Klein made a silent, self-deprecating comment and turned to ask, \u201cThen, do you have the journal issues of New Archeology and Archeology Summary?\u201d\u201cWe do,\u201d the librarian confirmed. \u201cA gentleman just returned them.\u201dHe flipped out the corresponding card and pointed Klein in the direction of the bookshelf.Klein went over to the bookshelf, scanned the journal issues, and pulled out the ones his mentor mentioned.Then, he randomly found a spot by the window to sit down. Under the bright afternoon sun, he began reading the information in the library quietly.\u201c\u2026Ancient relics don\u2019t solely exist on the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range. They\u2019re also spread out across the surrounding forests, valleys, and gentle slopes around the main peak\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026These relics are formed from lofty domes and gigantic stone columns. Honestly, they can be be described as magnificent\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m curious as to how the original residents mine and process these rocks? Hypothetically, let\u2019s assume that they performed their mining operation on the spot without needing to send them up the mountain\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026There\u2019s a strange pattern where the relics become larger in size the closer you are to the mountain peak. But surprisingly, there are no ruins on the peak. According to our hypothesis, there should be palaces that don\u2019t resemble man-made buildings, divine halls used for sacrifices\u2026\u201dPalaces that don\u2019t look like they were man-made\u2026 divine halls used for sacrifices\u2026 Could it be the one that I saw in my dream? While Klein ruminated, he suddenly heard footsteps approaching him from a distance.He looked up and saw a familiar face, a face that often appeared on the papers.He had a squarish face, thick eyebrows, a firm nose, short dark-blond hair, azure-blue eyes, and tightly-closed lips. All of these features belonged to a certain famous person from Tingen City, a philanthropist, entrepreneur, and the owner of this library\u2014Sir Deweyville.Beside Deweyville was the middle-aged butler who Klein had met before.Klein watched them walk by from more than ten meters away. Out of curiosity, he raised his right hand and lightly tapped his glabella twice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He casually studied Sir Deweyville\u2019s condition.He\u2019s very healthy; there are almost no hidden problems\u2026 His emotional state is horrendous. Amid the dullness, there\u2019s frailty\u2026 His mental state is frail? He has trouble sleeping well? But the purple aura at his head is completely fine\u2026 Klein muttered silently to himself as Sir Deweyville walked off and left the library.Retracting his gaze, Klein pinched his forehead and sighed inwardly.Being a tycoon sure isn\u2019t easy\u2026He didn\u2019t pay much attention to the matter and returned his gaze onto the journal issues in front of him.Klein didn\u2019t find a lot of clues after reading each of them. He could only confirm a few things.Firstly, there existed an ancient kingdom on the Hornacis mountain range, as well as its surroundings. The ancient kingdom\u2019s history dated back to at least 1500 years. Secondly, their architectural style was primarily about being grand. They left behind all sorts of murals and from those murals, it could be deduced that they believed that the Evernight would protect the loved ones of the departed. Finally, in the ruins, there were symbols that represented the Evernight everywhere, but they were clearly different from the Evernight Sacred Emblem.\u201cIf I had a chance, no\u2014 even if I have a chance, I\u2019ll never go there!\u201d Klein muttered with clenched teeth. He vowed not to court death.After tidying the journal articles and returning them back to their original spots, he put on his hat, lifted his cane, and left the Deweyville library.\u2026Divination Club.Bogda looked at the beautiful lady in charge of receiving guests and said, \u201cI\u2019d like to have a divination.\u201dAngelica smiled politely and said, \u201cDo you have a preferred fortune-teller? Or would you like to flip through our introduction guide and choose the one that\u2019s most suitable for you?\u201dBogda pressed the right side of his abdomen and gasped silently for breath while saying, \u201cI wish to have Mr. Klein Moretti divine for me.\u201d\u201cBut Mr. Moretti is not here today,\u201d Angelica answered with uncertainty.Bogda fell silent for a moment as he paced a few steps and asked, \u201cWhen will Mr. Moretti be available?\u201d\u201cNo one knows. He has his own matters to deal with. From what I\u2019ve seen, he usually comes here on Monday afternoons,\u201d Angelica said as she pondered over the matter.\u201cAlright.\u201d Bogda\u2019s face darkened as he turned around, planning to leave.\u201cSir, you can choose other fortune-tellers as well. For example, you can choose Mr. Hanass Vincent who is famous in Tingen City,\u201d Angelica tried her best to prevent the loss of business.Bogda stopped in his tracks and considered it for a moment before saying, \u201cNo, I only trust Mr. Moretti. Well, can I wait here for a moment? Perhaps he might come after he\u2019s done with his matters.\u201d\u201cNo problem,\u201d Angelica said with a warm smile.Bogda went to the sofa and sat down. Sometimes he stroked his cane; at other times he looked out the window, clearly looking rather impatient.Seconds turned to minutes. Just as Bogda\u2019s mind was in a mess, unsure if he should continue waiting or leave, he heard the beautiful lady exclaim in pleasant surprise, \u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Moretti!\u201dKlein saw the familiar Angelica and was just about to ask why it was always her. Did she not need to rest or take any days off?However, he immediately took into consideration that he was a Seer, so it was not appropriate for him to ask such questions. Instead, he had to use the tone of a charlatan and say something like: \u201cHow marvelous it is for fate to compel us to meet once again, Madam Angelica.\u201dUh, would this sound like I\u2019m hitting on her? Klein\u2019s mind whirled as he finally replied with a smile, \u201cGood afternoon, Madam Angelica.\u201d\u201cA customer wishes to hire you for a divination.\u201d Angelica pointed to Bogda who had hurriedly stood up from the sofa.Someone actually requested for me? Klein took off his half top hat in pleasant surprise, pinching his glabella twice while doing so.\u201cGood afternoon, Sir\u2026\u201d He looked over when his voice suddenly came to a pause.In his Spirit Vision, he saw the requester\u2019s liver looking dim. It was nearly black in color. It was making the rest of his body unbalanced as his aura was thin in various places.Klein deliberated over his words and he said in a serious expression, \u201cSir, you should see a doctor and not seek a divination.\u201dBogda stood stunned on the spot as he immediately gave a pleasant look of surprise while muttering, \u201cHow fascinating\u2026\u201d\u201cAnna wasn\u2019t lying to me\u2026\u201d\u2026He hurriedly looked up at Klein in earnest.\u201cMr. Moretti, I\u2019ve already seen a doctor and might have to undergo surgery. However, I\u2019m frightened about the surgery. I would like to divine the outcome.\u201dThe surgery of this era is really fraught with danger\u2026 Although Emperor Roselle had given the impetus, this era still lacks most of the necessary technology\u2026 Klein didn\u2019t reject his request and nodded slightly.\u201cMy divination fee is eight pence. Is that fine?\u201d\u201cEight pence?\u201d Bogda exclaimed in surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re only charging eight pence?\u201dAccording to Anna\u2019s description, and the performance Mr. Moretti had just shown me, I\u2019m willing to pay at least a pound!Haven\u2019t you heard of small margins with large volume? Klein was embarrassed for a moment. After thinking for a few seconds, he calmly smiled and replied, \u201cIt is enough just being blessed with the ability to receive revelations from the divine and catch a glimpse of fate. Therefore, we must maintain our humility and suppress our greed. Only by doing so, can we continue being bestowed with our gifts.\u201d\u201cYou are a true seer.\u201d Bogda held his chest and bowed, his tone filled with sincerity.Upon receiving Bogda\u2019s praise and trust, Klein\u2019s spirituality seemed to relax. As for the description of his \u201cprinciples\u201d, it also gave him some new insight.\u201cMiss. Angelica, is Topaz available?\u201d He turned to the beautiful lady beside him.Angelica heaved a sigh of relief for Bogda as she smiled sweetly.\u201cYes.\u201dAfter entering the divination room, Klein instructed Bogda to lock the door. Then, he sat behind the table and pinched his forehead.\u201cShall we use tarot cards for the divination?\u201d he inquired with a smile.\u201cSpirit Dowsing\u201d was only suitable to determine matters related to him. As for drawing an astrolabe, it was too time consuming.\u201cI\u2019ll leave it up to you.\u201d Bogda had no objections.Therefore, Klein helped him shuffle and cut the deck before laying them out in an Intis formation.Thanks to his uniqueness as a Seer, Klein did not flip the other cards. Instead, he directly flipped the card that indicated the final result.\u201cA reversed Wheel of Fortune. Things will develop badly.\u201d he said solemnly as he shot a glance.The color in Bogda\u2019s face drained instantly and his lips trembled.\u201cIs it hopeless?\u201dAs Klein tried his best to think of a solution, he said, \u201cLet me try a different divination method. Please leave your ring behind. Next, write your date of birth on this piece of paper. Then, please wait outside quietly.\u201dInfluenced by his gentle and comforting tone, Bogda calmed down and followed the instructions by writing down the information and leaving his ring behind.As he watched Bogda leave, Klein wrote a sentence on the piece of paper.\u201cOutcome of Bogda Jones\u2019s surgery.\u201dHe picked up the ring and paper slip and leaned back into his seat before using a dream divination technique.In a blurry and distorted world, he gradually found himself, only to see the gentleman collapse with an ashen expression. He was covered in white cloth as he was pushed out of the quaking operating room.This time, Klein didn\u2019t encounter anything strange. He no longer felt the sense of being watched, so he quickly woke up. He knitted his brows tightly as he considered how he was going to inform Bogda about the outcome.The surgery may very well lead to death\u2026 I can try the restorative ritualistic magic I learned today\u2026 but that would expose the matter of Beyonders. Besides, I have to apply for Captain\u2019s approval first\u2026 Yeah, and I might not be able to treat such a severe disease\u2026 Klein was racking his brains when he suddenly thought of something.\u201cMr. Glacis\u2019s lung disease was treated by an apothecary. He said that the medicine was extremely miraculous\u2026 What was it? Right, Lawson Darkwade, 18 Vlad Street in East Borough. Lawson\u2019s Folk Herb Store!\u201d As he tried his best to memorize the address back then, Klein quickly remembered the details.He rapped the corners of the table and quickly made a decision.After using Spirit Dowsing to quickly determine if it was a good or bad idea, Klein walked out the door. When he saw Bogda stand up in a fluster, he returned his ring to him and said warmly with a smile, \u201cI found hope for you.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Bogda asked pleasantly surprised.Klein did not reply him as he continued talking.\u201cYour hope lies in the East Borough, on Vlad Street. It\u2019s related to the single term Lawson.\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t find it, come back here again on Monday at four in the afternoon.\u201d\u201cGood. Good.\u201d Bogda nodded as he repeated himself. He excitedly fished out his wallet and produced five pence and three pennies.He had done according to what Klein had said, without using tips to corrupt a true seer.The corners of Klein\u2019s lips twitched as he received the money, but he smiled brilliantly.\u201cI hope you will find hope as soon as possible.\u201dAfter Bogda left, he handed over the commission like the previous time and also gave Angelica tips, pretending as though he had collected a soli.\u2026East Borough. Vlad Street.Bogda walked from one end of the street to the other, repeating it three times until his liver started to ache.Finally, he determined that there was only one place that had anything to do with Lawson on the street. It was the Lawson\u2019s Folk Herb Store, numbered 18 on the street.Mustering his courage, he walked in and caught the smell of the various herbs. He saw that the owner of the shop had black but very short hair. His face was round and he looked to be in his thirties or forties.The boss\u2019s formal attire resembled that of a village witchdoctor. It was a deep black robe embroidered with all kinds of strange symbols.\u201cHello, do you have medicine that can treat my disease?\u201d Bogda asked politely.The boss raised his head and swept his deep blue eyes across Bogda and smiled.\u201cYour liver disease is very serious, but the premise of everything is whether you have the money. Do you have enough to pay for the medicine?\u201dHe can tell? Bogda suddenly felt a lot more confident as he nodded frantically.\u201cHow much is your medicine?\u201d\u201cTen pounds. It\u2019s a very fair price.\u201d The boss fished out a bag of herbs from under the counter and said, \u201cAdd sufficient water and boil it into medicine. After boiling it, add ten drops of fresh rooster blood, then drink it down immediately. This bag of herbs can be cooked thrice. You will be fine after three times.\u201dAs he spoke, he opened the yellowish-brown paper and threw in all sorts of strange herbs.It sounds extremely shady\u2026 Bogda gulped down his saliva and said, \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201dThe boss stared at him and immediately smiled.\u201cDo you still want something else? What about this bag? Once you recover from your liver disease, I can give you a guarantee that your wife will be very satisfied.\u201dHe chuckled as he took out a black-papered bag of herbs and suppressed his voice.\u201cThere\u2019s mummy powder inside\u2026 Trust me, a lot of aristocrats consume this stuff. They put it in their tea or boil it as soup.\u201d\u2026 Bogda\u2019s confidence in the boss wavered to the point of feeling disgusted.I believe in Mr. Moretti\u2026 He took a deep breath, fished out his wallet, and pulled out the two biggest notes from what little was left of his gold pounds.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was a classic scam written on the papers! When Bogda made this connection, he even began to suspect Klein a little. He even began suspecting Joyce and Anna.When a tracked carriage stopped in front of him, he looked at the herbs in his hand. Unable to bring himself to return, he entered the carriage with a heavy heart.\u2026Inside Lawson\u2019s Folk Herb Store.As the boss watched Bogda leave, he suddenly turned his head and shouted at the door where there was a pile of herbs, \u201cScharmaine, stop purchasing herbs from today.\u201d\u201cW-why, Master?\u201d A handsome-looking youth with disheveled hair walked out.The boss smiled and said, \u201cThis is the sixteenth customer that has come because of my fame. If this carries on, I believe the Nighthawks, the Machinery Hivemind, and the Mandated Punishers will notice me. When the time comes, I\u2019ll need to consider heading to other cities.\u201d\u201cThen, do we need to sublease this store?\u201d Scharmaine nodded in understanding as he asked with concern.The boss chuckled.\u201cIf you wish to stay, you can be the boss of this store. You are already capable at identifying herbs and concocting medicine. Of course, remember to deposit half of your monthly profits into my anonymous Backlund Bank account.\u201d\u201cBut, I haven\u2019t learned what you are really good at.\u201d Scharmaine was already sick of never staying in a city for more than a year, but he was unwilling to give up learning the magical formulas that his master was good at.The boss leisurely rocked himself in his seat.\u201cThat\u2019s not something you can learn just because you want to\u2026\u201d\u2026A blackish-green bubbling liquid appeared in front of Bogda\u2019s eyes. It smelled of stinking socks and the color that makes one want to puke made him deeply suspicious about everything he had done today.When the rooster blood was dropped into the medicine, Bogda\u2019s father looked at his son worriedly and said, \u201cI think surgery is the best option.\u201dThe few drops of rooster blood bubbled with the boiling liquid before vanishing. Bogda took a deep breath and said, \u201cIf this medicine is useless, I\u2019ll consider surgery.\u201d\u201cThe Lord will watch over you.\u201d Bogda\u2019s father gestured a triangular Sacred Emblem across his chest.By the time the boiling liquid had cooled down, Bogda had no intention of wasting the ten pounds. He raised his right hand and closed his eyes. Flicking his head back, he gulped down the medicine in one go.The pungent aroma that had the noxious smell of blood, swished around in his mouth as he nearly spat out everything he had just drank.That night, Bogda had an upset stomach. He went to the bathroom six times, and by the time the crimson moon vanished, he fell asleep groggily.After an unknown period of time had passed, he jolted awake, having dreamed that he was being reprimanded by his boss at work.\u201cThankfully, I took three days of annual leave. I don\u2019t have to rush to work.\u201d Bogda heaved a sigh of relief when he discovered that he felt a lot more spirited.This was in stark contrast to the sluggish state he was in for the past few weeks.Bogda subconsciously reached out and pressed the right side of his abdomen. He noticed that the region which previously hurt when under slight pressure felt normal. He only felt the pain from ordinary pressure.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me it was really effective? That apothecary was clearly just fooling me\u2026\u201d Bogda was both surprised and doubtful as he got out of bed. He stretched himself and felt his health returning to him.He fell silent for a very long while as he muttered, \u201cAccording to the apothecary, I still need to drink it twice. Once I\u2019m done drinking, I\u2019ll go to the hospital to get a check up from a doctor\u2026\u201cThat apothecary didn\u2019t tell me how many times I can drink a day\u2026\u201c\u2026I still think he\u2019s a cheat\u2026\u201d\u2026Inside the civilian staff office of the Blackthorn Security Company, from his prior request, Klein received a space where no one would disturb him.He held a carving knife and emitted his spirituality. He seriously carved the incantations and symbols onto two silver accessories.The incantation was a request to avoid disaster and was written in Hermes. The two mysticism symbols symbolized the Evernight Goddess as well as the Empress of Disaster and Horror.Aside from that, Klein also added the Path Number that corresponded to the Goddess, 7, and the magical characteristic.In addition to that, charms and amulets had to be engraved on both sides; and each side\u2019s symbols, incantations, and characteristics, their exact locations, or special formats was in the realm of mysticism. The ones that were spread amongst the ordinary populace were filled with mistakes.At that moment, Klein had a lot of damaged materials to his right. Through repeated practise, and only after he confirmed that he had enough practice, did he dare to begin creating the amulets for Benson and Melissa.As he calmed his mind, his spirituality spewed out from the tip of the carving knife. The number 7 appeared on the surface of the silver accessories.He had already finished carving the incantations and symbols on the other side of the accessory. All that was left was to finish the remaining side.After putting down his knife, all his spirituality chained together as Klein suddenly felt a strange, majestic, and terrifying energy surge throughout the room.The commotion quickly vanished as the incantations on both sides of the accessory became complete with Klein\u2019s Spirit Vision. It emitted a serene blackness.He put down his carving knife and gently polished the silver accessory that was formed from a circle and a vertical piece. He felt a tinge of coolness from the mild-to-the-touch surface.\u201cIt\u2019s done!\u201d He happily placed the finished amulet and another one that he had previously finished into his pocket, planning to find an opportunity to give it to Benson and Melissa.Amulets created by Beyonders possessed a certain level of effectiveness. They allowed the wearer to unknowingly avoid disasters to a certain extent, but it was nothing too ridiculous. Furthermore, their spirituality would wane bit by bit. Unless one used a high-level ritualistic magic and created a prayer set, a year was the maximum one could use them for. As for high-level ritualistic magic, there was a terrifyingly high spirituality requirement. It wasn\u2019t something Klein could endure at the moment.When the time comes, I can use my spirituality to make another one\u2026 Klein thought, nodding as he began tidying up the messy table.He didn\u2019t make one for himself for the moment, because an amulet of that level had limited effects on him. Therefore, his goal was to gain a deeper understanding of incantations before trying to pair it with ritualistic magic. That way he could create a few defensive amulets that could be activated specifically with sound.After everything was finished, Klein walked out the office and prepared to hand over the damaged materials. That was when he saw Captain Dunn walk over in his black windbreaker.Dunn\u2019s deep and gray eyes swept across him as he smiled.\u201cKlein, the Holy Cathedral has approved it. You\u2019re now an official member.\u201d\u201cReally? That\u2019s great!\u201d Klein expressed his delight.Dunn nodded and said with a smile, \u201cYou can now receive a make-up pay of three pounds for this week. You\u2019ll receive 4.50 pounds every subsequent week until the advance payment is cleared.\u201cBy the way, did I mention the Nighthawks\u2019 ritual?\u201cEvery official Nighthawk has to independently complete a mission. Only by doing so will you gain the recognition of your partners. In consideration of the outstanding performance you showed, I believe I can assign you an ordinary mission instead. When that happens, I\u2019ll formally introduce you to all the Nighthawks in Tingen City.\u201dKlein replied without hesitation, \u201cAlright!\u201dThree pounds plus his compensation of seven pounds. Getting a new suit wasn\u2019t a problem anymore!Furthermore, he would still have plenty left over!Well, who knows when my mission will arrive\u2026Klein waited all the way till Sunday, the day of Selena\u2019s birthday banquet.\u2026Changing into his formal suit and using a brush and handkerchief to tidy his half top hat, Klein looked himself in the mirror before walking over to the first floor in satisfaction.At that moment, Melissa was sizing up Benson\u2019s clothes.\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d Benson raised his cane, feeling a little lacking due to his sister\u2019s gaze.He felt that there was nothing wrong with him when he inspected himself. He was already dressed quite decently.Melissa stopped staring at him and said with a serious expression, \u201cBenson, that is a very old suit you\u2019re wearing.\u201d\u201cThere will be a lot of excellent ladies and madams participating in today\u2019s birthday banquet. I believe that by wearing that, it\u2019ll be a form of disrespect to them.\u201dKlein was originally filled with questions. However, when he heard Melissa\u2019s emphasis, he immediately realized what was happening. He went over with a chuckle and said, \u201cBenson and I share a similar build. He can wear my other tuxedo.\u201dHe had already informed his siblings about buying a new suit. He explained it away by saying that his clothes had been torn while inspecting certain objects. Therefore, the company generously compensated him. Of course, he concealed the matter of him being \u201cpromoted with a pay rise.\u201d He was afraid of scaring them and only planned to tell them after half a year.Such an explanation made Blackthorn Security Company and Melissa extremely envious. They felt that the Blackthorn Security Company was an impeccable employer.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to, right?\u201d Benson retorted, having not realized the gravity of the situation.\u201cNo, it\u2019s extremely important.\u201d Klein pushed Benson\u2019s shoulders up the stairs. \u201cMy tuxedo is hanging on the clothes rack.\u201dAfter watching Benson go up the stairs in a daze, Klein turned around and smiled at Melissa.\u201cAre you hoping that Benson will use the opportunity provided by Selena\u2019s birthday banquet to begin a beautiful new romance?\u201dHe had been reading quite a fair amount of newspapers and magazines recently. He knew that aristocrats and middle-class banquets were typically grounds for blind dates.Melissa nodded solemnly.\u201cYes, Benson has missed out too much because of us.\u201dSis, why are you like a mother\u2026 Klein looked at Melissa as he suddenly shook his head with an exasperated laugh.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He sized her up and said with a solemn expression, \u201cMelissa, I think you aren\u2019t showing enough respect to today\u2019s banquet as well.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Melissa wore a puzzled look.Klein pointed at her neck.\u201cAs a lady, you are lacking a necklace that accentuates that area.\u201dWithout waiting for his sister to say another word, he smiled as he fished out a silver amulet wrapped with angel wings from his pocket.\u201cThankfully, I prepared one for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Melissa was taken aback at first before she asked, \u201cHow much was it?\u201dSis, your concerns are really quite misplaced\u2026 Klein silently scoffed as he explained with a chuckle, \u201cIt\u2019s actually not very expensive. Since it was in an incomplete state, I imitated an item that I\u2019ve seen before and engraved blessing incantations and beautiful patterns on them.\u201d\u201cYou engraved them?\u201d Melissa was indeed distracted.\u201cHow is it? What do you think of my work?\u201d Klein took the opportunity to hand over the amulet to his sister.Melissa studied it before gently biting down on her lip.\u201cI like the surrounding angel feathers.\u201dIf you think the incantations and symbols I engraved are ugly then just say so. There\u2019s no need to mince your words\u2026 An amulet\u2019s value is in its effects! The corner of Klein\u2019s mouth twitched. Just as he was about to urge his sister to accept it, he saw Melissa put on the necklace with a forced expression on her face. She then carefully adjusted the positioning of the amulet.\u201cPerfect.\u201d Klein sized her up and gave her exaggerated praise.Melissa shot him a glance and looked down at her amulet. She said listlessly, \u201cKlein, you were never like that before. Acting like that\u2026\u201d\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s because of my good job. With a decent income, I\u2019ve become more confident.\u201d Klein interrupted his sister and gave a preemptive explanation.Sigh, even though I received the original Klein\u2019s memory fragments, making myself appear natural in most major aspects, certain fine details are still there. I\u2019m still used to presenting my real personality\u2026 Especially when I\u2019m getting closer and more familiar with Benson and Melissa\u2026 He sighed inwardly.Melissa seemed to accept his explanation and pouted her lips.\u201cIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re like that\u2026 really great\u2026\u201dAfter the two engaged in a short conversation, Benson came down having changed his clothes. He wore a white shirt with a black vested tuxedo. His black bowtie and a pair of long, straight trousers made it seem like he had undergone a complete makeover. It was like he was a successful businessman after years of hard work.Same for the receding hairline\u2026 Klein chuckled inwardly.\u201cExcellent, Benson. It suits you very well,\u201d he said with a brilliant smile while throwing up his hands.Melissa also nodded in agreement on the sideline.\u201cThe facts show that my clothing is more important than me.\u201d Benson gave a self-derisive comment.Klein took the opportunity to fish out the remaining amulet and repeated his explanation from earlier before saying, \u201cI also made one for you.\u201d\u201cNot bad. I\u2019ll bring it with me.\u201d Benson accepted it without a fuss as he quipped, \u201cKlein, I wouldn\u2019t find it odd, even if you were to suddenly know how to style your hair, make clothes, fix watches, and feed curly-haired baboons.\u201d\u201cLife is just so full of surprises,\u201d Klein replied with a smile.Following that, the siblings tidied themselves up before walking out the main door. They took a trackless public carriage and arrived at the North Borough\u2019s Fania Street where Selena\u2019s house was.The Wood family lived in a terrace house as well, but unlike Klein\u2019s place, they had a porch. They had a small lawn in the front which made it look very elegant.When they rung the doorbell, Klein, Benson, and Melissa only had to wait for around ten seconds before they were able to see the star of the day, Selena Wood.With a head covered in wine-red hair, the girl gave Melissa a delighted hug.\u201cI like this dress of yours. It makes you look exceptionally beautiful.\u201dStanding beside Selena Wood was her father, Mr. Wood, senior employee of Backlund Bank\u2019s Tingen branch.\u201cWelcome, our honorable elder brother. Welcome, our young historian.\u201d He deliberately addressed Benson and Klein in an exaggerated manner.Young historian\u2026 Why doesn\u2019t he add the description of me having a conscience?\u2026 Klein retorted as he took off his hat and replied with a smile, \u201cMr. Wood, you look much more spirited and younger than I imagined.\u201dHis style of flattery had unknowingly inclined himself to the Foodaholic Empire.Benson held out his hand and shook Wood\u2019s hand.\u201cI know a lot of bank employees, but they\u2019re all equally arrogant and stiff, as though they\u2019re the latest machines. None of them are as civilized as you.\u201d\u201cIf you were to meet me at the bank, you might not say that about me.\u201d Wood laughed cheerfully.After exchanging pleasantries, Selena, who was wearing a new dress, led the siblings inside with a hop in her step. At times, she would mention in her usual tone that, \u201cElizabeth is already here,\u201d and at other times, she would suppress her voice saying, \u201cMelissa, your brothers are more handsome than I imagined.\u201dHey, I have good hearing\u2026 Although you are flattering me\u2026 Klein helplessly looked at the two sixteen-year-old girls walking ahead of him.This isn\u2019t right. I\u2019m still quite far from being considered handsome\u2026 Tsk, Miss Selena, how ugly did you imagine Benson and I to be? A balding, gloomy, fat man with a pale expression and lifeless eyes? Klein pinched his glabella in passing as he diligently practiced his Spirit Vision.Miss Selena Wood is healthy. She\u2019s excited and very happy\u2026 Mr. Wood\u2019s lungs are a little problematic. Right, I see his pipe\u2026 Klein swept his gaze across the crowd while in a good mood.\u201cElizabeth, Melissa is here.\u201d At that moment, Selena introduced with a brisk tone.A girl dressed in a blue frilly dress walked over. She had naturally curled brown hair and adorable baby fat.Klein was stunned when he saw her because he knew the girl.He had helped her choose an amulet back at the underground market!Elizabeth greeted Melissa first before looking at Benson and Klein.She was stunned and her brows knitted slightly, as though she was thinking about something.Soon, Elizabeth smiled and politely greeted them as though nothing had happened.Klein also pretended not to recognize her. Under Wood\u2019s lead, they came to the sofa in the living room where they were introduced to Chris\u2014Selena Wood\u2019s brother\u2014and the other guests.As Klein watched Benson chat with Chris and the other solicitors happily over the topic of their neighbor, Mr. Shaud, he couldn\u2019t help but feel envious.I don\u2019t have such socializing skills\u2026 He picked up a cocktail from a table in the corner of the room as he listened quietly. At times, he would nod and echo with a smile.It didn\u2019t take long before all the guests arrived and the banquet officially began.As too many guests had been invited, the Wood family\u2019s dining table could not accommodate everyone. Therefore, the banquet was done in a buffet manner. The maidservant served the steak dishes, roast chicken, fried fish, mashed potatoes, etc and placed them on different tables. The male servants were responsible for carving the meat, allowing for guests to take what they wanted.Klein couldn\u2019t help but click his tongue when he saw the elegant enamel plates and silver cutlery. He felt that the Woods were being too extravagant as a middle-class family.Since they\u2019re so rich, why would Chris need so many years to prepare for his wedding?\u201d When he thought of what his sister had previously mentioned, he was puzzled. \u201cYeah, it was probably to save up money to buy this cutlery that would have taken them so many years to afford. To such families, they have to look respectable!Amidst his mixed emotions, Klein picked up a plate and walked in front of a dining table. He forked a piece of honey-glazed roasted meat.At that moment, Elizabeth with her adorable baby fat cheeks came over. As she looked at the food, she whispered, \u201cSo you are Melissa\u2019s brother\u2026 Thank you. Selena likes the amulet I gave her a lot. She said that she felt healthier the moment she wore it.\u201dSelena\u2026 Amulet\u2026 Klein suddenly recalled the reason for selecting an amulet for the girl beside him.It was to give to a friend who liked mysticism as a birthday gift!That friend was Selena? Selena liked items related to mysticism? Klein frowned slightly as he smiled politely.\u201cIt might just be akin to a placebo effect.\u201dAfter saying that, he began waiting for her to praise Emperor Roselle.However, Elizabeth\u2019s reaction was that of confusion.\u201cWhat\u2019s a placebo effect?\u201d\u201cIt means it\u2019s completely psychological. At times, we believe that we will turn for the better and end up really becoming better,\u201d Klein explained crudely.\u201cNo, she said it\u2019s different from the amulets that she bought in the past. It feels different,\u201d Elizabeth emphasized.She cocked her head and shot a glance at Klein and said curiously, \u201cI never expected Melissa\u2019s brother to be an expert at mysticism.\u201d\u201cAs you know, I studied history, so it\u2019s common to encounter similar matters.\u201d Klein diverted the topic skillfully as he asked, \u201cAre you also studying at the Tingen Technical School?\u201d\u201cNo, Selena and I were Melissa\u2019s former schoolmates. Later, she went to a technical school. I study at the nearby Ivos Public School,\u201d Elizabeth explained seriously.A public school wasn\u2019t established and maintained by the government. Instead, it was a school that accepted students from the public. It was an evolution of good grammar schools whose goal was to groom graduates so as to enter university. The schools were rather expensive and they would consider the students\u2019 family background. It could even be out the of range of typical middle-class families.She didn\u2019t talk much. After choosing her food, she returned to Selena\u2019s side.After congratulating the star of the day on a happy birthday, the banquet gradually came to an end. Klein and Benson were invited to a game of Texas hold\u2019em. The small blind was half a penny, and the big blind was a penny. As for Melissa, Elizabeth, Selena, and their friends, they went upstairs. It was unknown if they were chatting or playing games.Klein\u2019s luck was pretty bad. He played about twenty rounds, but didn\u2019t receive a good hand at all. All he could do was fold and be a spectator.When he flipped the ends of his cards again, he found a Two of Hearts and a Five of Spades.\u201cShall I try a bluff once?\u201d Klein considered for a moment, but did not manage to muster the courage. He also resisted the urge to use divination to cheat.He covered his cards and rapped the table, indicating that he was not making a call. Then, he got up and left the table to head for the bathroom.Roselle was also a person with a obsessive-compulsive disorder. He actually found an odd reason to name the play style Texas\u2026 Klein shook his head as he proceeded forward.At that moment, he suddenly came to a halt as his pupils constricted.His spiritual perception told him that there was a strange fluctuation upstairs!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Shortly afterwards, Klein even suspected that he was hallucinating.If he wasn\u2019t considered rather skilled at spiritual perception, it was very likely that he would\u2019ve written off the abnormality.Klein frowned as he thought of his sister upstairs. He tightly held onto his cane as he went around the bathroom and hobbled to the Wood household\u2019s staircase.He quickly went upstairs while following the traces with his spiritual perception before arriving at the living room beside the balcony.This should be it\u2026 Klein mumbled as he raised his hand and tapped twice on his glabella.Auras penetrated the walls and the large wooden door before entering his vision. Most of the colors were ordinary with a blurry outline.However, one of them in particular was rippling with a sinister dark green color over its surface that slowly corroded inwards.Just as I thought, something wasn\u2019t right. Klein wore an usually stern expression as he reached out with his right hand and removed the silver chain which was wrapped around his left wrist.He held the silver chain in his left hand, allowing the topaz to dangle before him.When the topaz stopped swinging, he traced the spherical light and chanted inwardly, \u201cThe room before me has danger caused by the supernatural.\u201dNormally, spirit dowsing was only suitable for divining something that was related to him or the specific circumstances in a small region around him. As such, Klein described the chant in very specific manner\u2014the \u2018danger\u2019 could affect him and the room was right in front of him.\u2026\u201cThe room before me has danger caused by the supernatural.\u201dAfter repeating the chant seven times, Klein eyes widened as he saw the topaz rotating in a clockwise motion rapidly.It was an indication that there was indeed danger caused by the supernatural inside the room, and it was of considerable danger!Selena is a mysticism enthusiast. Did something go extremely wrong when she was dabbling with some sort of ritual? What should I do? Klein massaged his brows and wrapped the chain around his wrist before knocking on the door.Thump! Thump! Thump!He knocked on the door three times rhythmically and wore an amiable smile on his face.The door opened with a creak. Melissa, who was wearing her new dress, appeared in front of Klein.\u201cKlein, is something wrong?\u201d The girl didn\u2019t expect her brother to be here, so she was momentarily surprised.Klein responded with a smile, without any sign of distress.\u201cI was just curious since I heard you gals enjoying yourselves.\u201d\u201cSorry for disturbing all of you.\u201d Melissa lowered her head in apology, feeling somewhat embarrassed. \u201cWe\u2019re playing with magic mirror divination. Selena knows a lot and it\u2019s very fun.\u201dMagic mirror divination\u2026 Sis, why don\u2019t you gals play Charlie Charlie\u00a0challenge <sup>1</sup> or Ouija\u00a0boards <sup>2</sup> ? Klein shook his head, feeling both peeved and amused.He looked behind Melissa and into the living room. He saw Selena with her beaming smile and deep dimples.However, in his spirit vision, the wine-red haired girl, who was holding a silver-coated mirror, was being encroached by the sinister dark green colors.As his mind whirled, Klein deliberated over his words and said, \u201cHeh heh, I won\u2019t be interrupting your game. Ah, right. Where\u2019s Elizabeth? I had chatted with her over Feysac grammar. She mentioned that she wanted to ask me some questions.\u201d\u201cElizabeth?\u201d Melissa sized her brother up and said in an eccentric tone to emphasize her words. \u201cShe\u2019s only 16.\u201dHey, don\u2019t let your imagination go wild! Klein immediately explained, \u201cIt\u2019s a very normal academic discussion. Elizabeth is very interested in history and ancient languages.\u201dMelissa took a deep look at her brother before saying, \u201cShe\u2019s inside. I\u2019ll inform her.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein took a step back and moved away from the door.While watching his sister turn around, he heaved a sigh of relief. Although it wasn\u2019t the best of reactions, he was thankful that the person in a danger wasn\u2019t Melissa.He only waited for about ten seconds before a puzzled Elizabeth walked out. She asked curiously, \u201cMr. Moretti, what\u2019s the matter? I never said I was interested in history and ancient languages\u2026\u201dAt that moment, her sentence was halted by Klein\u2019s stern and solemn expression. Her nerves tightened as she seemed to sense that something wasn\u2019t right.Klein took a few steps diagonally as a gesture for Elizabeth to hide partially behind the door.The girl with the chubby baby fat was influenced by the sudden serious atmosphere so she unknowingly followed.\u201cAs you know, I\u2019m a mysticism enthusiast.\u201d Klein halted and turned around, speaking directly to the point.Elizabeth nodded and replied, \u201cYes, I even believe that you\u2019re an expert at mysticism.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m only an enthusiast, but this doesn\u2019t stop me from noticing that your magic mirror divination has turned into a problem,\u201d Klein said with a heavy tone.\u201cA problem?\u201d Elizabeth nearly raised her voice as she hurriedly raised her hands to cover her mouth.Klein thought for a moment before saying, \u201cI know words alone will make it difficult for you to believe me. Return to the room and when Selena isn\u2019t paying attention, steal a glance at the front of the mirror which Selena has hidden away from all of you.\u201d\u201cHow do you know that she hid the front of the mirror from us?\u201d Elizabeth blurted out.According to the information from the Nighthawks, more than ninety percent of the time, magic mirror divination cases which involve evil share such similarities\u2026 Klein smiled and said, \u201cGeneral knowledge.\u201dWhen the doubtful and frightened Elizabeth returned to the room, his composed smile vanished instantly. His face looked worried.Even though we\u2019re all in the North Borough, to go from Fania Street to Zouteland Street will take at least 15 minutes of travel by public carriage. By the time Captain arrives after making a round trip, the situation might have deteriorated to a hopeless state\u2026 If only Benson and Melissa wasn\u2019t here\u2026 But I can\u2019t deal with those hidden and unknown existences\u2026 Do I have any means to contain it\u2026 Right, Selena is a mysticism enthusiast. Her room definitely has no lack of pure dew, essential oils, herbs, and other items\u2026Just as Klein was racking his brains for a solution, Elizabeth sat next to Selena by using an excuse of discussing something with her.A girl opposite her sipped a mouthful of red wine, and under the teasing looks of everyone, despite her blushing, she mustered her courage to ask, \u201cCan you help me divine when I\u2019ll meet a romantic and handsome gentleman?\u201dSelena lightly coughed twice as she rubbed the mirror\u2019s back and said, \u201cMirror, mirror, tell me. When will the gentleman in Yonina\u2019s heart appear?\u201dAfter repeating it three times, she picked up the mirror and raised it in front of her.Seizing this opportunity, Elizabeth suddenly turned her body and stretched out her head to take a glance.According to her expectations, she felt that she would see Selena\u2019s face and half her face.However, the only thing she saw was Selena.The tiny mirror only had Selena, and it was Selena\u2019s entire body!The mirror was completely pitch-black, with Selena standing in the middle with a cold expression!Elizabeth trembled all over as she lunged backward and leaned against the sofa. She momentarily forgot to breathe.She involuntarily trembled and without giving an excuse, got up immediately, stumbling to the door. She didn\u2019t even dare to turn back to look at the beaming Selena.\u201cYonina\u2019s gentleman will appear on the Sunday of the second week, half a year later\u2026\u201dAmidst giggles, Elizabeth opened the door and left the room to see Klein who was standing in the shadows of the wall lamps in his tuxedo and half top hat.\u201cMr. Moretti, I-I\u2026\u201d she stammered in a daze.Klein calmly smiled.\u201cDon\u2019t disturb the girls and ladies inside.\u201dInfected by his smile, Elizabeth calmed down significantly. She extended her hand and closed the door as she quickly walked over to the wall lamp.\u201cI saw it. I saw only Selena inside the mirror. A devil-like Selena\u2026\u201d she whispered hoarsely.Indeed\u2026 Klein\u2019s expression turned serious as he asked in a deep voice.\u201cDo you know which is Selena\u2019s bedroom? Do you know where her mysticism items are?\u201d\u201cThere. The mysticism items are in there as well.\u201d Elizabeth didn\u2019t hesitate to point at a room diagonally across.Klein held his cane and walked over, opening the unlocked wooden door. Under the streetlights and the crimson moon\u2019s illumination, he turned a valve and lit a gas lamp.A pale yellow light glowed as he swept the area and found bottles of pure dew, flower essence, boxes of herbal powder, candles and amulets.These items were placed on tables or neatly arranged inside a rack. Their names were given on sticker labels.After confirming the items, Klein said to Elizabeth who had followed behind him, \u201cDo you want to save Selena?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Elizabeth subconsciously nodded before asking in a daze, \u201cWill it be dangerous?\u201d\u201cA certain amount. After all, I\u2019m only a mysticism enthusiast,\u201d Klein replied frankly.\u201cA certain amount of danger\u2026\u201d Elizabeth pursed her lips tightly for a few seconds before saying, \u201cIs there anything you need from me?\u201dKlein smiled warmly as he comforted her, \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. Now, all you have to do is pretend to return as though nothing had happened. Return to Selena\u2019s side. Five minutes later\u2014remember\u2014five minutes later, tell Selena that you have a pleasant surprise and bring her to me. Knock on the door softly, one long knock and two short ones. Following that, well\u2014leave it to me.\u201dElizabeth thought over it silently before nodding seriously.\u201cAlright.\u201dSeeing her return to the living room, Klein glanced at his pocket watch. He closed Selena\u2019s bedroom and quickly cleared the desk. Then, he picked the items needed and placed them on a chair.Immediately following that, he picked up two faint candles with a light aroma. He placed them on the upper left and right corners of the desk.They were symbols representing the Lady of Crimson and the Empress of Disaster and Horror.Klein planned on holding a ritual here to borrow the Evernight Goddess\u2019s powers to ward off the mysterious and unknown existence that was affecting Selena!As he was only a Sequence 9, the ritualistic magic he knew wasn\u2019t strong enough. In order to succeed, he needed Elizabeth to lure Selena into a sealing circle, right in the vicinity of the altar!Therefore, he needed to consider situations in which Selena might notice and resist!Due to these reasons, Klein planned on using suspension-style ritualistic magic.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 - PrayerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 86: PrayerTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosSuspension-style ritualistic magic referred to the termination of a ritual according to the Beyonder\u2019s judgment. They could finish other matters first before returning to continue the ritual. Even by doing so, it was still possible to gain the desired effects.This was a technique produced over 1000 years of ritualistic magic development. After all, many high-level ritualistic magic required multiple steps. The duration ranged from an hour to half a day before finishing. It was difficult to ensure that no one disturbed them during the entire process or that there wouldn\u2019t be any accidents.After gaining lessons from various predecessors through blood and tears, gaining feedback through each failure, being able to suspend ritualistic magic became mainstream at the higher levels while it also indirectly affected the lower level rituals.However, being able to suspend a ritual didn\u2019t mean that the ritual could be suspended at any time. One had to abide by mysticism theory and grasp the corresponding technique. If not, the failure of the ritual was unavoidable. it could even result in a terrifying backlash effect.Based on Klein\u2019s understanding, once one gained the attention of a particular divinity, and the divinity was waiting on the contents of the request, to suddenly say, \u201cWait, I need to use the bathroom,\u201d one can only be congratulated since they might never need to go to the bathroom ever again.Phew\u2026 Klein heaved a sigh of relief as he composed himself.Even though he had held many luck-enhancement rituals and had even designed a corresponding ritual that made an attempt at Justice and The Hanged Man, this was his first actual ritualistic magic that abided by the rules.After looking at the silver-inlaid cane by the side of the bed, Klein picked up the third candle and placed it in the middle of the desk to represent himself.He placed the silver bowl that Selena used for rituals in front of the third candle and replaced the ax with a Sacred Emblem. On the left were the pure dew and essential oils of the Moon flower, Slumber flower, and other plants. While on the right, he placed a plate of salt, a small silver dagger, a piece of fake goatskin, and a quill that was dipped in ink.Luckily, Selena had a complete inventory; otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have had any way to complete the preparations. As for the moderately fast rituals that Old Neil could perform, they were not something a Seer could do\u2026From the looks of it, Selena was quite an experienced mysticism enthusiast. Yes, if she wasn\u2019t experienced then she wouldn\u2019t have gotten into such trouble\u2026 She was only 16 and had been exposed to all of this for at least a year\u2026 Who had guided her? Ideas flashed through his mind as he picked up Selena\u2019s cup from the bed. He poured plain water into it and placed it beside the coarse salt.He took out his pocket watch and popped it open. He didn\u2019t delay any further after taking a glance at it. He traced layers of the spherical light in his mind and quickly entered meditation.The room that was filled with floral fragrance, was suddenly subject to a formless whirlwind. Klein put away his pocket watch and his eyes suddenly turned darker, from brown to black, as though he could see through one\u2019s soul.He extended his palm and laid it against the candle on the top right corner. He chanted inwardly, \u201cEvernight Goddess, you are the Lady of Crimson!\u201dAs Klein chanted, he extended his spirituality and rubbed the candle wick. After a couple of moments, the candle suddenly lit up, and there was a tranquil blue inside the dim yellow light.\u201cEvernight Goddess, you are the Empress of Disaster and Horror!\u201dJust like he did before, Klein successfully lit up the second candle on the top left corner.\u201cI am your loyal guard; the shield that fends against danger in the dark night, and the long spear that stabs at evil in the silence!\u201dWhoosh!The third candle that symbolized Klein began to burn.The flame was still. He picked up the small silver knife and mimicked Old Neil\u2019s motions. He used incantations, coarse salt, and plain water to fulfill the purification.Then, he let his spirituality that he had gathered spewed out from the tip of the silver dagger, and naturally merged them as one.With the silver knife in hand, Klein walked around the bedroom\u2014kneeling when he came to the bed\u2014and sealed the area with a formless barrier.The light from the street lamp outside the window suddenly disappeared, but the red light was still shining through quietly.Klein returned to the study desk and picked up the quill. With spirituality and ink, he drew incantations and symbols to ward off disaster.When all of that was finished, he put down the things he was holding. Then, he trickled a drop of pure dew, flower essence, and essential oils on each of the three candles.Sizzle!A faint fog filled the room which suddenly possessed an additional hint of mystery.Next, he burned a few types of herbs before taking a step back from the mixture of fragrances and began reciting the corresponding incantation in the suspension ritualistic magic.\u201cNobler than the stars and more eternal than eternity, the Evernight Goddess.\u201cI pray for your loving grace.\u201cI pray for you to show your loving grace to a devout believer of yours.\u201cI pray for the power of the Crimson.\u201cI pray for the powers of Disaster and Horror.\u201cI pray that you will cleanse your devout believer, Selena Wood, from evil\u2019s corruption and be safe from danger.\u201cI pray that you would wait for a moment, a moment for that unfortunate girl.\u201d\u2026\u201cMoon flower, a herb that belongs to the red moon, please bestow your powers to my incantation!\u201cSlumber flower, a herb that belongs to the red moon, please bestow your powers to my incantation!\u201d\u2026After reciting the incantation, Klein closed his eyes and repeated it seven times in his heart.He saw that there was nothing out of the ordinary at the altar. He then lifted the silver dagger again and took a few steps back to the door of Selena\u2019s bedroom.He tapped his chest in four spots, forming the shape of the crimson moon. He then turned around and raised his silver dagger.His spirituality spewed out from the tip once again and sliced open the shape of a door in the formless wall.Klein knew that even if he opened the door at that very moment, it wouldn\u2019t affect the tranquility and holiness of the altar.He took out his silver vine-leaf pocket watch that had a intricate pattern. He checked the time and went through the process that was to happen in a few moments.\u2026In the living room on the second floor.Elizabeth\u2019s body was quivering as she lifted her head from time to time to check the wall clock. She was counting down in silence under the illumination of the two gas lamps.\u201cIt\u2019s almost time\u2026\u201d As she spoke softly, she looked sideways at the lively girl with long wine-red hair. Her dimples were deep, her smile was bright, and she gossiped well with all the friends around her.But the more everything looked normal, the more terrified Elizabeth felt. The cold and horrifying Selena in the mirror seemed to be in her head, and she couldn\u2019t wipe the image away.I can\u2019t wait anymore! I have to take action now! Elizabeth suddenly stood up. Before everyone\u2019s shocked gazes, she smiled and stuttered, \u201cSelena, I-I have a surprise for y-you. Follow me out for a bit.\u201d\u201cReally? Didn\u2019t you give me a birthday present already?\u201d Selena flipped the mirror the other way around and stood up in surprise.\u201cA surprise will n-not have any signs.\u201d Elizabeth felt that she had no talent in acting at all.Without saying another word, she walked toward the bedroom door first. Selena followed behind with a confused smile.Melissa looked at her two best friends leaving, and unconsciously knitted her eyebrows.Elizabeth is acting so strange today\u2026She started acting even stranger after she met Klein\u2026She suddenly ran out earlier and said that she needed to use the bathroom, but why did she look so anxious?\u2026Selena\u2019s bedroom entrance.Elizabeth took a deep breath and said to the girl in front of her, \u201cLet\u2019s go to your room.\u201d\u201cElizabeth, you seem very nervous and afraid. Why?\u201d Selena looked puzzled at her good friend as she noticed her body trembling constantly.\u201cExcitement! Yes, excitement!\u201d Elizabeth shot a glance at the mirror in Selena\u2019s hand as she turned half her body around to knock on the door with a long knock followed by two short successive ones.\u201cWhy are you knocking on the door\u2026\u201d Selena was baffled even more.Creak. Her bedroom door opened. Dressed in his black tuxedo and half top hat, Klein appeared in front of the two girls.\u201cPleasant surprise? This is a pleasant surprise?\u201d Selena\u2019s mouth turned agape as she felt perplexed.At that moment, Klein suddenly reached out his hand and grabbed her by the wrist. He pulled her into the room as Elizabeth stood rooted to the ground.Simultaneously, Klein\u2019s silver dagger struck forward as it spewed out his spirituality which quickly mended the door-shaped passage.The invisible spirituality wall sealed off the room, insulating Selena\u2019s screams within.Bang!Klein suddenly closed the door and without even looking at Selena, he rushed to the desk.The wine-red haired girl stopped screaming as she looked up and surveyed the room.Her gaze rapidly turned cold as her skin was mottled with paleness. Her fingers rapidly grew sharp fingernails.And at this moment, Klein had already returned to his Cogitation state. He trickled a drop of Moon flower and essential oil onto each candle as he chanted loudly, \u201cSupreme Lady of Crimson, Great Empress of Disaster and Horror.\u201cI pray for you to bestow your loving grace.\u201cShow your loving grace to the lost lamb, Selena Wood!\u201dWhile chanting, he picked up the fake goatskin and pushed it onto the candle representing the requester.Whoosh!He felt a cold wind blow behind him as an immense energy assaulted his body.The goat skin was ignited and Klein threw it into a silver bowl. Then, he crouched downwards in accordance to his preparations to dodge the lethal strike.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!The wind howled ferociously, and Klein felt the uncontrolled outpour of his spirituality surging like the currents.He saw the goatskin burning in the tiny silver bowl, burning in silent darkness, and he heard heavy items landing on the ground behind him.Bam! Bang!The two sounds followed one after another with almost no breaks in between. Wisps of dark green gases plunged into the silver bowl and vanished into the illusory darkness.Klein rolled to the side and got up. He drew his revolver from his armpit holster. However, he saw that the adorable red-haired girl Selena had fallen to the ground and the silver-coated mirror had shattered into countless broken pieces on the carpet.Those shattered pieces didn\u2019t reflect Selena, but showed the ceiling and Klein\u2019s silhouette.Then, through the Spirit Vision he had left active, Klein saw the wicked dark green in Selena\u2019s aura had vanished completely. Everything returned to normal, but she seemed more frail.Phew\u2026 He had just relaxed when he felt a sharp, throbbing pain in his glabella and head.The sharp pain spread all over his body and made him want to roll around on the floor.Klein held his fists tight, and the veins on the back of his hands popped and became black. They looked like moving worms.Simultaneously, he heard silent screams and the whispers that ripped at his mind.It took him nearly twenty seconds to survive the ordeal. His forehead and vest was soaked in cold sweat.The ritualistic magic I used sucked up all my spirituality and almost made my Beyonder powers lose control? Klein made a rough guess of the situation.That also made him notice that he had digested quite a bit of the remaining energy in the potion. Based on his calculations, if he had the strength at the time he consumed the potion, he believed that there was no way he could have survived the ordeal. He could have become a monster straightaway.\u201cActing\u201d is quite effective after all\u2026 Klein tapped his glabella and wiped away his sweat.He turned towards the altar, tapped his chest four times, and said out loudly, \u201cPraise the Lady!\u201dFollowing that, he extinguished the candles and quickly tidied up the altar.Finally, he placed the items back into the desk and used his silver dagger to dispel the spirituality wall seal.Whoosh!The sound of the wind echoed before subsiding. Klein let out a long sigh of relief and felt a sense of lingering fear.\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t walked through the process beforehand and successfully completed the ritual then things would have become troublesome\u2026 Besides, I still don\u2019t know who my opponent or enemy is\u2026 Thankfully\u2014yes\u2014thankfully, the room was carpeted, so I didn\u2019t damage my clothes while rolling\u2026\u201dHe shook his head and reached out to open the wooden door to Selena\u2019s bedroom.\u201cHow was it?\u201d Elizabeth took two steps back and asked nervously.Klein looked at her terrified expression and took off his half top hat before saying with a warm smile, \u201cI\u2019ve already corrected the mistake of her magic mirror divination. It\u2019s been resolved now.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Either way, Elizabeth didn\u2019t doubt him any more. She patted her chest and heaved a sigh of relief.\u201cThank you. You truly are a trustworthy gentleman. I was scared senseless just now.\u201cHow is Selena? Is she fine now?\u201d\u201cShe might remain unconscious for the next few minutes, but she\u2019s completely fine now. Oh, two to three days of weakness is to be expected.\u201d Klein suddenly had a stern expression on his face as he asked, \u201cWho taught her mysticism? Didn\u2019t he tell her about the basic taboos?\u201dElizabeth straightened up a little more like a student who had just been scolded by her teacher.She thought for a moment before saying, \u201cSelena once mentioned that her teacher is Hanass Vincent. She met him a year ago at the Divination Club on Howes Street.\u201dHanass Vincent\u2026 On the surface, he didn\u2019t seem to teach anything questionable about magic mirror divination, but he secretly been teaching dark divination\u2026 If I knew about this earlier, then I would have reported it to Captain and have raided him earlier\u2026 Klein felt some regret as he asked in a deep voice, \u201cWas he also the one who taught Selena magic mirror divination?\u201dKlein was left with a lingering sense of fear because this matter had nearly affected his sister \u2014 Melissa!Elizabeth nodded cautiously.\u201cYes, but Selena had tried magic mirror divination a few times without any success. Oh, today she told me that she had a peek at her teacher\u2019s hidden incantations and that there would be no problems.\u201dShe was basically an expert at courting death\u2026 Klein massaged his temples to alleviate his headache.\u201cDo you still remember the incantations she recited?\u201dWell\u2026 Although Hanass Vincent had not voluntarily imparted the dangerous knowledge to Selena, it\u2019s obvious that he had been experimenting with it to extend an invitation to a mysterious, unknown entity. This would become a problem sooner or later. It has to be dealt with quickly before it gets worse and becomes a problem for someone else\u2026\u201cI remember a part of it\u2026\u201d Elizabeth recalled. \u201cShe recited it in Hermes. As you know, I was only exposed to Hermes just recently. All I remember is her using the terms \u2018revolve,\u2019 \u2018spirit,\u2019 \u2018Creator,\u2019 and \u2018grace.'\u201dCreator? The True Creator? Many underground mysticism enthusiasts believe in this ancient entity revered by many secret organizations\u2026 Yes, an entity that appeared 1000 years ago during the early stages of the Fifth Epoch! Klein nodded amidst his thought and said, \u201cRemember to ask Selena about the entire incantation after she wakes up, then find an opportunity to tell me.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Elizabeth replied without any reservations.But she immediately asked, feeling a little confused, \u201cMr. Moretti, why don\u2019t you ask her yourself?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to let Melissa know I enjoy mysticism. Can you help me keep that a secret?\u201d Klein asked in return.Elizabeth bit her lips, her eyes sparkling.\u201cNo problem. Melissa prefers machines to mystery. She likes logic over instinct.\u201dKlein placed his hat in front of his chest and bowed gentlemanly.\u201cThank you for your understanding. As for Selena, you do know that she\u2019s not someone who can keep a secret.\u201d\u201cA more accurate description is that she likes to share secrets with others,\u201d Elizabeth agreed.Klein put on his hat and thought for a moment before saying, \u201cRemember to tell Selena after she wakes up that she suddenly fainted and shattered her mirror. I think her memory probably stopped at the point when she began the magic mirror divination.\u201dSeeing Elizabeth nod, he put on a stern expression once again and said, \u201cRemember, be it divinations or trying other mysticism rituals, do not pray to any other entities other than the seven orthodox divinities! You should immediately burn those types of incantations and stay far away from anyone distributing those materials!\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t noticed this in time, Selena would have turned into a monster or an evil spirit in ten minutes, and everyone here would have been killed, myself included!\u201dThinking about the ice-cold Selena in the mirror, Elizabeth had no doubts about what Klein had just said. She sighed with lingering fear and said, \u201cI understand and I\u2019ll remember. I\u2019ll also keep an eye on Selena.\u201d\u201cAlright, go and take care of Selena.\u201d Klein raised his black cane and walked toward the stairway.As he walked, his eyes became darker. He took out a single penny with his right hand and flicked it into the air.\u201cSelena is alright now.\u201cSelena is alright now.\u201d\u2026Klein quickly repeated the description, then caught the falling coin. He saw George III\u2019s face facing upward.This was not a simplification of spirit dowsing. Instead, it was a simplification of dream divination. At that moment, Klein had forced himself into a state of sleep with the aid of Cogitation in order to take a tour through the spirit world. The heads and tails of the coin were a symbolic manifestation.Heads represented affirmation, while tails indicated dissent!Great, everything is fine now\u2026 Klein twirled the bronze coin with his fingers happily.That was a simplification only a Seer could accomplish.\u2026Elizabeth was staring at Klein\u2019s back and saw the flying coin before he caught it.Only when Klein vanished down the staircase did she turn to enter the bedroom. She saw Selena asleep on the floor with shattered pieces of the mirror beside her.She held her breath and tiptoed into the room as she looked at the fragments of the mirror. She made sure that the ice-cold Selena was no longer present; instead, the fragments were reflecting the ceiling.Phew. Put completely at ease, Melissa heaved a long sigh of relief.But despite her efforts, she couldn\u2019t move Selena to the bed. Instead, she nudged her awake.\u201cElizabeth\u2026 What happened to me? Did I get drunk?\u201d Selena asked weakly, the glow in her eyes having turned considerably dull while her eyes were filled with confusion.Elizabeth thought for a moment and replied in a serious tone, \u201cNo, Selena, something happened to you. Your magic mirror divination invited a malicious entity.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Selena weakly made her way to the bed with Elizabeth\u2019s help. She rubbed her temple as she said, \u201cAll I remember is when I started the magic mirror divination.\u201dElizabeth told a half-truth, \u201cYou were a completely different person during the ritual. The you in the mirror was completely different from the you in real life\u2026 I was very scared. Using the excuse of giving you a surprise, I brought you into the bedroom before I snatched your mirror and shattered it onto the carpet. After that\u2026 after that, you fainted.\u201d\u201cBlessed be the Goddess, you\u2019re okay now!\u201d\u201cI-I don\u2019t remember anything\u2026\u201d Selena muttered, her face pale.The more Selena tried to remember, the emptier her mind became, and the more afraid she felt.Subconsciously, she glanced at her desk and noticed that the placement of items was clearly different.Just what happened exactly\u2026 Selena tried hard to remember, but she could only faintly remember a man in a black suit and hat. He was not strong or tall, but he had a straight back.\u201cSelena,\u201d Elizabeth said seriously, \u201cI met a mysticism expert when I went to the underground market to purchase the amulet. He said that we shouldn\u2019t pray to any entity other than the seven orthodox divinities. Otherwise, we would be sure to invite disaster. Promise me, don\u2019t try this anymore. I didn\u2019t even know if what I did could save you just now!\u201dSelena was scared senseless. She nodded in a daze.\u201cNo more, I\u2019ll never try this again!\u201d\u201cAnd, just what did the incantations of your mysticism mean? If I have the chance to meet the mysticism expert again, I will ask him for you,\u201d Elizabeth asked, feigning nonchalance.Selena rubbed her temple and said, \u201cSpirit that revolves this world, the grace of the True Creator, the eyes that look at fate.\u201d\u2026Tap! Tap! Tap!Klein smoothed the creases and patted the dust off his clothes as he walked down the stairs.After that, he took off his hat and returned slowly to the long dining table.\u201cWhere did you go? It has been nearly 10 minutes,\u201d Selena\u2019s brother, Chris, asked as he folded his hand.Klein smiled and replied, \u201cTo the bathroom, then upstairs to acquaint myself with the ladies.\u201d\u201cI appreciate your honesty,\u201d Chris praised in laughter.He had the red hair and short build that ran in their family. He wore gold-framed glasses and had quite the personality; he was an exceptional lawyer.You wouldn\u2019t say that if you knew that I had knocked your sister unconscious upstairs\u2026 Klein replied humbly, \u201cWe were merely engaging in academic discussion.\u201dIn the area of mysticism\u2026He put down his hat and returned to his seat. He received his two cards as the new round started.Flipping up the corner of his cards, he saw the King of Spades and the Ace of Diamonds.Looks like I became luckier\u2026 Is this payback for doing a good deed? Klein took out a coin in preparation to place his bet.Since Hanass didn\u2019t intentionally reveal the incantation to Selena, there\u2019s no need for me to urgently report this to Captain\u2026He continued his cautious playstyle in the following rounds, only betting when he had a good hand. He didn\u2019t take any chances to bluff and didn\u2019t win much. When the game ended at half past ten, he had won six pence.\u201cI won two soli and eight pence.\u201d Benson fiddled with the notes and coins in his hand.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be an expert at poker,\u201d Klein praised, laughing.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t play often, but I know that this is the same as negotiation. You have to hide your cards and figure out the hidden cards that people have before using various means to scare or entice them\u2026\u201d Benson hadn\u2019t finished his sentence when he saw Melissa and the rest coming down from the second floor.\u201cIt\u2019s time to go home,\u201d said Klein as he glanced at his sister and her friends while rubbing his temples.The throbbing pain in his head remained.After that, Klein went to the bathroom once more and took the opportunity to walk past Elizabeth and obtained the complete incantation.Returning to his siblings, he smiled and said, \u201cOh right, I suddenly remembered something. I need to head back to the company for a while. Shall we go to Zouteland Street first? It\u2019ll be quick.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In fact, it only looked slightly more normal than Elizabeth\u2019s behavior and, later, Selena\u2019s.Klein chuckled as he had long thought of an excuse and said, \u201cThere was a mistake in one of the document descriptions, and I already informed my colleagues that I would hand it over to them when I arrive early at the company tomorrow morning. So, I can either amend it now since it\u2019s on the way or wake up at least half an hour earlier tomorrow morning. No doubt, I\u2019ve chosen to do the former.\u201d\u201cAh, no wonder. I had a nagging feeling that your mind wasn\u2019t in the game, so you were actually thinking about work.\u201d Benson smiled, suddenly enlightened. \u201cNo, I apologize. I should say, the card game helped you think.\u201d\u201cAlright, we shall wait for you.\u201d Melissa looked away and smoothed out the ruffles of her engageantes.As it was past the operation time for both track and trackless public carriages, the three siblings bid their hosts farewell before hiring a carriage nearby. It cost two soli for forty-five minutes.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that every carriage driver that rents out their own carriage adds ridiculous fees,\u201d Benson complained in a low voice. He had used most of the money that he won earlier to pay the driver.Klein smiled and replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s very acceptable. After all, it is almost eleven o\u2019clock.\u201d\u201cI was just joking. I thought that we could actually share the carriage with other guests. Forty-five minutes can take us to many places.\u201d Benson looked out of the window at the other people who were hiring carriages one after another.I know, ride-sharing\u2026 Klein rubbed the top of his silver-inlaid cane and said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a problem with that, but the other customers might. Benson, did you notice that they care a lot about their image and at looking respectable? I think that might be common among the middle-class.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d Benson nodded seriously and said, \u201cThe Wood family was much more extravagant than I imagined. However, Wood\u2019s weekly salary is only four pounds per week\u2026 Heh, \u2018looking respectable\u2019 might be the biggest difference between the middle-class people and curly-haired baboons.\u201dDo you have something against curly-haired baboons\u2026 Klein almost burst out laughing.Melissa didn\u2019t join in on their discussion. She took a seat and sized up Klein from time to time. Her gaze was sending chills down his spine.The two-wheeled horse carriage was traveling quickly in the dark, quiet street. They arrived at Zouteland Street in only twelve minutes.\u201cWait for me here. Five minutes, it won\u2019t be more than five minutes,\u201d Klein emphasized. He put on his top hat, grabbed his cane, and got off the carriage.As the carriage driver was charging based on time instead of distance, the driver didn\u2019t mind waiting.Going up the stairs, Klein arrived at the Blackthorn Security Company and knocked on the door.Within ten seconds, the door was opened wide. Leonard Mitchell appeared before him in a vest and shirt.\u201cYou\u2019re not on duty tonight,\u201d Leonard pointed out, looking surprised to see him.Klein was only on guard duty once a week for the Chanis Gate. They maintained a regular work schedule for the rest of the time. As for emergencies that happened at night, they would be dealt with by the Sleepless who enjoyed the night.However, only getting two to three hours of sleep a day can cause baldness and memory loss\u2026 Whenever he thought about this, Klein couldn\u2019t help but ridicule Captain Dunn Smith in his mind.\u201cI have something to report,\u201d he answered simply.\u201cThere\u2019s a mission?\u201d Leonard asked casually, moving aside.When Klein entered the reception hall, he saw Dunn coming out in his black windbreaker. His gray eyes were dark as usual.\u201cCaptain, I came across an incident involving the supernatural.\u201d\u201cGive me the details,\u201d Dunn asked directly.Klein recounted the whole story from earlier and reported the steps that he took to deal with it.\u201c\u2026So, I think there\u2019s a need to investigate Hanass Vincent.\u201dBack then he believed that since the evil entity that was invited by the magic mirror divination hadn\u2019t caused a disaster, and there was no indication that he was in extreme danger. That meant that the entity probably still needed more time. It didn\u2019t want to awaken or possess Selena ahead of time; therefore, as long as its goals were not exposed, the evil entity chose to observe the situation. Under such circumstances, it wasn\u2019t hard for Elizabeth to trick Selena to head to the entrance of the bedroom.\u201cYou\u2019ve done well. You seized the opportunity before the evil spirit fully materialized to possess her body completely.\u201d Dunn lifted his head lightly and said, \u201cLet us take care of the follow-up investigations. You can return home to rest.\u201dKlein heaved a sigh of relief and chortled.\u201cI thought you would make this my initiation mission and make me complete it alone.\u201dFrom the incantation that Elizabeth provided him, Hanass Vincent was certainly dangerous\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s because there\u2019s already an initiation mission for you.\u201d The desultory Leonard chuckled by the side.\u201cWhat?\u201d Klein was shocked.Dunn smirked and explained with his soothing voice, \u201cAt around seven tonight, the police station referred us to a case. From our initial assessments, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any danger or urgency, so it was decided that you would complete it on your own tomorrow.\u201d\u201cAlright, don\u2019t ask about the case. Rest well tonight and move your day off to Tuesday or Wednesday.\u201dCaptain, doing that only affects my sleep\u2026 Plus, Monday afternoon is when the Tarot Gathering takes place\u2026 Do I need to send a postponement notification to Justice and The Hanged Man? Klein shook his head and smiled bitterly. He then bade farewell and left.Exiting the stairway, he suddenly sensed something. He lifted his head to look towards the carriage that they had hired. He only saw Melissa looking at him silently through the window.When they made eye contact, Melissa suddenly looked away and sat properly.The corner of Klein\u2019s mouth twitched, and he got into the carriage, pretending nothing had happened.Under the crimson moon and pure night sky, the carriage moved quickly down one street after the other.When they returned home, Klein yielded the bathroom to Benson for his shower while he went to Melissa\u2019s bedroom and knocked twice.Melissa, who was planning to use the other bathroom, opened the door and looked at her brother suspiciously.\u201cMelissa, do you have any questions that you\u2019d like to ask? I know you do,\u201d Klein asked straightforwardly.Don\u2019t just observe me in silence\u2026Melissa lips trembled and creased her eyebrows as she spoke.\u201cKlein, what did you do to Elizabeth? She seemed a bit off.\u201d\u201cAnd, later on, Selena started acting very strange too.\u201dKlein had prepared his reply.\u201cDo you know that Elizabeth and Selena are mysticism enthusiasts?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah, but I don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that can\u2019t be explained in this world,\u201d Melissa answered seriously after being momentarily taken aback. \u201cAnything that seems unexplainable is due to the fact that the knowledge we have grasped is insufficient.\u201d\u201cYeah, I think so too,\u201d Klein echoed her sentiments guiltily.I once thought so too, until I successfully courted death\u2026He coughed lightly and continued, \u201cMysticism involves Hermes, the language used specifically for ancient worship ceremonies and prayers. Elizabeth knew that I am good at it. Heh, it is within a historian\u2019s domain after all. So, she asked me about the pronunciation of corresponding words and their actual meanings.\u201dMelissa nodded lightly, signifying her acceptance of her brother\u2019s explanation. It went according to her understanding of both parties.\u201cAs for why Elizabeth and Selena became weird later on, I have no idea about the actual reasons.\u201d Klein removed himself from the picture first, then he said, \u201cBut, I can make a guess.\u201d\u201cYou managed to guess it?\u201d Melissa blurted out in shock.Klein lifted his hand and patted his lips.\u201cI could guess from the contents of what Elizabeth asked. The few Hermes words were related to divination, as well as the worshiping of evil entities. Yes, when Selena did the magic mirror divination, did she recite in Hermes?\u201dHe proactively brought that up in order to remind his sister to keep her guard up against similar situations. It would be even better if she could cut off contact with Selena and Elizabeth.\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Melissa replied after a delay. \u201cI think I understand why Elizabeth and Selena were acting strange\u2026\u201dThen, Klein asked deliberately, \u201cAs Selena\u2019s magic mirror divination involved a wicked, illegal belief, perhaps Elizabeth found an opportunity to criticize and correct Selena\u2019s mistake after she clarified with me the actual meaning of the Hermes that Selena had used?\u201d\u201cI think so,\u201d Melissa didn\u2019t doubt this conclusion because she had made the same deduction herself.Klein let out a breath of relief upon seeing that he had successfully directed the flow of the conversation.\u201cIn the future, it\u2019s best if you advised Selena to put her beliefs in the orthodox.\u201dThen, he tapped four spots on his chest just like a priest.\u201cYes, I will!\u201d Melissa replied, sounding determined.\u201cAnd, don\u2019t tell Elizabeth and Selena about our deduction or about the things that I\u2019ve said. I actually promised Elizabeth not to tell you,\u201d Klein emphasized.\u201cOkay.\u201d Melissa nodded lightly.\u2026On Monday morning at eight, in the Blackthorn Security Company.Klein took off his hat and greeted Rozanne and Bredt. After exchanging a few words, he entered Captain Dunn Smith\u2019s office.He pushed the door open and looked around. He suddenly had a shock, because Dunn\u2019s face was pretty pale and his gray eyes looked clouded, without their usual darkness.\u201cWhat happened? Hanass Vincent?\u201d Klein asked in concern and shock.Dunn rubbed his forehead, took a sip of coffee, and replied with a bitter smile, \u201cHanass Vincent is dead.\u201d\u201cWho killed him ahead of time?\u201d Klein sat before Dunn with his cane in hand.Dunn didn\u2019t answer immediately but sighed and said, \u201cLeonard and I went to look for Hanass Vincent last night. As his usual behavior didn\u2019t show any unusual signs and there was nothing odd about his house, I decided to enter his dreams to look for clues.\u201d\u201cIn his dream, in his dream\u2026\u201dHis eyes showed fear as Dunn repeated himself twice, that was when he said, \u201cIn his dream, I saw a cross, a huge cross, one that blotted out the sky. On the huge cross there was a naked man nailed to it with black nails. His arms and legs were pinned with his arms extended outwards. He was hung upside down, his head hung low like a chandelier. There was strips of blood stains on his body.\u201d\u201cUpon seeing such a scene, I lost consciousness. I left Hanass Vincent\u2019s dream, and when I woke up, Leonard told me that Hanass had died in his sleep.\u201d\u201cHuge cross, hung upside down, the man covered in blood stains\u2026 It\u2019s similar to some of the stories of the True Creator that some of the hidden organizations believe in, but there are considerable differences too\u2026\u201d Klein made a deduction in suspicion.The few hidden organizations that believed in the True Creator had only appeared in the last two or three centuries, such as the Aurora Order and the Iron and Blood Cross Order. However, similar such depictions had never disappeared over the past thousand plus years.Dunn rubbed his forehead again. \u201cWe\u2019ll follow-up on this. As for you, go ahead and complete your initiation mission first.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I haven\u2019t seen any signs of danger at the very least,\u201d Dunn emphasized. \u201cThis is a case which was referred to us by Golden Indus\u2019s police department. The famous philanthropist Sir Deweyville has been experiencing unusual harassment over the past month. Be it his bodyguards, the security guards he has employed, or the police, none of them have been able to find the culprit. Inspector Tolle, who is in charge of this case, suspects that it involves Beyonder powers and, thus, handed the case over to us.\u201dI saw Sir Deweyville at the library the other day and noticed that he was feeling down and lethargic. So it was a result of being harassed\u2026 Klein knitted his brows and asked, \u201cWhat kind of harassment is it?\u201dThere hasn\u2019t been any physical harm inflicted yet; thus, the harassment wouldn\u2019t be considered dangerous.\u201cSir Deweyville hears moans and cries every night, no matter where he is, be it Tingen or not. This has affected his sleep quality negatively.\u201d Dunn flipped the notes in his hands. \u201cHe has seen a psychiatrist and has asked his butlers and servants to confirm that it was not an illusion. Having confirmed that it isn\u2019t a hallucination, thus, it is suspected that someone is harassing him.\u201dClosing the file, Dunn looked up at Klein.\u201cChange into your probationary inspector uniform in the break room, then meet Inspector Tolle who is in charge of this case at the Shooting Club. He\u2019ll provide you with more details.\u201d\u201cProbationary inspector uniform?\u201d Klein asked instinctively.Dunn rubbed his forehead and smiled.\u201cHalf of our salary comes from the police department, and the title of probationary inspector doesn\u2019t merely belong in the records. When you met Leonard and I for the first time, we were also wearing uniforms. This is a perk held by fully official members. Yes, the \u2018Perks\u2019 as Emperor Roselle would call it.\u201dUnfortunately, I can\u2019t wear it as a casual outfit. Otherwise, I\u2019d be able to have another spare outfit when my clothes are being washed\u2026 Klein picked up his cane and bade farewell before leaving the captain\u2019s office.He headed toward the break room and saw a black and white checkered uniform, complete with leather boots, placed on the table. The uniform\u2019s peak cap was embroidered with the logo of the police department\u2014two crossed swords and a crown. Located on the shoulder was a black and white epaulet with a shimmering silver star.\u201cThis is a probationary inspector uniform?\u201d Klein glanced at the uniform and noticed a string of numbers under the silver stars: 06-254.He had some understanding of the police rank structure in the Loen Kingdom. He knew that those at the top were the minister and the chief secretary of the police force. Under them were the respective commissioners, deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners of the various police departments. Those in the middle were superintendents and inspectors, while those at the very bottom were the sergeants and constables.After closing the door, Klein took off his suit and hat before changing into the uniform.He hung his suit up and left the room. He made his way into the clerk\u2019s office and looked at himself using the full-body mirror that Rozanne brought to him.The young man in the mirror had black hair with gentle brown eyes. The uniform on his body accentuated him with a heroic spirit.\u201cNot bad.\u201d Klein praised himself narcissistically. He left his cane in the office and left the Blackthorn Security Company.Inside his pockets were a full set of equipment, ranging from weapons to his police badge.\u2026At the hall of the Shooting Club.Klein met Inspector Tolle immediately since he was the only one in a police uniform.Of course, there\u2019s me too\u2026 Klein thought.There were two silver stars on the epaulets of Inspector Tolle\u2019s uniform. His clothes were propped up by his stomach and he had a thick blond mustache. His frame was tall but not imposing. Perhaps, it was imposing in the past.\u201cMoretti? Klein Moretti?\u201d Inspector Tolle noticed Klein and welcomed him with a smile.\u201cHello, Inspector Tolle, I believe that you have the right person,\u201d Klein replied amicably, then following his memories, he raised his right arm, kept his fingers straight and tight before saluting.Tolle chuckled.\u201cI can tell that you\u2019ll be a young man who\u2019s easy to get along with. That\u2019s good. Shall we head to Sir Deweyville\u2019s place now?\u201dEven though he was a higher rank than Klein, the tone in his query was obviously friendly.\u201cNo problem.\u201d Klein thought for a moment before he said, \u201cYou can fill me in on the details of the case on the carriage.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Tolle stroked his thick blond beard and guided Klein out of the Shooting Club. They boarded a carriage which was stopped on the other side of the road.There was the \u201ctwo crossed swords and a crown\u201d police emblem on the carriage, and it came with a personal carriage driver.\u201cSir Deweyville is a believer of the Goddess, so we referred the case to you,\u201d Tolle said quickly as he sat down.\u201cI know. The fine knight is a common figure on the covers of newspapers and magazines.\u201d Klein flashed a friendly smile.Tolle picked up the document docket beside him and removed the seal before taking out the materials inside. As he flipped through them, he explained, \u201cRegardless, even if you are aware of it, I need to provide you with the detailed briefing.\u201cSir Deweyville is one of the richest tycoons of Tingen City. He built his career beginning with a lead and porcelain factory. It has now expanded to steel, coal, shipping, banking, and bonds. He is also a great philanthropist that has been praised by the king, having set up the Deweyville Charity Foundation, the Deweyville Trust, and the Deweyville Library\u2026 He was also knighted five years ago\u2026 If he were willing to run for mayor, I don\u2019t think anyone in Tingen City could contest with him.\u201cBut Backlund is his goal; he wants to become a member of parliament. We once suspected that the harassment might be related to this, but we have no clues to this date.\u201dKlein nodded slightly and said, \u201cWe can\u2019t rule out that possibility, but there\u2019s nothing to confirm that suspicion as of now.\u201dTolle didn\u2019t dwell on this point. He continued, \u201cFrom the sixth of last month, Sir Deweyville has heard painful skin-numbing moans every night when he sleeps, akin to a patient\u2019s fight for his life. He has checked the surrounding rooms multiple times, but he hasn\u2019t found anything unusual. His butler and servants have also confirmed that they heard such sounds, but it is simply softer for them.\u201cIn the beginning, Sir Deweyville believed that this matter would pass quickly and didn\u2019t pay too much attention to it. But the moans became more and more frequent, to the point of occasionally happening during the day. There was even the addition of heart-wrenching cries.\u201d\u201cThis has made Sir Deweyville lose sleep, time and time again he had no choice but to leave Tingen to his villa in the villages. But it was to no avail. The moans and cries persisted. Similarly, the phenomenon persisted even in Backlund, just that it wasn\u2019t as serious.\u201cHe employed security guards to check his surroundings, but they didn\u2019t find any clues. Our preliminary investigations also came up with nothing.\u201cSir Deweyville, who has been tortured for more than a month, is on the brink of collapse. He visited psychiatrists time and time again but was unable to have his problems resolved. He told us that if this problem was not solved within a month, he would leave Tingen and head to Backlund. He believes that there would be people who can help him there.\u201dAfter listening to Tolle\u2019s explanation, Klein quickly analyzed and came up with a few possibilities.He offended a Beyonder and is suffering from a curse?No, if he was suffering from a curse, the butlers and servants in his house wouldn\u2019t hear the same things\u2026There\u2019s a Beyonder with unknown motives hidden among his servants and bodyguards?But the problem stems from the point that there has been no requests made of Sir Deweyville over the past month\u2026Perhaps Sir Deweyville accidentally came into contact with some vengeful evil spirit?That possibility cannot be ruled out\u2026The carriage entered the Golden Indus borough while Klein was still deep in thought. It stopped at the door of Sir Deweyville\u2019s house.A steel fence surrounded a lush garden. There were two statues by the side of the hollowed metal gates, a magnificent fountain that showered a marble sculpture with water, an expansive two-story building, as well as a path wide enough to fit three carriages.\u201cEven the knight\u2019s house is only two stories high\u2026 The newspaper reported that Backlund is experimenting with building ten-story apartments\u2026\u201d Klein got off the carriage and saw a sergeant with three chevron stripes walking over briskly.He looked at Klein and saluted.\u201cGood morning, Sir!\u201d\u201cGood morning.\u201d Klein nodded with a smile.Tolle smiled.\u201cThis is Sergeant Gate, you can tell him if you need anything.\u201cThis is Probationary inspector Moretti, a history and psychological expert from the police department,\u201d Tolle introduced Klein to Gate.\u2026I don\u2019t deserve such a title\u2026 Klein felt a little embarrassed.After the greetings, Gate pointed to the two-story building behind the fountain and said, \u201cSir Deweyville is waiting for us.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein caressed the revolver at his waist.That was his best bet against an enemy.Since he was in police uniform, he could put his revolver in a holster at his hip, making it easier to draw it.As they spoke, the trio made their way down the path, around the fountain, and arrived outside the door.By then, the door was already opened by a servant who was waiting politely at the side.As Klein pretended to adjust his hat, he tapped twice on his glabella to activate his Spirit Vision before entering the house.The square-faced Sir Deweyville was massaging his forehead in the hall. He was clearly in low spirits. His blond hair and blue eyes were either dry or dull as though he had aged considerably by at least five years.\u201cGood morning, Sir Deweyville.\u201d Klein, Tolle, and Gate bowed at the same time.Sir Deweyville stood up and forced out a smile.\u201cGood morning, Officers. I hope that you can resolve what has been causing me distress.\u201dAt that moment, Klein squinted and slightly knitted his brows.Other than his low spirits, Klein couldn\u2019t find any other problems with Sir Deweyville.That\u2019s odd\u2026 He thought for a moment before he said, \u201cSir, in which room did you first hear the moans?\u201d\u201cMy bedroom.\u201d Sir Deweyville shook his head.\u201cCan we take a look?\u201d inquired Klein.\u201cHaven\u2019t you checked it many times?\u201d the middle-aged butler interrupted from the side.It was clear that he didn\u2019t notice that Klein was the partner of the kind-hearted soul that had \u201cnot pocketed the money that he picked up.\u201dKlein smiled, composed.\u201cThose were my colleagues, not me.\u201d\u201cSir, this is an expert sent by the police agency,\u201d Tolle said, taking the opportunity to introduce him.Deweyville looked at the young expert and said, \u201cAlright, Cullen, take him to my room.\u201d\u201cSir, I hope that you will come with us,\u201d Klein said seriously.Deweyville hesitated for a few seconds before saying, \u201cIf that can solve the problem\u2026\u201dHe grabbed his cane as he spoke. He made his way feebly toward the staircase with the butler Cullen and several guards beside him, ready to support him if needed.Klein surveyed the surroundings as he followed behind them silently.One step, two steps, three steps\u2026 They arrived at the second story and entered the master bedroom.Klein didn\u2019t have the time to survey the surroundings when the hair on his body stood on their ends.This was feedback from his spiritual perception!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 - Findings By SightPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 90: Findings By SightTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosSir Deweyville\u2019s bedroom was larger than the living room and dining room of Klein\u2019s house combined. It was partitioned into a place for a bed, a living space, a changing room, a bathroom, and a study desk and bookshelves. The furnishings were exquisite, and the details were extravagant.But to Klein, the light seemed dimmer and the temperature was several degrees colder than the outside.At the same time, he seemed to hear the sound of sobbing and moaning, as though one was putting up a last-ditch struggle.Klein was in a trance, and everything suddenly returned to normal. The sunlight shone brightly through the window and poured over the entire bedroom. The temperature was reasonable, neither too high nor low. The surrounding policemen, bodyguards, and butler were quiet. No one spoke.This\u2026 He looked sideways at the classic yet luxurious bed. He felt there were pairs of blurry eyes lingering in the shadow, like the moths that fearlessly stayed around gas lamps.Taking a few steps closer, Klein lost the earlier images from his Spirit Vision.Not a standard wraith or an evil spirit\u2026 What is it exactly? Klein frowned and recalled the mysticism knowledge that he had been learning all this time.From what he had seen, the mission would have been easy if it was passed to a Corpse Collector, Gravedigger, or Spirit Medium. It was obviously not within his domain of expertise.Holding back his urge to use divination as an investigative approach, Klein looked around slowly to look for other traces to confirm the few guesses on his mind.\u201cInspector.\u201d Sir Deweyville hesitated and asked, \u201cDid you discover anything?\u201d\u201cIf it were that easy, I believe my colleagues wouldn\u2019t have waited until now,\u201d Klein replied, glancing at the philanthropist subconsciously.Just as he planned to retract his gaze, he suddenly saw that there was a faint white human figure reflected behind Sir Deweyville in the mirror behind him.No, there were many figures overlapping each other, resulting in a white distorted figure!The figure flashed by and Klein seemed to hear faint sobbing.Phew\u2026 He let out a breath to ease his nerves, having almost drawn his gun out out of fright.Heightened spiritual perception with Spirit Vision will one day scare me senseless\u2026 Klein tried relaxing his tense nerves by joking around before redirecting his focus back onto Sir Deweyville.This time, he saw something different.Now that he was in the bedroom, Sir Deweyville had a faint and twisted figure shimmering around him. It even dimmed the lighting of that area.Every flash was accompanied by an illusionary cry and moan that could hardly be detected by an ordinary person.Hardly audible for an ordinary person under ordinary circumstances? Is it because it\u2019s daytime? Klein nodded as he thought.He had an initial judgment for this case.It was resentment that was haunting Sir Deweyville. It was the remnant spirituality that resulted from unresolved emotions before a human\u2019s death!If such feelings of resentment stayed in this world over a period of time, they would become a terrifying wrathful spirit after becoming stronger.However, Sir Deweyville was a famous philanthropist. Even Benson, who was a picky person, was in awe of him. Why would he be bogged down with the resentment of the dead? Is he actually two-faced? Could it be the means of a Beyonder with nefarious intentions? Klein guessed the possibilities suspiciously.After some thought, he looked towards Deweyville and asked, \u201cHonorable Sir, I have a few questions.\u201d\u201cPlease ask.\u201d Deweyville sat down wearily.Klein organized his thoughts and asked, \u201cWhen you leave here to go to a new place, such as the village or Backlund, do you temporarily get at least half a night\u2019s worth of peace before the situation resumes and gradually worsens? Even when you sleep during the daytime, are you able to hear moaning and sobbing sounds?\u201dDeweyville\u2019s half-closed eyes suddenly widened as his deep blue eyes were suddenly beaming with hope.\u201cYes, did you find the root of the problem?\u201dOnly then did he realize that due to his extended period of insomnia and his poor mental state, he had completely forgotten to inform the police about such an important clue!Seeing that Klein\u2019s question had uncovered something useful, Inspector Tolle relaxed. He knew that the Nighthawk had found a clue.Sergeant Gate was surprised and curious too. He couldn\u2019t help but look closely at the psychological expert, Klein.It coincided with the traits of gradual entanglement and the feature of accumulation\u2026 Having received the feedback, Klein had basically confirmed the cause.Then, he had two ways of helping Sir Deweyville to shake off the burden. One was to set up an altar directly around the man and remove the resentment of the dead entirely using ritualistic magic. The second option was to use other mysticism measures to find the root of the problem and solve it from there.Taking into consideration the rule of preventing commoners from learning of Beyonder powers to the best of his abilities, Klein planned on first attempting the second method. Only if it failed would he pray to the Goddess.\u201cSir, yours is a psychological illness, a mental problem,\u201d he spoke nonsense with absolute seriousness while looking at Deweyville.Sir Deweyville knitted his brows and asked in reply, \u201cAre you telling me that I\u2019m a mental patient, that I need to enter an asylum?\u201d\u201cNo, nothing that serious. Actually, most people have psychological problems to one degree or another,\u201d Klein casually comforted him. \u201cPlease allow me to introduce myself again. I am a psychological expert from the Awwa County Police.\u201d\u201cPsychological expert?\u201d Deweyville and his butler looked at Inspector Tolle who they were familiar with.Tolle nodded seriously and confirmed that it was true.\u201cAlright, what do you need of me for my treatment? Besides, I don\u2019t understand why my butler, my bodyguards, and my servants will hear the sobbing and moaning as well\u2026\u201d Deweyville held his walking stick with both hands, looking confused.Klein replied professionally, \u201cI will explain it to you after it\u2019s resolved.\u201d\u201cPlease tell your butler, your servants, and your bodyguards to leave. Inspector Tolle, Sergeant Gate, please leave as well. I need a quiet environment to begin the initial treatment.\u201dA \u201ctreatment\u201d with magic\u2026 Inspector Tolle added in his heart and nodded at Sir Deweyville.Deweyville fell silent for more than ten seconds before saying, \u201cCullen, take them to the living room on the second floor.\u201d\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Butler Cullen didn\u2019t retort since the request was made by a police officer, a probationary inspector, and a psychological expert.After watching them leave the room one after another and closing the door behind them, Klein looked at Deweyville who had dark blond hair and blue eyes, and said, \u201cSir, please lie down on your bed. Relax and try to sleep.\u201d\u201c\u2026Alright.\u201d Deweyville hung his coat and hat on the clothes rack before walking slowly to the side of the bed and then laid down.Klein drew all the curtains, turning the room dark.He took off his pendant and quickly used spirit pendulum to determine any dangers. Then, he sat on the rocking chair near the end of the bed, traced a spherical light in his mind, and entered Cogitation. He allowed the world of spirituality to extend before his eyes.Then, he leaned against the back of the chair and fell into a deep sleep, allowing for his Astral Projection to make contact with the external world.He was using the technique of dream divination, to let himself be in the spiritual environment like he was dreaming, so as to communicate with each and every resentment that plagued Sir Deweyville.Only communication would be able to give him an answer and solve the problem!Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!A sad sob reverberated in Klein\u2019s ear, and he 'saw\u201d that the white translucent figures were floating around him.A painful groan echoed as Klein, who barely regained his mental processes, extended his right hand and touched one of them.Suddenly, the figures swarmed at him like moths darting toward a fire.The image before Klein\u2019s eyes suddenly turned blurry and his brain seemed to be cleaved into two. Half of his mind was calmly observing while the other half saw a \u201cmirror.\u201dIn the \u201cmirror,\u201d there was a young girl dressed in worker garbs. She looked strong and fit as she walked in a dust-covered factory while her head throbbed in pain.Her eyesight occasionally turned blurry and her body became skinnier by the day.She seemed to hear someone calling her Charlotte, and the voice said that she had a hysterical illness.Hysterical illness? She looked towards the mirror and saw that she had a faint blue line on her gum.\u2026The \u201cmirror\u2019s view\u201d switched and Klein saw another girl called Mary.She too walked into the lead factory, young and lively.Suddenly, half of her face started twitching, followed by her arm and leg on the same side.\u201cYou have epilepsy.\u201d She heard someone say while her whole body was convulsing.As she twitched and fell, the intensity increased before she finally lost consciousness.\u2026There was another girl, and she was depressed. She was walking around the street in a daze, to the point of having a speech impediment.She had a very bad headache, and she had a blue line on her gums. She would also convulse from time to time.She met a doctor, and the doctor said, \u201cLafayette, this is a result of lead poisoning.\u201dThe doctor looked at her with pity and saw her convulse again. She twitched continuously, and the doctor saw that her eyes had lost all their light.\u2026Many images appeared before Klein, and he remained immersed within them and calmly observed.Suddenly, he understood the plight of the\u00a0girls <sup>1</sup> .The female workers had been in extended contact with white lead. They had all died of lead poisoning as a result of long-term exposure to the dust and powder.Sir Deweyville had a lead factory under his name and also two porcelain factories. All of them hired comparatively cheaper female workers!Klein 'saw\u201d all of that in silence, and felt that there was something that still had not been clarified.Such \u201cdeath resentment\u201d was insignificant. They could not affect reality or have any effect on Deweyville even when accumulated.Unless\u2014 Unless there was a more powerful and stubborn resentment that had united them all.Just then, he 'saw\u201d another girl.The girl was no more than 18 years old, but she was glazing the porcelain in the factory.\u201cHayley, how are you doing lately? Do you still have a headache? If it gets too serious, remember to inform me. Sir Deweyville has enforced a rule that people with severe headaches cannot continue being in contact with lead and must leave the factory,\u201d an elder lady asked with concern.Hayley touched her forehead and replied with a smile, \u201cJust a little, I\u2019m okay.\u201d\u201cTell me tomorrow if it gets any worse,\u201d the elderly lady exhorted.Hayley agreed. When she returned home, she massaged her forehead from time to time.She saw that her parents and brothers had returned, but their faces looked hopeless.\u201cYour father and brothers lost their jobs\u2026\u201d her mother said as she wiped her tears.Her father and brother hung their heads low and muttered, \u201cWe will try to get some work at the harbor.\u201d\u201cBut we don\u2019t even have bread money for the day after tomorrow\u2026 Maybe we will need to move to Lower Street\u2026\u201d Hayley\u2019s mother looked at her with reddened eyes. \u201cWhen are you getting your pay? It\u2019s ten soli, right?\u201dHayley massaged her forehead again.\u201cYeah, Saturday. Saturday.\u201dShe didn\u2019t say anything else and remained as quiet as usual. She returned to the factory the next day and told her supervisor that her headache recovered and she felt fine.She smiled and walked five kilometers back and fro to work daily. She massaged her head more and more frequently.\u201cYou haven\u2019t found another job?\u201d Hayley couldn\u2019t help but ask her father and brother while looking at the soup which was boiling with black bread.Her father said in frustration, \u201cThe economy is in a recession. Many places are retrenching. Even the harbor jobs are sporadic. I could only get three soli and seven pence a week.\u201dHayley sighed and fell into her usual silence. However, she hid her left hand that was twitching suddenly.On the second day, she walked to work again. The sun was shining brightly, and the street grew busier and busier with pedestrians.Suddenly, she started convulsing all over.She fell to the side of the road, foam spewing out of her mouth.She looked up into the sky and her gaze turned into a blur. She saw people walking past and others getting close. She saw a carriage pass by with the Deweyville family emblem with a white dove with its spread wings as if ready to take off.She tried hard to open her mouth, but she couldn\u2019t make a sound.So, she didn\u2019t say a thing, quiet as ever.But the difference this time was that she was dead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 - SolutionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 91: SolutionTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosThe scenery started to distort, turning illusory and began to fade away.After Klein left his dreamlike state, his vision adapted to the darkness in the room.He knew that with one pound and ten soli, which was thirty soli a week, Benson didn\u2019t have an easy time supporting the family according to the standards of an average family.He had thought that the majority of workers earned twenty soli a week.He had once heard Melissa remark that Lower Street of Iron Cross Street had five, seven, or even ten families squeezing into the same room.He also learned from Benson that as a result of the situation in the Southern Continent, the kingdom\u2019s economy was in a recession for the past few months.He knew that a maid, with board and lodging provided, could earn between three soli and sixpence to six soli a week.Klein extended his hand and pinched his glabella. He was silent for a long time, until Sir Deweyville asked, \u201cOfficer, aren\u2019t you going to say anything? The psychiatrists I went to would always speak to me and ask questions in such a situation.\u201cHowever, I must say that I feel at peace. I almost fell asleep. I haven\u2019t heard any moans or cries yet.\u201cHow did you do it?\u201dKlein leaned back in the rocking chair. Instead of providing an answer, he asked with a gentle tone, \u201cSir, do you know about lead poisoning? Do you know about the dangers of lead?\u201dDeweyville fell silent for a few seconds. \u201cI did not know about it in the past, but I do now. Are you telling me that my psychological illness stems from my guilt\u2014my guilt toward the female lead and porcelain factory workers?\u201dWithout waiting for Klein to answer, he continued just like he always had\u2014in his position of power during a negotiation.\u201cYes, I did feel guilty about this in the past, but I did compensate them. At my lead and porcelain factories, the workers do not earn less than other workers in the same industry. In Backlund, lead and porcelain workers are paid no more than eight soli a week, but I pay them ten, sometimes even more.\u201cHeh, many people criticize me for breaking ranks since it makes it hard for them to recruit workers. If not for the Grain Act that made many farmers bankrupt, sending them to the cities, they would have had to raise their wages just like I did.\u201cFurthermore, I\u2019ve also informed the supervisor of the factories to make sure that those with repeated headaches and blurry vision are to leave the areas where they are exposed to lead. If their illness is really severe, then they can even ask for help at my charity foundation.\u201cI think I have done enough.\u201dKlein spoke without a ripple of emotion in his voice, \u201cSir, at times, you cannot imagine how important a salary is to a poor person. Simply losing work for a week or two can result in an irreversible loss to their family, a loss that would cause tremendous grief.\u201dHe paused before saying, \u201cI am curious, why wouldn\u2019t a kind person like you install equipment that can protect against dust and lead poisoning in your factories?\u201dDeweyville looked at the ceiling and laughed ruefully.\u201cThat would make my costs too high for me to bear. I would no longer be able to compete with other lead and porcelain companies. I no longer pay too much attention to my profits in these areas of my business. In fact, I am even willing to fork out some money. But what\u2019s the point of keeping the business if I have to keep doing that? That can only help a number of workers and not become a standard in the industry or effect change on other factories.\u201cThat would merely result in me forking out money to support the workers. I heard that some factories even secretly hire slaves to minimize costs.\u201dKlein crossed his hands and said after a moment of silence, \u201cSir, the root of your psychological illness comes from the buildup of guilt, despite you believing that the guilt has faded and disappeared over time. It wouldn\u2019t have any visible effects under normal circumstances, but there was something that triggered you and set off all the problems at once.\u201d\u201cSomething that triggered me? I\u2019m not aware of such a thing,\u201d Deweyville said puzzled, but with conviction.Klein allowed the chair to rock gently as he explained with a gentle tone, \u201cYou did fall asleep for a few minutes just now, and you told me something.\u201d\u201cHypnosis?\u201d Deweyville made a guess as he usually did.Klein did not give a direct reply and instead said, \u201cYou once saw a girl dying on her way to work while you were on your carriage. She had died because of lead poisoning. She was one of your workers who glazed porcelain while she was still alive.\u201dDeweyville rubbed his temples, speechless before saying somewhat doubtful, \u201cI think that happened once\u2026 but I can\u2019t remember it clearly\u2026\u201dHis prolonged insomnia had left him in a poor mental state. He could only faintly recall seeing such a scene.He thought for a moment, but gave up taxing his brain. Instead, he asked, \u201cWhat was that worker\u2019s name?\u201cWell, what I meant was, what should I do to cure my psychological illness?\u201dKlein replied immediately, \u201cTwo things.\u201d\u201cFirst, the worker that died by the side of the road was called Hayley Walker. That was what you told me. She was the most direct trigger, so you have to find her parents and give them more compensation.\u201cSecond, spread information about the dangers of lead in the newspapers and magazines. Allow your charity foundation to help more workers who suffered from the damage. If you succeed in becoming a member of parliament, push for enacting laws in this domain.\u201dDeweyville sat up slowly and laughed in a self-deprecating manner.\u201cI will do all of the rest, but to enact a law, heh\u2014 I think it\u2019s impossible since there is still competition from nations beyond our country. Setting up such a law would just slip the entire industry in the country into a crisis. Factories would become bankrupt one by one, and many workers would lose their jobs. Organizations that help the poor cannot save that many people.\u201dHe slowly got off the bed and adjusted his collar. He then looked at Klein and said, \u201cHayley Walker, right? I\u2019ll immediately get Cullen to retrieve information about her from the porcelain company and find her parents. Officer, please wait with me and continuously evaluate my mental state.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein stood up slowly and smoothed his black-and-white checkered police uniform.\u2026At eleven in the morning in the living room of Deweyville.Klein sat on the sofa in silence as he looked at the man and woman being guided into the house by Butler Cullen.The two guests had blemished skin, wrinkles already woven into their faces. The man had a slight hunch while the woman had a mole under her eyelid.They looked nearly identical to what Klein had seen through Hayley, just older and more haggard. They were so skinny that they were almost all bone. Their clothes were old and ragged. Klein even learned that they couldn\u2019t continue living on Lower Street of Iron Cross Streets any further.Sob\u2026Klein sensed an icy wind start to spiral through his spiritual perception.He pinched his glabella and shot a glance toward Sir Deweyville. It was unknown when a faint white, translucent, contorted figure had appeared behind him.\u201cGood-good morning, Honorable Sir.\u201d Hayley\u2019s parents were unusually polite.Deweyville rubbed his forehead and asked, \u201cAre the both of you Hayley Walker\u2019s parents? Doesn\u2019t she also have a brother and a two-year-old sister?\u201dHayley\u2019s mother answered in fear, \u201cHer-her brother broke his leg at the harbor sometime back. We got him to take care of his sister at home.\u201dDeweyville remained silent for a few seconds before he sighed.\u201cMy deepest condolences for what happened to Hayley.\u201dUpon hearing that, the eyes of Hayley\u2019s parents immediately turned red. They opened their mouths and said over each other, \u201cThank-thank you for your goodwill.\u201cThe police told us-told us, that Hayley died from lead poisoning. That\u2019s the term, right? Oh, my poor child, she was only seventeen. She was always so quiet, so determined.\u201cYou had sent someone to visit her before and sponsored her burial. She is buried at the Raphael Cemetery.\u201dDeweyville glanced at Klein and changed his sitting posture. He leaned forward and said with a serious tone, \u201cThat was actually an oversight of ours. I have to apologize.\u201d\u201cI have considered that I need to compensate you, to compensate Hayley. Her weekly salary was ten soli, was it not? One year would be five hundred and twenty soli, or twenty-six pounds. Let\u2019s assume that she could have worked for another ten years.\u201cCullen, give Hayley\u2019s parents three hundred pounds.\u201d\u201cThree-three hundred pounds?\u201d Hayley\u2019s parents were dumbfounded.They never had more than one pound of savings, even at their richest!It wasn\u2019t only them who were dazed. Even the expressions of the bodyguards and maids in the room were also all that of shock and envy. Even Sergeant Gate couldn\u2019t help but draw in a deep breath\u2014his weekly salary was only two pounds and among his subordinates, only one chevroned constable earned one pound a week.Amidst the silence, Butler Cullen walked out of the study and held a bulging sack.He opened the sack and revealed stacks of cash, some one pound, some five pounds, but mostly made up of one or five soli.It was clear that Deweyville had made his subordinates receive \u201cchange\u201d from the bank earlier.\u201cIt\u2019s an expression of Sir Deweyville\u2019s goodwill,\u201d Cullen handed the sack over to Hayley\u2019s parents after receiving confirmation from his master.Hayley\u2019s parents took the sack and rubbed their eyes, looking at it in disbelief.\u201cNo, this-this is too generous, we cannot accept this,\u201d they said as they held the sack tightly.Deweyville said in a deep voice, \u201cThis is what Hayley deserves.\u201d\u201cY-you truly are a noble, charitable knight!\u201d Hayley\u2019s parents bowed repeatedly in agitation.They had smiles on their faces, smiles that they couldn\u2019t repress.They praised the knight repeatedly, repeating the same few adjectives they knew. They kept insisting that Hayley would be grateful towards him in heaven.\u201cCullen, send them home. Oh, take them to the bank first,\u201d Deweyville heaved a sigh of relief and instructed his butler.Hayley\u2019s parents hugged the sack tightly and walked toward the door quickly without stopping.Klein saw the faint translucent figure behind Sir Deweyville attempt to extend its hands towards them, hoping to leave with them, but the parents\u2019 smiles were abnormally radiant. They didn\u2019t turn back.That figure turned fainter and, soon, vanished completely.Klein also sensed that the icy feeling in the guest hall had instantly returned to normal.From beginning to end, all he did was sit there silently, not expressing his opinion.\u201cOfficer, I feel much better. Now can you tell me why my butler, servants, and bodyguards could also hear the cries and moans? This shouldn\u2019t just be solely a psychological illness of mine, right?\u201d Deweyville looked at him curiously.Inspector Tolle, who knew the underlying truth, instantly became nervous.Klein replied without much expression, \u201cIn psychology, we call this phenomenon\u2014mass hysteria.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 - Psychological ExpertPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 92: Psychological ExpertTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudios\u201cMass hysteria?\u201d Sir Deweyville, who had met many psychiatrists recently, ruminated over the term Klein had said.Despite their curiosity, his butler, bodyguards, and servants didn\u2019t make a single sound since they had not been given permission by him.As for Sergeant Gate, he looked towards Klein doubtfully as if he had never heard of that concept.Klein controlled his habit of tapping the armrest with his fingertips and calmly explained, \u201cHumans can be fooled easily by their sensory organs. Mass hysteria is a kind of psychogenic illness that is a result of tense nerves and other factors amongst a group of individuals as they influence each other.\u201dThe jargon he spewed out confused Sir Deweyville, Sergeant Gate, and the rest, causing them to subconsciously opt to believe him.\u201cLet me give a simple example of this; this was one of the cases that I previously dealt with, one man held a dinner banquet and invited 35 guests. Midway, he suddenly felt disgusted and puked. After that, he even had severe diarrhea. After a couple times, he began to believe that he had gotten food poisoning. He shared his speculation with the other guests on the way to the hospital.\u201cIn the next two hours, there were more than 30 guests that had diarrhea amongst the 35 guests, with 26 of them experiencing nausea. They flooded the entire emergency room of the hospital.\u201cThe doctors went through a detailed examination and performed cross checks, and they concluded that the very first man didn\u2019t have food poisoning at all. Instead, it was a result of stomach inflammation caused by the change of weather and cold liquor.\u201cThe most surprising fact was that none of the guests who went to the hospital had food poisoning. In fact, not a single one of them was sick.\u201cThat is mass hysteria.\u201dDeweyville nodded slightly and marveled, \u201cI understand now. Humans do lie to themselves easily. It\u2019s no wonder that Emperor Roselle once said that a lie would become reality once it was repeated a hundred times.\u201cOfficer, how may I address you? You are the most professional psychiatrist I have ever met.\u201d\u201cInspector Moretti.\u201d Klein pointed at his epaulet and said, \u201cSir, your troubles have been resolved temporarily for now. You can try to sleep now while I determine if there are any other problems. If you are able to sleep well, please allow us to bid farewell ahead of time instead of waiting for you to wake up.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Deweyville massaged his forehead, took his cane, and walked upstairs to his bedroom.Half an hour later, a police carriage left the fountain at the door of Deweyville\u2019s residence.When Sergeant Gate got off on the way and returned to his police station, Inspector Tolle looked towards Klein. He complimented in jest, \u201cEven I believed that you were a real psychological expert\u2026\u201dBefore he finished his sentence, he saw the young man in a black-and-white checkered uniform looking expressionless. His eyes were deep and serene as he forced a smirk on his face and said, \u201cI only had some experience with it in the past.\u201dInspector Tolle fell silent until the carriage arrived outside 36 Zouteland Street.\u201cThank you for your assistance, allowing Sir Deweyville to be finally free from his problems and be able to find sleep again.\u201d He extended his hand and shook Klein\u2019s hand. \u201cThank Dunn on my behalf.\u201dKlein nodded slightly and said, \u201cAlright.\u201dHe went up the stairs and returned to the Blackthorn Security Company. He knocked and entered the captain\u2019s office.\u201cDone?\u201d Dunn was waiting for his lunch.\u201cDone.\u201d Klein massaged his forehead, and kept his reply short and simple. \u201cThe root of the problem stemmed from the lead and porcelain factory under Sir Deweyville. From the moment they were established to this day, too many deaths have been caused by lead poisoning. And every accident left Sir Deweyville with some resentful spirituality.\u201d\u201cGenerally speaking, that wouldn\u2019t bring too big of a problem. That might cause nightmares, at the most.\u201d Dunn had experienced similar cases with his plethora of experience.Klein nodded slightly and said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s usually the case. But, unfortunately, Sir Deweyville encountered a female worker who died of lead poisoning on the streets. She collapsed by the side of the street and happened to catch a glimpse of the Deweyville\u2019s family emblem. She also harbored intense indignation, worry, and desires. It was only when Sir Deweyville gave her parents, brother, and sister a compensation of three hundred pounds did her emotions dissipate.\u201d\u201cThis is a societal problem. It isn\u2019t rare in the Age of Steam and Machinery.\u201d Dunn took out his smoking pipe, smelled the tobacco, and sighed. \u201cWorkers that make linen work in damp environments, and are generally diagnosed with bronchitis and joint related ailments. As for factories with serious powder and dust issues, even if the dust isn\u2019t poisonous, it can still accumulate into lung problems\u2026 Sigh\u2026 We don\u2019t have to talk about this. As the kingdom develops, I believe these problems will be resolved. Klein, let\u2019s find a restaurant tonight to celebrate you becoming an official member, alright?\u201dKlein thought for a moment before saying, \u201cHow about tomorrow\u2026 Captain, I have used Spirit Vision for an extended period of time today and also used dream divination to directly interact with those resentments. I\u2019m feeling especially drained. I want to return home in the afternoon to get some rest. Would that be okay? Oh, then I\u2019ll head over to the Divination Club at about four or five in the afternoon to see how the club members are reacting to news of Hanass Vincent\u2019s sudden death.\u201d\u201cNo problem, that\u2019s only necessary.\u201d Dunn chuckled. \u201cTomorrow night it is. Let\u2019s do it at Old Will\u2019s Restaurant next door. I\u2019ll get Rozanne to make a reservation.\u201dKlein took off his police peak cap and stood up to salute him.\u201cThank you, Captain. See you tomorrow.\u201dDunn lifted his hand and said, \u201cHold on, did you mention that Sir Deweyville gave the female worker\u2019s parents a compensation of three hundred pounds?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Klein nodded and immediately understood the reason why the captain had mentioned it. \u201cYou are worried that they will get into trouble because of their wealth?\u201dDunn sighed.\u201cI\u2019ve seen many similar situations in the past. Pass me their address, I\u2019ll ask Kenley to arrange for them to leave Tingen for another city, to start life anew.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Klein replied in a deep voice.With all of that done, he left Dunn\u2019s office and entered the break room diagonally opposite. He changed into his original suit and left the police uniform in his locker.Klein took the public carriage back to Daffodil Street in silence. He took off his coat and top hat. He then heated up the leftovers from last night and ate them with the last piece of wheat bread to fill his stomach.Then, he went to the second floor, hung his clothes, and slumped into bed.When he woke up, the pocket watch showed that it was already ten past two in the afternoon. The sun was hanging high up in the sky and the sunlight shone through the clouds.Underneath the golden splendor, Klein stood next to his desk and looked out the oriel window. He watched the pedestrians in old ragged clothing as they entered or left Iron Cross Street.Phew\u2026 He let out a breath slowly, finally overcoming his low spirits.Every journey had to be taken one step at a time. Likewise, his Sequence needed to be advanced one level at a time. Everything worked like that.He shook his head and sat down. He started concluding and reorganizing his encounter over the last week, so as to reinforce the important points in his mind to prevent himself from forgetting them.Five minutes before three in the afternoon.Above a blurry, boundless, grayish-white, silent gray fog stood a lofty palace. An ancient mottled bronze table sat there quietly.On the seat of honor at the long table sat a man already engulfed by the thick gray fog.Klein leaned against the back of the chair and contemplated. He suddenly extended his hand and tapped on the crimson stars that represented Justice and The Hanged Man.\u2026Backlund, Empress Borough.Audrey lifted her dress as she quickly walked towards her bedroom.Suddenly, she felt something and looked sideways at the shadow sitting on the balcony. As expected, she saw her golden retriever, Susie, who was sitting there in silence, observing her as always.Audrey sighed and drew a crimson moon on her chest. She then got closer and looked down at her golden retriever from a commanding position.\u201cSusie, that\u2019s not right. This is peeping. A Spectator has to observe in an open manner.\u201dThe golden retriever lifted its head to look at its owner and shook its tail.After nagging her dog, Audrey didn\u2019t delay any further and continued walking towards her bedroom again.In the few seconds of opening and closing the door, she suddenly had a weird idea.\u201cI wonder if Mr. Fool would allow Susie to enter that mysterious space. Then, there would be four members in the Tarot Gathering! And all of them would be Beyonders!\u201cNo way, Susie can\u2019t talk. If they were to let her express her opinion and share her thoughts, what would she do? Woof woof woof? Howl howl? Eww, why am I mimicking a dog\u2019s bark here\u2026\u201cJust imagining such a scene feels really strange. A mysterious and solemn gathering with the sudden barking of a dog\u2026 Mr. Fool would definitely kick us out of the Tarot Gathering directly\u2026\u201dAudrey locked the door and sat by the side of her bed. She took out a piece of old yellowish-brown paper from underneath her pillow.She read it repeatedly and entered her Spectator state.\u2026In a particular area of the Sonia Sea, an old sailboat which was in pursuit of the Listener had already left the Rorsted Archipelago.Seafarer Alger Wilson was worried that the wall clock\u2019s machinery would malfunction, so he entered the captain\u2019s cabin about half an hour earlier in case he had misjudged the time which would cause his subordinates to see him getting pulled into the Tarot Gathering.In front of him was a glass of nearly transparent liquor. The rich aroma swirled strand after strand into his nostrils.Alger trembled once again when he thought of the impending Gathering, the boundless fog that presented itself in front of him in the hotel\u2019s corridor, and the mysterious Fool who sat in the middle of the gray fog.He lifted his glass and took a gulp, using the burning sensation in his throat to ease the emotions that had stirred within him.Very soon, he restored his calm. He was as calm and stoic as he always was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He pressed down with his right arm and spoke with his normal tone, replying as though it was natural.\u201cGreat, this means that we are on the path of excellence. If you have any matters to tend to that leave you unable to attend the gathering on Mondays, conduct the ritual and inform me. All you have to do is change the line in the incantation \u2018I pray for a good dream\u2019 with the reason.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Audrey quickly agreed. \u201cMr. Fool, I obtained another page of Emperor Roselle\u2019s diary. I believe I still owe you one page.\u201d\u201cI was away from land this week and haven\u2019t found any new pages.\u201d Alger placed his right hand near his chest and bowed in apology.\u201cNo matter. I expected my request to take a long time.\u201d Klein leaned back into his chair and tapped the armrest with his index finger. He looked at Miss Justice and said, \u201cYou can express the contents of the diary now.\u201dAudrey bowed slightly and said, \u201cAs you wish.\u201dA pen suddenly appeared before her. She recalled the symbols that she had memorized and tried her best to transcribe them.In seconds, she saw that the goatskin was already filled with content. The strange symbols neatly covered the entire page.After checking the contents, she put down the fountain pen and said, \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201dKlein raised his hand and the goatskin parchment appeared in his palm.Shifting his gaze down, he started reading without emotion.\u201cJuly 9th. I suddenly thought of an interesting question. Since the Sequence pathways are also called the \u2018Blessings of The Divinities\u2019 or \u2018Pathways of The Divinities\u2019, then why would the stone slate that records the completed twenty-two Sequence pathways be called the \u2018Blasphemy Slate\u2019. Blasphemy, what an interesting term\u2026 Just who is the one blasphemed?\u201cAnd who created the Blasphemy Slate? How could that person hold all of the Sequence pathways? Just what other information was on the stone? I really want to see it\u2026\u201cJuly 12th. I\u2019ve realized another fact today. The Sealed Artifacts are an important component of a church\u2019s overall strength, even though some of the sealed items are very, very dangerous. Among the seven churches, the God of Craftsmanship wields the least number of Sealed Artifacts which are also relatively less dangerous\u2026 Did I join an organization without a future? No, I should think of it this way; only a blank piece of paper can produce a good painting. A weak organization is the best place for me to display my abilities!\u201cJuly 14th. I saw that mysterious Mr. Zaratul again. I never expected him to be the leader of an ancient organization, the Secret Order!\u201dKlein\u2019s pupils constricted when he read this. He nearly revealed an unnatural expression.The Zaratul family only had a certain connection with the Secret Order in the notes of the Church of the Evernight Goddess. But now, he learned from Emperor Roselle that the mysterious Mr. Zaratul was further determined to be the leader of the Secret Order.From the looks of it, it is an unquestionable fact that the Secret Order holds the Seer Sequence pathway\u2026While Klein was reading the diary, Audrey looked over and began observing him out of habit.However, her field of vision was completely obscured by the thick fog.Momentarily taken aback, Audrey snapped back to her senses and turned her head frantically to look at the other illusory dark red star.I was too reckless, too insolent, too foolish in trying to observe Mr. Fool\u2026 I was lucky, lucky that he isn\u2019t angry. Audrey stuck out her tongue secretly and pretended to admire the scenery. She was just short of humming a lively tune.Alger sat silently, his gaze never leaving the long bronze table. He knew his place, as if he was in the presence of a true god.Klein collected himself and scanned the last portion of the diary.\u201cAfter learning that I had become a Savant, Mr. Zaratul mentioned that I had chosen a difficult, yet relatively safe path. I asked him why that was the case, but all he did was smile before telling me that the Sequence pathway contains secrets beyond my imagination. I couldn\u2019t help but ask him which Sequence pathway he selected. He told me that his Sequence 9 was Seer.\u201cI intentionally mocked him and asked if every Seer only disclosed half-truths, never explaining things more clearly. Furthermore, he was clearly a powerful High-Sequence Beyonder. There was no need for him to continue acting as a Seer!\u201cMr. Zaratul told me that it was a habit he adopted from back when he was a Seer, and that this was a method that could pique my curiosity and make me cooperate with him. He hoped that I could help him steal a dangerous sealed item from the Church of the God of Craftsmanship, a relic of the Antigonus family.\u201cClearly, this must wait until I become a core member of the Church of the God of Craftsmanship. I asked Mr. Zaratul how long it would take to digest the potion if I used the acting method, and what standards I should use to determine if I had digested it completely.\u201cHe told me that for the lower Sequences, it would only take half a year to digest the potion as long as one strictly used the acting method. In fact, in the fastest case, it might only take a month. And standard measure for progress was simple; every Beyonder would sense it immediately once the potion was completely digested. It is what it is.\u201cI asked him for more details, but he merely smiled at me.\u201cTo hell with his smiles, I\u2019ll beat up every Seer I see when I become a High-Sequence Beyonder!\u201d\u2026Rest in peace, Emperor\u2026 Klein read the diary several times before looking at Justice and The Hanged Man again.\u201cSorry for the wait.\u201d\u201cIt is our honor.\u201d Audrey was still shocked, forgetting that she was a Spectator.She looked at The Hanged Man and organized her words.\u201cWhere can I find the Psychology Alchemists?\u201dPsychology Alchemists\u2026 Klein suddenly recalled the man buying supplementary ingredients for the Spectator potion at the Tingen underground market.Perhaps he was a member of the Psychology Alchemists?Just as Klein was considering how to get closer to that man, The Hanged Man, Alger Wilson shook his head and said, \u201cMiss Justice, firstly, I don\u2019t have a clue. Secondly, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any rush in seeking out the Psychology Alchemists. What you should focus on now is completely digesting the Spectator potion.\u201dAudrey glanced at The Fool and noticed that he didn\u2019t have any intention of adding to the conversation. She nodded in disappointment and said, \u201cAll I want is to have plenty of time to prepare so that I can approach them more naturally. Alright, then when can I digest the Spectator potion and stop acting? Is there a standard that indicates when I can? I\u2019m almost at the point where I no longer feel frustrated, nor do I hear the constant murmuring anymore.\u201dAlger looked at The Fool in the fog but saw that he didn\u2019t have any intention of speaking. He then deliberated before saying, \u201cIf you don\u2019t use the acting method, the typical rule of thumb is to wait three years and confirm that you no longer feel restless or receive any auditory or visual illusions. There is one simple test to determine when you can. That method is to exhaust your body to its limit. If you still don\u2019t hear any maniacal murmurings or see any strange things at that point, that would mean that you\u2019re ready to advance.\u201d\u201cWith regards to the acting method, I have also just come into contact with it. It feels good, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll take three years.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t useful at all\u2026 Three years, that\u2019s too long\u2026 Audrey criticized inwardly.She had just thought about this when she heard an armrest being tapped.Audrey froze, then turned her head in joy. She saw The Fool tapping on the edge of the long table.Alger sat straighter, waiting for The Fool to speak.Klein said in his normal tone, \u201cFor Low-Sequence Beyonders, as long as you strictly stick to acting, you should be able to digest the medicine in half a year. It\u2019s even possible to do it in a month.\u201dHe looked at Justice and added, \u201cAs for the signs of digestion, you\u2019ll know it when it comes. It doesn\u2019t need to be taught.\u201d\u201cOne month\u2026 Great! Thank you, Mr. Fool!\u201d Audrey exclaimed while brimming with joy.Miss Justice, don\u2019t think that you are the chosen one. The key point is half a year\u2026 Klein lifted his right hand and placed it beside his lips.\u201cHalf a year\u2026\u201d Alger repeated softly.Audrey sensed joy, relief, and intense doubt in his tone.What is he suspicious about? Audrey thought as she asked, \u201cMr. Fool, have you considered adding more members?\u201dKlein leaned back casually. He had long prepared an answer.\u201cThis started as a trial, so I didn\u2019t spend much time thinking about extending our meetings.\u201cBut now, as a regular gathering, we must choose our members carefully. Secrecy is our motto.\u201dAudrey nodded gently and said, \u201cThat is to say that we have to follow a process of observation, recommendation, and testing process. Yes, a process.\u201d\u201cYou can interpret it that way,\u201d Klein affirmed.In his mind he was thinking about how he could inquire about the Secret Order and the Clown potion.How can I ask questions in a way that befits my status? Klein was placed in a difficult spot.At that moment, realizing that Justice temporarily had nothing else to say, Alger took the initiative to speak, \u201cI\u2019ve heard that a Listener from the Aurora Order is searching for traces of the True Creator, which is the holy residence they advocate.\u201d\u201cTrue Creator?\u201d Audrey asked, puzzled.\u201cIt is an ancient entity worshiped by numerous secret organizations and cults. They believe that the Creator hasn\u2019t completely perished. The Core he left behind is the True Creator.\u201d Alger gave a rough explanation. \u201cSince the Fifth Epoch, the True Creator has appeared in many forms, such as The Hanged Giant or the Eye behind the Shadow Curtains. Heh heh, many people believe that Emperor Roselle referenced the imagery of the True Creator when he was creating the tarot cards; hence, there exists the card of The Hanged Man.\u201dAt this point, he looked at Klein and said, \u201cMr. Fool, there\u2019s nothing with what I said, right?\u201dIs he trying to probe for my views on the True Creator? Klein thought about the bloody man on the cross that the Captain saw in Hanass Vincent\u2019s dream and immediately had an idea.Doesn\u2019t both the hanging and the shadows imply evil connotations?Therefore, he chuckled and said, \u201cI am more inclined to call him, the Fallen Creator.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 - Hidden SagePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 94: Hidden SageTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudios\u201cThe Fallen Creator\u2026 Fallen\u2026\u201d Alger ruminated over The Fool\u2019s words and fell deep in thought.However, what struck Alger the most was The Fool\u2019s relaxed, natural, and nonchalant attitude.He acted as if they were equal!If he hadn\u2019t experienced their previous ritual, Alger might have thought The Fool was merely bluffing, and building himself up to intimidate him and Justice. But now, he was of the opinion that even if The Fool was inferior to the True Creator, he was at least close to that level.It\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s also an opportunity\u2026 Alger muttered softly. He then spoke with a smile, \u201cMr. Fool, your description is indeed more appropriate. According to our observations, Beyonders who believed in the True Creator, no\u2014the Fallen Creator, have a higher probability of losing control. The rest of them are mostly psychopaths.\u201dThat\u2019s something that the Nighthawks\u2019 intelligence mentioned as well\u2026 And the so-called \u2018psychopaths\u2019 didn\u2019t lose their sanity; instead, their ideologies become twisted\u2026 Klein maintained his seated posture but didn\u2019t continue with the conversation.He was still considering how to inquire about the Secret Order and Clown potion, but he couldn\u2019t figure out a way of asking the questions in a way that fit with his persona.It\u2019s such a pity that the Gathering is still so different from an Internet forum. Otherwise, I could create another smurf account to join the Gathering, and that account would be in charge of asking questions that are inconvenient for me to ask\u2026 Perhaps, one day, I\u2019ll learn mirror-related magic and give it a try. For example, I can make half the members here my smurf accounts\u2026There are twenty-two chairs here, and there are twenty-two cards in the tarot deck. That matches up perfectly. But when I \u2018created\u2019 this divine hall, I didn\u2019t even name myself \u2018The Fool\u2019 or have any intention of forming a \u2018Tarot Club\u2019. Hmm, do these symbolize the twenty-two different Sequence pathways?I wanted a divine hall, so a divine hall appeared. If I wanted a smurf account, would I get a smurf account\u2026Upon seeing The Fool remain silently engulfed in the thick gray fog, Audrey asked both wistfully and curiously, \u201cThat sounds scary. Mr. Hanged Man, could you share, in detail, information about each, and every mysterious organization? And also the matters regarding each secret cult? It\u2019s hard for me to come into contact with them during my daily life. I can only understand them through the both of you. I\u2019m willing to pay for it. May I know what you\u2019d like in return?\u201dThat\u2019s a great question! Miss Justice, you\u2019re playing the role of my smurf account to a certain extent\u2026 This way, The Hanged Man will definitely bring up the Secret Order\u2026 You\u2019re the best! Klein\u2019s mind stirred when he heard that, but he didn\u2019t let his emotions show through his expression or movements.Alger thought for a moment before saying, \u201cI need money\u2014a thousand pounds. It\u2019d be best if they weren\u2019t bills marked by a serial number. Or maybe gemstones that have just been unearthed. Price them according to the Backlund Jewelry Exchange\u2019s monthly average price.\u201dA thousand pounds? That\u2019s a huge sum of money. It could be used to buy a house in a high-class street in Tingen City! Not everyone would have that available immediately\u2026 Captain might have an annual salary like that, I guess? Hayley\u2019s death compensation was only three hundred pounds\u2026 Although Miss Justice is a noble, she obviously hasn\u2019t inherited her family\u2019s wealth yet, and she\u2019ll only be receiving some sort of annual allowance\u2026 Hmm, it\u2019s no wonder that The Hanged Man stated that it could be paid via gemstones\u2026 Klein was very sensitive towards monetary figures. Luckily, he was blanketed in thick fog.For a single lady or madam, two thousand pounds could let her live a decent life!If two thousand pounds were invested, the investment could reliably produce an annual return of about a hundred pounds.\u201cA thousand pounds?\u201d Audrey said, sounding shocked. She then replied happily, \u201cNo problem, do I send it to the previous address?\u201dJudging by Miss Justice\u2019s tone, she finds it very cheap? Klein didn\u2019t look over.Alger was quiet for a good twenty seconds before he said, \u201cYes, send it to the Warrior &amp; Sea Bar at Pelican Street, in the White Rose Borough of Pritz Harbor. Tell the boss, Williams, that it\u2019s what the \u2018Captain\u2019 wants.\u201cAlright.\u201d Audrey leaned back and posed in a Spectator-like manner. \u201cMr. Hanged Man, you can start now.\u201dAlger looked at The Fool, deliberated for a moment before saying slowly, \u201cLet\u2019s start from the Moses Ascetic Order. It is the earliest hidden organization. Of course, many think that the earliest hidden organizations are the Church of the Evernight Goddess, the Church of Mother Earth, and the Church of the God of Combat.\u201cThese people must be from the Church of Lord of Storms, the Church of Eternal Blazing Sun, or the Church of the God of Knowledge and Wisdom,\u201d Audrey refuted sulkily.The Church of the Goddess is the earliest hidden organization? That was the first time Klein had heard of such a claim.What exactly happened in the Fourth Epoch or the Third Epoch?Alger smiled and said, \u201cThe truth is buried in ancient history. Only one thing is certain: no one has ever said that the Church of Lord of Storms, the Church of Eternal Blazing Sun, or the Church of the God of Knowledge and Wisdom were once hidden organizations.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s save some time and return to main topic. The Moses Ascetic Order was first established by a few humans that had read the Blasphemy Slate. They believed in an non-anthropomorphic god, called \u2018the Hidden Sage\u2019.\u201d\u201cThe description is that of a god, but it is more of an ideology, a natural law. For example, all objects are numeric. The Hidden Sage is an embodiment of Spirit Numerology. Or that knowledge is supreme, and the Hidden Sage is knowledge itself. Hence, the original Moses Ascetic Order was a very respectable organization, and it maintained a good relationship with the other major churches.\u201cThe members of the organization led ascetic lives to resist losing control and to resolve the effects of the Remnant potion. They strictly kept their order\u2019s secrets, and they upheld moral and religious precepts. They believe that humans continuously reincarnate after death\u2026\u201cThe Sequence 9 that they grasp is called Mystery Pryer\u2026 The word \u2018Warlock\u2019 was also spread from that organization.\u201dAudrey listened to The Hanged Man\u2019s description carefully and asked sharply, \u201cYou said that the Moses Ascetic Order used to be a respectable organization. Are they not one anymore?\u201dAlger nodded his head indiscernibly.\u201cYes, they have fallen into corruption and are now an evil organization.\u201d\u201cWhy? I find their beliefs very good and very normal,\u201d Audrey expressed her confusion.That was Klein\u2019s confusion too. The information that he could get at his security clearance didn\u2019t provide the reason for the Moses Ascetic Order\u2019s fall from grace.Alger looked at the unfathomable Fool and tersely agreed.\u201cI am not sure of the real reason. It might be because it has been buried by history. However, I have heard one terrifying explanation.\u201cIn that story, the main reason why the Moses Ascetic Order fell into corruption was because the god that they believed in, the Hidden Sage, had come to life!\u201cHe became the personification of an evil god!\u201d\u201cCame to life? This\u2026 how?\u201d Audrey found it unimaginable as she replied with an incredulous tone.Without realizing it, she had exited from her Spectator state.It\u2019s like a horror story, but the ghost is even a god\u2026 Klein\u2019s heart stirred with a surge of emotions as well.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, no one knows the answer.\u201d Alger had originally wanted to casually say, \u201cMaybe Mr. Fool would know,\u201d but he held back the urge.He had already teetered on the borders of danger once.In the The Book of Storms 5:7, there was a saying that Alger remembered clearly, which was: \u201cDo not test God!\u201dAudrey calmed herself down and didn\u2019t press for more answers. She gestured for him to continue.Klein maintained his seated posture and his silence, validating The Hanged Man\u2019s descriptions with his own understanding.Finally, he realized that there were four points that he needed to take note of.First, the Demoness Sect was also known as the Demoness Family in the Fourth Epoch. Back then, they had very few members, and their beliefs were passed down through their bloodlines. Plus, they would kill the fathers of their children and abandon the baby boys. Hence, all the members were female. Of course, that was all from Alger\u2019s description, and there was no way to verify it at the moment.Second, the Numinous Episcopate that believed in Death and the Rose School of Thought that liked bloody sacrificial worship ceremonies both originated in the Southern Continent. After the colonial era came, they almost vanished under attacks by the seven churches. But as such, they began spreading to the Northern Continent.Third, the current Psychology Alchemists was similar to the earlier Moses Ascetic Order. They believed in an non-anthropomorphic existence and believed that the human spirit could change everything.Fourth, the Secret Order had the lowest activity level among all the other hidden organizations. Thus, they were the most unknown. Every time they appeared, they seem to be after something or looking for something.What are they after or looking for? Klein suddenly recalled the diary which he had read earlier: The leader of the Secret Order, Zaratul, cooperated with the Roselle. His goal was to get something left behind by the Antigonus Family.Their appearance that time was to look for the lost notebook, the Antigonus family notebook\u2026 Klein narrowed his eyes slightly and felt that he had apparently found the key reason for the Secret Order\u2019s actions.They are after the things that the Antigonus family left behind!Klein suppressed his urge to tap the edge of the table as his thoughts appeared one after another.Oh, they were looking for remnant traces the Antigonus family left behind?Then must I direct my focus onto these areas to obtain the Clown potion formula from the Secret Order?After a further exchange of information, Klein announced the end of the Gathering.\u201cBy your will.\u201d Audrey and Alger stood up together.Cutting off the connections, he saw both their figures shatter and disappear. Klein rubbed his glabella and attempted conjuring a smurf account with his mind.As he thought, a figure appeared at the furthest end of the long bronze table. That figure was wearing a black tuxedo, a silk top hat, and a dull expression. His actions were clumsy and inarticulate. Even though he was engulfed in gray fog, it was obvious that something was wrong with him.That won\u2019t do\u2026 Klein experimented a few more times before sighing and dismissing the idea of creating a smurf account.He attempted other things too. He continued to sit above the gray fog in the seat of honor at the long bronze table. He considered what Audrey had said, and he cast his gaze curiously at the illusory crimson stars.After a moment of silence, Klein started to pray as a form of feedback instead of establishing contact with those stars.Amidst the tranquility and silence, he didn\u2019t receive any feedback from the ten plus crimson stars nearby.In order to receive feedback, I need to pull someone above the gray fog before I can reply? Klein nodded as he thought, feeling somewhat disappointed.He didn\u2019t want to violate someone else\u2019s will and forcefully pull them into this mysterious space.Hmm\u2026 Klein was just getting ready to leave, but he habitually touched a nearby illusory crimson star.Just then, he suddenly felt that there was a faint and insignificant prayer deep inside the crimson star!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 - The SupplicantPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 95: The SupplicantTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudios\u201cA prayer?\u201dKlein\u2019s mind stirred as he used the same method he used back when he spied on The Hanged Man. He allowed his spirituality to spread outward and touch the crimson blob.A hazy and contorted image appeared within his sight. He could faintly see a blond teen kneeling on the ground, facing a pure crystal ball.That teenager was dressed in a tight-fitting black outfit, with a style very different from the contemporary styles of the Loen Kingdom. It was more congruent with the traditional clothing of the Feysac Empire and the Intis Republic that Klein had seen from reading magazines.The area surrounding the teenager was dark and had old furniture. From time to time, the room would be illuminated, but Klein couldn\u2019t hear the roaring thunder or the pattering of rain.In the image, the teenager had his hands on his forehead, fingers crossed. He bowed forward, continually praying for something. His thick accent buzzed in Klein\u2019s ears.Klein listened attentively but discovered an awkward fact.He couldn\u2019t understand what the other party was saying. It was a language that he had never come across in his life!\u2026To think that I cannot understand a foreign language even though I am the mysterious ruler of this world above the gray fog\u2026 Klein gave a self-deprecating laugh. He indignantly tried listening in once again in a manner more attentive than when he had to do English listening comprehension tests back on Earth.As he was listening to the prayers, he gradually discovered something.Even though he had never learned the language the young man was speaking, he found that it had similarities to Ancient Feysac!Father\u2026 Mother\u2026 Those are likely the meanings of those two terms, right? It is quite similar to Ancient Feysac, but not without its differences\u2026 Klein creased his brows and slipped into deep thought. Ancient Feysac was a common language in the Fourth Epoch. It is also the root language of all the contemporary languages of this era. Furthermore, it is still evolving\u2026 I cannot confirm it right now\u2026He listened to it over and over again, eliminating the possibility of the language being a modern language like Loen, Feysac, or Intis.Could it be a dialect of Ancient Feysac? Like the language used in the Antigonus family\u2019s diary? Klein tapped his finger on the edge of the bronze table and nodded indiscernibly. There was another possibility. Ancient Feysac didn\u2019t spring into existence out of nothing, it was an evolution of Jotun, the language of the Giants\u2026 The Feysac Empire in the north has always claimed that its people possesses the bloodline of the Giants. Perhaps, this is ancient Jotun.At this point, Klein, who lacked knowledge, could only stop. He retracted his spirituality, without looking or listening in to that scene.He had no intention of pulling the praying teen up above the fog immediately. He wanted to know what the young man was talking about first.Of course, before that, he had to observe him frequently and conduct basic \u2018tests\u2019.Phew. Klein exhaled as he leaned back in his chair.He enveloped himself with his spirituality and simulated the feeling of falling.\u2026After \u201crevising\u201d Roselle\u2019s diary, Klein changed into his formal wear and left for the Divination Club.He took the public transport despite his pay rise, but he did splurge to support Mrs. Wendy\u2019s business. He spent 1.5 pence on sweet iced tea to combat the afternoon heat.When he arrived at Howes Street, Klein tossed the empty cup into the trash can and walked up to the second floor.Before entering the building, he pinched his glabella and activated his Spirit Vision.Klein had just entered the hall when he felt a faint, lingering grief.The pretty receptionist Angelica was sitting there; her slightly red eyes looked unfocused.\u201cThe grief will pass in time,\u201d Klein said with a gentle and firm tone as he walked toward Angelica.Angelica looked up abruptly and muttered, clearly confused, \u201cMr. Moretti\u2026\u201dShe quickly came to her senses and asked, perturbed, \u201cY-you already know about Mr. Vincent?\u201cOh right, I forgot that you\u2019re an exceptional fortune-teller.\u201dKlein sighed appropriately.\u201cI only managed to divine a very rough outline of what transpired\u2026 Just what exactly happened to Mr. Vincent?\u201d\u201cThe boss told us that Mr. Vincent had a heart attack in his sleep and left this world peacefully.\u201d Angelica cried as she said, \u201cHe was so friendly, so polite, a true gentleman. He was the spiritual mentor of so many of our members. H-he was still so young\u2026\u201d\u201cI am sorry for bringing up this sad topic.\u201d Klein didn\u2019t console her any further. He walked toward the meeting room slowly.Angelica took out a handkerchief and wiped her eyes and nose. She then looked at Klein\u2019s back and asked loudly, \u201cMr. Moretti, what would you like to drink?\u201d\u201cBlack tea.\u201d Klein preferred black tea to coffee, even though he found the black tea average.In comparison, he preferred ginger beer and sweet iced tea. But as a gentleman, it was not right for him to act like a child in a formal setting\u2026As it was a Monday, there were only five or six members in the meeting room. Using his Spirit Vision, Klein saw that they each had different colors of emotion. Some were grieving, some more dull, some relatively unaffected.They\u2019re all rather normal\u2026 normal reactions. Klein nodded slightly. He picked up his cane and found a spot in the room.He was about to deactivate his Spirit Vision when he saw Angelica walk in and walk towards him.\u201cMr. Moretti, a customer is looking for you. Well, it\u2019s the person from last time,\u201d the beautiful lady said with a hushed tone.\u201cYou still remember him?\u201d Klein asked with a smile.Hmm, I wonder if he bought the magical medicine as I instructed\u2026 I wonder if he still needs surgery\u2026Angelica covered her mouth and said, \u201cHe was the only person who was willing to wait an entire afternoon in the club for a divination.\u201dKlein grabbed his cane and stood up. He walked outside without saying anything.In the reception area, he found the person who had sought his services the other day. He also noticed that the aura near his liver had regained its normal color. His overall health had also improved.\u201cCongratulations, the feeling of being healthy is wonderful indeed.\u201d Klein smiled as he extended a hand.Bogda was first taken aback before he immediately extended both hands. He grabbed Klein\u2019s right palm tightly.\u201cMr. Moretti, you truly can \u2018see\u2019 my condition!\u201cYes, I have fully recovered! The doctors asked me questions over and over again, ran repeated tests on me, but they cannot believe that I recovered just like that!\u201dUpon hearing Bogda\u2019s ecstatic description, Klein calmly confirmed one thing\u2014the apothecary at Lawson\u2019s Folk Herb Store was definitely a Beyonder!He had seen how severe the man\u2019s liver disease had been. Fully healing him in the span of a few days was beyond the capability of herbs and medical ability. The only possible explanation was that of a Beyonder!Coupled with the incident with Glacis, there could only be one answer.\u201cI have to repent to God. To think that I would suspect you, suspect that miraculous doctor.\u201d Bogda refused to let go of Klein\u2019s hand. He continued on about his shame and gratitude, \u201c\u2026those ten pounds were truly money well spent. It bought my life back!\u201dWhat? Ten pounds? You spent ten pounds on the miraculous medicine? And you only gave me eight pence for my divination\u2026 Just eight pence\u2026 eight pence\u2026 pence\u2026 Klein was dazed just hearing about it.At this moment, Bogda released his hands as he took a step back while beaming. He bowed reverently and said, \u201cI am here today to express my gratitude. Thank you, Master Moretti. You showed me the way and saved my life.\u201cThis was the outcome of you paying to have something divined. You need not thank anybody.\u201d Klein lifted his head slightly and looked at the divide between the wall and the ceiling. His answer fully expressed the vibes of a charlatan.\u201cYou are a true seer,\u201d Bogda praised. \u201cNext, I\u2019ll be heading to Vlad Street to thank that apothecary and buy the medicine he recommended.\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t you already recovered?\u201d Klein expertly hid the shock in his voice.Bogda looked around, and laughed when he confirmed that the receptionist was not paying attention to them. He chuckled softly and said, \u201cThe doctor mentioned a concoction of herbs that includes mummy powder. It is a prescription that would satisfy both men and women\u2026 I didn\u2019t believe the doctor back then, but I have no more doubts now.\u201d\u2026There\u2019s a prescription like that? Klein suddenly felt that the apothecary was a cheat, and suspected if he had pushed the person in front of him into a fiery pit of doom.He observed Bogda and confirmed that there was no problem with his aura.\u201cMummy powder?\u201d Klein cautiously asked.\u201cYes, mummy powder. I have asked a friend, he said that even the nobles of Backlund are maniacally looking for such an item. It\u2019s a powder made by grinding mummies which gives men peak performance in bed. Even though it\u2019s disgusting and sounds dirty, it truly is a material used by the aristocrats\u2026\u201d Bogda gave a detailed description. He had an eager desire in his eyes.Mummies? Mummies made from corpses? Then grinding them to powder? Klein was dumbfounded. He nearly retched in front of Bogda.Those nobles sure are hardcore\u2026 Just as he was about to advise Bogda against doing so, Glacis, who had suffered from a lung disease previously, stepped into the door and heard Bogda\u2019s description.\u201cYes, it\u2019s very effective. I would recommend that you head to Lawson\u2019s Folk Herb Store at Vlad Street. Mr. Lawson\u2019s secret recipe is very effective!\u201d Glacis took off his spectacles and leaned over with interest. He recommended with a hushed tone, \u201cMy experience was very, very, very perfect.\u201d\u201cYou know of it too? I was just about to head to Mr. Lawson\u2019s Folk Herb Store.\u201d Bogda\u2019s worries vanished completely.After a short conversation, he left the Divination Club in a hurry.Up until then, Klein was still a little dumbfounded.He waited till twenty past five in the afternoon before putting on his hat and picking up his black cane. He took a carriage down to Vlad Street, intending to observe the apothecary named Lawson Darkweed before deciding if he should notify the captain or not.\u202618 Vlad Street.Klein stood outside the herb store and saw the closed door, as well as a subletting notice.\u2026Quite a wary man\u2026 he muttered silently.Since this had happened, he no longer had to be troubled or perform any observations.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He walked into the Blackthorn Security Company with steady footsteps.\u201cGood morning, Klein. The weather is so cool and beautiful today, I\u2019m looking forward to tonight\u2019s feast.\u201d Rozanne who was wearing a light green dress greeted him with a smile from behind the reception desk.Klein deliberately touched his stomach and said, \u201cMiss Rozanne, you shouldn\u2019t be talking about that so early in the morning! I\u2019m already sick of today\u2019s mission that has yet to arrive. I only hope for the evening to arrive sooner.\u201d\u201cMe too.\u201d Rozanne chuckled.She looked to the left and right, then she beckoned for Klein to come closer. She lowered her voice and said, \u201cI met Madam Daly earlier.\u201d\u201cSpirit Medium Madam Daly?\u201d Klein asked in surprise.The most famous Spirit Medium from Awwa County had been living at Enmat Harbor all this time, and it wasn\u2019t a short distance from Tingen.\u201cYes.\u201d Rozanne gave a firm nod and said, \u201cBut, she has already left. Ah, she is my ideal Beyonder. If I were to become a Spirit Medium, I would leave Tingen and travel all around the world by myself. To Intis, to Feysac, to Feynapotter, to the Southern Continent; to the vast prairies, primitive forests, and snow-covered plains!\u201dLady, be aware of the Nighthawks\u2019 rules\u2026 Klein shook his head in amusement.\u201cEven Madam Daly has to apply and obtain permission to leave Enmat Harbor.\u201d\u201cI know that, but you can\u2019t just remind me about it now and shatter my dreams!\u201d Rozanne said peeved. \u201cThe truth is, I would never become a Beyonder. It\u2019s too dangerous. I know when I\u2019ll die from sudden gunfire. From what I\u2019ve seen, Beyonders are basically people who turn themselves into monsters to fight against monsters.\u201d\u201cArchbishop Chanis said that we are guardians, but also a bunch of miserable wretches that are constantly fighting against threats and madness,\u201d Klein replied, sighing. The quote had left a deep impression on him.To fight against the abyss, we have to endure the corruption of the abyss.The two of them fell silent in unison. Rozanne was the first to break the silence as she pursed her lips towards the partition and said, \u201cCaptain wanted you to meet him when you arrived.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d With his hat and cane in hand, Klein passed through the partition and entered Dunn\u2019s office after knocking on the door.A middle-aged gentleman with deep and serene gray eyes and a high hairline put down his coffee cup and said with a smile.\u201cDaly was here.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t say that I\u2019m surprised; Rozanne had just informed me,\u201d Klein replied with a smile.Dunn didn\u2019t mind his humor but sighed.\u201cDaly was just transferred to the Backlund diocese, which is the world\u2019s busiest and most crowded city. They have the highest population of Beyonders and the most opportunities\u2026 She has a higher chance of becoming an archbishop or a senior deacon than me.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Klein asked curiously as he took a seat.Dunn thought for nearly twenty seconds before answering, \u201cShe has a unique talent in mastering and exploiting Sequence potions\u2026 I\u2019ve mentioned the internal rule of the Nighthawks before. If you want to consume the next potion in the Sequence, you\u2019ll have to wait three years and go through a strict examination to prevent any loss of control. But typically, three years is far from sufficient. I spent three years going from a Sleepless to a Midnight Poet. It took me nine years to go from a Midnight Poet to Nightmare\u2014a full nine years. And to go from Nightmare to Sequence 6, I\u2019ve already spent three years. I have no idea how many more years I need.\u201cWhen our bodies age and our energy starts to decline, even if we overcome the latent dangers, we shouldn\u2019t attempt advancing anymore. This is because the risk of losing control at that point is so high that no one is willing to risk it.\u201cAs for Daly and I, we are different from most Beyonders. After she became a Corpse Collector, she handed in a special application after only a year. She hoped to consume the follow-up potion immediately. What surprised everyone was that she actually passed through the stricter examination and obtained the Gravedigger potion.\u201cIt only took her one more year to go from Gravedigger to Spirit Medium. Heh, this year will be her fifth year as a Beyonder. She is only twenty-four this year, young enough to have many opportunities ahead of her.\u201dOn the surface, she\u2019s the most famous spirit medium in Awwa County, but she truly is an actual Spirit Medium\u2026 Isn\u2019t that acting? Old Neil had apparently mentioned that Madam Daly had similar tendencies\u2026 Klein felt that he had grasped the key reason for Madam Daly\u2019s quick ascension through the ranks.\u201cCaptain, you\u2019re young enough as well. You\u2019re only in your thirties,\u201d Klein comforted Dunn, but added in his heart, It\u2019s just that your memory isn\u2019t that great\u2026Dunn drank a sip of his coffee. He shook his head and smiled bitterly.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask Madam Daly about her method of mastering and exploiting Sequence potions?\u201d Klein purposely asked.Dunn put down his coffee cup and massaged his temples as he spoke.\u201cShe told me to become a true Nightmare\u2026 I don\u2019t know what that means.\u201dPlay the role of a Nightmare. Man, a Nightmare sounds sinister\u2026 Klein creased his eyebrows and temporarily fell silent.Then, Dunn took out his smoking pipe and sniffed at it.\u201cDaly and I discussed the possibility of Seer\u2019s follow-up potion being Clown. Assuming that the member of the Seers didn\u2019t lie to you, she brought up an interesting hypothesis.\u201d\u201cWhat hypothesis?\u201d Klein asked hurriedly, his eyes turning bright.He had once used a divination method to determine if Clown was the follow-up potion of Seer. The answer he received had been vague, but it seemed close to being a confirmation.Dunn\u2019s deep and serene gray eyes swept his gaze at him while he said in thought, \u201cA normal Sequence pathway proceeds in a stepped manner. They advance according to a particular similarity. For instance, Sleepless, Midnight Poet, and Nightmare are all obviously related to the darkness of the night, as well as the peaceful sleep and tranquility that is generated from sleep. It can be imagined that every subsequent Sequence would have identical traits, only with more power and a wider scope. They might be linked to secrets, disaster, horror, the crimson moon, etc\u2026\u201cCertain Sequence pathways appear unrelated, but when we analyze them in detail, we can still find similarities, such as Assassin and Instigator. Their implied similarity is to bring people calamities, pain, sorrow, and despair. Hence, the follow-up Sequences should abide by this pattern.\u201dKlein paid close attention and asked proactively, \u201cBut Seer and Clown doesn\u2019t have such a connection?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Dunn nodded and said, \u201cDaly believes that there might be Sequence pathways that share another kind of relationship. After all, there\u2019s a lot we do not know.\u201dHe paused for a moment before saying, \u201cDaly said that, in this sort of pathway, the low to mid Sequence potions would respectively provide the Beyonder an ability that seems brand new and unrelated to the others. When the Beyonder reaches a point of qualitative change, these abilities will mix into an abnormally powerful \u2018job\u2019 that includes them all.\u201d\u201cIn other words, the pathway doesn\u2019t advance step by step, but instead it\u2019s a relationship of dissection and combination.\u201dKlein listened intently, but he felt lost. Dunn lifted his right hand and said, \u201cA normal Sequence pathway advances a bit at a time, just like a child growing up. A growing child becomes taller, stronger, heavier, and more mature from a young age.\u201d\u201cWhile special Sequence pathways are more like\u2026\u201dHaving said this, Dunn lifted up his thumb.\u201cThis is Sequence 9.\u201dThen, he lifted up his index finger.\u201cThis is Sequence 8.\u201dThen, he gradually lifted up the rest of his fingers.\u201cEach and every finger is independent, and doesn\u2019t seem to be related to the others. But in the end\u2026\u201dWhen he said the word \u2018end,\u2019 Dunn clenched his fingers into a tight fist!\u201cI understand now.\u201d Klein was suddenly enlightened. He agreed with Lady Daly\u2019s guess and the Captain\u2019s metaphor.Maybe that\u2019s how it is? He nodded in deep thought.Sequence 8 Clown and Sequence 9 Seer are completely different and have brand new abilities. And according to the description from the Nighthawks\u2019 intelligence, the corresponding Sequence 7 and Sequence 8 Clown don\u2019t share any similarities either\u2026Klein fell silent for a while before curiously pressing on, \u201cAt which stage would the different abilities combine to form a qualitative change?\u201dDunn took another sip of coffee and chuckled.\u201cDaly and I guessed Sequence 4!\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Klein blurted out.\u201cBecause according to the way the churches categorize Sequences, Sequence 4 is the beginning point of the higher Sequences. It is said that merely achieving such a level brings about qualitative changes in vitality and energy. In ancient times, Sequence 4 Beyonders were qualified to be called demigods in the Fourth Epoch. It\u2019s a pity that such Beyonders are very rare in this era,\u201d Dunn said wistfully.\u201cIf Sequence 4 to Sequence 1 are High-Sequence Beyonders, then who are the Low-Sequence Beyonders?\u201d Klein asked with interest.\u201cSequences 9 through 7 were considered as Low-Sequences a thousand years ago. But, in recent centuries, Beyonders are few in number and each church has listed Sequence 7 as a Mid-Sequence.\u201d Dunn laughed in a self-deprecating manner.Sequence 9 and Sequence 8 are Low-Sequences. Then, Sequences 7 through 5 are Mid-Sequences. Finally, those Sequence 4 and above are High-Sequences\u2026 Klein repeated in his head and inevitably felt a yearning for that.Emperor Roselle was a High-Sequence Beyonder!However, the higher the Sequence, the greater the risk of losing control\u2026 Klein thought to himself in fear.He asked as though in a seemingly casual manner, \u201cWhat is the Sequence 4 potion for the Church of the Goddess called?\u201d\u201cIn actual fact, I\u2019m not sure. My security clearance isn\u2019t high enough for me to be privy to that information. I\u2019ll be able to read them when I become a diocese bishop or Nighthawks deacon.\u201d Dunn shook his head and smiled. \u201cIn fact, at least half of the Church\u2019s thirteen archbishops and nine senior deacons at the top of the Church\u2019s hierarchy are below Sequence 4. Hmm, that\u2019s just me being optimistic. The archbishop Ince Zangwill, who became wanted, lost control when he tried to advance to Sequence 4.\u201dThe one who stole Sealed Artifact \u20180-08?\u2019 His potion was apparently called Gatekeeper\u2026 Klein thought and probed, \u201cIs Sleepless Sequence 5 Gatekeeper?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s in Spirit Medium\u2019s pathway. You\u2019ll be allowed to access that information when you reach Sequence 7 and become a bishop or a Captain of a Nighthawks team.\u201dGatekeeper is Sequence 5 of the Spirit Medium pathway? Does it mean that it\u2019s keeping watch over the gates to Hell? Or keeping watch over the gates to the Spirit World? Klein guessed.\u201cAlright, go to Old Neil and continue with your studies.\u201d Dunn smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget about dinner tonight, at Old Will\u2019s Restaurant. Reservations have been made. I\u2019ll introduce you to the rest of the Nighthawks officially.\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ve already prepared the money.\u201d Klein forced a smile.\u201cNo, there\u2019s no need. Have you forgotten that we have additional bonuses? The part about you completing an assigned mission.\u201d Dunn waved.Klein was momentarily taken aback before replying with a beaming smile, \u201cAlright, Captain.\u201dHe turned around and walked towards the door, while counting inwardly, Three, two, one\u2026 Eh, why didn\u2019t Captain call me back?Klein dragged out \u201cone\u201d for a very long time, only to be surprised that Captain Dunn Smith hadn\u2019t forgotten add anything.A miracle\u2026\u2026In the armory, Old Neil stole a glance at Klein, who was in a good mood.\u201cDon\u2019t be obsessed with tonight\u2019s dinner. You still have a lot of things to learn, such as more ritualistic magic, ancient Hermes, Dragonish, Elvish, and many more.\u201d\u201cYeah, every afternoon besides your day off, you have to have at least two hours of combat training with an instructor.\u201d\u201cCombat training? Captain didn\u2019t mention it\u2026\u201d Klein was shocked.Old Neil nodded and didn\u2019t hesitate to answer, \u201cHe forgot.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He turned his head in surprise.\u201cMy combat instructor lives here?\u201dShouldn\u2019t a combat artist who was selected by the Nighthawks be exceptional\u2026Leonard Mitchell, who had guided Klein there, snickered and said, \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate Mr. Gawain because of his residence\u2019s surroundings. Although he was never conferred an aristocratic title, he was a true knight back in the day.\u201dHaving said that, the poetic Nighthawk, who was dressed in a white shirt, black trousers, and buttonless leather boots suddenly felt melancholic.\u201cHe was active during the waning era of the knights. The warriors donning their armors would storm through enemy ranks despite the gunfire and cannon fire, destroying their enemies and redefining the battle lines. But alas, they were quickly met with the invention of the high-pressure steam guns and six-barrel machine guns. From then on, the knights had to gradually step down.\u201cMr. Gawain met the same fate. More than twenty years ago, the Awwa Knights\u2019 Order of Chivalry faced the most advanced weaponry of the Intis Republic army\u2026 Sigh, every time I recall this, it seems like I\u2019m touching the dust heaps of history. The poet in me stirs when thinking of this irreversible and fated destiny, but alas, I do not know how to compose the poem.\u201d\u2026Then what\u2019s the point in saying so much? Klein acted oblivious to Leonard\u2019s self-deprecation and gave a serious suggestion, \u201cMy university schoolmate once told me that the composing of poems requires a certain degree of talent. It\u2019s best you start by reading the Classical Poems Anthology of the Loen Kingdom.\u201dLeonard\u2019s mood changed on a whim. He replied with a light-hearted tone, \u201cI purchased that book a long time ago, as well as other titles, such as the Selected Poems of Emperor Roselle. I will work hard to become a true Midnight Poet, Mr. Seer\u201dIs he hinting at the\u2026 acting method? Klein replied, as though he couldn\u2019t understand him, \u201cYou would still need books on grammar.\u201d\u201cAlright, let\u2019s enter.\u201d Leonard extended his hand and pushed open the half-closed metallic gates. The two of them then followed the path towards the house.They were still a distance away from the house when Klein saw a tall man walking out from behind the main door.He had short blond hair, his brows already laced with white hairs. His facial features looked like they had been ravaged through age, his wrinkles were etched deep across his face.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d the aged man asked in a deep voice.\u201cMr. Gawain, as per your contract with the police department, this probationary inspector will be learning the art of combat under your guidance,\u201d Leonard explained with a smile.\u201cCombat? There\u2019s no need to study combat in this era.\u201d Gawain looked at Klein with turbid eyes and said in a dead voice, \u201cYou should learn how to draw your gun and shoot. You should master the most advanced weaponry.\u201dWas this the psychological trauma caused by the six-barrel machine guns and high-pressure steam guns? Klein didn\u2019t give a reckless reply; instead, he smiled and looked at Leonard.\u201cThe art of combat is still a skill a policeman has to master. Most of the criminals we face are not those who must be executed on the spot. Some might not even have weapons. In that case, we have to rely on combat techniques,\u201d Leonard said, obviously prepared for the situation.With a dark expression, Gawain fell silent for more than ten seconds before saying, \u201cThrow a punch.\u201dHe was speaking to Klein.Klein, who was not holding his cane, remembered the boxing matches he had seen in his previous life. He raised his arm and threw it forward.Gawain\u2019s lips twitched indiscernibly. He thought for a moment and said, \u201cKick.\u201dTilting to the side slightly and twisting his hips, Klein tightened his thigh muscles and kicked forward with his right foot.Cough\u2026 Gawain covered his mouth and cleared his throat. He looked at Leonard and said, \u201cI will honor my contract. But based on his foundation, he needs to come here four times a week, three hours each time, for the first month.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the combat expert. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d Leonard nodded without hesitation. He smiled and said to Klein, \u201cSee you at dinner.\u201dAfter Leonard walked out the metallic gates, Klein asked out of curiosity, \u201cInstructor, how should I begin practicing? Punching, or footwork?\u201dAs a qualified keyboard warrior, he understood the importance of footwork in combat.Gawain stood akimbo as he shook his head lethargically.\u201cWhat you need now is strength training.\u201cSee those? Those are two dumbbells made of steel. They shall be your partners for today.\u201cOther than that, you also have to practice deep squats, running, and rope-skipping. Let us take those one set at a time.\u201dWhile Klein was still in a daze, Gawain suddenly raised his voice and said sternly, \u201cUnderstood?\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201d At this moment, Klein felt as though he had returned to military training and was facing an inhumane instructor.\u201cChange out of your clothes. There\u2019s a set of knight\u2019s training clothes on the sofa.\u201d Gawain suddenly sighed. He turned around and walked toward the black steel dumbbells.\u2026Six in the evening, at a corner table of the Old Will Restaurant.Other than Frye, who was guarding Chanis Gate, all the members of the Blackthorn Security Company were present. There were six Nighthawks and five civilian staff.A white tablecloth was draped over the long table. Waiters carried over plates of food, portioned them before serving them to each individual guest.Klein saw steaks drenched in black pepper sauce. He saw bacon, sausages paired with mashed potatoes, egg puddings, asparagus, and specialty cheeses. He even saw rose-colored champagne. However, he had no appetite. The training in the afternoon had nearly made him vomit.Noticing the pale, newly-inducted Nighthawk with turbid eyes, Dunn raised the glass of red wine in front of him and laughed.\u201cLet us welcome our newest official member, Klein Moretti, cheers!\u201dThe cold and introverted black-haired lady, Royale Reideen, the Sleepless Kenley White, the sloppy Leonard Mitchell, as well as the white-haired, black-eyed Midnight Poet Seeka Tron all raised their cups and looked at the new member of their team.Klein fought back the discomfort of the training and raised his glass of amber champagne. He stood and said, \u201cThank you.\u201dHe clinked glasses with every Nighthawk, tilted his head back, and finished the small amount of champagne.\u201cIs our Miss Author not going to say something on this occasion?\u201d Dunn smiled as he looked at Seeka Tron.Seeka Tron was a lady in her thirties. She had average looks, but had an exceptional demeanor, one that was quiet and serene. Coupled with her few strands of graying hair, it added a unique charm to her.Klein had heard Old Neil mention that this Midnight Poet had taken on a side job as an author and had attempted to submit her works to newspapers and magazines. Unfortunately, only a few smaller newspapers had accepted them.Seeka smiled and looked at Dunn.\u201cIn order to make the term \u2018Miss Author\u2019 into a reality, Captain, I think you should give me some funds to self-publish my work.\u201dDunn laughed.\u201cYou should learn from Old Neil and give me a more suitable reason.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m most impressed with Mr. Neil in this department!\u201d Rozanne echoed in-between her mouthfuls of roast mutton.Amidst the chatter and laughter, Leonard looked at Klein and said with a chuckle, \u201cAre you so tired that you have no appetite to eat?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Klein sighed.\u201cIf you haven\u2019t touched your food yet, I can be of assistance.\u201d Leonard acted as though he didn\u2019t want to waste any food.Klein didn\u2019t mind. He nodded and said, \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be an issue.\u201dAnd with that, a good portion of the food in front of him was eaten by Leonard and the rest.Nearing the end of the dinner, the waiters served plates of beef pudding and ice-cream.Klein tasted ice-cream and found it cold and sweet. It was particularly appetizing.Before he realized it, he had finished the ice-cream drizzled with a blueberry sauce.And as a result of this, he started to feel the hunger pangs. It was a hunger which demanded recharging food that came after intense exertion.Swallowing his saliva, Klein looked to the front, only to see that all the plates were empty. There were no leftovers.\u201cLet\u2019s end the dinner here, and give Klein a final toast,\u201d Dunn suggested.Before finishing his sentence, Klein asked, \u201cCaptain, may I order another plate of food?\u201dThe group fell silent after hearing such a request, only to break out into chuckles moments later.\u201cHaha, you\u2019ve finally recovered. No problem, order two plates if you want to.\u201d Dunn shook his head and laughed.While patiently waiting an unbearable amount of time, Klein heard his stomach growling.Finally, a freshly prepared black pepper steak was served before him.His fork and knife danced as Klein finished the medium-done steak in ninety seconds, tears nearly falling from his eyes. The meat juices and the fragrance of the sauce lingered in his mouth.Sometime later, Klein let out a satisfied sigh as he looked at his empty plate. He put down his knife and fork and took a sip of his champagne.\u201cWaiter, the bill please.\u201d Dunn turned around and called for the waiter.The waiter went to the counter, then returned with the check. He gave a thorough breakdown,\u201cYou opened five bottles of Desi Champagne, each bottle being twelve soli and three pence, a small glass of Southville Red Wine for ten pence\u2026 Each black pepper beef steak was one soli two pence\u2026 Each serving of beef pudding was six pence, the servings of ice cream was one soli each\u2026 The total would be five pounds, nine soli, and six pence.\u201dFive pounds, nine soli, and six pence? That\u2019s nearly my weekly salary! A restaurant is indeed much more expensive than eating at home! Klein clicked his tongue upon hearing that. He felt lucky that the Captain had said that he didn\u2019t need to pay out of his own pocket. They had some petty cash from bonus earnings!He calculated the cost carefully and noticed that the most expensive portion of the meal was the alcohol. Five bottles of champagne had cost more than three pounds!This is no different from Earth\u2026 Klein secretly rubbed his stomach and forced down the last of his champagne.\u2026The next morning, Klein felt bloated. He tried to get off the bed in his sleepy stupor.Just as he exerted strength, he was instantly awakened by his aching muscles. He felt as though his body wasn\u2019t under his control.\u201cWhat a familiar feeling\u2026 It\u2019s the same as that day after we got punished with frog jumps. Today is a rest day, but I still have to pay a visit to my mentor and see if I can borrow the monograph on the Hornacis main peak from the library at the University\u2026\u201d Klein\u2019s lips twitched as he made his way outside with some effort.He wanted to draw a gasp with every step.\u201cKlein, what happened to you?\u201d Melissa, who had just come out of the bathroom, sized up her brother suspiciously for his odd posture and slow movement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It didn\u2019t aid him in adjusting to combat training quickly.As for the original Klein, he had focused on his studies early on and had suffered from malnutrition. That led him to possess a below-average physical condition. The fact that he was having \u2018after effects\u2019 from working out was to be expected.\u201cSore muscles? I remember you returning after dinner last night and you didn\u2019t do anything else\u2026 Does alcohol cause sore muscles?\u201d Melissa inquired with an inquisitive look.Does alcohol cause sore muscles\u2026 Sis, that question\u2026 can\u2019t help but make me have inappropriate thoughts\u2026 Klein laughed dryly and said, \u201cNo, this has nothing to do with alcohol. It was from yesterday afternoon. I joined the company\u2019s combat training.\u201d\u201cCombat?\u201d Melissa was even more astonished.Klein organized his thoughts and said, \u201cWell, this is what happened. I considered it and believe that as a historical and relic consultant of a security company, it\u2019s impossible for me to stay in the office or port warehouse forever. Perhaps there will come a day when I have to accompany them to the villages or an ancient castle, to the site of some relic. That might require me to hike, to cross rivers, and to walk a lot. I\u2019ll have to endure all sorts of tests posed by nature, so I have to possess a sufficiently healthy body.\u201d\u201cSo you joined combat training to enhance your stamina?\u201d Melissa seemed to understand her brother\u2019s intention.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Klein answered with great affirmation.Melissa said with a frown, \u201cBut that isn\u2019t gentlemanly\u2026 Don\u2019t you always keep yourself to the standards of a professor? A professor only requires the ability to read historical documents, ponder over difficult questions, and maintain a polite and gentlemanly demeanor.\u201cOf course, I\u2019m not saying that those aren\u2019t all good things. I prefer men who can solve problems on their own, regardless of whether that solution requires brawn or brain.\u201dMelissa smiled.Klein smiled and said, \u201cNo, no, no, Melissa. Your definition of a professor contains a misconception. A true professor can communicate with people gently and politely, but he can also educate the other person using the principles of physics by raising a cane to convince someone when there is an obstacle in communication.\u201d\u201cPrinciples of physics\u2026\u201d Melissa was momentarily at a loss, but she quickly understood what her brother was saying. She was suddenly unable to retort him.Klein didn\u2019t say anything more but widened his pace with great difficulty as he headed for the bathroom.Melissa stood there and looked for a few seconds. She suddenly shook her head and caught up to Klein.\u201cDo you need my help?\u201dShe posed as if she was supporting someone.\u201cNo, there\u2019s no need to. I was hamming it up a bit earlier.\u201d Klein felt humiliated. He suddenly stood straight and walked normally.Watching her brother walk steadily to the washroom and close the door, Melissa pursed her lips and muttered, \u201cKlein is getting more and more pretentious\u2026 I even believed that his muscle soreness was really that serious\u2026\u201dIn the bathroom, Klein stood behind the tightly shut door, his face suddenly contorting in pain.Ouch, ouch, ouch\u2026 He held his breath, tensed his body, and stood there for a good seven or eight seconds.When he finally went downstairs with great effort, had breakfast, and saw Benson and Melissa off, his soreness finally began to ease.After resting for a little while, Klein took his cane, donned his top hat, and left the house, strolling towards the public carriage stop.\u2026During the summer, Khoy University had trees with shade-providing foliage, flourishing with birds and luxuriant flowers. It was peaceful and calm.Walking along the river, Klein took a turn towards the history department. Then, he found the three-story building which showed its age and located his mentor\u2019s, Cohen Quentin\u2019s, office.He knocked and entered the room, but he was shocked to see that the man sitting at his mentor\u2019s seat was the academic, Azik.\u201cGood morning, Mr. Azik, Where\u2019s my mentor? We made an appointment by letter to meet here at ten,\u201d Klein asked, puzzled.Azik, who was Cohen Quentin\u2019s best friend and often debated with his mentor regarding academic topics, smiled and said, \u201cCohen had a last minute meeting and went to Tingen University. He asked me to wait for you here.\u201dHe had bronze skin, an average height and build, black hair, brown eyes, and gentle facial features. Being in his presence brought on an indescribable feeling, as though you could see in the man\u2019s eyes that he had been through the vicissitudes of life. Under his right ear was a tiny mole that one wouldn\u2019t notice unless closely examined.Having said the reason, Azik suddenly frowned as he carefully observed Klein.Feeling confused by the sudden scrutiny, Klein looked at his attire. \u201cHave I committed some breach of etiquette?\u201dTuxedo, black vest, white shirt, black bow tie, dark colored trousers, leather boots with no buttons\u2026 Everything seems normal\u2026Azik\u2019s brows eased and he chuckled softly.\u201cDon\u2019t mind me. I suddenly noticed that you are way more energetic than before. You look even more like a gentleman now.\u201d\u201cThank you for your compliment.\u201d Klein accepted it calmly and asked, \u201cMr. Azik, did my mentor manage to find the book \u2018Research of the Hornacis Main Peak\u2019s Relics\u2019 in the school library?\u201d\u201cHe found it with my assistance,\u201d Azik said, smiling gently. He then pulled open the drawer and took out a gray-covered book. \u201cYou are no longer a Khoy University student anymore. You can read it here, but you cannot take it home.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Klein delightfully took the academic monograph, and with a hint of fear.The book\u2019s design was fully in-line with the current trends; it used hard paper as a hardcover and it was printed with an image like an abstract version of the main peak of Hornacis mountain range.Klein took a glance and found a seat. He flipped open the book and started reading carefully, line by line.As he became engrossed in the book, he suddenly realized that there was a cup of rich and fragrant coffee by his side.\u201cHelp yourself to the sugar and milk.\u201d Azik put down the silver saucer and pointed at the milk jar and sugar container.\u201cThank you.\u201d Klein nodded with gratitude.He added three cubes of sugar and a teaspoon of milk before continuing to read his book.The book, Research of the Hornacis Main Peak\u2019s Relics, was not a very thick book. Klein finished reading it when it was almost noon. He took note of a few noteworthy points.First, the settlement on the main peak of Hornacis Mountain and its surrounding area was obviously an advanced civilization, which existed as part of an ancient nation.Second, from their wall murals, their perspective on life appears similar to that of humans. I can assume for now that they were human.Third, they revered yet feared the darkness of the night. Hence, they called their god the Ruler of the Evernight, Mother of the Sky.Fourth, the weirdest part is that researchers haven\u2019t found any graves in the entire area, which initially seems to indicate that the people didn\u2019t need to be buried, because they didn\u2019t die. However, that would be contradictory to the contents of the wall murals. In the wall murals, the people in the nation believed that death is not the end. They believed that their deceased family would protect them in the night. Hence, they would keep their deceased family members at home, on the bed, by their side, for a full three days.There is nothing beyond that for the wall murals as it doesn\u2019t involve burials.Klein took another sip of coffee and continued to write down his \u2018afterthoughts\u2019 in his notebook.Mother of the Sky, Skymother is such a grand title, while the Ruler of the Evernight obviously overlaps with the Evernight Goddess\u2026 Is this a contradiction at its roots?In the ancient remains on the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range and its surrounding area, every arrangement and decoration was well-preserved. Even the wall murals didn\u2019t have any signs of damage. Before it was discovered, there seemed to be no disturbance at all\u2026 The table was arranged with cutlery, and there were dried stains of rot on the dining plates\u2026 In some rooms, there were half-filled bottles of alcohol that had almost turned into plain water\u2026What happened to the nation\u2019s people? They seemed to have left their homes in a hurry, without taking anything with them, and they never returned.Considering how there are no burial grounds, this only makes it weirder.The author, Mr. Joseph, also mentioned that when he first discovered the remains, he even had the belief that the people residing there had just vanished all of a sudden.Klein stopped writing and cast his gaze at an illustration.On John Joseph\u2019s third visit to the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range, he had used a new camera model to shoot a monochrome photograph.In the photo, the lofty palace had a collapsed wall and was overgrown with weeds. It followed a grandeur style for its design.When he flipped to the photograph, Klein\u2019s first thought was that of the palace he had seen in his dream.The two styles were identical. The only difference was that the one he had dreamed of was on a peak and it was way more magnificent. It also had a huge chair\u2014a seat of honor\u2014that looked like it didn\u2019t seat a human. Countless translucent maggots clustered together and squirmed slowly beneath the chair.I can confirm that my dream is related to the ancient remains on the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range\u2026 That should be the Nation of the Evernight which was referenced in the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook\u2026 Klein nodded slightly and closed the book.At that moment, Azik, who was sitting opposite him touched the inconspicuous mole under his right ear and said, \u201cHow was it? Found anything?\u201d\u201cQuite a bit. Take a look, I\u2019ve written so many pages of notes.\u201d Klein pointed at the table and smiled.\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re suddenly so interested in this matter.\u201d Azik sighed and said, \u201cKlein, when I was studying at the Backlund University, I had dabbled with some divination and did quite a bit of research on that. Well, I discovered that there is disharmony\u2026 in your fate.\u201dWhat? Divination? Are you talking to me about divination? As a Seer, Klein looked at Azik the academic in amusement.\u201cHow is it disharmonious?\u201dAzik thought for a moment.\u201cHave you encountered many strange coincidences in the past two months?\u201d\u201cCoincidences?\u201d As he was indebted to Mr. Azik, Klein didn\u2019t dispute his question as he subconsciously began thinking.If we are talking about coincidences, the most obvious matter was when we were after kidnappers. We actually managed to find clues of the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook that was lost for days in the room opposite the kidnappers.Also, Ray Bieber didn\u2019t flee from Tingen in a hurry; instead, he found a place to digest the power bestowed by the notebook, allowing for Sealed Artifact 2-049 to track him down easily. That seemed to be against common sense. Although Aiur Harson gave a reasonable explanation, I always had a nagging feeling that it was somewhat coincidental\u2026Oh, Selena had stolen a glance at Hanass Vincent\u2019s secret incantations, but she held back till her birthday dinner banquet to try it out, and I happened to discover it, which is quite a coincidence too. Otherwise, Hanass Vincent wouldn\u2019t have been the only one to die so suddenly\u2026Klein thought about it seriously for a few minutes and said, \u201cThere are three. Neither too many, nor too frequent. Furthermore, there was nothing that indicated someone\u2019s involvement and guidance.\u201dAzik nodded slightly.\u201cAs Emperor Roselle once said, a single coincidence is encountered by anyone. Twice is still normal. Thrice is when one should consider what internal factors are influencing those coincidences.\u201d\u201cCan you tell me anything else?\u201d Klein probed.Azik laughed and shook his head.\u201cI can only tell that there\u2019s some disharmony, but nothing else. You have to understand that I\u2019m not a real seer.\u201dIsn\u2019t that basically equal to saying nothing\u2026 Mr. Azik is quite odd\u2026 He\u2019s playing a charlatan in front of a charlatan like me\u2026 Klein let out a breath, seizing the moment when Azik stood up, he pinched his glabella and activated his Spirit Vision.When he looked over, Azik\u2019s aura fully appeared before his eyes and everything seemed fairly normal.Unfortunately, I can only see the Ether Body and Astral Projection of a person above the gray fog\u2026 Klein thought carefreely as he tapped his glabella again whilst standing up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 - Red ChimneyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 99: Red ChimneyTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudiosLate in the afternoon, Klein returned home and drew the curtains, allowing his room to slip into darkness.He took out his pen and paper and thought for a long time, finally writing down a sentence: \u201cThe kidnapping of Elliott was due to extraordinary elements.\u201dAs a Seer, Klein had tried to divine if those coincidences were a consequence of unnatural developments, but the results showed otherwise.This time, he was influenced by Azik to look into these events again. He also drew lessons from the suited clown. He seriously designed an appropriate divination statement, eliminating any descriptions that might be vague or cause confusion.\u201cYes, I should break down the three coincidences and divine them separately\u2026\u201d Klein nodded in thought as he slowly removed the topaz from his wrist.He held the spirit pendulum with his left hand and allowed it to hang close over the divination statement on the paper.He collected himself and entered a state of Cogitation. With his eyes closed, Klein started chanting repeatedly, \u201cThe kidnapping of Elliott was due to extraordinary elements.\u201d\u2026As he recited the statement over and over again, Klein opened his eyes and looked at the pendulum, only to see the topaz turning counterclockwise slowly.\u201cIt\u2019s still a negative\u2026\u201d Klein muttered to himself. He designed several other divination statements, but the results persisted\u2014there was nothing strange about that incident.He then separately divined the \u201cevent of Ray Bieber\u2019s stay in Tingen\u201d and \u201cSelena\u2019s magic mirror divination incident,\u201d but the answers for both events were normal.Heh, was I, a real Seer, frightened by the charlatan Mr. Azik? Besides, Captain and the others didn\u2019t feel that anything was off\u2026 Klein laughed and shook his head. But he remained cautious. He planned on using the dream divination technique to get a final confirmation.After some thought, he changed the divination statement to fit the change in method.\u201cThe true reason for Elliott\u2019s kidnapping.\u201d As he scribbled with the fountain pen, Klein paused and pondered over his words.After reading it over and over again, he tore the slip of paper and walked toward his bed. He relaxed and laid down.With the divination statement in hand, Klein quickly fell asleep with the help of Cogitation.He found himself in a contorted, broken world. Regaining his senses, he began swimming through the blur.Gradually, he saw the few kidnappers. He saw them lose their final chip at a gambling table, saw them obtain guns from underground sources, and saw them survey the area. They even rented the apartment across Ray Bieber\u2019s apartment as their hideout\u2026These didn\u2019t form a continuous scene, instead, they were presented in the form of flashing pictures. Klein couldn\u2019t find anything that was abnormal.Furthermore, it had also aligned with the statements given by the kidnappers.After exiting the dream, Klein separately divined the other two incidents but had the same result. Their developments followed logic. The coincidences were really coincidences.\u201cI was indeed overthinking things. Mr. Azik is merely a divination enthusiast\u2026\u201d Klein stabilized his pendulum and shook his head with a bitter smile.He was about to draw the curtains and allow sunlight into the room when he froze.\u201cFrom the original Klein\u2019s impression of Mr. Azikc, he is a dependable and trustworthy person. He had never once said anything baseless. Even if he was always quarreling with Mentor, it was limited to academic topics, and each of them had their reasons\u2026 If he was truly a mere divination enthusiast, he wouldn\u2019t have interacted with me like that\u2026 And the memories of original Klein has nothing about him liking divination\u2026 Of course, this could be due to the loss of a corresponding memories\u2026\u201d Klein frowned and couldn\u2019t ease his worries. He needed a way to confirm this.He suspected that Mr. Azik had unwittingly come across some insider information and was trying to remind him by using divination as an excuse.\u201cHow should I confirm this?\u201d Klein paced back and forth across the dark room, trying to recall the other divination techniques he knew.One step, two steps, three steps. He suddenly halted as an idea came to him.\u201cLet\u2019s assume that these coincidences are dubious. I\u2019m unable to divine a result either because my Sequence isn\u2019t high enough or I\u2019m being affected by outside interference, but I can change my environment! I can change my environment to someplace that is even more mysterious and even harder to understand.\u201d Klein felt pumped. He pulled open his drawer and took out a silver dagger.He concentrated and allowed his spirituality to flow out from the tip of the dagger, becoming one with his surroundings.With each step he took, the wall of spirituality sealed off the entire room.Klein planned on doing the divination above the gray fog, to do the divination in that mysterious world!\u2026In the magnificent ancient divine hall above the endless gray fog.Klein sat at the seat of honor on one end of the bronze table. Before him was a piece of goatskin he willed into existence.He lifted a pen and tried writing the divination statement as he had previously.\u201cThe kidnapping of Elliott was due to extraordinary elements.\u201dHe held the spirit pendulum and hung it low. Klein quickly composed himself as he turned silent and ethereal.Half-closing his eyes, he recited the statement seven times, using his spirituality to interact with the spiritual world that stood above all.Feeling the tug of the silver chain, Klein opened his eyes to look at the pendulum.The sight made him freeze immediately.The pendulum was spinning clockwise!This meant that there was an extraordinary element behind Elliott\u2019s kidnapping!This was completely different from the result he had gotten in the outside world!There were no traces of any interference\u2026 Such power or means is terrifying\u2026 What\u2019s the motive of the person behind this? Is my fate intertwined with the Antigonus family\u2019s diary? Klein was immensely shocked. He lost his calm and the rotation of the pendulum slipped into chaos.He put down the topaz and rubbed his glabella. His expression was abnormally grave.After contemplating for a few seconds, he didn\u2019t attempt to divine the other two events. Instead, he wrote a new divination statement: \u201cThe true reason for Elliott\u2019s kidnapping.\u201dHe held the paper in his hand and recited the statement seven times. Klein leaned back and fell into sleep above the fog.Soon, he saw a boundless, illusory grayish-white fog.The fog dissipated slowly, revealing a colorful grass plain filled with flowers.The space behind the flowers and the plains was folding into itself, like a monster that had come alive.Klein tried his best to look forward, barely making out an image of a dark red chimney.At this point, the scene before him shattered, putting an end to his dream.Klein abruptly straightened his back in the majestic divine hall. His heart was beating wildly without reason.Phew\u2026 It felt like I had just spied on a terrifying thing\u2026 He took in two deep breaths to stabilize his chaotic emotions.Tap. Tap. Tap. Klein tapped on the side of the table sometime later and slipped into deep thought.Red chimney\u2026 garden\u2026 grass plains\u2026 How is this related to the person behind all of this? I cannot determine his motive from the coincidences, nor can I conclude that there is any evil intent\u2026In the midst of this thinking, Klein felt alarmed, for himself, Captain, Frye, and the others.We are like puppets dancing on a string. What\u2019s even scarier is that we thought so highly of ourselves\u2026Sigh\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to raise this matter to Captain. Old Neil\u2019s divination produced the same results as mine in the outside world\u2026 If they asked me to confirm it in front of them, I have no way of doing that\u2026 Klein rubbed his temples as if he had a headache.After nearly twenty seconds of calm, he began divining the \u201cevent of Ray Bieber\u2019s stay in Tingen.\u201d Similarly, he first used spirit dowsing.This time, Klein was shocked to see his topaz hang motionless. It was neither a confirmation or rejection of the statement.\u201cStrange\u2026\u201d he muttered. He started to guess the reasons for this phenomenon, \u201cThe person behind this has sensed my divinations and engaged in countermeasures?\u201dFollowing this, he tried the dream divination technique, but all he saw were fragmented pieces of fog. He no longer made any new discoveries.The results of \u201cSelena\u2019s magic mirror divination incident\u201d were the same.Klein could almost confirm his conjecture at this point. Since he had no way of notifying Captain Dunn Smith for the time being, he had an unprecedented motivation to improve his abilities.\u201cI must head to the Divination Club later and quickly succeed in my \u2018acting\u2019 to digest the Seer potion\u2026 Also, I have to confirm whether the Clown potion is indeed the subsequent Sequence of Seer, as well as gather clues about it\u2026 In addition, I have to interact more with Mr. Azik and see if I can dig up whatever inside information he holds\u2026\u201d Klein held his forehead with his right palm and quickly drew up a plan, and determined his focal point.After some thought, a goatskin appeared in front of him again. He picked up his pen and wrote:\u201cThe corresponding Sequence 8 of Sequence 9 Seer is Clown.\u201dFrom his prior experience, the present Klein was completely convinced that his divination abilities were augmented and enhanced above the gray fog.\u201cJust like how raids are usually successful\u2026 is this the result of having good luck?\u201d he muttered and picked up his spirit pendulum.Sometime later, Klein received a definitive answer:The corresponding Sequence 8 of Sequence 9 Seer was Clown!He then wrote on the paper once again.\u201cThe corresponding Sequences 8, 7, 6, and 5 of Seer would grant at least one brand new, unrelated power.\u201dKlein exhaled as he tried spirit dowsing again.However, he saw the topaz hang motionlessly without any rotations.\u201cThere isn\u2019t enough information to complete the divination and receive a revelation?\u201d he muttered to himself while seemingly deep in thought. Then, he set down the silver chain and began considering the required statement for a dream divination.Nearly twenty seconds later, he picked up his fountain pen and wrote seriously: \u201cClues to the Clown potion.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - Interpreting SymbolsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100: Interpreting SymbolsTranslator: AtlasStudios Editor: AtlasStudios\u201cClues to the Clown potion.\u201d\u2026On the seat of honor at the ancient bronze table, Klein repeated the divination statement a few times before leaning back and entering a deep sleep.His surroundings quickly became peaceful and quiet. He saw a hazy view, with countless distorted and blurry scenes flashing past, just like drops of morning dew on tender flower petals.Gradually, Klein grasped his spirituality and came to his senses.He saw a fireplace before him with a rocking chair in front of it. Sitting on it was an old woman dressed in black and white.Although he couldn\u2019t see her face since she was hanging her head low, Klein\u2019s gut feeling told him that she was an old lady. And he was pretty certain about it.The old lady was facing a desk directly. There were newspapers and tin cans inlaid with silver on the desk.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Klein found the scene before his eyes very familiar, and he quickly recognized what he saw.This was where Ray Bieber and his mother stayed!This was where he saw a bloated cadaver for the first time!\u201cThere are clues that point to the Clown potion here?\u201d Just as Klein\u2019s thoughts flashed past, the scene around him transformed.It was a grayish-white warehouse, hidden among identical buildings.There were white bones scattered all around, and a few balls of flesh that looked like they had been squashed by a boulder.In the middle of the warehouse was a grayish-white object that was the size of a fist. Its surface was filled with ditches and it looked soft but ductile. It looked like a brain that had been extracted out of a living being.Just as Klein recognized the scene and recalled something, the scene before him distorted like rippling water before transforming into another new blurry scene.A naked body was laid on a long table covered with a white cloth. There were some bluish, discolored patches on the corpse\u2019s skin.Klein suddenly knitted his eyebrows and muttered, \u201cIt was first the images of Ray Bieber\u2019s hiding place and his remains, and now, it\u2019s related to the brand on the suited clown\u2019s wrist?\u201dJust as he attempted to speculate what the scenes meant, the scene suddenly changed again.A marble coffee table, a set of two leather couches, and a chandelier that hung high on the ceiling.There were three people\u2014Klein Moretti, who had black hair, brown eyes, and a scholarly temperament; a wealthy man with a chubby body and pale skin; and a beautiful young lady with fishnet gloves.Following that, it was another three people and an object\u2014a middle-aged man in a black robe who had thick spiky brown hair; a wealthy man with a chubby body and pale skin; a half-century-old elder with messy eyebrows, thin brown hair, and gray-blue eyes; and a black notebook on the round table in-between all of them, a notebook that exuded an ancient and distant air.The Antigonus family\u2019s notebook!Klein suddenly sat up straight and the dream vanished.Looking outside the divine hall where there was boundless gray fog and crimson stars, he thought in both shock and confusion.I was divining for clues to the Clown potion\u2026 Why would the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook show up?Let me think, let me think, that chubby guy was Welch. Yes, Welch, an unfortunate fella who bought the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook and triggered a sequence of incidents\u2026 The beautiful young lady wearing fishnet gloves was Naya\u2026I remember, the marble coffee table and leather couch combination is a hallmark of Welch\u2019s place. I saw Spirit Medium Daly there.In other words, what I saw was Welch\u2019s living room. It was a scene where the original Klein and his two classmates were discussing the notebook.Klein calmed himself down and tapped on the edge of the long bronze table rhythmically.Then, what does the last scene represent? The notebook appeared, Welch appeared. Could it be the scene where he bought the ancient item?There were another two people, and one of them looked very familiar. I feel like I\u2019ve seen the middle-aged man in the classic black robe somewhere before\u2026 That spiky brown hair, severe dark eye circles\u2026 Yes, I know who is he now. Hanass Vincent from the Divination Club, the Hanass Vincent who \u2018died peacefully\u2019 after Captain snuck into his dream, having learned that Selena secretly obtained the secret incantation from him!No way, he was the one that sold the notebook to Welch?Everything appears to be coming full circle. The world sure is small, no\u2014Tingen is really small! On careful thought, it really is a possibility that Hanass Vincent wasn\u2019t an ordinary fortune-teller. He was obviously deep into mysticism and obtained the attention of an ancient evil god. He had the channels, ability, and opportunity to acquire the notebook that was accidentally released by the Secret Order\u2026It\u2019s no wonder Captain and company never figured out where Welch bought the notebook. Their investigative approach was entirely wrong. They had attempted to investigate via the antique market\u2026 But when the actual whereabouts of the notebook was found, they gave up on that lead.What a pity, Hanass Vincent just passed away not too long ago. Otherwise, we definitely could\u2019ve found out something regarding the notebook\u2026 Since he was involved in mysticism, he should\u2019ve researched the notebook\u2026 His death was way too coincidental!However, there was another person at the scene, a man in his fifties. He might know quite a bit of what happened.Klein stopped tapping his fingers on the edge of the table and looked through every scene of his dream divination once more.Ray Bieber\u2019s house, Ray Bieber\u2019s hideout spot, the remains of Ray Bieber, the brand on the suited clown\u2019s wrist, Welch\u2019s house; Welch, Naya, and original Klein\u2019s exchange; Welch, Hanass Vincent, and the Antigonus family notebook\u2019s \u2018group photo\u2019. Hehe, besides the brand on the suited clown, everything else is directly related to the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook!But I had divined for clues to the Clown potion\u2026 This isn\u2019t scientific, nor does it make mystical sense!After becoming a Seer, Klein once tried to divine where Welch had bought the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook, but he never considered using the unique qualities that the area above the gray fog possessed. As such, he had failed to receive any revelations, but now, he had chanced upon the truth by divining something separate.After spending nearly twenty seconds to calm down, Klein summarized the context provided by Roselle\u2019s diary and attempted to interpret his dream divination.The first possibility: Zaratul or should I say, the Secret Order, was searching and pursuing the relics of the Antigonus family. So, the symbolic meaning of the dream is to use matters related to the Antigonus family to lure the Secret Order into appearing, so as to obtain the Clown potion\u2019s formula.The second possibility: the Clown potion\u2019s formula is directly recorded in the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook\u2026 The fact that the Zaratul family is seeking the relics of the Antigonus family implies that they share very deep connections. They could\u2019ve been allies or enemies. Hence, it seems fairly natural that the Antigonus family possessed parts of their Sequence. Things would be obvious if they were allies, but enemies are the ones who would know each other the best\u2026But the second explanation wouldn\u2019t be able to link it to the brand on the suited clown. Sigh, I do wish that the second explanation were true though. When the Holy Cathedral finds an expert to interpret the notebook, I would be able to obtain the Clown potion without any risk.It seems that the first explanation is the most plausible. My gut feeling as a Seer tells me that there might be a deeper symbolic meaning.Having thought of this, Klein massaged his forehead and suddenly realized the limitations of a Seer.Unless it was a very simple and straightforward sign, a Seer had to be extremely careful when making interpretations. It was just like walking on the edge of the abyss or walking on a thin layer of ice over a lake\u2019s surface. The suited clown\u2019s outcome was an actual and bloody example of what a single mistake in interpretation or failure to grasp a key point could result in!In that instant, Klein had an illusion of himself mastering the true essence of a Seer. He seemed to be just one step away from digesting the potion completely.\u201cThank you for enlightening me with your life\u2026 Praise the Lady!\u201d he muttered and drew a crimson moon before his chest.Then he divined whether Azik had good intentions or if he was an amazing Beyonder. He received confirmations for both of them.Eventually, the continuous divinations exhausted Klein. He had no choice but to stop churning through his thoughts and decide on the crucial matters that he needed to attend to.I have to find the man that appeared in the same scene with Welch, Hanass Vincent, and the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook as soon as possible!I can begin my search with the Divination Club.I can\u2019t just confront Mr. Azik. Yes, he might be a Mid-Sequence Beyonder of the Life School of Thought, but there\u2019s a lack of information, making it impossible for me to divine\u2026Phew. Klein let out a breath and conjured the portrait of the half-century-old elder with messy eyebrows, thin brown hair, and gray-blue eyes on the goatskin that appeared before him.This was the third person present when the Antigonus family\u2019s notebook was traded between Welch and Hanass Vincent!Looking at the portrait, Klein suddenly fell into a dilemma.I can\u2019t draw. During art class in primary school, I was always the one receiving the greatest criticism from the teachers.Should I use ritualistic magic like Old Neil? This was done by praying to the Goddess\u2026 If I were to use the uniqueness of the area above the gray fog\u2026 I would be in trouble if the divinities noticed something amiss!Hold on a second, perhaps I can pray to myself! Transmitting images and transmitting voices are similar\u2026 Although I\u2019m temporarily unable to access the mysterious power above the gray fog, accomplishing such a minor matter shouldn\u2019t be a problem!Having thought of this, Klein immediately emanated his spirituality to envelop himself to stimulate the feeling of falling.Back in his bedroom, he lit the gas lamp and \u2018prayed.\u2019\u201cThe Fool that doesn\u2019t belong to this era;\u201cYou are the mysterious ruler above the gray fog;\u201cYou are the King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck;\u201cI pray for your revelation and pray that you allow me to draw what I\u2019ve seen.\u201dAfter reciting the incantation, Klein didn\u2019t splash essential oils or burn any herbs to gain the help of their powers.It was just that informal when praying to oneself!There were suddenly murmurs in his ears as he saw the four black dots that formed a square surface on the back of his hand.He walked four steps counterclockwise and recited the incantation before penetrating the maniacal chaos to return to the area above the gray fog.This time he didn\u2019t see any of the crimson stars shrinking or expanding. But behind the seat of honor at the long bronze table, the strange symbol formed by a partial Pupil-less Eye and partial contorted lines shimmered weakly as it produced illusory prayers.Klein held his ear to it and listened. After making sure that there were no mistakes, he conjured the portrait of the \u2018third person\u2019, and cast it towards the flowing light in accordance to the prayer\u2019s format.After everything was done, he immediately left the mysterious world above the gray fog and returned to his bedroom.Just as he found his footing, a portrait surfaced immediately in front of Klein\u2019s eyes. Furthermore, he sensed a weak and illusory power augmenting him.He picked up a fountain pen and found a piece of white paper and expressed his intent.Klein was surprised to find his right hand moving uncontrollably as it quickly drew lines.Before long, he saw a lifelike portrait of the \u2018third person\u2019.After writing down the hair and eye colors, as well as other unique characteristics, Klein heaved a sigh of relief despite the spasms of his right hand.The illusion before his eyes rapidly dissipated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
