She was sold by her vicious grandmother and became the wife shared by the four brothers of the Ye family. That night, she fled and then fell down, which unexpectedly killed her.Actually, in her own case, she died of cancer the day she turned 25, after suffering for seven or eight years. Who would have thought that she would be reborn by God\u2019s will?Reborn with a healthy body, Liu Duo was very happy because she finally didn\u2019t need to take various kinds of medicine every day. Bearing this thought in mind, Liu Duo laughed happily.At the moment, Liu Duo felt an urge to urinate, so she turned over and got up. Then, she put on her cloth shoes, opened the wooden door, and walked outside.Ye Ling went out of the kitchen with a bowl of paste in his hands. Upon seeing Liu Duo open the door and go out, he walked unsteadily towards her, saying, \u201cWife, you are awake. Are you hungry? Here you are. It\u2019s good for your stomach.\u201dGangly and 1.75 meters tall, he looked delicate and pretty. Liu Duo knew he was Ye Ling, the youngest of the four brothers in the Ye family. He was nineteen years old that year.Liu Duo didn\u2019t feel hungry at first, but her stomach sang on that occasion. She said awkwardly, \u201cEh, a little bit. But I want to go to the restroom first.\u201d\u201cRestroom? What is the restroom?\u201d Ye Ling was bewildered yet a little cute.\u201cIt means outhouse. All right, I just want to pee.\u201d Liu Duo explained with a smile. How could I forget I was reborn in ancient time?Seeing Liu Duo look at him while smiling, Ye Ling\u2019s handsome face turned red, and he said in his heart, Our wife was so pretty!He looked aside in a hurry, turned around, and put the bowl of paste on the wooden table under the roof, saying embarrassedly, \u201cOh, go ahead.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201d Liu Duo walked towards the outhouse by the side. Thanks to the memory from the original body, Liu Duo knew what the outhouse looked like and where it was.Sitting on a stool under the roof, Ye Ling was in a trance while staring at the direction of the outhouse. He thought, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for my leg disease and years of consumption on medicines, the family wouldn\u2019t have been so broke\u2026\u201dLiu Duo squatted over the latrine. When she was about to stand up after peeing, pains in her abdomen burst \u2013 one round after the other. Based on her twenty-five years of experience from her previous life, of course, she knew what it was.\u201cWhy am I so unlucky that the \u2018great aunt\u2019 is coming uninvitedly right after I just returned to life?\u201d Liu Duo felt deeply depressed. What would she do about it? At that moment, how could she get out?Ten minutes passed, and Liu duo was contemplating what she could do. Outside, Ye Ling frowned as his mind wandered. He looked at the almost-cooled paste and wondered why the wife hadn\u2019t come out and why she was in the outhouse for so long.Ye Ling stood up and walked to the outhouse. He knocked on the door, \u201cWife, what happened? Why is it taking you so long? Are you uncomfortable?\u201dLiu Duo listened to the fourth brother\u2019s words with embarrassment, while her legs felt numb.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWell\u2026well\u2026\u201d Liu Duo pulled her hair, trying to think of a way to explain.\u201cWife, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ye Ling felt a little rash because he was worried something would happen to their wife, who was bought for two hundred pence for the four brothers of the Ye family to continue the family line.Most of the money used to buy a wife was borrowed by their Third Uncle because their family was too poor to pay such an amount. Most of the money his brother earned was spent to buy medicine for Ye Ling, while the rest was used to feed the whole family. Seeing them all grown up, the Third Uncle considered the possibility that no other family would let their daughters marry them and suffer, so the only way was to buy a shared wife for them to bear offspring.[1] \u201cgreat aunt\u201d \u2013 menstruation.

What\u2019s the matter? Why don\u2019t you come out?\u201d Ye Ling didn\u2019t hear any answer, so he knocked on the wooden door of the outhouse again.Since it was impossible to stay there until the \u201cgreat aunt\u201d left, Liu Duo rubbed her numb thighs and legs as if she had to be ready for anything. She said, \u201cWould you please find a female neighbor and let her come around? It\u2019s an emergency.\u201dUpon hearing that she wanted him to leave, Ye Ling didn\u2019t agree, because he thought Liu Duo was looking for a chance to escape again.\u201cNo. I can\u2019t leave, or you will run away again. Wife, my brothers and I will treat you well. Please don\u2019t bear the thought of escape in mind. Get out here, please.\u201dDear Lord. Liu Duo was quite muddled. How could she run away at this very moment when the \u201cgreat aunt\u201d rushed and her legs were extremely numb? Since no sanitary pad was used in this time, how could she get any clue what to use unless she asked a female local?She said, \u201cFourth Brother, don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t run. The problem is that I must find a female, or I can\u2019t get out. Do you want me to stay in the outhouse forever?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026..but, nobody will be at home if I go out. How do I explain to my brothers if you run away?\u201d Ye Ling paused and pondered, worrying Liu Duo might take the chance to escape.Liu Duo, who was angrily rolling her eyes, felt furious. Run, run, where could she possibly run to by herself? She was a complete stranger in town. In addition, the official identity document was mandatory in ancient time in order to travel throughout the country, which was so called the \u201ccertificate of identification\u201d or \u201cthe household registration.\u201dSince the day when she was sold to Ye brothers by her vicious grandma, her document was added to the Ye clan accordingly. Ah, why did I have such a miserable life?Liu Duo explained to him patiently, yet helplessly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t run. My \u2018great aunt\u2019 has come, but I don\u2019t have the stuff needed. That\u2019s why I need you to find a female neighbor for me. She can help me out.\u201d\u201cThe great aunt? Wife, is your relative coming?\u201d Ye Ling was confused. He remembered that when they bought the wife the day before, Liu Duo\u2019s family said that they would neither come to see her nor want to be visited when.\u201cI am going crazy.\u201d Rage was burning in Liu Duo\u2019s heart!\u201cAh\u2026My menstruation occurred, which happens to women once every month. Do you understand? If you do, hurry and help me find a female neighbor. I need to borrow something necessary. My legs are too numb to bear any longer!\u201dOnce hearing Liu Duo\u2019s furious words, Ye Ling\u2019s face felt terribly embarrassed, and even his ears were red. He said after he coughed awkwardly, \u201cWait for a moment. I\u2019ll go right away!\u201dAlthough there were no women in his family, he still knew what menstruation was, so he needed to go to the Third Uncle\u2019s home and look for the Third Aunt, who must have the stuff his wife needed.Ye Ling left the outhouse in haste and went to the Third Uncle\u2019s home, while Liu Duo had to continue to wait miserably in the squat position.Because he was walking too fast, Ye Ling had dense sweat on his forehead when he arrived at the front of the Third Uncle\u2019s door. He gasped while knocking on the door hastily, \u201cThird Aunt, Third Aunt, open the door. It\u2019s Ye Ling.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming.

She said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Did the wife run away again? We need to go and find the village head immediately, so people will be called to find her together!\u201d\u201cAlthough that poor girl is reduced to be shared, she is yours after she was unhesitantly sold by her own Grandma.

They provided the brothers with supplies from time to time, instead of looking down upon their poverty.\u201cThird Aunt, don\u2019t worry. The wife didn\u2019t run away. She only asked me to borrow something. She said\u2026she said her menstruation occurred. She doesn\u2019t have the stuff needed. Ye Ling\u2019s face turned redder and redder as he explained.Looking at Ye Ling\u2019s red face, the Third Aunt smiled, realizing she had thought too much. \u201cOh, I see. Wait a moment, Little Fourth. I\u2019ll go inside and prepare the stuff. Then I\u2019ll go with you to see her.\u201dThe Third Aunt turned back to the room, prepared some blocks of cotton cloth and charcoal ashes to put them in a basket covered by a piece of linen before she went out.\u201cCome on. Your wife is waiting for us.\u201dThe Third Aunt went out with a smile, locked up the gate, and went towards the Ye\u2019s. Ye Ling wanted to walk fast, but he couldn\u2019t. The Third Aunt laughed after noticing it, \u201cDon\u2019t hurry. Take your time, little Fourth.\u201dIn the outhouse, Liu Duo remained squatted, bored and miserable. She tried to stretch her legs sometimes to release them from numbness. The good thing was that it was not too stinky in the outhouse. Otherwise, she might be suffocated from the smell.Hearing footsteps, Liu Duo came to her senses immediately and said, \u201cFourth Brother, is that you?\u201d Have you borrowed some? My legs are so numb as if I were crippled!\u201dHearing Liu Duo\u2019s clear and crisp grumbles, like an oriole singing, the Third Aunt chuckled, \u201cI\u2019m coming. Don\u2019t hurry, my girl. You\u2019ll be better soon.\u201dAfter hearing the answer, Liu Duo calmed down. As long as someone gave her a 'sanitary pad\u201d, it was not unbearable to wait another minute. \u201cOh, thank you.\u201dThe Third Aunt came into the yard, sat on the stool, and then took out the stuff to make the cloth strips for Liu Duo.After she finished sewing several strips, the Third Aunt handed them to Ye Ling, \u201cTake these to your wife.\u201dLooking at the stuff passed on, Ye Ling blushed again. He lightly knocked on the door, \u201cWife, Here you are. Please open the door.\u201dCreaking rang out while the door opened slightly. Liu Duo extended her hand, \u201cGive them to me!\u201dSeeing her fair and clean palm, Ye Ling passed them to her. Liu Duo\u2019s hand recoiled once it took the stuff. It was made using two layers of long, cotton strips with something sewen inside. This was the 'sanitary pad\u201d in ancient times!She looked it over and figured out how to use it. Liu Duo put it on her underwear and pulled up her trousers. She felt quite comfortable.Liu Duo walked out by holding the wall after she pushed open the door of the outhouse. Her legs were trembling due to the longtime squatting.Ye Ling held up Liu Duo immediately, saying with guilt, \u201cI got you. Your legs must be numb. It\u2019s my fault for making you wait for so long.\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Liu Duo didn\u2019t know what to say! She didn\u2019t blame him at all.\u201cGirl, come here. Come on. Third Aunt wants to have a word with you.\u201d The Third Aunt called Liu Duo with a gracious expression.Liu Duo was quite satisfied with the appearance of herself reflected on the water when she washed her hands by the well. It was not even close to that in her previous life, but quite pleasant.She especially liked the tiny red mole at the center between her brows, aside from big eyes and arched brows, a tall and delicate nose, reddish cherry-like lips, and a baby-fat, oval face. Two small dimples emerged around the corner of her mouth when she smiled.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLiu Duo also came and sat under the roof. Ye Ling took the cooled paste to heat again in the kitchen.The Third Aunt smiled greater and greater after staring at Liu Duo for a while. She was beyond satisfaction.

If they dare to treat you badly, tell your Third Aunt. I am on your side!\u201d\u201cYou may feel wronged for being a wife in such a poor family, but the brothers, they are all good guys.

Urging for the pregnancy? I am still a 15-year-old child! Even though I have a twenty-five-year-old soul, the body is not ready yet!Ye Ling passed the bowl to Liu Duo after heating the paste again, \u201cWife, eat this while it\u2019s still hot. It took so long. I bet you must be hungry.\u201d\u201cOh, Ok. Thanks.\u201d Liu Duo was hungry indeed, so she took it immediately and ate slowly. It wasn\u2019t good to eat, but it was much better than nothing. This was the best the family budget could allow, after all.The Third Aunt continued while looking at Ye Ling and Liu Duo, who was eating her paste, \u201cLittle Fourth, you and your brothers should treat your wife well and never wrong her. If you need some help, come to your Third Uncle and me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Third Aunt, we\u2019ll treat her well and never wrong her.\u201d Who else would we treat well except our wife?\u201cWell, well. It\u2019s late now. I\u2019m going back. Girl, come visit if you\u2019re bored!\u201d\u201cOh, OK. Watch your step, Third Aunt.\u201d Liu Duo answered. When she would truly visit or not aside, manner wise she should answer along.\u201cOK. Third Aunt, let me walk you out.\u201d Ye Ling held the Third Aunt\u2019s arm and walked outside.Liu Duo felt warm throughout her body, and the pain in her abdomen was relieved somehow after finishing the paste. Then, she got up and stretched.\u201cWow, it feels comfortable when the stomach is full!\u201dYe Ling turned back and saw Liu Duo stretched out casually in a good mood. Finally, a wife was going to bear children in this family.Ye Ling brought the bowl and chopsticks beside the well after tidying up. Watching Ye Ling doing the housework, Liu Duo thought this man was really diligent.Liu Duo took a close look at him. He was quite handsome; however, it was a pity that he had leg asymmetry with one leg longer than the other that crippled him. In addition, he looked like a weak and delicate beauty, due to frequent intake of medicine.Ye Ling\u2019s face was flushed bright red and dared not to look at her after finding Liu Duo\u2019s eyes had fallen on him for a long while.\u2018Oh, the pretty boy is shy.\u2019 Liu Duo grinned with reddish cheeks.She wanted to go out and look around, so she stopped staring at him. She needed to get familiar with the surroundings where she was going to live after her rebirth.\u201cWell, Fourth Brother, staying at home is so boring. Let\u2019s go out for a stroll, shall we?\u201d Liu Duo asked Ye Ling for his opinion, in case he thought she would run away again!Ye Ling looked up and was deeply attracted by Liu Duo\u2019s smiling face, with such features, as well as her dimples. \u201cMy wife is so beautiful\u201d has become a pet phrase in Ye Ling\u2019s heart.While Ye Ling was about to respond, a bang sounded. It was something landing heavily on the ground, startling Ye Ling and Liu Duo! They both turned their heads and looked towards the gate of the yard.\u201cGo out for a stroll? Do you want to run away again after only one single night? In my opinion, only one blow can let you know what I am capable of.\u201d\u201cYou have become the wife of our Ye brothers, since your Grandma took the money. Stop trying to run away, or I\u2019ll show you my strength! How about snapping your legs?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWith a face that good-looking, he mouthed words that were shockingly raw and violent, talking about hitting people all the time. That was Ye Mo, the Third Brother of the Ye Clan.He was about 1.8 meters tall, of an average figure, and stunningly handsome with a sculpture-like face that could be compared to Mr. Universe \u2013 the champion of a beauty pageant.Such wonderful genes ran in the Ye clan! The Liu Duo who owned the original body had never looked at them properly ever since she was bought back. That was why the other Liu Duo at that moment was not very clear about their appearances.Liu Duo was satisfied with the good look of the Fourth Brother, as well as that of the Third Brother. She was even guessing that the appearances of the First and Second Brothers must be more or less at the same level.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You\u2019re scaring her.\u201d Ye Ling said immediately. He was afraid that his Third Brother would actually hurt Liu Duo.After he put down the pack basket and ax, Ye Mo glared at Liu Duo while standing at the yard gate. He seemed to be saying, \u2018Don\u2019t you dare to try and go out!\u2019Witnessing Ye Mo\u2019s childish actions, and hearing his odious words, Liu Duo was not in a mood to argue with him, so she got up and returned to the room after responding him by rolling her eyes. She had a bad impression of Ye Mo, while Ye Mo was irritated by Liu Duo\u2019s reaction, his chest moving up and down.\u201cLittle Fourth, you\u2019d better not dote on her. Instead, we need to be harsh to let her know what we are capable of, or she might run off again!\u201d\u201cThird Brother, I understand and will keep an eye on her. But I think she won\u2019t run off if we treat her well and let her feel it.\u201d Ye Ling tried to persuade his Third Brother.\u201cYes, I know. However, we need to be tough when it\u2019s necessary, or she won\u2019t know who she is!\u201d Ye Mo picked up the ax and started to chop firewood.Ye Ling took up the washed bowl and chopsticks. Then, he put them in the kitchen. While lying on the bed, Liu duo was digesting her identity as the shared wife with her mouth drawn and retracted.Rich families had several wives and concubines, while the poor only shared one wife in some places. Bluntly speaking, it was buying a wife for the purpose of giving birth to children to continue the family line.I spent my whole previous life fighting against serious illness and never had a man. Now God gave me not only a healthy body to relive but four men in total. Is this some kind of compensation? How good my fortune is in love affairs!So shared wife I am. Who said only men could have several life partners? At the moment, I have four legal husbands. Since all were given by God, I will enjoy my life with a laugh! She fell asleep in a daze while hearing the sound of firewood being chopped.A couple of hours later, Liu Duo woke up. She got out of bed, prepared the long cloth strips given by the Third Aunt in her hands, and went to the outhouse for changing.The two brothers cooperated orderly to prepare supper in the kitchen. One was tending the fire, and the other was cooking.Liu Duo cracked open the outhouse door and went in. Ye Mo heard the door creak and went out to have a look immediately.He found her neither in the yard nor in the room where Liu Duo was supposed to be sleeping. After that, he rushed outside in a hurry, opened the gate, and ran out.Ye Mo looked around outside the yard and did not see anyone, either. On his way rushing back, he saw Liu Duo pull the wooden door of the outhouse and come out.\u201cAh!\u201d Liu Duo was startled by Ye Mo\u2019s hastiness.She patted her chest and stared at Ye Mo, saying, \u201cDo you know it\u2019s quite scary when people are scared by others?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Seeing her come out of the outhouse, Ye Mo was embarrassed by his deed, due to the thought that Liu Duo had run off again.\u201cI what! Rushing around like this, you look either ill-minded or mentally disordered,\u201d said Liu Duo, rolling her eyes. Then she took the used cloth strip to the side of the well to clean it.Liu Duo didn\u2019t want to be good to Ye Mo, who suspected again that she would run off without any trace of trust in her. In addition, she was really startled just now.Listening to her words, and watching her cold back, Ye Mo got extremely furious.\u201cWho are you calling ill-minded and mentally disordered?

It\u2019s not like I\u2019m sick or anything!\u201dLiu Duo didn\u2019t pay any attention to Ye Mo any more. She drew the end of the bucket and dropped it into the well. After trying several times, frustratingly she still couldn\u2019t fetch any water.How badly she missed the tap water pipe! \u201cFourth Brother, come over here.\u201dShe could only ask Ye Ling for help.

She did what she could to prevent the mad man from messing with her again.Liu Duo did not want to be spooked by Ye Mo every other day. Her heart could not take it! The best way to deal with people who had nothing better to do was to stay far away from them.Although they would have to see each other again, one way or another, she just did not want to bother with him.

Her impression of him soared right up. What a gentleman!Meanwhile, Ye Mo got the hot water ready and came to her room, \u201cCome wash your face and feet before you sleep.\u201dAlright, in regards to his doing, Liu Duo supposed he still had some merits. But what Ye Mo said next made all those good feelings she had towards him disappear without a trace!\u201cSleep after you have had a good wash. You slept with me last night, so it\u2019s Ling\u2019s turn tonight. Don\u2019t even think about running. When our two brothers return, it\u2019s the same as usual. Everyone takes turns sleeping with you.\u201d\u201cYou better stay alert, Ling. Call me if you need to pee, otherwise, she might run away again, just like last night.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t think about running again. Stay here with us, and we\u2019ll treat you right. If you run again, you bet I\u2019ll break your legs!\u201dLiu Duo stared wide-eyed and intently at Ye Mo, like she had discovered a new species. Oh my gosh, this violent man.Ye Mo felt big watery eyes staring right at him and quickly disrupted the line of vision. If she looked closely, she would find that his ears had gone red. \u201cAlright, you two. Get a quick wash and sleep. Good night.\u201dYe Mo looked unrestrained as he left, but he was actually desperate to flee. He thought, this woman\u2019s eyes are so captivating, staring at a man like that. How shameless.As for the other two, one felt tense, the other relaxed. Liu Duo supposed one night\u2019s sleep should not be a big deal. Nothing was going to happen. In fact, nothing could, even if she wanted.With her uninvited period, and this fifteen-year-old body she was trapped. The youngest brother was only nineteen, so he was not suitable to do that which should not be done.This was Ye Ling\u2019s first night with a woman. His heart was pounding like madness, and even his face and ears flushed a crimson red. He was so nervous that he did not know what he should say.Liu Duo washed and climbed into bed first. She took off her outer garments, leaving only her undergarments on, as she laid down under the blanket. She slept a lot during the day, so it was hard to sleep with a little excitement left.Ye Ling poured some water to wash his feet and dilly-dallied as he got into bed too. He was also in his underwear and did not move once he tucked himself under the covers.\u201cLing, are you asleep? If not, why don\u2019t we have a little chat?\u201d Liu Duo wanted to talk.\u201cNot yet, why? Whatever you want to say, just say it, my wife, I\u2019m listening.\u201d How could he sleep? His wife was lying right beside him. He was beyond excited.\u201cLing, don\u2019t call me \u2018wife\u2019 in the future. Call me Duo Er or Little Duo. That\u2019s much better.\u201d It felt particularly cheesy and awkward to be called \u2018wife\u2019 all day.\u201cBut you are my wife. Everybody else refers to their wives like that.\u201d Why can\u2019t I call my wife \u201cmy wife\u201d? Ye Ling furrowed his eyes.\u201cJust call me Duo Er, alright, Ling?\u201d Liu Duo turned around to face him. She stretched her arms and shook his shoulders, almost flirting.\u201cSure, sure, sure, Duo Er. Put your arms under the covers, don\u2019t catch a cold. It\u2019s freezing at night.\u201d Flirting worked really well on Ye Ling.\u201cHehe, whatever you say,\u201d She said as she giggled, revealing only her head.Seeing her smile made Ye Ling\u2019s heart flutter. He thought, I won\u2019t ever let her feel wronged. I want her to be happy every day. If the wife is happy, I am too, and so area my brothers.\u201cWhat do Yang and Liu do for work?\u201d As far as she could remember, she did not have memories of either of those two brothers, but she knew there were four of them!\u201cBig brother hunts in the mountains.

She woke up semi-consciously and got out of bed in a hurry. She did not even put on her outer clothing as she took her cloth and rushed out.Mo was chopping wood when he saw Liu Duo run outside with nothing but her undergarments on. He furrowed his brows unhappily and was about to give her a scolding when Liu Duo entered the outhouse.In the kitchen, Ling was steaming buns for breakfast, to be eaten with porridge.After changing the cloth, Liu Duo slowly walked out of the outhouse and went to wash the cloth by the well. There was another bucketful of water ready. Warmth gushed into her heart. Ye Ling mentioned yesterday that he would always fetch water for her.\u201cLiu Duo, have you no shame, being under-dressed like that? Get back inside and put your clothes on!\u201d Seeing that Liu Duo did not return to her room immediately, Ye Mo stopped what he was doing and started scolding her.She perked up and glared at Mo. \u201cAre you blind? Do you not see what I\u2019m wearing? Have I somehow exposed my breasts or my buttocks?\u201dHer tone was neither salty nor calm, which made Ye Mo red in the face! How could a woman bluntly talk about such things, breasts and buttocks? Utterly shameless!\u201cYou\u2026 just get back inside and put your clothes on. Don\u2019t argue with me! As a wife, you should be submissive to your husband.

As the axe struck down, one split into two. In her room, Liu Duo got into bed and lay down with her eyes closed. Having her period was awfully uncomfortable.\u201cMo, Duo Er, food\u2019s ready,\u201d Ye Ling called out, having set out three bowls of porridge and the chopsticks.He went into the room when Liu Duo did not show up and found her cowering in the bed under the blanket. He walked to the bedside, tapped her gently and said, \u201cDuo Er, come eat. Didn\u2019t you say you wanted to go out for a walk yesterday? After breakfast, I\u2019ll take you.\u201dWhen the two were talking last night, Liu Duo said she wanted to familiarize herself with the environment. Otherwise, she would not know their location in the neighborhood, and wouldn\u2019t that be silly?Separated by the blanket, Liu Duo replied dully, \u201cI don\u2019t feel like moving. I\u2019ll eat later. My \u201cgreat aunt\u201d, I mean menstruation, makes me uncomfortable.\u201dHearing this, Ye Ling began to worry. He did not know what to do. He didn\u2019t have any practical experience with menstruation. \u201cWould you want Uncle Lee to take a look? His healing skills are great.\u201d\u201cNo, this is normal. I just need to lie down, so you can eat first,\u201d What\u2019s the need to call a doctor over a normal physical condition? It\u2019s not like she had a cramp and needed medicine.\u201cThen why not eat first and lie down later? It\u2019s bad to go hungry.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s alright.

Thanks, Ling.\u201dThere was nothing he could do for her. Ye Ling left, closing the door on his way out.Ye Mo took the bundle of wood into the kitchen and washed his hands.

He picked up his chopsticks and ate his food. Although he had never experienced menstruation, he had heard about it from the neighbors. Women tended to feel exhausted and uncomfortable during those few days.And when women had menstruation, it meant that they had matured; they could marry and give birth, and it only comes a few days every month.As Ye Mo thought about it, he could feel his ears burn. The wife could bear their children in the future. There would be a chance after consummation.While she slept, Liu Duo felt itchiness by her ear. She raised a hand to scratch it, turned over, and continued sleeping.Yet the perpetrator chuckled, \u201cGet up and eat, lazy bum.\u201dShe thought it was Ling, so she grumbled in a flirtish manner, \u201cLing, I\u2019ll get up. Soon.\u201d\u201cHurry up! Or I might just spank you,\u201d the person laughed and left.In the yard, three men were busy working. One of them was the eldest brother, Ye Yang, who had just returned from hunting. Mo and Ling were helping to process the prey Yang had brought back.Their second brother, Ye Liu, joined them after coming out from the room. Both of them had just returned, and Liu had rushed to take a look at Liu Duo.\u201cYang, Liu, have you taken breakfast?\u201d Ling asked.It was still early when they came home \u2013 barely past ten in the morning.\u201cIt\u2019s alright to skip a meal. It\u2019s almost noon anyway.\u201d Liu did not care.Yang agreed.\u201cRight. Ling, I bought medicine for you. Remember to take it every day. There are enough for a month.\u201d\u201cSure thing, Liu. Thank you so much,\u201d Ling hung his head low, feeling guilty. His monthly medical expenses would cost two-thirds of his brothers\u2019 earnings.\u201cWe are brothers. No need to thank me. If it happened to me, or Yang, or Mo \u2013 to any one of us \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t abandon us either, would you?\u201dYe Ling replied immediately, \u201cOf course not. I\u2019d definitely take care of you guys.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean!\u201d Ye Liu grinned from ear to ear.Right then, Liu Duo finally awoke. She sat up in a daze and put on her outer clothing. She combed her hair with her hand and simply tied it in a cute, playful bun.She opened the door and walked out. Two other people she had never seen before had shown up in the yard. They were processing prey, so she guessed the eldest brother of the Ye family had come home.As for the other one, that could be the second brother. From what Ling had told her last night, they might come home today!\u201cLing!\u201d Liu Duo called out.Four heads turned to her at the sound of her sweet oriole-like voice.Liu Duo stood at 1.6 meters and weighed about ninety-five grams, with a face full of collagen and skin as white and snow, which came with a seductive beauty mark. The dimples at the corners of her mouth made her seem purer and lovelier.At first sight of this girl, Yang thought, not bad.Liu thought, impressive.\u201cDuo Er, you\u2019re awake. Do you feel better?\u201d Ye Ling got up and asked her, full of concern.\u201cYes, I\u2019m a lot better.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThat\u2019s great. The cloth you hung up last night is dry now. I\u2019ve sewn the charcoal in for you.

They just came back.\u201d\u201cOh. Hi, Yang, Liu,\u201d Liu Duo addressed them politely.The eldest brother, Ye Yang, was tall and strong, with darker skin, standing at over 1.8 meters, with handsome facial features. The scar on the right side of his face made him seem scarier.The second brother, Ye Liu, was also over 1.8 meters in height, with a well-proportioned body, and he had the best-looking facial features of the four brothers.Looking at Liu Duo obediently addressing them, Yang merely acknowledged her as he continued plucking chicken feathers, his head hanging low.Liu measured the girl from top to bottom and whistled a tune when he was done, \u201cYo, lazy bum, you\u2019re finally awake!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Liu Duo slightly twitched her mouth. For someone that handsome, Liu somehow behaved like a hoodlum?After introductions, Liu Duo turned towards the outhouse, clutching the cloth that Ye Ling had sewn for her.Ye Yang had managed to hunt 8 pheasants, 3 rabbits, and a large wild boar that should weigh about 100 jin.The four brothers processed the pheasants in no time. Only several tail feathers were spared to separate the pheasants from the chickens.Liu Duo exited the outhouse to find the brothers working on the boar. She paid no mind and went to wash up by the well. She took the time to wash her cloth too.\u201cDuo Er, there\u2019s breakfast on the table. Go have it. Don\u2019t starve,\u201d said Ling, forever the kindest. Though busy, he remembered Liu Duo had not eaten.\u201cOh, thanks, Ling,\u201d Ye Ling\u2019s niceness kept her happy.More people came to the Ye family\u2019s house. They were there for the game, to taste the meat, and most importantly, because Ye Yang sold his catch at a cheaper price, and they did not have to go to town.\u201cBoss Yang, great catch this time! I\u2019m here to buy two pheasants. Haven\u2019t had game in a while,\u201d a simple man said as he came to the yard.\u201cYes, me too. I\u2019m here for the boar.\u201d\u201cMe too\u2026\u201dLiu Duo sat at the table under the roof, quietly eating her meal. Yang and Mo continued processing the boar, Liu took out the scale to weigh, and Ling handled the transactions.Pheasants, wild rabbits, and other small animals alike were 5 wen per jin; wild pork was more expensive at 10 wen per jin. If taken to town, they would be a lot more costly.\u201cHere, two pheasants for you. That\u2019s 8 jin and a half in total, so let\u2019s call it 40 wen. Handle with care, brother Wang,\u201d Liu gave the pheasants to a villager with that name.\u201cAlright, thanks,\u201d he said as he passed the money to Ling and left with the goods.Ling did not count the money when he accepted it, \u201cGoodbye, brother Wang.\u201dThey lived in the same village, and they rarely cheated, so Ye Ling did not bother counting.The villagers who came to buy wild pork chatted along as they waited for the brothers to process the meat.\u201cBrothers, is that the wife Uncle Ye bought for you guys? She\u2019s pretty,\u201d said one villager as he looked at Liu Duo.Group discussion was unavoidable after someone initiated the conversation.\u201cYou\u2019re right. For someone so small, she\u2019s quite pretty.\u201dThe Ye brothers buying a shared wife was not a big deal, but everyone knew everyone in the neighbourhood, so they would know sooner or later, but they had not seen Liu Duo in the flesh.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt\u2019s a pity she\u2019s on the small side, while all of you tower over her.

You can also collect money while sitting down.\u201d Ever since she woke up, she saw Ye Ling dealing with pheasants\u2019 feathers while squatting, and now he kept standing to collect money.Ye Ling\u2019s legs were already in an inconvenient state.

After all, he didn\u2019t work as much as the other three brothers.\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Ye Ling, just take a seat. I was just teasing Little Duo. I\u2019m not tired.\u201d Ye Liu didn\u2019t want Ye Ling to feel awkward, as Ye Ling was thin-skinned.The villagers felt temporarily relieved when they saw Liu Duo showing care for Ye Ling. After all, almost the entire village knew about the escape incident. After all, no one wanted to be a shared wife. Moreover, this shared wife\u2019s appearance was quite attractive. The only fear was that she still might be thinking of running away.The people who came to buy meat were all gone after about an hour. The only thing left were wild boar heads, spare ribs, about twenty grams of meat, and pig offals. After they cleaned up the yard, it was already noon, and they started to prepare lunch.

Ye Ling kept his head lowered as he rolled the flour and occasionally looked up at Liu Duo.\u201cOkay, mission accomplished. Stir-fried radish with pork.\u201d Liu Duo was quite confident with her cooking.In her previous life, besides working and taking shots and medicine to resist her illness, the thing she loved the most was cooking. She would cook delicious food to reward herself.After brushing the pot once, Ye Ling started to boil water to cook the noodles. Ye Ling cut the dough into thin strips, turning them into noodles.Liu Duo, who couldn\u2019t keep up, sat at the side with her legs crossed, one hand on her leg and the other holding her chin, and watched Ye Ling busying himself.Ye Ling\u2019s delicate face slowly blushed as he felt Liu Duo\u2019s intense stare.\u201cWhy do you get so embarrassed so easily?\u201d Liu Duo arched a quiet laugh.Ye Mo, who was adding firewood while tending the fire, occasionally sneaked a peek at Liu Duo.

I know I\u2019m a charm!\u201d Noticing Ye Mo\u2019s peeking, she turned to confront his gazing.

You are usually quite fierce, why aren\u2019t you saying anything now?\u201dYe Ling looked at Ye Mo, then looked at Liu Duo, and chuckled. Mo secretly checking out Duo Er? It seems like Mo doesn\u2019t really hate her after all.Hearing Ye Ling\u2019s weak laughter, Ye Mo\u2019s slightly tanned handsome face blushed as red as an apple. It wasn\u2019t clear if it was because he was close to the fire, or if it was because of embarrassment.\u201cWho looked? I have never seen such a boastful woman before! Shameless.\u201d Ye Mo clenched his teeth and denied.Liu Duo did not get angry. She continued to laugh, \u201cBlame me for being pretty.\u201d\u201cLing, do you think I\u2019m pretty?\u201d she turned her head again and asked Ye Ling.Ye Ling, the most honest husband, would naturally follow Liu Duo\u2019s lead, \u201cYou are pretty. Duo Er is the prettiest in my heart.\u201dThis was also Ye Ling\u2019s honest feeling.Ah! Does this count as Ye Ling\u2019s confession?Ye Mo was speechless after hearing Ye Ling\u2019s words. Why didn\u2019t Ye Ling side with him? Instead, he went and grew Liu Duo\u2019s arrogance!Looking at Liu Duo\u2019s smug pretty face, Ye Mo decided that, since the pot was already broken, he would throw another pot into the mess [1], \u201cYes. You are pretty, and you are also my wife! Does a husband need to secretly look at his own wife? How absurd!Looking at Ye Mo\u2019s blushing face and also hearing his quibbles, Liu Duo suddenly felt that he was a bit cute.It didn\u2019t take long for the noodles to cook after they were dropped into the pot. There were five bowls of noodles, a plate of stir-fried radish with pork, and a small bowl of pickled vegetables. After they were placed on the table, they prepared to have lunch. After Ye Yang and Ye Liu washed their hands, they went to the table, sat down, and started to eat.At the dining table, Liu Duo noticed that none of the four brothers took any of the meat. Besides the radish, they only ate the pickled vegetable. Only meat could be seen on the plate of stir-fried radish with pork. It made Liu Duo afraid to take the meat.She coughed lightly, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you guys eating the meat?\u201dYe Yang glanced at Liu Duo, \u201cYou should eat more of it.\u201dYe Liu laughed, \u201cLittle Duo, you should eat more.

She gave the meat to the four brothers, placing a piece of meat in each of their bowls. She also gave herself some of it.\u201cThis is not allowed in the future. If we have meat we should eat it together. I don\u2019t want special treatment.\u201d She picked up the bowl and didn\u2019t speak anymore.The four brothers looked at the meat in their bowl and were stunned for a second. And without prior agreement among each other, they all started to eat.After they finished lunch, Liu Duo went back to the room to have an afternoon nap. The four brothers were having a discussion in the other room.Ye Mo told the two older brothers the things that happened since Liu Duo was bought and brought over. \u201cIn the future, we will each take turns every night. This way, we won\u2019t have to worry about her escaping.\u201d\u201cMo, Duo Er won\u2019t run away. You shouldn\u2019t speak like that.\u201d Ye Ling believed Liu Duo.Ye Yang was silent and did not utter a word. Ye Liu laughed, \u201cIt is normal for her to want to run away. After all, we are depriving her. \u201dIf it weren\u2019t for Liu Duo\u2019s family, how would it have been possible for her to become their shared wife? Ye Liu\u2019s attitude towards the escape incident was very tame.\u201cLiu, what deprivation? This is a wife that was bought with money borrowed from our third uncle and with all of our savings. If she runs away, who will we find to bear us children?\u201d\u201cIf blame is to be given to anyone, then blame that granny and her good-for-nothing mom and dad! In any case, she has entered our household, and she is not allowed to run away. Otherwise, I will break her legs! It is fine, as long as she can still help us give birth.\u201d Whenever Ye Mo mentioned Liu Duo running away, his voice would get louder in agitation.The other three brothers could only shake their heads at Ye Mo\u2019s agitation. Ye Mo\u2019s temperament was simply aggressive.Ye Liu laughed, \u201cYe Mo, you should calm down. If you are this fierce, be careful that she might not consummate the marriage with you.\u201d\u201cDuo Er said she won\u2019t run away again in the future. Moreover, she even let us eat meat during lunch. Duo Er is very nice.\u201d Ye Ling believed in Liu Duo\u2019s words a hundred percent.With all that money they spent and the debt they had to carry in order to buy this wife, it would be a double whammy if she did run away and a huge blow to the Ye family. No wonder Ye Mo tended to be a bit anxious.\u201cOkay. I feel that she won\u2019t run away again. Ye Mo cannot speak about breaking legs in the future. You should treat her more warmly and your temper needs to change,\u201d Ye Liu said seriously. His feelings about Liu Duo wouldn\u2019t be wrong.Ye Mo\u2019s face was unhappy. \u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Ye Liu turned his head to face Ye Yang and then said, \u201cYang, you should sleep with Little Duo tonight. Each person gets one night. That is quite fair.\u201d\u201cAs for consummating the marriage, we will go by age. Yang, you go first. But from what Ling said, Little Duo\u2019s period came. Yang, you need to wait for a few days.\u201dYe Yang nodded and said okay, and then didn\u2019t say anything else. Just like that, Liu Duo\u2019s sleeping place for each night, and the arrangement for the consummation were officially decided.It was still early when Liu Duo woke up from her afternoon nap. She stretched her body, tidied her hair, and went to the yard.She saw Ye Yang sitting on the wooden stool and writing something with bamboo. She didn\u2019t see Ye Liu and Ye Mo, nor did she know what Ye Ling was busy with in the kitchen.She went to Ye Yang\u2019s side and squatted down. \u201cYang, what are you making?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cA pack basket,\u201d he said in a low voice, which engineers love.\u201cOh.\u201d She initially wanted to chat more, but she saw Ye Yang only cared about working on what was in his hands in silence, with his head down, and with an emotionless expression, so she didn\u2019t want to say too much.Liu Duo acted tactfully and didn\u2019t bother him. She got up and went to the outhouse and then went to find Ye Ling. She prepared to go out to walk around. She didn\u2019t make it yesterday, so she definitely had to go today. Otherwise, she felt like she would go crazy from staying in the house every day.The ancient times didn\u2019t have phones, computers, or televisions. Having nothing to do was difficult to bear.

Some were rubbed with salt to prevent them from going rotten. The boar head was also cut into two pieces.Liu Duo went to the kitchen and leaned against the door. \u201cLing, have you finished? If you\u2019ve finished, can we go out for a walk?Ye Ling\u2019s face was lit up with a smile whenever he heard Liu Duo\u2019s voice. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ve finished. While we are on our way, let\u2019s bring some meat to Third Aunt.\u201dIn the past, Ye Ling didn\u2019t smile a lot. The first reason was that he always felt that he was a burden to his three brothers. The second reason was that he felt inferior, because of the problem with his legs. He stumbled when he walked, and it didn\u2019t look good. The village children always made fun of his walking.Ever since Liu Duo ran away and woke up, in these two days they interacted, he became much more cheerful and started to smile more and more.He tied two pieces of meat with twine and carried them in his hand. It was about five or six grams. \u201cLet\u2019s go.

This put her in an especially good mood. Having unpolluted air really puts people in a comfortable mood.Liu Duo\u2019s smile created very deep dimples at the sides of her mouth. She opened up her arms and took a deep breath. \u201cComing out feels so refreshing. The air is so good!\u201dThe ancient time, without chemical pollution, was definitely better than the 21st century by thousands of times!\u201cAs long as Duo Er likes it.

In the future, let\u2019s come out more often.\u201d The excited Liu Duo held Ye Ling\u2019s arm and smiled.Being held by the arm by Liu Duo while walking made Ye Ling\u2019s face red and his heart race. He wanted Liu Duo to let go, but he was also afraid to make Liu Duo unhappy.During this time period, it didn\u2019t matter if they were husband and wife, man and woman weren\u2019t allowed to have such intimate activities in the day.Some of the villagers saw Liu Duo holding Ye Ling. They pointed at them, \u201cWho is that girl holding on to a man so shamelessly?\u201d\u201cThat man looks like the fourth brother in the Ye family. That woman should be the shared wife that was bought! Why else would they be walking together?\u201d\u201cThey are really offending public morals.

I still want to bring Duo Er to see our vegetable and paddy field.\u201dKnowing that young people like them barely had anything to talk about with an old granny like her, Third Aunt said, \u201cOkay.

That I might dislike you guys for being poor and then run away?\u201dActually in the beginning, besides the reason of being the shared wife of us four brothers, she did dislike our family for being poor!

Every now and then, he would toss some manure onto the plants as fertilizer. Normally, they would only water their crops.\u201cLing, what brings you here?\u201d Liu with his bucket of manure was the first to spot Ye Ling and Liu Duo.Upon hearing that, Ye Mo looked up and gave Liu Duo a meaningful look before going back to weeding.\u201cI brought Duo Er to have a look at our farm and get to know the surroundings.\u201d\u201cRight, it\u2019s good to get used to the place,\u201d Liu put down the bucket, took out the long dipper, and began scooping manure onto the roots.Ye Ling went to squat beside Ye Mo to help with the weeds. Liu Duo stood aside and observed before taking a spot next to Ye Ling.Having had no experience with weeding, Liu Duo felt curious about the deed. She pulled at the weed with all her might but could not extract the roots. She must have been doing it wrong. It took her several more attempts to get it right.She smiled deeper the more weeds she pulled. With Liu Duo and Ye Ling joining in, they finished weeding a lot quicker.\u201cDuo Er, take a rest, don\u2019t get too tired,\u201d Ye Ling felt sorry for her. He didn\u2019t want her to work.Liu Duo had not even replied, but Ye Mo cut in, \u201cGot tired so fast? She\u2019s not a rich lady. It\u2019s not like she hasn\u2019t worked before!\u201dLiu Duo squinted at Ye Mo, there he goes again!She was not quite tired in the first place. Her feet felt a little numb, her back sore.

As for Ye Liu, who had gone off to get more manure and had not returned, he did not hear anything. He came back to see Ye Mo dragging Liu Duo. The girl seemed to be shouting. The two seemed to be having a quarrel.Knowing Mo\u2019s infamous temper, and seeing him not taking his hands off Liu Duo, Ye Liu was afraid Mo would get physical out of impulse, so he put down the bucket and rushed to assist.\u201cMo, let her go.

His face strained as he struggled to apologize, but he did not manage to speak.On the other hand, Liu Duo saw Ye Mo open his mouth, but no words came out \u2013 only a look of grievance on his face. What a chauvinist, saving face to the end!She lifted her chin and said, \u201cSave it, Liu. Let\u2019s not bring ourselves to his level!\u201dAs she lay on the bed in a daze, she figured that, according to her past life, she was twenty-five years old in spirit! Why bother fussing over a scumbag four years younger than her?\u201cOur precious Little Duo, righteous as ever. I\u2019m liking you more and more,\u201d Ye Liu stretched his arms across Liu Duo\u2019s shoulders, like a hoodlum.Liu Duo felt aversed, goosebumps rising all over her body. Are these brothers related by blood? Why are they so different?Yang was as stoic as a block of wood, Liu resembled a gangster, and Mo was impulsive and bad-tempered, whereas Ling was so gentle and amiable. No matter how she looked at them, they did not seem like family.\u201cApologise!\u201d Ye Yang suddenly joined in and bellowed.The three brothers glared at Ye Mo, as if the situation would get worse if he did not suck it up. Ye Mo knew he was in the wrong, so he muttered softly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cLouder. Duo can\u2019t hear you. Did you not eat? You sound like a mosquito!\u201d Ye Liu dug his ears.\u201cI said, I\u2019m sorry. It was my fault.\u201d Ye Mo could not bear his second brother\u2019s strange ambiance, but he relented in a loud voice.\u201cThere we go. Admitting your mistake is the right thing to do!\u201d Ye Liu patted Ye Mo\u2019s shoulder as a playful smile danced across his face.Just like that, under Ye Liu\u2019s \u2018authority\u2019, the conflict was easily resolved. Liu Duo pushed Ye Liu away and headed to the outhouse.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You wish!\u201d She pushed him out and slammed the door.With no shower gel and no bathtub, Liu Duo realized how much she missed them!

The village gradually became more and more lively, and smoke started to come out of the kitchen chimneys.Her mood was good before going to bed, so when she got up from her sleep, Liu Duo was full of smiles, as if she were bathing in the spring wind. She even woke up early for the first time! She put on her clothes, pants, and shoes. She picked up her wooden comb and started to hum while combing her long hair that went down to her waist. She pushed open the door and went out.\u201cGood morning, Yang!\u201dShe saw Ye Yang sweeping the fallen leaves in the yard. Liu Duo had a smile in her eyes, and the dimples at the corners of her eyes were enchanting.Ye Yang lifted up his head and looked at Liu Duo. He nodded, \u201cMorning. Not going to sleep longer?\u201dIt was only about six-something right now. Usually, Liu Duo would still be in deep sleep.\u201cI\u2019ve slept enough, so I don\u2019t need to sleep anymore.\u201d Liu Duo sat on the wooden stool and combed her hair.\u201cOh.\u201d He lowered his head and continued to sweep the floor.She combed her hair into a bun and went back into the house to look at the bronze mirror. She looked right and looked left and then nodded in satisfaction. \u201cVery pretty!\u201dShe put down the wooden comb and took a cloth to the outhouse. The other three brothers also finished putting on their clothes and walked out. After he washed his face and rinsed his mouth, Ye Ling went to the kitchen to cook. Ye Mo was busy starting the fire.Ye Liu sat beneath the roof with his legs crossed, with one hand on his legs, and with another on the table. He would knock on the table from time to time. He smiled in a way that made him look punchable. \u201cYang, have you been sleeping well recently?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d he glanced at Ye Liu.People should not mention the problems of others so openly. It was truly a torment! Moreover, the wife was still young! He still needed to continue to suffer! Ye Yang indicated.\u201cTsk, Yang, is your expression showing your unsatisfied desires?\u201d Ye Liu touched his chin while looking playful.He clearly knew Liu Duo was on her period and couldn\u2019t consummate the marriage, but he still teased him! Even if she wasn\u2019t on her period, Ye Yang had never thought about consummating the marriage.Ye Yang\u2019s always stoic face showed a rare eye roll.After Liu Duo came out of the outhouse, she went beside the well to clean the cloth. When Ye Liu saw Liu Duo, the target of his teasing immediately changed.\u201cYo, Little Duo, you woke up quite early today.\u201d He stepped over beside Liu Duo.\u201c\u2026\u201d He really was a hooligan, and a hooligan whose attractive index was off the charts, no less!\u201cCome, Little Duo, I will help you wash it.\u201d He intentionally came close to Liu Duo\u2019s ear and spoke flirtatiously.Liu Duo lowered her ears and said tenderly in a low voice, \u201cSpeak to me from further away. I don\u2019t need your help.\u201dShe finished washing it by herself and hung it on a rope. She then continued to wash her face and brush her teeth. She treated Ye Liu like air.Ye Liu touched his nose and laughed. He did not feel that Liu Duo\u2019s attitude was bad at all.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Five of them sat around the table and ate dumplings. They were made especially for Liu Duo by Ye Ling, because Liu Duo did not like to eat paste. In the past, before Liu Duo came to their house, they would always eat paste or plain congee. They could save more money that way.Liu Duo bit into the dumpling and it was all meat fillings. Liu Duo ate happily. \u201cLing, these dumplings are delicious.\u201d\u201cEat more of them if they are delicious. There are still some in the pot.\u201d Seeing Liu Duo happy also made Ye Ling happy.She ate a whole fifteen dumplings. Liu Duo let out a belch and leaned back against the chair.

Although he was a bit simple, and also a bit stoic, she still found him to be very masculine!Ye Yang felt Liu Duo looking at him. He still maintained an expressionless face. Only he himself knew that his heartbeat sped up considerably.\u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean we need to go to town? Yang, I want to go.\u201d Liu Duo was very excited.

They walked for half an hour before arriving in town. It made Liu Duo so tired that she bent down and tapped her legs.She had never walked such a long distance before. In the past, no matter where she went, she would always use her household\u2019s private car. Liu Duo really didn\u2019t want to continue to experience this feeling of traveling with her own legs.\u201cYang, why don\u2019t we take an ox cart when we go back later?\u201d She saw an ox cart on the road. She wanted to get on it, but their condition at home did not allow for it.\u201cOkay.\u201d Ye Yang saw that Liu Duo was tired. He decided in his heart, \u201cNext time we come, we will also come by ox cart.\u201dThe town was very lively. There were nonstop sounds of people selling things. Liu Duo looked around everywhere excitedly\u2026 This little Pingning town may be small, but it was very well stocked. All sorts of things were sold there.They arrived at the grain shop and Ye Yang said, with an air of familiarity, \u201cBoss, give us two bags of forty jins coarse powder.\u201dThe chubby boss said happily, \u201cOkay. Eighty jin of coarse powder. One jin is four wen. The total is three hundred and sixty wen.\u201dPowder (flour) could be categorized into three types. Coarse, fine, and refined. And the price for each type was four wen per jin, six wen per jin, and eight wen per jin, respectively.The price for each kind of food was written on wooden signs. The characters used in this alternate reality were exactly the same as the characters used in modern times.The price of rice was divided into eight wen per jin for broken rice, ten wen per jin for coarse rice, and twenty wen per jin for polished rice.\u201cYang, can we buy a few jin of rice to eat?\u201d It felt like she hadn\u2019t eaten any cooked rice for a long time. Although crude fiber was very healthy, one should still eat cooked rice, right?The hand Ye Yang used to carry money suddenly stopped. He looked at Liu Duo. Liu Duo was looking at him with a hopeful expression. Her dazzling big black eyes were very bright. \u201cAdd another five jin of polished rice.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay, okay.

Liu Duo took a special look at the tailor\u2019s shop when they passed by it.She actually really wanted to buy some clothes. When the previous owner of the body went to the Ye family household, she only brought two changes of clothes beside the clothes that she wore.

Three wen per person.\u201d He shook off the ash.Ye Yang took out six wen straightaway and then gave them to Wang Tuozi. He placed the two bags of powder and the bag of polished rice into the cart. He then sat on the side.Liu Duo looked at the cart that was made of wood, and then looked at the four wheels made out of wood. When it started, the ox would be pulling at the front. She had never sat in one before but was very eager to try it.Liu Duo sat very near to Ye Yang. The ox cart was clearly very spacious, but she still chose to sit so close to Ye Yang. Ye Yang\u2019s entire body was stiff and he did not know what to do. People who looked over would start to gossip again.When he moved to the side a little bit, she would immediately follow. Ye Yang gave up. If she stuck to him then that\u2019s that. If people wanted to talk, let them talk.Wang Tuozi, who was smoking his tobacco, looked at Liu Duo and thought, The young wife from the Ye family is quite attractive. She\u2019s just a bit too brazen! Sticking to a man in broad daylight. Wang Tuozi did not make his feelings known and continued to smoke his tobacco.After a long time, no one else came. After Wang Tuozi finished his smoke, he sat in front of the ox cart and whipped his whip. The ox cart started to move.As the road was uneven, the ox cart kept swaying around. In the beginning, Liu Duo felt it was interesting, as it was new, but after a while, her butt could not handle it anymore. She had never experienced such punishment before.She looked around and saw that there wasn\u2019t even a cushion on the ox cart!

Ox carts were bumpy by nature. He himself did not feel anything.\u201dBear? That was easy to say, but for Liu Duo who had never experienced such hardship, how could she bear it?She held onto Ye Yang\u2019s arm, borrowed his strength, and sat on his thighs. She used the thick and soft thighs as a cushion. Liu Duo said, while smiling happily and showing all her teeth, \u201cLet me borrow Yang\u2019s legs to sit on. It doesn\u2019t hurt now.\u201dYe Yang almost threw Liu Duo down the instant she sat on his legs. He was so nervous that he had trouble breathing, and his heartbeat increased.\u201cGet down.

He felt that his life after twenty-five would no longer be bland and lonely anymore.Sometimes, a person who doesn\u2019t pay attention to their surroundings could also perhaps change their life. Sometimes it would be for good, but sometimes it would be bad!The cart kept shaking. Liu Duo felt like she was about to fall asleep. Ye Yang unknowingly took the initiative to embrace Liu Duo so that she could sit more comfortably.\u201cYang, it\u2019s so boring.\u201d The journey was silent. Only the steps and breath of the ox could be heard.\u201cWe\u2019re almost home.\u201d Ye Yang looked ahead.\u201cYang, sing a song for me to listen to.\u201d She looked up and stared at Ye Yang\u2019s clean chin. She was trying to find something to talk about to relieve the boredom!\u201c\u2026\u201d Sing? Ye Yang thought in his heart that he had never sang before!Liu Duo didn\u2019t get an answer.

Liu Duo cleared her throat and sang, \u201cToday\u2019s weather is so fine, the scenery is nice everywhere, nice scenery\u2026\u201dIn her past life, Liu Duo liked to sing, but because of her illness, she could only hum softly.

After all, Ye Ling had to have his medication every month.Ye Liu saw that Ye Mo wasn\u2019t responding and said something very harsh, \u201cSince you feel that Little Duo shouldn\u2019t eat rice, then you should go find another wife for yourself and have her eat coarse powder with you!

He\u2019s nothing but a hoodlum!\u201dYe Ling looked at Liu Duo, still red in the face and not speaking, nodding, or shaking his head.The last piece of clothing was washed and placed into the bucket. \u201cAlright, we can go now.\u201dYe Liu carried the bucket so that Liu Duo and Ye Ling\u2019s hands would be empty. Together they walked home.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Ye Mo had not returned for the night. He was staying at his childhood friend, Li Gen Er\u2019s, house. The friend, who went by the name of Li Wazi, was poor too, but he married a one-eyed wife.There were three members in the family. His father died early, and the inheritance was divided. Li Wazi could barely feed the family by himself.\u201cMo, you aren\u2019t going back? Your brothers would be worried,\u201d Li Wazi said.He was wrong. Ye Yang, Liu, and Ling would not be worried about him.\u201cWorried? In their mind there\u2019s only that bitch, and my own brothers treat me like this! Let me go find my own wife, live my own life, when they very well know I wouldn\u2019t agree!\u201d Ye Mo said with burning rage.It was not quite impossible to get his own wife, even if they were quite poor.After all Ye Mo was in his prime, perfectly healthy, strong, and diligent. He also had the looks, and quite a number of ladies would fall for that.\u201cThat nasty bitch. Running away and eating good stuff. Did we really buy her, or are we raising her as Buddha? She doesn\u2019t know her place! We bought her to bear our children!\u201dThe more he thought, the angrier he got. Ye Mo thumped on the table as he rose and yelled, \u201cI\u2019m going back to let her know her place!\u201dWith that, he rushed out.\u201cMo, you ought to calm down,\u201d Li Wazi quickly raced after him.But he was one step too late. Ye Mo had already disappeared. Li Wazi shook his head. \u201cThis guy is still as impulsive as ever.\u201dWhen they were young, whenever Li Wazi was bullied, Ye Mo would almost hit first and ask questions later. The villagers were usually afraid of him.Liu Duo was washing her cloth by the well, while Ye Liu and Ye Ling were preparing lunch in the kitchen.She had just finished washing it and hanging up to dry when Ye Mo returned. He rushed to Liu Duo\u2019s side, easily picked her up and dragged her into the room.Being suddenly picked up like this, she was stunned, and kept struggling when she finally reacted. \u201cAh, are you crazy? Put me down!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Not responding to her, Ye Mo directly threw her onto the bed like he would a gunny sack.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWith a \u2018whomp\u2019, she landed painfully and wailed, \u201cGeez, you\u2019ve really gone crazy, you nutter!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Ye Mo glared before he violently pounced onto her. In full control, he strapped her hands over her head.\u201cYou bet I\u2019ve gone crazy. I must have been blind to agree to buying you! You are a bitch, and you destroyed our brotherhood!\u201dLiu Duo glared at Ye Mo, who was currently enshrined in madness. She was so mad at herself for worrying about him, for being afraid something would happen to him, and look at what was going on now, treating her like this once he got home?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yang bought 5 jins of polished rice, and suddenly she became a wasteful bitch?What had she not tried before, in her previous life? She always had the best. Now that she was brought back to the past, stricken by poverty and could not handle rough rice, wanting to have normal rice became a sin?Rice was grown to be eaten, not to be looked at! She knew they did not have a lot of money, and she thought of ways to earn more. It wasn\u2019t like she didn\u2019t consider their situation, especially since Yang had headed for the hills again.Liu Duo thought of Yang and instantly calmed down. \u201cYou let me go. I\u2019ll find a way to earn back the money for the polished rice, and then we can eat well for the rest of our lives.\u201d\u201cListen to you? Hmph\u2026\u201d Ye Mo snorted in contempt.She had said she would make money, yet Ye Mo was still reluctant, and this angered her. \u201cLet me go, I said let me go, or I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d\u201cOr you\u2019ll what? We bought you back, remember? Your job is to make babies for us!\u201d With that, Ye Mo lowered his head and bit her neck.Liu Duo cried out in pain, \u201cOw\u2026 you scoundrel!\u201dWhen Ye Mo bit onto her neck, his heart beat fast. This was his first time so close to a woman. And this woman\u2019s body was beyond soft, like having no bones, and the fragrance made him blush despite being so mad that his face was distorted.In the kitchen, the cracking of the firewood muffled Liu Duo\u2019s screams, but ever since they had a wife at home, her actions had tied their heartstrings.Ye Liu and Ye Ling rushed out and followed the sounds coming from the room.They saw Ye Mo throwing himself on Liu Duo, biting her neck, and no matter how hard she struggled, she could not overcome the disparity of strength between them.Ye Liu took Ye Mo down in one go and pulled him out of the room. Ye Ling came to give her a comforting hug, \u201cDuo Er, don\u2019t be scared. Liu and I will protect you.\u201dLiu Duo nodded as she sobbed and dried her tears.Ye Liu gave Ye Mo a terrible beating after pulling him out of the room, \u201cYou\u2019ve gone too far, Mo, bullying Little Duo again!\u201dHe landed one punch after another, each just as forceful. Ye Mo grimaced in pain, but dared not to revolt.In the room, Liu Duo heard Ye Liu\u2019s sounds of scolding and beating. She tugged at Ye Ling\u2019s sleeves, \u201cLing, Liu wouldn\u2019t paralyse him, would he?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Liu knows what he\u2019s doing. Mo deserves it.\u201d Ye Ling was very furious with what Mo did to Duo Er.\u201cOh,\u201d Liu Duo dried her tears and got down from the bed, exiting the room with Ye Ling.Ye Mo looked pitiful on the ground after being savagely beaten. Footprints were everywhere on his body, and his face was \u2018colorful\u2019, to say the least, with blood dripping from the corners of his mouth.As for Ye Liu, his hands were numb after the beating. He grabbed the pole next to him, ready to give his brother a good whipping.Liu Duo saw that and immediately sounded, \u201cLiu, stop.\u201dThe pole was very thick, so one strike would be unbearable. She could almost imagine the whipping on her own body. It had to be extremely painful.Liu Duo begged him to stop. Ye Liu grinned and said, \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. Our Mo has thick skin.

Liu Duo thought, Oh my god, is he really his little brother that is related by blood? The punches were so vicious.\u201cSince Little Duo doesn\u2019t let me attack anymore, I won\u2019t attack. Your skin is really coarse and your bones are really thick. Even my hands are hurting.\u201d Ye Liu came to Liu Duo\u2019s side.Liu Duo saw a big hand with five slender and well-proportioned fingers in front of her. Liu Duo showed a face of confusion. What is he doing?\u201cLittle Duo, for you, my hands have become numb from tiredness. You need to take responsibility and massage it.\u201d His face looked like he was wronged.\u201cEm\u2026\u201d Liu Duo felt like she had a headache.

Ye Mo thought that he himself was the person who became numb from pain!Liu Duo knew Ye Liu was faking it, but he did stand up for her, so she pulled his hands over and massaged them as a token gesture.\u201cAhh, that feels good. Don\u2019t stop. It is about to stop being numb.\u201d Ye Liu showed an expression of pleasure.She pushed away Ye Liu\u2019s hands with one swoop and said, \u201cAre you still not going to start the flame and cook? I\u2019m hungry!\u201dThe moment Ye Ling heard Liu Duo said she was hungry, he immediately turned around, went to the kitchen, and then started to cook. He did not care if it was real or fake.Ye Liu knew Liu Duo\u2019s thoughts, and that he shouldn\u2019t go overboard. \u201cOkay. It will be cooked immediately. I will feed Little Duo until she is plump and white!\u201dIs he treating me like a pig? Feeding me until I\u2019m plump and white! Liu Duo became so angry that her cheeks bulged. And her previous feelings of depression all disappeared.Both of them also went to the kitchen, leaving only Ye Mo there, by himself, in a daze!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014After they finished cooking and were about to eat, the two brothers had a tacit understanding and neither of them called Ye Mo. Liu Duo glanced over at both of them. They clearly cooked his portion, but they didn\u2019t call him over to eat?\u201cLiu, Ling. Are you guys not going to call him over to eat?\u201d Liu Duo couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cDoes he think he is a lord? That he is a pampered son of a wealthy family? Or that he is our old ancestor? Does he still need to be called over to eat?\u201d Ye Liu did not care at all.Ye Ling didn\u2019t speak and just ate his own food. He sat on the same side as Liu. It was Ye Mo\u2019s fault for bullying Liu Duo.\u201cEm\u2026\u201d She couldn\u2019t tell from looking that Ye Liu\u2019s mouth was so poisonous. He was even able to harm his own brother!Liu Duo put down her bowl and went to the bedroom. She saw Ye Mo lying stiff on the bed, like a corpse. He did not move at all.He wiped clean the blood on the corner of his lip and changed his clothes. Liu Duo was very satisfied. Although this person was very vile and impulsive, she did like the fact that he liked to keep clean.\u201cHey, time to eat.\u201d Liu Duo stretched her hands to push his shoulder.Ye Mo didn\u2019t utter a word. He turned his head and looked at Liu Duo. She didn\u2019t know what he was thinking about.\u201cWhy are you looking at me? I asked you to go to eat. Have you become a mute!\u201d She glared at Ye Mo.If she didn\u2019t take into consideration that he was one of her four husbands, she wouldn\u2019t pay attention to him. If he was beaten to death or starved to death, it would be well deserved!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe looked at the small expression in Liu Duo\u2019s eyes and felt that she was a bit cute. Was she not angry with how he had treated her?

You can starve to death!\u201d She turned around and left.He turned his body and looked at Liu Duo\u2019s back. Ye Mo pondered deeply. Initially, it was Liu Duo\u2019s grandmother who came to them when she heard that their family wanted to get a shared wife and were willing to give ten taels of betrothal gifts. She said their granddaughter could be sold to them as a shared wife, but her family wanted twenty taels of silver. Furthermore, they would never have any communications with her in the future.Ye Mo initially did not agree. Twenty taels was too expensive, but Uncle Ye said, \u201cIt is good if they cut off contact with her after she is sold to you guys.

They wanted a shared wife anyway. Since her family took the initiative and reached out to them to sell her, they bought Liu Duo.They also agreed that they would treat her well, but she ran away. And now, she also wasted money. He was indeed impulsive and hurt her just now, but he felt regret after he was beaten up.He treated her so badly, but she was still willing to come and ask him to eat. \u201cWas I wrong?\u201d Ye Mo muttered to himself.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014When Ye Liu saw Liu Duo came back to the table while huffing and puffing, he laughed, \u201cLittle Duo. I already said you shouldn\u2019t bother with Mo, but you still went there stubbornly to find displeasure!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s just eat. Will eating be able to block your mouth?\u201d Liu Duo rolled her eyes.Ye Liu said mischievously, \u201cIf Little Duo feeds me, then it might be able to block my mouth!\u201dAfter he spoke, he even pushed his bowl to Liu Duo. His face conveyed the message, Quickly, block my mouth!She grabbed a piece of meat and stuffed it into his mouth, \u201cMaster, my master, eat quickly!\u201dYe Liu chewed the meat in his mouth, and his face was full of satisfaction. \u201cSince Little Duo has rewarded me a piece of meat, I will reluctantly eat by myself.\u201dLiu Duo realized that her own anger was always so easily dissipated by this hooligan.The three of them ate harmoniously. Ye Mo walked over while dragging his feet.Ye Ling got up, went to the kitchen, and filled a bowl for him. After all, he was his third brother. Even if he was angry at him, the anger would be gone after a while.Ye Liu took a bite of vegetables and then slanted his eyes at Ye Mo. \u201cYo, who is this majesty? He looks like he grew up to have a fat head and big ears. A face of fortune. How shall I serve you?\u201dLiu Duo wanted to laugh when she heard Ye Liu\u2019s enigmatic words. Because of what you did, you didn\u2019t even recognize your own third brother?\u201cYou guys take your time to eat. I finished eating.\u201d He placed down his bowl and returned to his room.The corner of Ye Mo\u2019s mouth started to twitch when he heard that. Even if his face had been punched and was somewhat swollen, it wasn\u2019t to the point where he had a fat head and big ears, right?Liu, can you not say such vicious words to your own brother? Ye Mo thought depressedly.\u201cMo, eat quickly or it will get cold.\u201d Ye Ling gave him chopsticks. He actually wanted to laugh a bit at what Ye Liu said.Ye Mo\u2019s anger started again when he saw, through Liu Duo\u2019s back, that she was holding back her laughter. His anger was on an upward trend. Aren\u2019t you the reason I was beaten up to this point by Liu!\u201dAs if Ye Liu knew Ye Mo\u2019s anger was starting up again, he put down his bowl and said with a very serious expression, \u201cYe Mo, if you still dare to bully Little Duo in the future, it won\u2019t just be a beating.

When Yang comes back, I will tell him that if this happens again, Mo will move out immediately!\u201dYe Liu had got a clear understanding from Uncle Ye early on of why Liu Duo was sold to their family as a shared wife. She was also a very pitiful person, as she was sold away, like an object, by her family.Since fate had brought her to their house, she was a real member of the family. Although they weren\u2019t rich, and she was a shared wife, she did come to their house. This meant that she was an important part of the family that could not be removed! And she was not just a tool for carrying their ancestral line.Ye Ling was unbearably anxious. He shook Ye Mo, \u201cMo, quickly admit you were wrong, and say you will not treat Liu Duo like that anymore.\u201dYe Mo\u2019s soul was shaken back into him. He was somewhat afraid to look at Liu. He said meekly, \u201cLiu, I was wrong.\u201dYe Liu looked at Ye Mo and also found it hard to bear. He sighed and said sincerely and earnestly, \u201cYe Mo, Little Duo isn\u2019t merely just the shared wife of us four brothers. Most importantly, she is also our family. She is an inseparable part of our family. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cLook at yourself. How do you treat her? Have you ever treated her as family?\u201dYe Liu\u2019s question made Ye Mo speechless. He always said that she was a shared wife whose purpose was to bear them children. He indeed had never said she was family.\u201cLittle Duo has quite the tolerance. Although she did not get angry this time, mostly because of my considerable effort and my handsome face, she is still just a little girl. She needs to be taken care of.\u201d He did not forget to praise himself while he spoke.When Liu Duo had heard the sound of the table being hit earlier, she thought that they would fight again, so she went to the bedroom door and listened from the corner. Initially, when she heard Ye Liu say she was family and was a part of the family, she nodded to praise him for saying something good.As he spoke, he started to become flippant.

Of the four brothers, he was the one who cared the least about worldly values. That was why he could brazenly hold Liu Duo\u2019s hand while walking leisurely on the village road.This was something that Liu Duo didn\u2019t need to change. She was actually quite happy. In her previous life, she never had the experience of walking while holding hands with her own man.She suddenly felt a feeling of warmth from walking leisurely while holding hands with Ye Liu. She really liked this feeling.\u201cLittle Duo, can you tell me what you wanted to do by asking me to come out by myself?\u201d Ye Liu suddenly asked out of the blue.The warm atmosphere was ruined, by Ye Liu, just like that. It disappeared without a trace.Liu Duo wanted to push away his hands in one fell swoop. This hooligan made her feel warm?

She then continued to say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what kind of business a woman can do that can easily and quickly earn money? Moreover, one that doesn\u2019t need a complex process?\u201dAfter she finished speaking, she looked carefully at Ye Liu. He was the smartest and most cunning of the four brothers. Could he guess it correctly?Liu Duo showed she was a bit excited. She also wanted to use this as a way to figure out if he had spent that kind of money before by gauging his speech. If he had, humph, she would immediately remove him from being one of her four husbands!Ye Liu was pondering when he first heard what Liu Duo said. He suddenly felt a chilling gaze on him. He lifted up his head and saw Little Duo staring at him, with an expression of contemplation, with both her arms around her chest. She looked like she was demanding him to respond quickly.Although he wasn\u2019t sure, Ye Liu initially considered whether or not Little Duo was referring to partnering with the madam of a brothel. Now that he saw her expression, he immediately knew he had guessed right!A smile suddenly appeared on his face, yet he suddenly reached out with his hands and flicked Liu Duo on her forehead! \u201cNice Little Duo, umm\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can actually give ideas on this kind of business? Then why don\u2019t you experiment on my body first?\u201d He pulled Liu Duo over and hugged her waist. His dirty hands even rubbed against her.She knew he guessed it, and she wasn\u2019t argumentative. He held the hand of the person who was playing hooligan. \u201cTell me, have you ever gone? Have you ever spent that kind of money?\u201d\u201cOf course not. I have said it before, my body and heart belong to Little Duo. I have kept myself pure for twenty-three years for you. You cannot fault me!\u201d Ye Liu was in a good mood. Since she cared about such things he should grab the chance to immediately show his sincere heart!Although Ye Liu\u2019s tone was frivolous, Liu Duo felt happy in her heart. She nevertheless said with her mouth, \u201cWho knows if what you said is true or false. Even if it is a lie, there is no way to prove it!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true. I swear it!\u201d He let go of Liu Duo, held up three fingers, and knelt down. \u201cI swear to the heavens, if I, Ye Liu, lied to my wife, Liu Duo, then I will never sleep on my wife\u2019s bed ever again. Having a wife will be no different from not having a wife. I will become a monk!\u201dPfff, Liu Duo suddenly blushed with embarrassment. He wasn\u2019t serious, even when he was making a vow! It made her mad, but it was also funny. She turned around and left. She didn\u2019t want to bother with this hooligan.When he saw that his wife left, he immediately ran after her. \u201cLittle Duo, you have to believe me now, right? If I lied to you, I would have to live as a widower! I really am pure, in both heart and soul. My beauty only blossoms for you!\u201dAh, I\u2019ve got goosebumps all over my body! Liu Duo thought.Liu Duo did not reply, but there was a smile on her face. She could not hide it, even if she tried, as her dimple were very deep. When Ye Liu saw Liu Duo smiling happily, he also became happy.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cLittle Duo, exactly what kind of partner are you looking to find in town? And what kind of ideas can you give?\u201d Ye Liu asked directly about the previous topic again.\u201cYou want to know?\u201d She stopped walking and looked at him.\u201cOf course.\u201d He nodded.\u201cActually, I also want to know, but I still don\u2019t know, so I can\u2019t let you know right now. Wait until I figure it out and know. Then I will let you know!\u201d Liu Duo finished speaking in one breath, and then ran away laughing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She sighed, \u201cit\u2019s so different with longer legs!\u201dThey walked hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder once again. This time, Ye Liu watched his mouth, not even mentioning what had just happened. Between them, silence spoke louder than words, as they both bore satisfied smiles on their faces.As they passed by a residence, they heard shouting and beating, as well as a woman crying. Around them, people were starting to gather and look on passively.\u201cMrs. Wang, what\u2019s going on now?\u201d A woman asked.\u201cNot sure, let\u2019s see,\u201d another woman answered.\u201cWhat a pity, pregnant and being beaten still.\u201d\u201cI heard Liu Ergouzi wants money to gamble again, but Liu Lanshi wouldn\u2019t give it to him.\u201d\u2026As she heard the murmurs, Liu Duo did not want to look on. Not only was this unrelated to her, she did not like being an onlooker and a busybody.She took Ye Liu\u2019s hand and was about to leave, but it did not take long before more people crowded the place, all discussing at once.Liu Duo furrowed her eyebrows, annoyed that she could not get past. It was someone else\u2019s business, what was there to see? What a bunch of silly people!They were stuck there. Ye Liu did not like it either. He did not like making gossip, but the villagers did not have much entertainment other than farming, so they found delight in sticking their noses in other people\u2019s affairs!\u201cYou stinky bitch, where did you hide the money? Give it to me, now!\u201d Liu Ergouzi shouted fiercely.\u201cHusband, that money\u2019s not for gambling. It\u2019s for Xiao Lian\u2019s medicine,\u201d Liu Lanshi sobbed.

Shut up!\u201d And he pushed his mother away.Having been pushed onto the ground, the mother cried, \u201cYou wretched\u2026\u201dLiu Lanshi went to help her up, and the both of them burst into tears. Little Xiao Lian, about four or five years old, crouched aside and coughed in between sobs.\u201cErgouzi, how could you do this to your mother and your wife? This is very unbecoming.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, whatever it is, you shouldn\u2019t hurt them!\u201d\u2026The audience could not stand it any longer as they pointed out his faults.\u201cWhat are you looking at?

As she passed by the house, Liu Duo glanced at Liu Lanshi and shook her head.Seeing her do so, Ye Liu asked, \u201cWhat are you shaking your head for?\u201d\u201cNothing. Let\u2019s go home.\u201dIf you didn\u2019t care about yourself, how would you expect someone else to? If you didn\u2019t fight back, no one would fight for you! Blindly compromising would only suck the life out of you!\u201cRight.\u201d They held hands as they slowly walked home.They reached home and, after making their return known, Liu Duo rushed to the outhouse to change her cloth. Another two days and her period would be gone.As usual, she washed and hung her cloth to dry on the rope.Ye Ling sat under the roof with a needle and thread, patching some clothes. Liu Duo walked over and sat beside him. \u201cLing, you know how to mend clothes? How handy!\u201d\u201cYes, I do. This is Mo\u2019s. It got ripped when he was chopping wood. With a bit of sewing, he can wear it again.\u201d He was the one who sewed them back together whenever his brothers\u2019 clothes needed mending.The clothes they wore had been patched again and again. As long as they were still wearable, the brothers would not throw them away.She stared at his proficiency and could not help asking, \u201cLing, about your parents, when did they pass away?\u201dHaving no women in the house, having to learn feminine chores, and being good at them, Liu Duo felt pity towards Ye Ling.Ye Ling paused. It had been a while since his parents were mentioned. He had almost forgotten. He was very young then, but he had a vivid memory.He mended the final stitch, cut off the thread, and stared up at the ceiling as he slowly spoke. \u201cAbout ten years ago, I guess. Time passed so quickly.\u201dTen years? If so, Yang was fifteen, Liu was thirteen, Mo was eleven, and Ling would have been only nine. They must have had a miserable childhood. With no parents, she could not imagine what kind of life they lived.\u201cOnce, dad brought Yang hunting in the hills. There was an accident. Dad fell into a trap to save Yang. The trap was used to capture large animals. That was when Yang\u2019s face got terribly scratched. He came home with blood on his face, asking our uncles to help rescue dad, but they didn\u2019t care. Grandmother didn\u2019t care either.\u201dSo that was how Yang got the scar on his face.\u201cThe hill had many traps, and many beasts too. If they went and couldn\u2019t rescue him, sacrificing others was not worth the loss! Call it strange, but dad\u2019s life should have ended then.\u201dLiu Duo furrowed her brows. She was very angry.\u201cAfter that, our third uncle went looking for dad anyway. He managed to bring him home, but dad\u2019s chest had been pierced by the wooden stakes in the trap.\u201dHe paused, his voice whimpering, and continued. \u201cIt had been only three days after his death, but my uncles were already egging on my grandmother to distribute the inheritance. Mom was short-tempered from the start and could not handle anger well. After dad died, mom suffered a great blow, yet my grandmother added insult to injury. She got so cranked up that she died soon after.\u201dThat must have been a heart attack! Liu Duo scowled. What kind of family was this? Their eldest son had just died, and then they wanted to separate their inheritance, snuffing out their daughter-in-law too?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhy did you grandmother and your uncles suddenly want to split the inheritance? Are they still human?\u201d Liu Duo asked.Hmm\u2026 Right, why though? They were most definitely not human! Ye Ling could only smile.While they were not paying attention, Ye Liu walked by and leaned on the woodpile next to them, with his arms folded in front of his chest, and answered on Ye Ling\u2019s behalf. \u201cDad died, and Yang was barely grown up, so how much could he hunt? So much for income.\u201dListening to him talk, one would think he was talking about some other family. Liu Duo sighed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I just happened to be more good-looking.\u201dAs for Mo then, he was at school; and Ling was still a kid and had medicine to take, so there went our budget!\u201d Ye Liu said very casually.Both Liu Duo and Ye Ling wondered if Liu could take this seriously.But Liu Duo was surprised. Someone as impulsive and short-tempered as Mo actually used to be a student? Was he any good?\u201cOh, right, and Yang needed a wife, so that was more spending. Therefore that old woman, who couldn\u2019t die, cut us out!\u201dOld woman who couldn\u2019t die! Great use of words, Liu Duo thought in agreement.He stepped over and sat beside her. \u201cWhatever we had, we split.

Dad and Yang went hunting in the hills, and Mo went to school. His grandmother, uncles, and aunts did not take kindly to his mom and Ling. One day, he returned early after working in town and discovered what had happened by accident.They left all the laundry to his mother alone. She had to do every chore by herself and could not even get a full meal. The cousins bullied Ling, and no one bothered.He never knew that his mother and Ling had been suffering when they were not around. His mom would not say, and neither would Ling.Liu became so angry that he roared at his mother, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell Dad or us? Dad and Yang work hard hunting, I\u2019m working too, and all the money we earn we gave this family, but this is how they treat you and Ling? And you tolerated it? You were taken advantage of and didn\u2019t say anything. When Dad comes back, we are leaving this place!\u201dAnd yet his mother, his dear mother, actually said, we are a family, so it does not matter if one contributes more or less. Is splitting what young kids like you talk about? That\u2019s not filial. Grandmother didn\u2019t ask to split, so we shouldn\u2019t simply say things like that. It destroys harmony.When dad and Yang returned, he pulled his dad aside and told him everything. He also said that splitting was for the better, and dad actually repeated what mom said!Thinking about this, Ye Liu kicked the bench beside him, and it flew across the yard, as he cursed, \u201cStupid piety!\u201dThis made Liu Duo and Ye Liu jump in surprise. He had been talking like he usually did. This was the first time they had seen him express sudden anger.\u201cLiu?\u201d Ye Ling called out weakly.Liu Dup gently shook his shoulder, asking silently, what\u2019s the matter?Obviously, Ye Liu was quietly drowning in his own thoughts, remembering the past.When he came to, Ye Liu grinned gently. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.

Give it a few more years and he would be even more attractive.Ye Liu sat beside her and saw her staring at Ling with a sleazy grin on her face, and teased her. \u201cI say, Little Duo, please don\u2019t ogle at Ling like that.

Liu Duo was smiling particularly brightly. He had never ever seen any woman laughing so uncontrollably.But it was especially attractive, not pretentious at all, in fact very natural and poised.

Little Duo, you go to sleep with Ling.\u201d Ye Liu gave Ye Ling a look that asked him to take Liu Duo to bed.\u201cYou must be tired Duo Er. Let\u2019s go to bed.\u201d Ye Ling said softly.Liu Duo also wasn\u2019t argumentative. She nodded and left with Ye Ling to the bedroom without even looking at Ye Mo. They then closed the door.It was one thing for Ye Mo to know he did wrong. He did admit wrong, and she did help him, but Liu Duo did not say whether or not she would ignore him and give him attitude!Ye Mo stayed silent and did not make a sound. He went to the other bedroom. Ye Liu faced the door and reminded, \u201cLittle Duo, remember to wake up early to go to town! Otherwise, I won\u2019t wait for you.\u201d\u201cOkay, I know. Go to sleep. Goodnight.\u201d\u201cGoodnight.\u201dYe Liu returned to the bedroom and saw Ye Mo spacing out while sitting on the side of the bed. He closed the door, went to the side of the bed, and took off his coat, all the while laughing, \u201cTsk, you missed a night. You need to wait for another one or two days! What a pity.\u201d\u201cLittle Duo\u2019s figure is small and petite. Everything that is supposed to be there is there. Moreover, she is soft and fragrant. Hugging her is what you call comfort.\u201dHe knew his own second brother. He was acting strange again. He was not planning on paying attention to him. He minded his own business. He took off his clothes and went to bed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLiu really went on and on. He clearly knew that Mo knew he had done wrong and was regretful, but he still poked at his heart.Of course, he knew Liu Duo\u2019s body was soft and fragrant. He could feel his body get hot when he thought about their bodies getting really close to each other today. Her breasts were soft and bouncy.Ye Liu\u2019s laugh got even more irritating when he saw that Ye Mo did not make a sound. He blew out the oil lamp, laid down on the other side of the bed, and sighed, \u201cAhh, I really miss Little Duo. What should I do if I can\u2019t fall asleep\u2026\u201dYe Mo pulled his own bedsheets and covered his head.

Some felt sorrow, and some felt joy. Liu Duo and Ye Ling were in a happy mood. They chatted for a while, then went into their dreamland.But on Ye Liu and Ye Mo\u2019s side, just as Ye Liu said, they couldn\u2019t fall asleep.The previous night, Ye Liu had hugged Liu Duo while he slept. Although it was torturous, it was much more interesting than hugging a blanket every day and night. Tonight, he could not sleep even though he was hugging a blanket. He thought of Liu Duo\u2019s fragrant body.Ye Mo would find it even harder to fall asleep. He was angry at himself for doing those things that frightened and hurt her. At the same time, he was also thinking of Liu Duo\u2019s fragrant body.They had been bachelors for twenty-something years, so suddenly gaining a wife would definitely make them long for her. It wasn\u2019t their fault. After all, the people who were of the same age as they were already had kids who were running around everywhere.With the thought of going to town later, Liu Duo woke up at about six-thirty. After she got out of bed, she combed her hair and washed up. She then went into the outhouse.Ye Ling saw his two brothers snoring with haggard faces. He asked, puzzled, \u201cLiu, Mo, what happened to you guys? Didn\u2019t sleep well?\u201cNothing. We slept well.\u201d Ye Mo turned his body and went to the side of the well to wash up.Just then, Liu Duo finished her business and came out of the outhouse. Ye Liu saw Liu Duo with his sharp eyes and went over, \u201cLittle Duo, you are so obedient to me and woke up so early. Don\u2019t tell me that you woke up early to see me!\u201d\u201cCan you not be so egotistical? What did you do last night? You have dark circles under both your eyes.\u201d She pushed Ye Liu away and went beside the well to wash her cloth.He also followed her to the well, like a stalker, and just so happened to also wash. \u201cAh, it\u2019s all your fault. Little Duo. You need to take responsibility for me.\u201dShe lifted her head and looked at the gaze from the idiot. She stared at Ye Liu, \u201cWhat do I have to do with it?\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep well because you weren\u2019t beside me. Not sleeping well caused me to have dark circles under my eyes, and that will affect my gentlemanly face.\u201d Ye Liu spoke very enthusiastically, and Liu Duo listened with a frown. What kind of messed up logic was this?She was too lazy to care about the nonsensical Ye Liu. She hung up her cloth and then went to the kitchen to accompany Ye Ling with preparing breakfast.On the dining table, Liu Duo took a bite of rice, then looked at Ye Liu and said, \u201cLiu, are we going to take the ox cart later?\u201d She really didn\u2019t want to walk, as it was too far.Heading to town again? Ye Mo started to frown as he listened. However, he didn\u2019t flip out.\u201cSure. Call me master.\u201d He tore apart a mantou, threw it into his mouth and chewed. He stared at Liu Duo and smiled smugly.\u201cHumph\u2026\u201d she turned her head and ignored him.\u201cAh, I say Little Duo,\u201d he drank a mouthful of white congee to moisten his throat, \u201cYou aren\u2019t even willing to call me master. My heart feels very cold!\u201dShe just minded her own business. After she finished her last bite of rice, she put down her chopsticks. She saw that Ye Liu was still eating and rushed him, \u201cLiu, can speed it up? A big man eating so slowly!\u201dYe Mo and Ye Ling had also finished eating. They were only waiting for Ye Liu.Ye Liu was still calm and composed after hearing that. He held the bowl and drank the last gulp of white congee. Satisfied, he put down the bowl and chopsticks.\u201cLittle Duo, you just don\u2019t understand that being quick is not a good thing for a man. Being quick means being not capable, understand?\u201d He raised his eyebrows while looking at Liu Duo.What kind of twisted logic was this? She did not understand what he said.Liu Duo, Ye Mo, and Ye Ling all curiously looked at Ye Liu. Their eyes were asking him to clarify what he said and tell them what it meant.Hehe. Ye Liu laughed mysteriously. \u201cYou want to know?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAll three of them nodded together.Ye Liu turned his head towards Ye Mo and muttered a few words into his ear. He then turned to Ye Ling\u2019s ears and muttered a few words.Liu Duo looked at the three of them with a stunned expression. What\u2019s with this situation? What did Liu say to them?Ye Liu laughed in a way that made his face look punchable.

What was his intention? The two younger brothers couldn\u2019t even look at her, and Ye Liu, the older brother, smiled in a way that possessed hidden meanings.\u201cSince we\u2019ve finished eating, let\u2019s go.\u201d Liu Duo took the lead and stood up. She walked towards the door to go outside, and Ye Liu ran after her immediately.Ye Ling cleared away the bowls and chopsticks. Ye Mo spaced out for a few seconds, got up, and said, \u201cLing, you stay at home. I also want to go to town to take a look.\u201d\u201cOh okay. Go then. Otherwise, Liu and she would\u2019ve gone far.\u201dYe Mo nodded and then ran out. He saw that Liu Duo and Ye Liu hadn\u2019t gone far. He immediately ran after them.\u201cMo, why did you run after us? You don\u2019t need to miss us. We will be back by the afternoon at the latest.\u201d Ye Liu patted Ye Mo\u2019s shoulder.Who missed you? Ye Mo rolled his eyes. \u201cI also want to go to town.\u201d He said clearly and concisely.\u201cWhat are you going to town for?\u201d Ye Liu felt suspicious. Why did Mo suddenly want to go to town?\u201cNothing really. I just wanted to go.\u201d He looked ahead of him and was unwilling to say more.Liu Duo only glanced at Ye Mo and did not make any sound. She muttered in her heart, You want to monitor me, I bet! First, to make sure that I don\u2019t run away. Second, you are afraid that I might spend money frivolously!They walked towards the Chao Village entrance. Wang Tuozi\u2019s ox cart would be waiting there for the people who wanted to take the ox cart to town.When they arrived at the village entrance, they saw that there were three people sitting on Wang Tuozi\u2019s ox cart.Liu Duo even recognized one of them. It was the person she fought with by the lake.When that person saw Liu Duo, she made a humph sound and ignored her. She turned her head and gave her the cold shoulder.The other two people were polite, and they nodded. None of them spoke, because they weren\u2019t familiar with each other.Wang Tuozi still said aloud, as a token gesture, \u201cThree wens per person. A round trip is six wens.\u201dWhen most villagers went to town, the women would take the ox cart to town, but very few of them would take it going both there and back. Taking it in both directions was too extravagant.Ye Liu took out nine wens from his waist and handed them to Wang Tuozi. Ye Mo said, \u201cDon\u2019t include mine, I will walk there.\u201dHe even glanced at Liu Duo after he spoke. He then walked on the road towards town. He felt a bit unsatisfied in his heart, but he did not say it aloud.Wang Tuozi also didn\u2019t say anything and returned three wens.Liu Duo looked at Ye Mo\u2019s back. \u201cPretending to be cool!\u201dYe Liu did not mind at all. He sat on the side of the ox cart after he paid. He waved his hands, \u201cLittle Duo, come and sit here.\u201d He even wiped it off.Wang Tuozi saw that it was about time. \u201cSit tight, it\u2019s time to leave. Don\u2019t fall!\u201dA leather whip landed on the ox\u2019s butt and the ox cart slowly rolled forward to begin traveling.\u201cWait a moment.\u201d Ye Ling ran over from afar while limping.

You want to go?\u201dWang Tuozi turned his head and looked at Ye Ling.\u201cYing.\u201d Liu Duo was a bit surprised to see Ye Ling, especially seeing that he held a piece of cloth in his hands.He hadn\u2019t run there specifically to give it to her, had he? Liu Duo felt somewhat moved. He really was a considerate man. He remembered it after she had complained to him once.Liu Duo really guessed correctly. \u201cDuo Er, I borrowed a cushion for you. This way, it won\u2019t be as bumpy.\u201dHe gave the cloth to Liu Duo.

Scold me instead, don\u2019t blame Ling.\u201d Liu Duo pulled at Ye Liu.\u201cLiu, don\u2019t blame Duo Er. It was me who wanted to deliver it.

Be careful next time.\u201d\u201cAre you coming or not? You\u2019re wasting our time!\u201d The girl they had encountered by the lake that time couldn\u2019t stand to look at Liu Duo.Ye Ling also knew that it wasn\u2019t good to delay.

She put both her hands together by her mouth and said, \u201cLing, go back. We will come back very soon.\u201d\u201cSit tight and don\u2019t fall.\u201d Ye Liu pulled Liu Duo\u2019s shoulder.The other women on the ox cart gossiped to pass the time. It took a while to get to town.The ox cart\u2019s speed wasn\u2019t fast or slow. After traveling for a while, Liu Duo and the others saw Ye Mo, who was walking in front.\u201cMo, why are you walking so slowly? Look, we\u2019ve already caught up to you.\u201d Ye Liu shouted at Ye Mo.When Ye Mo heard the sound, he turned his head around, looked for a while, then turned back ahead and continued to walk. What nonsense was he talking about? He only had two legs, how could he walk faster than something that had four legs?\u201c\u2026\u201d Liu Duo was speechless. Ye Liu was acting strange again and talking nonsense!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014They arrived at the town and got off the cart. The women all went their own way. When Liu Duo got off the cart, she told Wang Tuozi that she would leave her cushion on his ox cart and that he could sit on it if he wanted to. She would get on his ox cart after she returned.Before Ye Liu and Liu Duo went too far, they heard Ye Mo\u2019s voice. \u201cLiu, wait up.\u201dThe two of them turned around and looked at Ye Mo, who ran closer to them. \u201cMo, go run your own errands in town. What did you call us for?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything. I\u2019m just here to walk around with you guys.\u201dShe knew what Ye Mo was planning to do.

They looked like they were bodyguards. This was the second time she had come to town, and she didn\u2019t possess the wondrous zeal she\u2019d had last time.The lively town was filled with continuous shouting of all kinds.They arrived at the tailor shop that Liu Duo noticed the previous time she. Liu Duo walked in.Ye Mo thought that Liu Duo wanted to buy clothes. He frowned so heavily that it could kill a mosquito.He coughed, like a westerner, and pulled Ye Liu, who was next to him. He slowed down his pace and said softly, \u201cLiu, how much money did you bring?\u201dHe knew what Ye Mo meant. Ye Liu smiled, \u201cEnough money to take the ox cart.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t a lot. Ye Mo nodded and felt at ease.The female shop assistant immediately smiled when she saw that there were customers. \u201cWhat does this customer need?\u201dLiu Duo shook her head. She wanted to look through this tailor shop carefully. She had only glanced at the exterior the last time.The size of the tailor shop was not small. There were two floors. The bottom floor sold clothing materials and finished clothing for common people. The top floor probably sold things that only those with money could afford.She lifted her legs and prepared to go upstairs. The shop assistant immediately stopped her. \u201cThe things in the top floor are more expensive.\u201dLiu Duo looked at the female shop assistant who blocked the stairs and frowned. \u201cSo what?

Why go up to browse if you are not going to buy anything?\u201d The female shop assistant became more smug once she heard someone else helping her.She turned around to face Ye Mo and stared at him. \u201cIt is your fault anyway that I can\u2019t afford it! You are still a man but you don\u2019t even have money to afford to let your own women buy the things she wants.\u201dThis brat is talking down to me? You are still wet behind the ears! This makes me so mad. Liu Duo\u2019s heart was going crazy!Ye Mo lowered his head to look at Liu Duo\u2019s angry face and was at a loss for words. It was true, she was his women, and he didn\u2019t have the ability to give her money to let her buy the things she wanted. He even spoke that way when she wanted to go take a look.Ye Liu pulled Liu Duo. \u201cLet\u2019s go Little Duo. Liu will bring you up to look.\u201dHe then smiled at the female shop assistant. \u201cBeautiful, this is where you are wrong. If we don\u2019t go up to look, how would we know if we fancy something? If we see something we fancy and the price is right, then we will buy it. If we don\u2019t see anything we fancy, then we will definitely not buy anything! Correct, no?\u201dThe female shop assistant saw that Ye Liu gave her a warm smile. She nodded very shyly. \u201cYes, yes, yes.\u201d\u201cIn that case, excuse me, beautiful.\u201d He led Liu Duo upstairs.F**k. Liu Duo couldn\u2019t stay calm and collected. This brat wants to use his male sex appeal? He thought that I couldn\u2019t get upstairs by myself?While walking on the stairs, Liu Duo threw Ye Liu\u2019s hand away. \u201cOh you are so capable, and your mouth is oh so very sweet. You can call someone beautiful so readily!\u201d\u201cSweet? Do you want to kiss it and try?\u201d He lowered his head and moved closer to Liu Duo.\u201cShameless!\u201d She pushed away Ye Liu and quickly got up to the second floor.Ye Liu ran after her while laughing. However, Ye Mo still stood where he had stood previously and did not follow them up. He looked at the stairs for a while, then turned around to walk out the store. He stood by the side and waited for them.He stared at the pedestrians who were coming and going. Ye Mo\u2019s heart was a mess. Why did he cause Liu Duo to become angry again? It was one thing for him to not have money for clothes, but why did he say it that way when she only wanted to browse.The clothing materials and finished clothing on the second floor were incomparable to the ones on the first floor. The things on the first floor were just normal single-colored sackcloths and cotton cloths. The items on the second floor were all brocade fabric, silk fabric and so on. The workmanship was also good.While looking, Liu Duo couldn\u2019t help but touch it with her hands. It was very soft. It would definitely be very comfortable when worn.Ye Lu saw that Liu Duo liked it very much. However, the reality of the current situation was that he didn\u2019t have any money to give her to purchase it. He was determined to buy it for her once he saved enough money.\u201cAre the two of you looking for clothing materials or finished clothing?\u201d A woman came and asked with a smile.They looked at the woman who spoke. She was about forty years old, but she was still attractive. There were some parts of her that looked quite good. Moreover, she was dressed much better than the female shop assistant. She was probably important. She hadn\u2019t acted elitist, and this made Liu Duo feel satisfied.\u201cSorry, we are not here to buy anything. I am here to discuss a partnership.\u201d Liu Duo was also smiling. When other people\u2019s attitudes were good, her attitude would naturally also be good.\u201cDiscuss a partnership?\u201d The woman felt uncertain.She sized up Liu Duo, and Liu Duo generously allowed her to look carefully.The woman saw that although her manner of dressing looked poor, the confidence brimming on her face could not be ignored.

She probably wasn\u2019t here to make trouble.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThen what kind of partnership do you want to discuss with my store?\u201d The woman was very curious.Ye Liu was also very curious, as he also very much wanted to know.

It might have just been an accountant\u2019s office. There was a table, several stools, and a writing desk.They were told to sit anywhere they pleased, and then she placed the paper, ink, and brush on the table in front of Liu Duo, motioning her to use them.Liu Duo picked up the brush and doodled on the paper, just to try her hand. She had never drawn using a brush before.Then, on the paper, she drew a cartoonish pig. It was fat, with adorable eyes. Because it was not painted with what should be a tender shade of pink, it lacked a certain appeal, but otherwise Liu Duo was quite satisfied with how it turned out.\u201cWhat do you think? The pig\u2019s cute, right? We make it this big,\u201d she gestured the size with her fingers, \u201cI can guarantee that those rich ladies would love it very much.\u201d Liu Duo said, looking quite pleased with the expression on the woman\u2019s face.Pigs in their eyes were always depicted as fat and ugly with humongous ears. Liu Duo\u2019s drawing though was cute beyond measure. The woman loved it at first sight, even Ye Liu was surprised.This was one of Liu Duo\u2019s interests. She did not like it before, but there was one year in her previous life when she was admitted to the hospital due to severe illness. She met a little girl there who suffered from similar conditions.The girl loved drawing these, and slowly, Liu Duo was roped in. It was boring in the ward, so they would draw in their sketchbooks and share their work between themselves, competing for who had the cuter or better drawing.\u201cWhat do you think? Do you want to collaborate?\u201d Liu Duo took another clean, white piece of paper and covered up her pig.The woman was not angry at Liu Duo\u2019s actions. She just felt she had not seen enough.She sat on the other side and spoke calmly, \u201cPlease, how should I address you?\u201dLiu Duo was quite content with the woman\u2019s attitude. She was neither needlessly rejoiceful nor fanatical, but she was able to calm down and ask for her name.\u201cMy surname is Ye-Liu, my name is Liu Duo. You can call me Little Duo,\u201d she smiled, \u201cThis is my husband, Ye Liu; the idiot downstairs as well; and there are two more at home.\u201dYe Liu was unusually happy with Liu Duo\u2019s introductions. Usually she would not willingly call him that, but right now she did not mind telling others she was a shared wife! She had truly integrated into the family.Ye Liu smiled as though he was bathing in spring. He could not help but hold her hand, slightly trembling \u2013 proof that he was quite excited.The woman was surprised when she heard this. Liu Duo was a shared wife, and she spoke of it out in the open too? Shouldn\u2019t this be something unspeakable? And based on her appearance and the way she carried herself, she did not seem like one at all.Liu Duo spoke nothing of the look of disbelief on the woman\u2019s face. She couldn\u2019t care less what others thought of her. She was a shared wife. So what?\u201cSo, I wonder how should I call you?\u201d Liu Duo ought to know the other person\u2019s name too.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI\u2019m Qin Fang, but you can call me Miss Fang.\u201d The woman had seen the world too.

Even if it were available in the shop, it would still incur some costs.\u201cLittle Duo, what do you think about a thirty-seventy split?\u201d\u201cOh, thirty-seventy?\u201d Liu Duo and Ye Liu looked at each other. His eyes told her he would go with whatever she decided.Liu Duo smiled in reply as she lowered her head and played with his long fingers, \u201cMiss Fang, I believe you aren\u2019t as sincere as you think!\u201d\u201cTrue, all I did was draw a sample, so it seems like you call the shots, but without my samples, what would you be making?\u201dShe looked up and stared at Qin Fang as she spoke in a serious tone, \u201cIn any kind of business, don\u2019t ideas always come first, and actions come later?\u201dSeeing the look of seriousness on Liu Duo\u2019s face, Qin Fang knew Liu Duo was not someone to be fooled. She forced a laugh, \u201cTake it easy, Little Duo. Of course I\u2019m willing to work with you, so may I ask what you have in mind then?\u201d\u201cTwenty-eighty. I take eighty, you can have twenty.\u201dYe Liu thought Liu Duo would suggest a fifty-fifty split, but what came out of her mouth surprised him. After all, Qin Fang was certainly the one calling the shots.Would the negotiation fail? Ye Liu was quite worried. Liu Duo gave his hand a reassuring pat.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Qin Fang furrowed her brows. Twenty-eighty would put her at a great disadvantage.Liu Duo did not rush. She said slowly, \u201cMiss Fang, think about it. This pig I drew, have you seen anyone draw something like it? I think I\u2019m the only one who can do so in the entire kingdom.\u201d\u201cThis little pig is just one of many emotions. The whole package would include happiness, anger, sadness, joy, and resentment. It can all be done on this pig.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll be the only shop who sells it. When the large amount of revenue comes in, will you still think getting twenty is too little? If you feel that way, then I\u2019ll find another partner. Good things are worth the wait.\u201dShe stood up, took Ye Liu by the hand, and was about to leave.\u201cWait,\u201d Qin Fang, who had been indecisive, heard what Liu Duo said and was suddenly enlightened. She had not given it enough thought.Liu Duo turned around, \u201cIs there anything else? We have other places to go.\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019re joking, aren\u2019t you, Little Duo?\u201d Qin Fang quickly pulled her back passionately and offered her a seat.\u201cLet\u2019s have it at twenty-eighty then! Little Duo, if you don\u2019t mind, can you draw the other pigs with different emotions? I want to make the arrangements immediately.\u201dQin Fang really wanted to see what the other emotions looked like.Liu Duo laughed in her seat, \u201cDon\u2019t rush, we can sign the contract first.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t a fool. If she had drawn them out, she would not have any tricks left, and where would she go then?\u201cYou\u2019re right, that\u2019s my bad,\u201d Qin Fang picked up the brush and began writing two copies of the same document.She finished with her signature and her stamp, along with the stamp of the tailor shop, before handling it to Liu Duo.All shops in the kingdom had their own special seals that came with legal benefits.She read the contract and was about to sign when Ye Liu stopped her, \u201cWait, Little Duo, I\u2019ll call up dear Mo to take a look.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe couldn\u2019t read, and he thought Liu Duo couldn\u2019t read too, so both of them wouldn\u2019t know if the contract was legitimate, so best to call Ye Mo for confirmation.\u201cEr\u2026\u2026\u201d she looked at him. She wanted to say she could read, but that was not possible, because they both knew the original Ye Duo was illiterate.Qin Fang nodded with a smile, \u201cGo ahead, find someone literate to help.\u201dLiu Duo watched Ye Liu go, feeling rather helpless. It seemed she would have to find an opportunity to pretend to learn how to read, otherwise it would be too bothersome.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He went to pat him on the shoulder.\u201cMo, come upstairs with me.\u201dLiu Duo had not come down, yet he was invited to go up. Ye Mo got more annoyed than ever. \u201cWhy should I go up? I don\u2019t have the money to buy new clothes for her.\u201d\u201cNot that. She knows we don\u2019t have money. There\u2019s some business to take care of. Come on. Don\u2019t let them wait too long,\u201d Ye Liu said as he pushed his brother along.In the room on the second floor, Liu Duo had been telling Qin Fang, \u201cWhen summer comes, we can draw cute pictures on the fans. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be mountains and rivers. They\u2019re boring.\u201d\u201cBy then, leave all the drawing to me. I will provide fresh new drawings every two weeks or every month, so that customers will visit us often.\u201d\u201cAlright. It looks like cooperation with you would bring good business into the shop, and maybe we\u2019d even become famous!\u201d Just dreaming about it had Qin Fang grinning from ear to ear.On the second floor, Ye Liu led Ye Mo directly into the room and sat him down.He brought over the contract, made and signed by Qin Fang, for Ye Mo to take a look.Ye Mo looked at the contract, disbelief spread across his face as he stared at Liu Duo. How could she\u2026\u2026\u201cWhat? Is there a problem? If not, let me sign it,\u201d Liu Duo, still angry at him, was not taking him kindly.\u201cMo, is everything alright?\u201d Ye Liu slightly pushed him.Qin Fang was not rushing, merely looking on at them with a smile. Little Duo seemed to have some discontentment with this husband, yet she had taken a liking to Ye Liu.This one that came after had bruises on his face. Could he, like concubines in a rich family, have been fighting for favours?Liu Duo stretched a hand out to take the contract Ye Mo was holding, but he refused to give it to her and said coolly, \u201cEven if there are no problems, why should I give it to you? Do you even know how to sign your name?\u201dHe was surprised. She was not here to buy clothes, but to discuss business, and had struck a twenty-eighty deal.\u201cOf course I\u2026\u201d The words hung on her tongue. She did not want them to suspect. Illiterate people should not know how to write either.She got so mad that there was nothing she could say. She huffed her cheeks and glared at Ye Mo.Ye Mo saw Liu Duo\u2019s reactions and felt that he had won for once. \u201cTrue, there are no problems, but nothing is mentioned about the price, how do we calculate the dividends then?\u201dTrue indeed. If not written clearly, the shop could sell one for fifty wen, yet charge them twenty wen, and after the twenty-eighty split, wouldn\u2019t they lose out?Right, why didn\u2019t she think of this! She looked Ye Mo in the eye and couldn\u2019t believe that this psychopathic maniac actually had some brains!Qin Fang was surprised to hear that too. She had truly forgotten to list the price. \u201cA mistake on my part, Little Duo. How much do you think we can sell these for?\u201dLiu Duo pursed her lips and thought, \u201cLet\u2019s do it this way, Miss Fang. We don\u2019t have to list the price yet. After we complete the products, we can decide then. I believe Miss Fang would not go back on her word. Otherwise, I\u2019ll only lose out once.\u201d\u201cOf course. Since Little Duo trusts me so much, I won\u2019t back out on her,\u201d Qin Fang said frankly. Businesses want to maintain long-term profits. She was not an idiot.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAlright, time to sign,\u201d she went to pick up the brush.Suddenly Ye Mo grabbed her hand and wrapped it around his, holding the brush, \u201cHere, I\u2019ll teach you how to write your name and take your fingermark.\u201dLiu Duo\u2019s hand shook, oh dear.

I\u2019ll get the drawings ready in a few days and get back to you. I say, Miss Fang, you should be able to make them, can\u2019t you?\u201d She asked as she kept her contract.Not long after, they would have income, and Yang would not have to go hunting anymore. Just thinking about it made her so happy.Qin Fang also smiled, \u201cRest assured, Little Duo, I can certainly guarantee you\u2019ll be satisfied with the final product.\u201d\u201cRight. Do remember, just make ten for every picture, as a warm-up.\u201d\u201cI know that.\u201d With that, they left the room.Qin Fang walked behind them and found that they were not wearing good clothes. She could even see the patches, so she said, \u201cLittle Duo, don\u2019t go just yet. Choose any clothes or cloth from our collection and I\u2019ll let you have them.\u201dLiu Duo stopped in her tracks and looked over at Qin Fang, \u201cThat\u2019s not right, is it? We don\u2019t have the money.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need the money. I\u2019ve said I\u2019d let you have them. Take it as a token of gratitude for working with us.\u201dSince she offered, Liu Duo didn\u2019t argue. It wouldn\u2019t be sincere.Joyfully she went to pick something out, while Ye Liu and Ye Mo just looked at her.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ahead?\u201d Qin Fang asked the other two.Ye Liu did not take his eyes off Liu Duo as he replied, \u201cWe\u2019ll just let her choose. She\u2019s the one working with you, not us, so we don\u2019t have to.\u201dThey could not bare to take more advantage than they could afford. They would shop with their own money in exchange for peace of mind.Qin Fang was pleased. They were poor, but they had ambitions. Liu Duo must have seen their righteousness. That was why she did not feel disgraced being with them.Liu Duo spotted a light blue garment, made of brocade, that came in a simple style \u2013 not complicated, like the others she did not like. Satin was too expensive, and she did not want to take advantage of others too much.She saw the men just standing there and knew what they were thinking. When they had money, she would buy more for them.She took the garment and compared the size, \u201cLiu, come look at this. Is it nice?\u201d\u201cLooks great. You look beautiful, so whatever you wear makes you even more so,\u201d Ye Liu nodded.Oh dear, what a talker! She smiled sweetly. Who didn\u2019t like compliments from their husband?Ye Mo said nothing. She did not ask him, and he did not like that! He put on a long face.\u201cTry it on. The fitting room is over here,\u201d Qin Fang brought Liu Duo to the fitting room.She changed into the new garment and walked out excitedly. She spun once in front of Ye Liu, \u201cLiu, what do you think?\u201dNice, very nice.\u201d He smiled and nodded. She was smiling like a kid, but she looked really nice in the outfit.Clothes make the man, after all. Now Liu Duo looked like a different person, like a rich man\u2019s daughter. Not very striking, but quite sophisticated.\u201cPffft, that\u2019s all you have? Looks average,\u201d Ye Mo had to rain on her party.He was mad that she did not ask him, as though he was invisible!Liu Duo came to confront him, \u201cWhatever, so I\u2019m average. I\u2019m not wearing it for you. I\u2019m not asking for your opinion. You\u2019re being amorous!\u201dThen she turned and held onto Ye Liu as she spoke to Qin Fang, \u201cThank you, Miss Fang, for the clothes. We\u2019ll be going now. See you in a few days.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSure, come again,\u201d Qin Fang nodded.Ye Mo glared at Liu Duo. He was furious, but he refused to show it. His chest huffed and puffed as he walked behind them.Qin Fang laughed at the sight before her, \u201cNo wonder Little Duo did not fancy him.

She can\u2019t employ just anyone to work here. She has to avoid offending potential customers!\u201dShe had nearly forgotten. This shop assistant was undependable and too snobbish.As the shop assistant saw them off, she could feel her eye twitching, like she might have bad luck soon.\u201cLiu, let\u2019s go home. We got what we came here for.\u201d It seemed to be almost noon.\u201cLittle Duo, you and Mo can go first, maybe to Uncle Wang\u2019s (Wang Tuozi\u2019s) ox-cart, or anywhere else to shop around. I\u2019m going to the alley to see if there\u2019s any work I can do. Then I\u2019ll come back to get you.\u201d With that, Liu passed his money bag to Liu Duo.Men gathered at the alley looking for work, so bringing Liu Duo there was inconvenient.\u201cLiu, you don\u2019t have to look for odd jobs now. When Miss Fang makes and sells her products, we\u2019ll have income.\u201dHe patted her on the head, \u201cThat\u2019s different. That\u2019s your money, Little Duo. I am young and strong, so it\u2019s a pity if I don\u2019t work in my prime. Go on. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d She did not oppose Ye Liu\u2019s persistence. After all a man\u2019s dignity must not be crushed.\u201cAh, Little Duo, would you miss me even for a while? Don\u2019t rush, I\u2019ll be back very soon, and I\u2019ll stay with you tonight, alright?\u201d He winked at her.What conduct! It was his intention to go without her. She rolled her eyes and turned around. Fine then. She wasn\u2019t going. He could have said so from the get-go. It wasn\u2019t like she cared. Geez\u2026Ye Liu watched her leave, throwing a little tantrum, and smiled. \u201cMo, keep her company, and don\u2019t lose her. She\u2019s not familiar with the streets. And don\u2019t anger her again. You hear me!\u201dHe nodded in agreement and caught up with her.After a short distance, Liu Duo looked down and checked the money bag. There was about thirty wen in there. Quite a handsome amount.Is this my allowance? She thought happily, no longer upset.Ye Mo followed beside her and watched her actions. Unknowingly, he said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have money left at home, and Ling needs to buy his medicine.\u201dShe tightened the money bag and placed it around her waist. Darn, how could she have forgotten the killjoy!She eyed him once and ignored him, and she continued with her shopping. She was just checking how much money they had, not that she planned on buying anything. Why did he have to be so defensive and remind her!Don\u2019t want me to spend? Then I will! Determined, she got serious as she explored the shops.Ye Mo realised she was ignoring him. What did he do? He didn\u2019t even say anything!The fool was rather stubborn. He walked behind her, wondering what he had done wrong.In one stall, there were all sorts of hairpins carved from wood. This attracted Liu Duo, as she stopped in her tracks to look at them.She picked one up to take a good look. The ones that Liu and his brothers wore to tie their hair were made of twineRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMiss, you can buy one if you like.

He saw her dressed in brocade and guessed that she must be rich.The vendor was a young man and was quite good-looking, with black hair tied halfway with a wooden hairpin. It certainly looked better than the way Liu and the rest of them tied their hair.The hairpins also came in different lengths. A longer one should be able to tie everything up.Ye Mo saw Liu Duo gazing at the young vendor. Rage ensued!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Who made it a rule that I can\u2019t look at other men? Does looking mean that I am not following the standards of being a wife?\u201d\u201cThere are so many women on this busy street.

So fierce.\u201d\u201cShe is indeed a bit fierce, but what she said also isn\u2019t wrong.\u201d\u2026The sounds from the crowd went into Liu Duo\u2019s ear. She was initially already very angry, but now people were babbling in front of her. That made her even more annoyed.\u201cWhat are you guys looking at? Always gossiping. How annoying. You guys will make less money if you guys keep bothering about things that don\u2019t concern you! Whether I am fierce or not, what the hell does it have anything to do with any of you?\u201d She glared at the crowd, placed the hairpin down, and walked away.Liu Duo\u2019s stomach was full of fire. Why did she have to meet her nemesis who specialized in making her angry!She was the one who did wrong but she directed her anger at me? Completely unreasonable. Ye Mo frowned and then followed Liu Duo.Liu Duo, who was walking in front, realized Ye Mo kept following her. She turned around and unleashed her anger, \u201cDon\u2019t follow me. We will walk on our own. I get annoyed just by looking at you!\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s following you? I am going in this direction! I am walking at the back, so how did you see me?

Don\u2019t speak if you stutter. Embarrassing!\u201d He swung his head and didn\u2019t look at Liu Duo.His mood now was especially good. The corner of his mouth tilted up.He returned had what Liu Duo said to him this morning back to her. That smug expression pierced and hurt her eyes!She turned around furiously and clenched her teeth. Liu Duo had rage in her heart. Detestable. Don\u2019t think that I will say another word to you!The angrier Liu Duo got, the faster she walked. She got faster, and faster. Finally, she started running. She wanted to leave Ye Mo behind and stop him from following her.Unfortunately, Liu Duo\u2019s short legs were no competition at all for Ye Mo, who was 1.8 meters tall.No matter how she ran, Ye Mo would always be three or four meters away from her.Liu Duo got tired and stopped running while she panted. She turned around and saw Ye Mo. He was neither red in the face nor panting.Feeling pleased with himself, Ye Mo raised his eyebrows. He didn\u2019t speak, and he didn\u2019t move forward.Detestable. Liu Duo felt that she was about to explode from anger, but she also felt she was at her wit\u2019s end.In front of her, not far away, sweet foods were being sold. Liu Duo smelled the smell and walked over. She didn\u2019t worry about Ye Mo anymore. If he wanted to follow her, then that was his business. She was the only one who was angry anyway.There were many kinds of sweet snacks at the candy shop. The shapes were also small and exquisite. She got an appetite just by looking at them. There was even brown sugar and white sugar. Liu Duo became happy.It just so happened that Aunt Flo hadn\u2019t left. She could buy some brown sugar and brew some brown sugar water to drink in order to renourish her blood.\u201cHow much for the brown sugar?\u201d She asked the shop assistant.Seeing that there was business, the shop assistant was filled with smiles. \u201cIt isn\u2019t expensive.

Buying sweets had already become a luxury now.Just wait longer. It will get better! Liu Duo encouraged herself.Liu Duo walked around the entire street and didn\u2019t buy anything. She then went back, following the same street. She prepared to return to Wang Tuozi\u2019s ox cart to wait for Ye Liu so that they could go home together.When she turned around, she didn\u2019t even give Ye Mo a glance. This went beyond just ignoring him. Ye Mo still followed Liu Duo like her shadow.After walking for a while, she could see Wang Tuozi\u2019s ox cart far off in the distance.

Ye Liu hasn\u2019t arrived yet.\u201d She said politely to Wang Tuozi.Wang Tuozi smoked a puff of tobacco and nodded. He saw that Liu Duo changed into new clothes. It was even made of brocade. He couldn\u2019t help but look a few more times.He thought, This brother from the Ye family is quite willing to spend money on this shared wife. He bought both polished rice and brocade clothes.Wang Tuozi saw Ye Mo and waved his hands at him. In response, Ye Mo walked over and also sat on the rock.\u201cThird brother of the Ye family, where is your second brother? Why aren\u2019t you together?\u201d\u201cHe went to the port. He will come here soon.\u201d He answered truthfully.He nodded. \u201cThat little wife of yours is quite good at spending money. You guys indeed need to work a bit harder. Although doting on the wife is a good thing, don\u2019t go overboard. Doesn\u2019t Ling still need to take medicine every month?\u201dHe knew what Wang Tuozi meant. Wang Tuozi thought that the clothes on Liu Duo\u2019s body cost quite a bit. However, he was not allowed to tell Wang Tuozi. After all, that matter couldn\u2019t be announced right now.He only nodded his head and said okay. Moreover, she had gained it by herself, and it didn\u2019t have anything to do with them.It was getting late, and one after another, the villagers who had come to town to conduct business or buy things were starting to go back to the village.Ye Liu still hadn\u2019t come after a while. Liu Duo was a bit anxious.\u201cWhat is he doing that he hasn\u2019t come back?\u201d Liu Duo got off the ox cart and walked forward. She then stopped and then paced back and forth.The people who were taking the ox cart home had already pressed Wang Tuozi quite a few times.\u201cUncle Wang, are you going or not? My family is waiting for me to go back to have lunch!\u201d\u201cYeah. We\u2019ve waited for so long.\u201d\u2026Liu Duo took the cushion in her hands. \u201cSorry, Uncle Wang. You drive your ox.

We will be going.\u201d Wang Tuozi drove the ox cart away.After all, he couldn\u2019t waste the other passengers\u2019 time for one passenger.Liu Duo paced back and forth. She looked ahead and wanted to go to the port to take a look, but she was afraid that she might miss Ye Liu.Ye Mo walked over and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be anxious. Liu was probably delayed by something. Let\u2019s keep waiting.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Didn\u2019t he just go to look whether there was any temporary work? Why would there be anything that would hold him up?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAnother ten minutes passed and Ye Liu still hadn\u2019t returned. Liu Duo\u2019s brows firmed up. What exactly was he doing?She walked towards the street and randomly asked a few people how to get to the port. She then walked in that direction. Ye Mo followed closely behind.Although Ye Mo said he knew where the port was, Liu Duo didn\u2019t ask him. Instead, she went and asked passersby. He felt a bit unhappy in his heart but didn\u2019t mind too much. After all, finding Liu was more important!He still knew what to prioritize. Liu had never misspoken before.

Her heart felt uneasy, feeling that something was about to happen.The closer they got to the port, the fewer women there were on the street. When they got to the port, almost all of the people were men. No wonder Liu didn\u2019t want her to follow him. The way people from the ancient times thought was really\u2026She shook her head and then continued to walk forward. Ye Mo went beside Liu Duo, and they walked side by side.There were many men there. He had to be careful if men with bad intentions got close to Liu Duo.There were a lot of people gathered at the front, as if something had happened. Liu Duo felt, through her sixth sense, that Ye Liu was over there. She went over quickly, but she was unable to push her way through.She patted someone\u2019s shoulder and asked, \u201cBrother, may I ask, what happened here?\u201d\u201cYo, where did this little lady come from? To actually come to this port.\u201d The man turned his head and saw that she was a young girl, so he spoke in a lighthearted tone.\u201cBrother, may I ask what happened?\u201d Liu Duo asked again patiently.He saw that Liu Duo was not embarrassed at all, and on the contrary, she asked again politely. The man replied, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just that Burly Du and Pretty Liu are fighting. It is very common.\u201d\u201cPretty Liu? Who\u2019s that?\u201d Liu Duo tried to guess. It couldn\u2019t be Liu, right?Ye Liu was even prettier than women. Of the four brothers, his attractiveness index was the highest.\u201cIt is Ye Liu. We, the people here, all call him that. It\u2019s his fault for having a woman\u2019s face.\u201dRowdy jeering would come from the crowd from time to time. \u201cFight! Fight! Don\u2019t hold back\u2026\u201dIt really was Ye Liu who fought. Liu Duo\u2019s heart jumped. Ye Mo also hurried over. He needed to go to help Liu fight.He pulled Liu Duo over to the side. \u201cYou wait here. I will push my way through to take a look.\u201dHe turned around and went forward. He was able to quickly push himself in. Liu Duo felt puzzled. Why couldn\u2019t she push herself in? Was it because she was a woman, so she didn\u2019t have enough strength?Ye Mo pushed through and saw the scene. It was different from what he imagined. He thought that Liu would definitely be the one getting hit. After all, that person said that Liu was fighting with Burly Du.One would know that Burly Du was definitely strong just from hearing his name. And although Liu was tall, he was thin. That kind of figure was not much of a match.But he saw that Liu was the one who kept hitting Burly Du.Burly Du covered his head, snuck away like a rat, and immediately said, \u201cI was wrong. Stop hitting. I won\u2019t ever dare to do it again. It hurts\u2026\u201dThe men who surrounded to watch immediately laughed. \u201cHaha, Burly Du, let\u2019s see if you dare to tease Pretty Liu again!\u201d\u201cHit him, Pretty Liu.

What was this situation? Burly Du had teased Liu?Liu Duo stared at the backs of a group of men. From time to time she would hear, \u201cFight! Hit him with all your strength,\u201d and her heart would jump. She had already twisted the cushion in her hands into a different shape.Could it be that Ye Mo joined and was also hit? Liu Duo could not stay calm anymore. She needed to go in to take a look, but she couldn\u2019t push through. What should she do? She was extremely worried.Liu Duo kept pacing back and forth outside the crowd of people, who were standing in a circle.Liu Duo suddenly shrieked loudly, \u201cWhose pants fell off?\u201dThis was the highest frequency sound Liu Duo had ever made. She even gave herself a shock. Could it be that she had the potential to become a singer?The men, who stood in the circle and watched, lowered their heads one after the other to look at their own pants.

They had also heard the vigorous sound Liu Duo had just made. They really didn\u2019t know what to say. She could even say such words aloud. All the people there were middle-aged men!These people did not have enough. The language they used was disrespectful to Liu Duo. Ye Mo and Ye Liu\u2019s expressions were very not good.\u201cDidn\u2019t I ask you to wait there? Why did you push in?\u201d Ye Mo rebuked her for not listening to him. These uncouth men were laughing at her.Liu Duo treated those men like air. She did not care at all. Her anxious heart relaxed when she saw Ye Liu did not have a single scratch on him.\u201cLittle Duo, let\u2019s go back first.\u201d Ye Liu held Liu Duo\u2019s hand and wanted to take her away from that place before speaking.The men were like wolves and tigers. No women had come to this port before.Most of the men there were bachelors. They usually wouldn\u2019t behave so flippantly, but how could their natural instincts not come out when they gathered together?She threw Ye Liu\u2019s hand. \u201cOkay. You are the best. Give me a good explanation. Otherwise, humph\u2026\u201dThis was really not a place to speak. The people in the group were also chatting continuously. Annoying!She turned around and wanted to leave. Burly Du immediately ran over to show his existence. \u201cWait, are you Liu Er\u2019s shared wife?\u201dLiu Er? Liu Duo blushed with shame. Did this man need to be so disgusting! Using such an intimate name.Ye Mo couldn\u2019t help but throw up when he heard this. This man called Liu as Liu Er? Even his parents didn\u2019t call him that when they were still alive.Ye Liu felt depressed. Why did this Burly Du have to have such bad memory? \u201cBurly Du, I already told you that you are not allowed to call me that!\u201d\u201cWhy Liu Er? I like to address you that way.\u201d Burly Duo looked like he had been wronged.\u201cYou are still using it!\u201d He was so angry that he gave Burly Du another punch.The men who surrounded to watch saw that they were about to fight again and immediately cheered. Liu Duo looked at the man called Burly Du. His height was about the same as Ye Liu\u2019s. However, his physique was very robust. He was like those muscular men in gyms. No wonder he was called Burly Du.However, Liu Duo hated men with this type of physique the most. They were too robust and did not look good at all. On the other hand, she liked sturdy physiques like Yang\u2019s, where the muscles weren\u2019t too eye-catching. Moderation was the most perfect.\u201cYou are Burly Du, right? I am his shared wife. What\u2019s there to it?\u201d Liu Duo turned around and looked up to stare at him.No expression could be seen on her face. She just stared at him.Burly Du saw that Liu Duo was just staring straight at him, and his heart felt a bit flustered. He felt that he couldn\u2019t afford to offend her. He braced himself and said, \u201cNo, there\u2019s nothing to it. I just wanted to see what you look like and whether or not you were able to match up to Liu Er\u201dAh. Who invited this joker? Was it his business whether or not she matched up to him?\u201cNow that you\u2019ve seen what I look like, do you think that I am able to match up to him?\u201d Liu Duo walked forward with a smile and asked with a good disposition.Burly Du saw Liu Duo standing in front of him. She wasn\u2019t very tall, just 1.65 meters. She was thin and her skin was white. She had long shapely eyebrows and big eyes. Her nose was small and straight, and she had a delicate, ruby-lipped mouth. Her facial features were delicate and pretty. There was a small, red beauty mark that was somewhat pleasant, and there were two dimples at the side of her mouth that looked a bit charming.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBurly Du thought in his heart, This little lady\u2019s appearance is quite attractive.

Before he finished, Liu Duo interrupted him.\u201cWhat you think doesn\u2019t mean squat. Who do you think you are? Does it have anything thing to do with you whether or not I match up to him?

However, since he had peeped at her man, in her eyes, he was extremely ugly.Liu Duo had said all her little thoughts aloud and so directly. Burly Du was red in the face, and he did not dare to look at Ye Liu. His face looked very shy.\u201cLittle Duo, I am definitely not homosexual. You can see that clearly!\u201d Ye Liu said immediately, afraid that Liu Duo might misunderstand.Liu Duo rolled her eyes. He was always taking advantage of her. How would she not know his sexual orientation?The men who surrounded to watch whistled. \u201cOh wow. This little lady is so spicy.\u201d\u201cYeah. That small mouth is quite nimble. Wonder if it bites people?\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026 Ye Liu. Boy, you better be careful tonight!\u201d\u2026Liu Duo didn\u2019t feel anything when she heard the filthy speeches. She only found it to be noisy and that they were annoying to listen to! Ye Liu and Ye Mo, on the other hand, were black in the face and looked like they were about to make a move.Ye Mo squeezed his fist, and just as he got ready to beat up the man nearest to him, he heard Liu Duo\u2019s voice.\u201cHey, I say, why are a group of middle-aged men just as loquacious as women? Whether I\u2019m spicy or not, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to live with you, right? Whether I bite or not, it\u2019s not like like I\u2019m going to sleep with you, right?\u201d\u201cGo do what you are supposed to do. Each one of you, go back to your own homes, and each one of you, go find your own mothers. What nonsense!\u201dShe turned around and walked toward where she had initially come from. Ye Mo and Ye Liu followed immediately.Burly Du and the group of men were stunned. Was this little lady really a girl? Wasn\u2019t she a bit too dauntless? She didn\u2019t have any of the shyness a girl should have at all!Wang Tuozi\u2019s ox cart had already left, so they could only walk back.Liu Duo\u2019s face didn\u2019t look happy or sad while she walked on the road. Her face was expressionless. Ten minutes had passed since they had left the port, and she hadn\u2019t said a single word.Liu Duo didn\u2019t pay Ye Mo any attention when he spoke. Liu Duo also didn\u2019t pay attention to Ye Liu when he spoke. She treated the two of them as air.Ye Mo pulled Ye Liu over while looking at Liu Duo, who was walking at the front. \u201cLiu, what exactly happened between you and that Burly Du. Why was there a fight? You made us wait for so long.\u201d\u201cNothing happened. I bumped into him when I went to the port to see if there was any suitable, temporary work.\u201dYe Liu felt furious and awkward when Burly Du was mentioned. \u201cAh, don\u2019t mention him. Anyway, if I don\u2019t hit him, he won\u2019t remember.\u201dYe Liu found it a bit hard to say it aloud. Was he supposed to say that Burly Du fancied him, and every time he saw him, he would trouble him for a while? That when Burly Du pulled him, he was accidentally pressed down after he was pushed, and they had become entangled together?How unlucky. How was he pushed down? And even being pressed against on the ground! Ye Liu became so angry that blue veins showed on his forehead.\u201cIn the future, stay away from those kinds of people. They are a bad influence.\u201d It was also quite unexpected for Ye Mo.

He did not want to acknowledge that his brother would say things like that, neither bashful nor shameful.Liu Duo did not react, so Ye Liu pulled her over and slapped himself on the face, \u201cHit me, Little Duo.

She ignored Ye Liu intentionally, because she liked it when he coaxed her. Was this how it felt to have a partner? It felt nice.She had responded, so some of her anger must have dissipated. Ye Liu immediately clung onto her, giggling as he took her hand again.This time, Liu Duo could not push him away, \u201cLet me go. Who allowed you to take my hand?

How shameless can you get! Who wants you to their hold hand whenever you please! Narcissist!

The four brothers had self-respect, so they couldn\u2019t possibly do such thing.Liu Duo secretly laughed at Ye Ling\u2019s anxious state and put on a serious face. \u201cHow can you say that?

You look nice in whatever you wear, Duo.\u201d\u201cOf course. It\u2019s me we\u2019re talking about!\u201d Liu Duo was very proud of herself. She was extraordinarily happy to have new clothes.By the look of it, this garment had not come cheap, but Ye Ling said nothing. As long as Liu Duo was happy. He could always secretly save money on medicine, or not consume as much.\u201cLing, listen, we\u2019ll have money in a few days, haha. Then we can buy some new clothes for you, for everyone!\u201dYe Ling hesitated and was about to ask why when Liu Duo interrupted, \u201cDon\u2019t ask me why. I\u2019ll tell you when the time comes. Consider it a surprise!\u201dSince that was what she said, Ye Ling did not probe further. He nodded.He turned away and got the dishes out from the pot and set them on the table. The first thing Liu Duo did when she arrived home was to go in the outhouse and change her cloth.Upon exiting, she washed the used one and hung it on the rope. She murmured to herself, \u201cNext time I change the cloth there should be none left.

Only Ye Mo kept staring at the quarter of an egg in his bowl, not picking up his chopsticks, as though he could change it into a flower.It was only when Ye Liu went for his second bowl that Ye Mo ate his egg. Ye Liu looked at him, not saying a word. There were some things Ye Mo had to decide for himself.\u201cIt feels nice to be full,\u201d said Liu Duo with an air of satisfaction. \u201cRight, Liu, did you find any suitable work when you were at the alley?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s some, but I don\u2019t intend to go.\u201d Ye Liu put down his chopsticks. \u201cI\u2019m going there again tomorrow to find more.\u201dWhen Ye Liu realised Burly Du had signed up for the job he wanted, he gave up on the idea.

Let\u2019s go together.\u201dLiu Duo looked at the woman who had suddenly joined them. She should be older than her, with average looks, but she was taller \u2013 at least 1.7 meters.\u201cLing, who\u2019s that girl?\u201d Liu Duo said, motioning towards her.\u201cShe\u2019s Li Chunmei, Aunt Li\u2019s granddaughter.\u201d Ye Ling looked at her, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Duo Er?\u201dShe shook her head, \u201cNothing.

They were scattered everywhere in the farms and fields, busy tending to their own land.When they reached the paddy fields, Ye Mo and the men rolled up their sleeves and pants, took off their shoes, and strolled barefoot into the field. Liu Duo stood aside, not moving.She planned to help to pass the time, but at the sight of the wet field, she knew it would be muddy if she stepped in, and she did not like the feeling of dirt.Ye Mo did not say anything to her this time. He stepped into the field, followed by Ye Liu and Ye Ling.\u201cLing, you go up later. Mo and I can handle it. You best not tire yourself,\u201d Ye Liu reminded him.\u201cYes, I know.\u201dShe observed the men from the side, and sat on the ground when she got tired.What a coincidence it was that the paddy field that belonged to Li Chunmei\u2019s family was right beside theirs.Everyone busied themselves in the paddy fields, while Liu Duo was the only one standing on the path, especially out of tune.\u201cThird brother Mo, the girl that came with you is your wife, right?

There she was, sitting quietly, watching them work.He did not answer Li Chunmei, as he continued weeding.Having received no response, Li Chunmei spoke again, \u201cThird brother Liu, was she like that at her old place?\u201dShe was curious. Was Liu Duo sold because she was too lazy?\u201cHer clothes are expensive, aren\u2019t they? What a snob. Why aren\u2019t you saying anything, third brother Liu?\u201dWas he unhappy because his wife was lazy? According to her mother, it was Uncle Ye who decided to buy a shared wife for them. Who would expect she\u2019d turn out to be lazy and snobbish?\u201cNothing. Get back to work,\u201d Ye Mo said.The words he spoke bore no expression. In Li Chunmei\u2019s ears, it meant that he was unwilling.Therefore she saw Liu Duo as a lazy and snobbish person \u2013 one who Ye Mo disliked.Liu Duo knew what Li Chunmei thought of her.

It was because today was different. They ate dinner earlier than usual, and it was still only around seven o\u2019clock.Ye Mo was still sitting there and boiling the water. He didn\u2019t say anything when he saw Liu Duo this time. He had a cool expression on his face, and he just boiled the water earnestly.Liu Duo was even happier that he didn\u2019t try to pick a fight. She reached out with her hand to uncover the lid. Ye Mo reminded her, \u201cThe water hasn\u2019t gotten hot yet. Ye Liu already drew it to take a bath. Wait for a while longer.\u201dLiu Duo retracted her hands when she heard that. She thought, Why did his character suddenly change? Why is his tone so tender?Although she was a bit suspicious, Liu Duo didn\u2019t think too much about it. She sat on the side of the stool and waited for the water to boil.The atmosphere was quiet. The burning wood made crackling sounds, which was the only sound that could be heard.Liu Duo stared at the corner and thought of Ye Yang. What was he doing right now? Had he eaten? Was he hurt? Did he think about her? When would he return?As she thought this, she suddenly realized she really missed him. It was very obvious that they hadn\u2019t really exchanged many words between them. In fact, most of the time it was she who was doing the talking. But she just missed and felt concerned about him!She only snapped out of it when Ye Mo made a sound. \u201cThe water is hot. You can use it now.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d She got up and drew the water.After she drew the water, she picked up the bucket and started to stagger outside.Seeing this, Ye Mo got up and prepared to help, but just as that happened, Ye Liu came. \u201cOh, Little Duo, you are here. I finished bathing and didn\u2019t see you in the bedroom.\u201d\u201cCome, I will help you carry it. You just finished bathing but still drew water? Is this for washing your hair?\u201dHe stretched out his hands and took over the wooden bucket that Liu Duo held with both her hands.\u201cYeah. Thank you, Liu. My hair is a bit itchy, so I want to wash it.\u201d\u201cWhat good timing. I will help you wash it, and the two of us will be able to better our relationship as husband and wife.\u201dLiu Duo walked to the front and ignored his frivolous words.In the end, she couldn\u2019t resist the shameless Ye Liu, and he still helped her finish washing her hair.When her hair was being washed, Liu Duo was shocked. Did that dirty water really come from the water that was used to wash her hair? No wonder she felt her head itch. How long had had it been since she last washed her hair?She was even ridiculed by Ye Liu. \u201cLittle Duo, you haven\u2019t washed your hair in a year, right?\u201dThis was really embarrassing!After she wiped her hair until it stopped dripping, she flung her hair back and revealed a face that was as red as an apple.She turned around, ran back to the bedroom and closed the door. She didn\u2019t want to see Ye Liu\u2019s look of ridicule.Little Duo\u2019s embarrassed expression is so cute! Ye Liu laughed while he picked up the Chinese honey locust and placed it into a wooden box next to him.Liu Duo combed her hair and then tossed it around again. She then put her clothes on the bed and rested her head by the edge of the bed, letting her hair drop straight down from the bed.The bed was very tall. Her dangling hair was just barely out of reach of the ground.Ye Liu closed the door right after he came in. He also lit the oil lamp while he was there.\u201cLittle Duo, you rushed to lie down on the bed even though your hair hasn\u2019t completely dried yet? Then I won\u2019t give up on Little Duo\u2019s desire to spend the night together.\u201dHe took off his clothes while he spoke.Liu Duo lifted her eyes, looked at Ye Liu, and said to him, feeling frustrated, \u201cLiu, can you be more normal?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHad this bastard\u2019s sperm gone up to his brain because he had held it in for too long? Liu Duo ridiculed him, feeling helpless.The upper part of his body was naked, and he was wearing underpants on the lower half. After Ye Liu got into the bed, he grabbed his head with his right hand and said seriously, \u201cLittle Duo. I am both very handsome, and very long!\u201d [1]Endnote[1] The original translation is a play on the Chinese word, \u201c\u6b63\u5e38\u201d which means normal, and was what Liu Duo asked him to be earlier in the story. \u201c\u6b63\u201d means handsome, and \u201c\u5e38\u201d is a homonym of the word \u201c\u957f\u201d, which means long.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He even pretended to be serious and showed an alluring expression. Liu Duo thought, What is this bastard talking about? Could it be\u2026???Liu Duo\u2019s face turned red when she thought of this. In her previous life, she didn\u2019t have much energy and time needed to experience the love between a man and a woman because of the suffering her illness gave her. However, how would she not understand what was happening now? Moreover, she was also definitely a woman who liked to read stories about male homosexual love!She turned her head as she didn\u2019t want to look at Ye Liu\u2019s attention-seeking face. She said shyly, \u201cShameless bastard!\u201dPffff\u2026 Ye Liu laughed, \u201cLittle Duo, where are you going? How am I a shameless bastard? Hmm\u2026\u201d\u201cYou know why!\u201dHe got close to Liu Duo, lowered his head, and smiled slightly at her. \u201cLittle Duo, how are you so smart and cute? I am really liking you more and more.\u201dWhen he first saw her, he thought she was clever, charming, and possessed the tsundereness[1] of a little lady. Her personality was frank and open, and she didn\u2019t care about how the world viewed her at all.When he saw her draw that cute pig while they were in town, he realized she wasn\u2019t just good at talking, but she was also very smart. They had really brought home a treasure.Liu Duo turned around and pushed Ye Liu. \u201cWho wants you to like me? Don\u2019t come so close to me, and move a bit further away.\u201dThe more she pushed, the closer Ye Liu got. He said, feeling wronged, \u201cLittle Duo, why are you so cruel? I am your husband. If I am not to get close to you, should I get close with other women?\u201dShe stared at him when she heard that. \u201cYou dare to? If you get close to other women, I will turn you into a cripple!\u201dSince he was hers, unless she didn\u2019t want him, no one else could even think about having any part of him! She had always been very possessive of her belongings, ever since she was young.\u201cLittle Duo, you are so fierce. If that is so, then don\u2019t chase me away when I get close to you. Do you like me?\u201d Since she felt so possessive of him, Ye Liu became smug and wanted to gain even more ground. He clung directly onto Liu Duo\u2019s body.His hands even moved around her waist, touching everywhere.Liu Duo, who was being touched, felt a flock of crows flying pass. This bastard isn\u2019t passive, is he?She held the misbehaving hand. \u201cYou low-class bastard. You\u2019d better stop. Always taking advantage of me.\u201dThe oil lamp filled the house with warm light, making the atmosphere very ambiguous. Ye Liu stared at her so deeply that his eyes were like a whirlpool trying to suck her in. It was very seductive.Ah, what a monster! Liu Duo was defeated. She looked away, her cheeks blushed red, and her heart beat faster.Ye Liu\u2019s mood became especially good when he saw Liu Duo\u2019s evading gaze. He grabbed the back of her hand and said insufferably, \u201cI won\u2019t take advantage of Little Duo. You come and take advantage of me. I don\u2019t mind it.\u201dHe placed Liu Duo\u2019s hand on his chest.It felt smooth and strong. Liu Duo felt like she got shocked by electricity and pulled her hand away. She realized that sleeping on the same bed with this guy was really god damn dangerous. He didn\u2019t even wear clothes. Who knows when this bastard would leap up and eat her up.Liu Duo acted calm and said, \u201cI mind it. There is not much there. Nothing but skin and bones.\u201dHumph. You complained that I\u2019m thin. Aren\u2019t you the same? In her heart, Liu Duo rolled her eyes in contempt.\u201cOh, Little Duo is still angry at me for saying she is too thin?\u201d Ye Liu found it funny. It turned out that Little Duo knew how to hold a grudge.\u201cIs it still not okay after I admitted I was wrong? Little Duo isn\u2019t thin \u2013 not thin at all. As a matter of fact, she is a bit fat.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHer chest was suddenly attacked. Liu Duo shouted out, \u201cAhhh! You terrible hooligan!

This bastard looked decent and proper, but he was actually a perverted hooligan!Liu Duo just sat there, feeling indignant and embarrassed. However, Ye Liu just smiled slyly. \u201cThis tactile sensation is much more wonderful than I imagined. It is soft and bouncy.\u201d\u201cLittle Duo, I just bathed, so I\u2019m not stinky at all. I am also not acting like a hooligan right now. Behaving like this towards one\u2019s own wife is reasonable, fair, and legal.\u201dHe touched her hair that was draped over the side of the bed to check if it had dried.\u201c\u2026\u201d She didn\u2019t pay attention to him. Humph.Ye Liu didn\u2019t get angry, even though he didn\u2019t get a reply.Ye Mo and Ye Ling both heard Liu Duo\u2019s scream in the bedroom beside them. They were both shocked, and they both thought, Did Ye Liu and her consummate the marriage?\u201cLittle Duo, your hair is almost dry. Do you want to comb it a bit?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d I won\u2019t pay attention to you, humph.Ye Liu got out of the bed and brought a wooden comb over. He sat on a stool and faced Liu Duo\u2019s head. He brushed her hair lightly and even tossed it around to make it dry faster.She could feel Ye Liu moving carefully to avoid pulling her scalp and causing pain. The corner of Liu Duo\u2019s mouth started to lift up slowly.In her heart, she felt a bit blessed. The feeling of being pampered by her man made the anger she initially felt disappear.Ye Liu put down the wooden comb when Liu Duo\u2019s hair was dried thoroughly. He blew out the oil lamp and climbed in bed.Ye Liu crawled under the blanket right after he got into the bed and held Liu Duo in his embrace. \u201cLittle Duo, it feels so warm when I hug you. It was very cold just now. How do you want to reward me?\u201dShe moved her body around to try to escape his embrace. She then said, without being considerate to his ego, \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to help me comb my hair. Serves you right for not wearing any clothes!\u201d\u201cHa, Little Duo is so heartless.\u201d As he laughed, he kissed the top of Liu Duo\u2019s head. \u201cLet\u2019s sleep since it\u2019s getting late.\u201dHe still needed to go to the town port early in the morning to find suitable, temporary work.After a long time, she noticed Ye Liu didn\u2019t try anything else. Was he really asleep?Liu Duo tried to break away from his embrace. Right as she moved, Ye Liu\u2019s arms tightened, not allowing her to escape his embrace.\u201cGo to sleep quickly, and don\u2019t move,\u201d Ye Liu said calmly.She was hugged tightly, so she couldn\u2019t move. Liu Duo muttered, dissatisfied in her heart, What sleep? That thing that is pressing against my butt is so obvious. How can I fall asleep? Shameless, dirty hooligan.The feeling was especially unbearable. Liu Duo felt like her whole body was burning.But was she the only one who found it unbearable? It was even more unbearable for Ye Liu. It felt like he could only look at and touch his wife, but he couldn\u2019t have her. It wasn\u2019t a typical kind of unbearable feeling and torture.Although Ye Liu was very loose with how he spoke, he actually knew how to restrain himself. Even if he wanted to consummate their marriage, Yang should be the one to do so first. Besides, she was still young, and they needed to wait for at least a year and a half.Liu Duo slowly fell asleep as this unbearable time passed by.Dawn came, and the weather was sunny. Liu Duo slowly got up in a daze. But the other side of the bed had turned cold long ago. Ye Liu\u2019s body had disappeared.Her stomach ached, so Liu Duo got up to put on some clothes. She didn\u2019t have time to tie her hair before she left the bedroom to head to the outhouse.Ye Mo, who was chopping firewood, saw Liu Duo. He turned his gaze away, looking uncomfortable.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLiu Duo found it strange. What\u2019s with that?After she did her business in the outhouse, Liu Duo felt comfortable. She returned to the bedroom to get her wooden comb and combed her hair.She tied a ponytail high on her head, braided it, and let it hang down. It was full of youthfulness.

Liu Duo felt rueful that it was another new day. Not having to worry about any illness, and not having to take medicine, was a great feeling.After she finished with her things, she went to the kitchen and saw Ye Ling sitting next to the stove. Liu Duo walked over and said out of concern, \u201cLing, how do you feel today? Feeling better?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine now. I feel much better after taking my medicine. Thank you, Duo Er, for showing concern for me.\u201d Ye Ling smiled bashfully. However, he didn\u2019t look at her and kept moving his sight away from her.Liu Duo felt puzzled. What was going on? She didn\u2019t find it that strange when Ye Mo had acted this way moments ago, but now even Ye Ling was acting this way. What the hell was going on?\u201cYi\u2026\u201dWhen she was about the ask the question, Ye Ling interrupted her, \u201cDuo Er, let\u2019s eat. Liu already ate and went to town.\u201dHe got up and went to get the rice and chopsticks straightaway. Liu Duo could only let the matter go and go to help.The three of them were eating at the table. Ye Mo suddenly said, \u201cLing, you stay at home and rest today. She and I will go to the paddy fields to weed. We have to get rid of the weeds and plant the rice as soon as possible.\u201dLiu Duo stopped what she was doing and looked at him. \u201cWhy do I have to go with you? I\u2019m not going.\u201dGoing to the paddy fields to weed? She absolutely didn\u2019t want to get into the field. She also didn\u2019t want to be with Ye Mo. The only thing they did, besides fighting, was even more fighting. It really annoyed her!He didn\u2019t look at Liu Duo and said, while he ate, \u201cNo reason. If you don\u2019t go, what are you going to do?\u201d\u201cI will stay at home and accompany Ling. Right, Ling?\u201dYe Mo didn\u2019t wait for Ye Ling to speak. He said straightaway, \u201cIt\u2019s not like Ling is a child. Why would he need you to accompany him? You need to come!\u201dIt was like this every time. His voice would get loud when he became unhappy.Ye Ling initially wanted to argue, but he said to Liu Duo, \u201cDuo Er, you should go. Going out for a walk is also good.\u201dIn the end, in consideration for Ye Ling, Liu Duo reluctantly agreed.The two of them didn\u2019t converse with each other while they were on the way. Ye Mo walked at the front, and Liu Duo followed behind.While on the way, they saw quite a few villagers working in paddy fields and vegetable fields.\u201cYe Mo, I heard your fourth brother fell ill. Is he alright now?\u201d Li Wazi immediately came over when he saw Ye Mo.\u201cYeah. He is fine now and is resting at home.\u201d Ye Mo had never shown his angry side to Li Wazi before.Li Wazi caught sight of Liu Duo, who was following behind. He pulled Ye Mo aside and spoke at a volume that only the two of them could hear, \u201cYe Mo, this is your shared wife right? She is quite pretty.\u201dThis was the second time Li Wazi had seen Liu Duo. In the beginning, he had helped to search for Liu Duo when she had escaped. However, the sky had been dark then, and he hadn\u2019t clearly seen what she looked like.\u201cYeah.\u201d Ye Mo still felt somewhat pleased when he heard his wife being praised for being pretty. His mood became considerably better.Liu Duo saw that someone was looking at her, so she lifted her eyes and cast a glance at Li Wazi, who was walking side by side with Ye Mo.A typical man of the Zhuang family. He was tall, strong, and good-natured. He was only about twenty-something years old.\u201cYe Mo, what\u2019s with your face?\u201d Li Wazi suddenly realized there was swelling on Ye Mo\u2019s face.Sigh.

Don\u2019t disappear.\u201d He entered the paddy field after he finished speaking.Liu Duo looked at Ye Mo\u2019s back and became suspicious. Did his character really change? He doesn\u2019t want me to work and pull out the weeds? He just wants me to guard these cloth shoes that no one wants?She couldn\u2019t figure it out, so she decided to not think about it. She had never planned to enter the paddy field anyway. Liu Duo sat at the side and looked at the people and everything else around her.Ye Mo, who was busy weeding, just simply wanted Liu Duo to be with him. He had come around to the thing that happened last time. If she didn\u2019t want to work, then she wouldn\u2019t need to. He would just have to do more.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201cSister Chunmei, are you almost finished with weeding your family\u2019s paddy field?\u201cYeah, there is only one small patch left.\u201dLi Chunmei headed there while speaking to a girl.\u201cHmm. Who is that girl? Sitting there idly. Doesn\u2019t she need to help her family with their work?\u201d The girl felt puzzled.Li Chunmei looked and saw that it was Liu Duo. She said, with a hateful look on her face, \u201d Xiaoling, that is the shared wife that Big Brother Mo\u2019s family bought. She\u2019s called Liu Duo. She\u2019s both lazy and a spendthrift. She doesn\u2019t even have any manners\u2026\u201dLi Chunmei told Xiaoling an exaggerated version of what had happened the day before.\u201cWhat? Then didn\u2019t they lose a lot of money buying such a shared wife back home? Ye Mo and his brothers are so unlucky.\u201d Xiaoling looked at Liu Duo with contempt and felt pity for Ye Mo and his brothers.Although Li Chunmei lowered her voice, Xiaoling\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t quiet. She was one of those people who naturally talked very loudly. Her words drifted into Liu Duo\u2019s ears.Liu Duo heard someone talk about her so she turned her head to look. When she saw Li Chunmei, Liu Duo smiled. That smile was invisible to anyone who did not look very closely at the corner of her mouth.Li Chunmei, ha\u2026She cast a glance at the two of them, turned away, and continued to look at the scenery and the people who were doing manual labor.\u201cLet\u2019s stop talking. Come. We will chat later. We need to finish the work in the paddy fields.\u201d Liu Duo\u2019s glance made Li Chunmei\u2019s heart tense up.\u201cThat\u2019s also fine. I don\u2019t like her at all.

Are they here to make me laugh? Don\u2019t like me?She shook her head.

It wasn\u2019t long before she finished weeding.She saw Liu Duo just sitting there and not coming over to help.

As Liu Duo sat on the slope, she had witnessed Li Chunmei move from her field to their field.She could not, however, overhear the conversation between Li Chunmei and Ye Mo due to the distance.She had no objection to extra help. If Ye Mo were the only one weeding, it would take forever.Li Chunmei smiled like a blossoming flower as she spoke to Ye Mo, while indifference still hung coolly on his face, and he only responded every now and then.Liu Duo was pleased with this! Surely, she did have have a good impression of Ye Mo, but he was one of her husbands after all. She could not stand other women.\u201cThird brother Mo, I\u2019m finished with mine, let me help you out,\u201d Li Wazi shouted as he walked, carrying his shoes.Ye Mo looked up and nodded. He knew Li Wazi would come to help him. They grew up together and were the best of friends. Li Wazi would help him work when he was free and vice versa.Li Wazi came and saw Liu Duo sitting there, but he did not protest, because his wife was just the same. Other than cooking and cleaning, he did not let her get involved with farm work.He walked into the paddy field and saw Li Chunmei there too. He greeted her, saying, \u201cChunmei, you\u2019re here to help Mo too, I see. How diligent.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you the same, brother Lee? We\u2019re all neighbours, so it\u2019s natural to help one another.\u201d Who did not enjoy some good praise? She smiled proudly.She added, \u201cMo\u2019s working alone without a decent helper. It would take longer to plant his rice, which would reduce his harvest too.

Li Wazi thought to himself.Another helping hand, and a good one, would naturally speed things up even more. After Li Wazi joined them, Li Chunmei could not speak to Ye Mo alone, and this made her unhappy. Her smile had largely diminished.As though he had just thought of something, Li Wazi came to Ye Mo\u2019s side and whispered, \u201cMo, didn\u2019t you say you want to teach your wife a lesson? How did it go?\u201dAt the mention of that, colour drained from Ye Mo\u2019s face, as he felt awkward. He feigned confusion and retorted, \u201cWhat do you mean? Nothing happened.\u201dHe dodged the question and stepped aside.Li Wazi followed up and reminded him kindly, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you want her to know her place? What happened next? Did you\u2026 did you guys \u2018do that\u2019?\u201dHe nudged Ye Mo with his elbow. Ye Mo glared at the mischievous look on his face.He was reminded of the utter failure that came after his gallant words that day, and the terrible beating that followed. Yet this so-called bad company had the nerve to remind him!He knew what he was saying, as he shyly admitted, \u201cNo! Shut up and get weeding.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLi Chunmei saw the two speaking in low voices. She had no clue what was going on. She came up and asked, \u201cThird brother Mo, brother Li, what is it?\u201d\u201cNothing,\u201d Li Wazi faked a laugh. Of course he couldn\u2019t share stories like this with an unmarried woman. And he wouldn\u2019t even if she were married.Right then, Liu Duo strolled slowly to the side of the field and asked Ye Mo, \u201cWhere\u2019s the outhouse here?\u201dAround those parts, there was nothing but forest and fields, so she had to ask.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We usually resolve these emergencies in secret.\u201dYe Mo stared at him in dismay. Is this guy a bit too enthusiastic? That\u2019s my wife, and she\u2019s asking me.Li Wazi did not think too much. This was Ye Mo\u2019s wife. If it were someone else, he would not be as attentive.\u201cArgh!\u201d Liu Duo felt very crossed.She could get used to the outhouse if toilets were unavailable. But having to find a dark hidden spot to attend to her needs was too much for her. She could not accept it.She went away, dragging her long face. Whatever. It\u2019s not that bad. I\u2019ll have to endure it until I get home.\u201cI\u2019ll bring you,\u201d Mo said, and walked up.He saw Liu Duo\u2019s disappointment and felt strange inside.Liu Duo was surprised to hear him say that. She needed to relieve herself, and he\u2019s bringing her? It\u2019s just weird!\u201cThird brother Mo, let me go with her,\u201d Li Chunmei said, announcing her presence as she approached.Liu Duo looked at her and thought, This girl sure knows how to make an appearance.\u201cThere\u2019s no need. I\u2019m going home to settle this.\u201d There were no outhouses there, and with her? Why her?She faced the slope that was towards the direction of home.Ye Mo was stubborn. He left the paddy field, pulled out weeds to wipe mud off his hands, and chased after her.\u201cI\u2019m taking you. Home is still quite far away, so don\u2019t want you to hold it for that long,\u201d he said coolly as he pulled Liu Duo in another direction.Under his grip, Liu Duo refuted him in her mind, You\u2019re the one who\u2019s held it for too long!If he could have heard her thoughts, he would definitely have engaged in combat, I certainly have held it for too long!Li Wazi watched them leave and continued weeding, not thinking too much of it.Yet Li Chunmei furrowed her brow, displeased, as she uttered, What\u2019s she faking for? She\u2019s not any family\u2019s missy! I didn\u2019t even want to go with you!\u201cWhat? Chunmei, what did you say?\u201d Li Wazi looked up and asked, absent-mindedly.\u201cAh, nothing. Brother Li, you\u2019re hearing things.\u201d Li Chunmei lowered her head and began weeding.Ye Mo led Liu Duo to a deserted place, with grass so tall it could conceal human legs. It was peaceful all around. Only birds sang.\u201cRight, no one comes here. You finish your business, and I\u2019ll stand guard,\u201d With that, he released his grip and turned around, with his back to her.Liu Duo observed her surroundings. She felt that this was a good place to hide a dead body, with grass so tall.She took a few steps forward on her own, distancing herself a good five meters from Ye Mo. She found a spot with the tallest of grass, making sure that there was absolutely no one around before crouching down to pee.When she finished, she straightened her clothes, got up, and stepped out.She had only walked a few steps when she heard light movement behind her. She looked back and thought she saw something brush past her.The wind blew, and the grass swayed with it. The scraping sound made her whole body go cold, and she shivered.She immediately took to her heels, dragging Ye Mo with her.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Ye Mo asked curiously behind her.She ran a distance and only shook off Ye Mo\u2019s hand when she felt safe. She panted heavily, \u201cDon\u2019t go there again. It\u2019s spooky.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAh?\u201dShe rolled her eyes at him. It was his fault she got scared.

Nothing good had ever come from being with him!Back at the paddy fields, Liu Duo continued sitting by the sideline, and Ye Mo resumed weeding.He could not do anything about Liu Duo\u2019s neglect towards him. He did not know how he had offended her, and she would not talk about it!\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Mo?\u201d Li Wazi got curious about the gloom on Ye Mo\u2019s face. He had just gone for a walk with his wife, and he had come back all fired up.Ye Mo had his eyes on Liu Duo, who was looking up at the sky, wondering what was occupying her thoughts?In response to Li Wazi\u2019s words, Ye Mo\u2019s expression dimmed. \u201cMore work, less talk.\u201dLi Chunmei looked over at Liu Duo, then again at Ye Mo\u2019s handsome face. She thought, Liu Duo must have done something again to make him mad.This wife is such a sinner! She only knows how to anger her husband!As time passed, the weeds in the paddy field were all removed. \u201cThank you for your help today,\u201d Ye Mo said to his neighbours.\u201cNo need for that. It\u2019s no big deal,\u201d Li Wazi laughed.Li Chunmei agreed, \u201cExactly!\u201dThe three left the paddy field. Liu Duo saw that all was done and they could finally go home, so she got up and took the lead.She had nothing good to say to them, much less a person like Li Chunmei, who was so self-centred and thought so highly of herself.She knew that Li Chunmei thought about getting it on with other married men. What a typical home wrecker.\u201cSister Chunmei, wait for me!\u201d Xiao Ling shouted from behind them.She had finished her work too and was heading home in the same direction.As she got nearer, Li Chumei went ahead to catch up with Ye Mo.\u201cThird brother Mo, brother Li,\u201d Xiao Ling greeted them as she approached.Ye Mo nodded coolly. Li Wazi smiled.The four of them walked behind while Liu Duo took the lead.\u201cThird brother Mo, why didn\u2019t that wife of yours work today? Lazy bum. Even kids help with the farm. Why you didn\u2019t say anything?\u201d Xiao Ling\u2019s voice was so loud even Liu Duo could hear her.Xiao Ling was young \u2013 only fourteen. She heard everything from Li Chunmei, so she could not fathom Liu Duo\u2019s actions and disliked her too, on top of disliking her role as a shared wife.Ye Mo did not look at her but said coolly, \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t want to work, then she doesn\u2019t want to work.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Xiao Ling was stumped. If she did not help with the farm, she would be beaten or scolded by her family.She felt extremely put off at Ye Mo\u2019s reply. How could she, a shared wife, live such a good life?As Li Chunmei listened, she felt that Ye Mo was a good man. Liu Duo was clearly not lovable, yet he tolerated her.Li Wazi kept to himself. His wife did not work either, so it seemed totally normal. What was there to argue about?Because he loved his wife.Liu Duo stopped in her tracks and turned around, facing Ye Mo and then Xiao Ling.How could someone so young be so devilish, only looking for trouble and not even thinking twice about her own circumstance.\u201cLittle girl, it\u2019s best to watch your words and don\u2019t meddle in other people\u2019s business. After all, careless conversations cause trouble! In the end, no one will marry you!\u201dLiu Duo smiled gently, but her words surely packed a punch.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYe Mo felt indifferent, for he had been on the receiving end far too many times.Li Wazi was caught by surprise, Mo\u2019s wife cannot be underestimated!Li Chunmei was not fooled by her smile.

Her voice was already loud, so this was quite stinging to Liu Duo.She suddenly felt that Ye Mo\u2019s shouting was very weak compared to this.Ye Mo furrowed his brow. He was about to tell Xiao Ling that even though Liu Duo was their shared wife, he would not allow anyone to bully her. Li Wazi also had something to say, but instead they listened to Liu Duo\u2019s calm response.\u201cLittle Wench, with a voice this powerful, you could have scared all the men away. Be careful now, or you\u2019ll die a virgin!\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m a shared wife who was sold to the family. So what? I have four husbands, each better looking than the next. This is my blessing from my past life, unlike some people, who might be secretly plotting to steal my man.\u201dWith that, Liu Duo gave Li Chunmei a long, hard look.Li Chunmei turned away, unwilling to face her.With her secret discovered, her cheeks reddened with panic. Liu Duo had been right, the Ye brothers were all very good-looking.Ye Mo smirked at the praise. She had even said it was a blessing to be their shared wife. He could not hide the happiness on his face.Li Wazi could have worshipped her on the spot. Anyone who had no trouble saying that had to be manlier than any man!Xiao Ling was so mad her cheeks turned red, but she could not think of a good comeback. How could she rival Liu Duo? A modern person\u2019s wife could easily kill off a kid\u2019s ancient ideology!Not caring about the two, Liu Duo imitated Ye Liu\u2019s tone and spoke to Ye Mo, \u201cLittle brother Mo, won\u2019t you get over here and stay far away from those two? Don\u2019t learn from them. People can hear their shouts from miles away! How embarrassing.\u201dShe turned away again and continued marching forward.Ye Mo\u2019s smirk turned into a twitch. Dear brother? She\u2019s tired of living, is she? She won\u2019t call me Mo, but she chose to call me little brother, like Liu does!Groaning, he caught up with her so that they were walking shoulder to shoulder. \u201cI told you to call me Mo. Who are you to add \u2018little\u2019?\u201dNot stopping, Liu Duo chuckled as she walked. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I call you that? You\u2019re the third in the family.

Can\u2019t you look at me like a normal person?\u201d This person should be good friends with Ye Mo, but he never introduced himself, so she did not know his name.He had a lot of zeal, and he was very honest, so he left a good impression in her books.Ye Mo gently nudged him with his elbow, eying him knowingly.

He gave Liu Duo and the others a few instructions and then left.Liu Duo stood at the yard\u2019s door and watched Ye Liu leave. She thought of Ye Yang again. Of the four men, two of them had left in order to provide for the family. She felt very irritated.Her wish, after she had been given another life, was to live together with her family and to live a normal life where they were all happy and healthy \u2013 not like this, where they were all in separate places, and she had to hope for them to come home soon.However, she could only find comfort by telling herself that she would only need to endure this for a while longer.

She would clean the dirty clothes to pass the time.When Ye Ling heard her, he took out all their dirty clothes and put them into a bucket.\u201cDuo Er, I will go with you. This way, we will be able to finish washing faster.\u201dThe two of them went together to the riverside, and Ye Mo went to chop wood.The water in the river was very clear, and the water quality was especially good. It was still early, so there weren\u2019t many people. Liu Duo and Ye Ling found a nice spot and began to wash the clothes.Not long after, people with dirty clothes started to come to the riverside to wash their clothes.\u201cLing, you rest for a while.

She saw that his head was even lower than before, and he was quietly washing the clothes.Did he get angry? Liu Duo suspected. This was the first time she saw Ye Ling get angry. His anger was the type that didn\u2019t make any sound. It was the complete opposite to Ye Mo\u2019s style of being fiery and aggressive.\u201cLing? Why aren\u2019t you saying anything?\u201d Liu Duo called over to him.There still wasn\u2019t any response. He didn\u2019t speak nor lift his head.

Ye Ling started to feel embarrassed. What kind of person would keep mentioning the word consummate in broad daylight?Liu Duo watched the little movements he made. The corner of her mouth moved, and she laughed silently. Was he embarrassed? He was embarrassed, but he still mentioned the thing about the consummation!If you move, I\u2019ll also move.

Instead, she was the one who fell directly onto the ground because of her own inertia.Dust flew upwards. Liu Duo only felt a tremble beneath her legs.On the other side, Ye Ling saw that Liu Duo hadn\u2019t followed him, so he turned around. \u201cDuo Er, what are you still doing there?\u201d\u201cNothing.

Otherwise, his fiery temper might cause some major problems again!Wang Liushi looked at Ye Mo\u2019s grave face and disapproved. She didn\u2019t believe that he, as a man, would dare to touch her.When Liu Duo saw Ye Mo, it felt like she saw her bodyguard. Although this bodyguard was a bit thin.However, he was currently the only strong man left in their house. Yang and Liu were both away, so she could only depend on Ye Mo.

He stared at Liu Duo in complete disbelief.Why did the \u2018Big Brother Mo\u2019 that came from her mouth sound so nice? Ye Mo became happy after she called him Big Brother Mo. This blessing came too suddenly and it resulted in Ye Mo staring blankly at Liu Duo.Why is this bastard staring at me? Didn\u2019t he hear me asking him to help? Liu Duo rolled her eyes at Ye Mo.

His decibel level was also very high.Liu Duo lamented in her heart, Ah, Ye Mo has the potential to sing high notes like Pavarotti. His deep and resounding voice sounds quite nice.When Wang Liushi heard he would hit her again, she increased her volume and screamed, \u201cThe third brother of the Ye family, you are not a man.

Moreover, Wang Liushi was too fat and couldn\u2019t dodge in time, so she was always hit.Having a stick in hand was really different. Liu Duo\u2019s confidence level at that moment was sky-high.

What was so great about it? She turned to get the rice.Ye Mo\u2019s eyes caught her expression at that moment. He realised, the more he noticed her in detail, the more interesting quirks he was in her.

And to this violent man?She laughed as she thought about it. He was indeed handsome, with a dimple on his right cheek, and he looked much better smiling than he did frowning.Having received his answer, Ye Mo got down to serious business.As Liu Duo boiled the water, adding firewood every now and then, she spent most of the time staring at Ye Mo.This was the first time she had studied him in detail. While the four brothers looked handsome and similar, only he and Ye Liu had the same facial features.Ye Liu represented feminine beauty, while Ye Mo was the masculine one.

After the three washed up, Ye Ling left, because tonight it was Ye Mo\u2019s turn to sleep with Liu Duo.An oil lamp was lit in the room. Liu Duo untied her hair and combed it straight. She went to the bedside and took off her clothes. She felt a little nervous sleeping with Ye Mo, since the two of them had not been getting along.Ye Mo was especially nervous too. Ye Liu\u2019s warnings to him after recent incidents were still fresh in his mind, but his feelings and attitude towards Liu Duo had changed a lot, so he was more cautious.Liu Duo climbed into bed in her undergarment and lay under the blanket with her back to Ye Mo.Then, Ye Mo blew out the oil lamp. He too was in his undergarments, but he was not underneath his blanket. Instead, just like Ye Liu, he crawled under Liu Duo\u2019s blanket and shared hers.The difference was that he was wearing a shirt, and he was not hugging her.Since Ye Ling had left, the two of them had not spoken a word \u2013 like mutes.Liu Duo got so scared she could not move.

He shoved his body and moved behind her, once again crawling under her blanket.This time Liu Duo could not move. Ye Mo held out his arms and brought her into a hug, \u201cAre you planning to freeze your husband to death, stealing the blanket like that?\u201dLiu Duo was already so scared she could barely speak, and this doofus actually came to hug her?

It\u2019s warm like this.\u201d He saw her struggling, so he held her even tighter, even closer.He thought, You stole my blanket first! But what Liu said was true, hugging the wife makes things much more comfortable. And she smells nice. So soft.If Liu Duo knew what he was thinking, she would have been devastated. You fool! No wonder you look so similar to Ye Liu, that hooligan!They had not been getting along, even if Ye Mo had been acting strangely that day. But being in his embrace like this made Liu Duo very nervous.When Ye Liu was hugging her, though it was dangerous, he did not do anything to her. But she could not guarantee it would be the same with this fool!This fellow was impulsive and violent. Even though he had not beaten her, she was unable to block whatever else he might do to her. The disparity in strength between man and woman was very real.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt this point, Liu Duo struggled even more forcefully, but Ye Mo was reluctant to let go. On the contrary, her struggling elicited a response within him.She felt something push against her behind. She was so frightened she stopped moving. Her heart beat extremely quickly, and she got uncontrollably nervous.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you moving? Hmm\u2026\u201d He asked in a deep voice.He hugged her tightly in an attempt to drown out his discomfort. However, he could smell her fragrance, and he touched her soft bodice, and this heated him up even more.\u201cYou\u2026 you let go of me! It\u2019s quite cramped over here. Let\u2019s just use our own blankets. It\u2019s much better that way,\u201d Liu Duo muttered carefully, afraid he would unleash his carnal desires. He was not Ye Liu.

The hard object poking at her behind was getting harder and hotter as it pressed uncomfortably against her.She wanted to carefully get just a little bit further away, but a single tiny action caused Ye Mo to flip over and trapped her underneath him.Caught by surprise again, Liu Duo\u2019s big round eyes stared widely at him, and she gulped. She was nervous, but she had to be careful to not provoke him. \u201cYou, what are you doing? Let me go. Please, please don\u2019t be rash. I\u2019m still too young.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Ye Mo lowered his gaze at her.Liu Duo exhaled freely when he did not take the next step. She relaxed a little.\u201cYou get down first.

We can still share one bed and blanket,\u201d She tried convincing him to get off of her.\u201c\u2026\u201d Ye Mo gazed at her lips opening and closing and felt dryness in his mouth.He lowered his head and lightly kissed her on the mouth, casually licking her lips.

You look thin but you\u2019re most certainly not light, she thought.Surprisingly, Ye Mo obeyed.

His voice screamed ecstasy. He placed her hand there, not letting it go.Oh, f**k! This fool plans to use my hand to\u2026 to resolve the problem? Liu Duo\u2019s face burned and reddened, but the room was too dark for anyone to see.Sure, she was a fan of boys\u2019 love, but she would still be especially bashful to touch it directly.No words were said. Liu Duo didn\u2019t know what to say, and Ye Mo had no time for words.Ye Mo just thought that the feeling of her hand rubbing his manhood was particularly comfortable. He felt less unbearable now, but it was not enough.Liu Duo thought. Oh, oh my, I didn\u2019t know that his manhood could be so\u2026 so big. Would it get any bigger? The nervousness she felt in the beginning had disappeared and was replaced by curiosity. She was all right as long as she was not touched.At this thought, she poked a little more, and it really got bigger and harder. Ye Mo moaned again, like he was about to burst.\u201cYou provoked it, so you must bear responsibility!\u201d He said in between moans, and brought her hand to rub up and down on that part of his body.Liu Duo\u2019s rationality snapped.

Ye Mo closed the door after he entered got into the bed and hugged Liu Duo again.This time she knew better. She let him hug her, as long as he did not force himself on her. She closed her eyes and drifted to sleep.As he hugged her, he felt she was no longer struggling or resisting. He chuckled silently, as though he had gotten what he wanted.But he could not sleep. He felt smug and restless, and it was a great feeling.Some time went by. Liu Duo was breathing steadily, already asleep, while Ye Mo\u2019s eyes were wide open, unable to sleep. He suddenly felt that hugging his wife was filled with both happiness and agony!He held Liu Duo\u2019s hand a few more times to resolve his biological urges. She did not react at all, busy dreaming.After finishing his private business, he helped wash her hand. Finally pleased with himself, he resumed hugging her and managed to sleep with a smile on his face. In his dreams, Liu Duo was everywhere. One was quarrelling with him, another was complaining to him, the third one was fighting with somebody else, and the fourth was conversing happily with his brothers\u2026 all in all a series of emotions. He felt that she was the most interesting woman he had ever seen, and she was cute too!Once this person had a substantial change towards the other party, anything bad about them would become mesmerising in his eyes.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014In the morning, around six or seven, Liu Duo stirred awake. Her blurry eyes suddenly snapped open really wide. Ye Mo was not awake yet, and he was still hugging her from behind.This fellow still hasn\u2019t let go at this hour! Get off me, geez!She freed herself from his embrace, ignored him, got down from bed, and put on her clothes.Ye Mo, being pushed aside, also opened his blurry eyes. He had been over-excited last night and only managed to fall asleep at two or three in the morning.Liu Duo took her comb and stood under the roof, brushing her hair. As she did so, she remembered what had happened the previous night, and her face uncontrollably flushed red.She thought, this fellow is even more shamelessly perverted than Liu!On the other side, Ye Mo wrapped himself in the blanket and smelt Liu Duo\u2019s remaining fragrance on it. Then he dozed off again. He was too tired.In the kitchen, after keeping busy for a long while, Ye Ling was carrying a basin of water out to pour when he saw Liu Duo brushing her hair. \u201cDuo Er, are you hungry? Food will be ready soon.\u201d\u201cOh, alright.\u201dYe Ling did not see Ye Mo, so he peeked into the room behind Liu Duo.

She didn\u2019t want to turn a little white rabbit into a big bad wolf!Feeling depressed, she tied all the hair on her head into a ponytail and then went beside the well to wash her face and rinse her mouth.On the other side, Ye Mo was still deep asleep on the bed. This was the first time in his long life that he had slept so peacefully.When he was young, he had needed to wake up early to help with work. When he started going to school, he had still needed to wake up early to go to school. Later, when their family began to have problems, he had also needed to wake up early to take care of a young Ye Ling.They could eat after the mantous were steamed. Ye Ling ladled in the paste. Liu Duo then helped to carry it to the table and arranged the bowls and chopsticks.\u201cIt seems like Mo is really tired. He still hasn\u2019t got up.\u201d Ye Ling looked at the bedroom door and said faintly.\u201cEmm, yeah. Ling, we don\u2019t need to wait for him. Let him sleep.\u201d Liu Duo said insincerely.He nodded and then carried Ye Mo\u2019s bowl of paste back into the kitchen to keep it warm in the pot.Ye Mo finally woke up naturally, late in the morning. He put on his clothes and walked out of the bedroom.The sunlight in spring was always very gentle. Ye Mo walked to the side of the well and washed his face and rinsed his mouth, but he didn\u2019t see any trace of Liu Duo or Ye Ling.He frowned, carelessly washed his face and rinsed his mouth, and then went out.Liu Duo and Ye Ling, on the other hand, were transporting the rice seedlings to the side of the paddy field, so that they could be transplanted. Of course, Liu Duo wouldn\u2019t be going down into the paddy field.Ye Ling insisted on transplanting the seedlings. He said, \u201cMo is too tired. Almost all of the farm work is done by him. I need to help with some of it. I won\u2019t wear myself out.\u201dLiu Duo initially didn\u2019t want him to do this, as she was afraid he might get tired. However, she couldn\u2019t dissuade the stubborn Ye Ling. Liu Duo could only compromise and help him carry the rice seedlings.Ye Mo circled the area near their house and didn\u2019t find them. He also didn\u2019t find them in the vegetable field. He finally found them in the paddy field. He let out a breath.At that time, he had been really afraid Liu Duo had ran away again. He had been even more worried than when she had ran away on her first day there. He hadn\u2019t really known why, but he had just been especially afraid that she might disappear.As if she had telepathy, Liu Duo turned around and saw Ye Mo panting heavily. He was even sweating all over. She frowned, \u201cTsk, you thought that I ran away again, right? You are so senseless!\u201dShe rolled her eyes at him!Ye Mo did not feel embarrassed at all that his thoughts were exposed. Instead, he smiled and thought, That\u2019s good. What she said was true. She really won\u2019t run away again.\u201dLiu Duo saw Ye Mo smiling, while staring at her, and was unable to make head nor tail of it. He looked like an idiot!She pouted and turned around, her back facing him. She didn\u2019t want to pay attention to him. He had crossed the line and used her hand without saying anything. He even suspected her of running away again. She was really angry in that moment. Humph\u2026Ye Mo smiled, walked forward, and touched Liu Duo\u2019s head.

However, she didn\u2019t want to go down into the paddy field, so she felt very conflicted.In the end, she decided to take off her cloth shoes, roll her sleeves up to her elbows, roll her trousers up to her knees, and go over.She lingered around the periphery of the paddy field and didn\u2019t step in. Ye Ling saw Liu Duo standing there and laughed, \u201cDuo Er, you don\u2019t need to come down, just leave it to us.\u201dHe knew Liu Duo was afraid to get dirty. She even frowned when she saw them go into the paddy field and get mud all over them for the first time.Ye Mo lifted up his head when he heard Ye Ling. He saw that Liu Duo had exposed her fair arms and legs. He frowned, showed a bad expression on his face, and said, \u201cYou are not allowed to come down. Roll down your sleeves and your trousers! Just wait up there.\u201dHe especially didn\u2019t want others to see her fair body. Although it was just a small part of her arms and legs, he still wouldn\u2019t allow it.Liu Duo looked at the face Ye Mo pulled and felt especially angry in her heart. Is there something wrong with this bastard? I didn\u2019t do anything to provoke him. Who is he showing that face to? He even laughed, and now he\u2019s pulling a face! I\u2019m still angry at you! What\u2019s with that attitude!She turned her head and let out a humph. She ignored him, stretched out her legs and then stepped down into the paddy field.The paddy field wasn\u2019t really that deep. It felt as one would expect and was especially soft. Mud stuck to her legs and was in clear contrast with her fair skin tone.After both her legs went in, Liu Duo felt that they became much heavier than usual. It was very hard to move in the mud, but she also felt it was very interesting.\u201cLing, come and pull me. My legs are stuck, and I can\u2019t move.\u201d She smiled as she stretched out her hands to ask Ye Ling, who wasn\u2019t too far away, to come and help her.Ye Ling laughed lightly and came over to lead Liu Duo over beside him. \u201cDuo Er, why did you want to come down?\u201d\u201cBecause I want to keep you company!\u201d Liu Duo playfully poked the tip of his straight nose.\u201cOh.\u201d Ye Ling\u2019s delicate cheeks started to turn red again. He bent down and continued to transplant the seedlings.Liu Duo looked at Ye Ling\u2019s movement and also picked up a few rice seedlings with her hands. She copied his movements and placed the rice seedlings into the paddy field.Ye Ling tilted his head and saw Liu Duo had stuck about seven or eight seedlings in her hands into the mud. The seedlings weren\u2019t planted properly and were moving around. He immediately said, \u201cDuo Er, don\u2019t put too many. Just three or four seedlings is enough. Also, you need to push them in a bit more, otherwise they will fall down.\u201dHe had been too shy and had forgotten to teach her.\u201cOh.\u201d Liu Duo listened earnestly and then practiced again.The smart Liu Duo learned it very quickly, although her speed was a bit slow.

Liu Duo looked at the sky helplessly and didn\u2019t want to answer the two of them.Ye Ling saw that Liu Duo didn\u2019t speak and continued to say, \u201cLiu Duo, although Mo\u2019s skin is a bit darker than normal, he is diligent, honest, and even knows how to read. He is very good.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Was this little fella trying to sell Mo? Liu Duo tilted her head and stared at him. She wanted to see what else he would say!Ye Ling\u2019s mood surged when he saw Liu Duo give some response. He continued to say, \u201cMo even loves to help people. Two years ago, when Brother Li\u2019s (Li Wazi\u2019s) family was in a bad state, he was in the process of dividing their property. Mo often went and helped out with their work\u2026\u201dAfter she listened to Ye Ling say a bunch of stuff, Liu Duo finally said, \u201cOh.\u201dYe Ling couldn\u2019t believe his own ears. After he said so much, Liu Duo just replied by saying, \u201coh\u201d?He looked at Liu Duo with a blank stare, his expression seemingly asking if he had heard wrong.Liu Duo looked at Ye Ling\u2019s adorable face and started to laugh.Ye Mo frowned, and his heart felt especially jittery. He sighed, \u201cLing, what\u2019s the point of saying so much. No matter what, I can\u2019t change the fact that I am this dark.\u201dHe looked over to Liu Duo and made her face him. Ye Mo said cooly, \u201cI am simply this dark, and you need to accept that. You also need to like it! Who asked you to be my wife?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Speechless.Liu Duo added another thing she now knew about Ye Mo. Besides being impulsive and violent, he was also childish and overbearing!What did he say? He said \u201cneed.\u201d \u201cNeed\u201d your goddamn face! She disliked overbearing men the most!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI won\u2019t accept it, and I won\u2019t like it! What are you going to do?\u201d She just wanted to go against him! She wanted to see what he could do.When Ye Mo heard it, he first frowned, but then calmed down. The corner of his mouth lifted up, and he said coolly and arrogantly, \u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything. You are still my wife. In the future, you still need to give birth to my child!\u201d\u201cSo no matter whether you like it or not, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that you are my wife! No matter what, you still need to give birth to my child!\u201dEndnote[1] A word that originates from Japanese. Someone who is tsundere is someone who acts cold on the outside but is actually tender on the inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This bastard is thinking about having a child again. A child my ass!\u201cWho wants to have a child with you? You\u2019re dreaming! From today onwards, I want to sleep by myself!\u201dWhen Ye Ling heard this, he didn\u2019t say anything and didn\u2019t think it was bad either. As long as Liu Duo was happy, he was fine with it.However, Ye Mo opposed it immediately. \u201cNo! I disagree. You don\u2019t have the power to decide.\u201dYe Mo had just tasted the sweet honey, so how could he agree for Liu Duo to sleep alone? Even if they didn\u2019t consummate their marriage, they could still do other stuff.\u201cWho said that I can\u2019t decide? Ling, do you agree?\u201d Liu Duo turned her head and asked Ye Ling.\u201cAs long as Duo Er is happy. It\u2019s just that the house only has two bedrooms. Once Yang and Liu come back, it will be too crowded if the four of us share a room.\u201d Ye Ling aired out his apprehensions.\u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem. After I get my money in a few days, I will build a large house. We will then each have our own bedroom.\u201d Liu Duo was very happy that Ye Ling agreed with her opinion.\u201cI won\u2019t agree to it!\u201d Ye Mo said furiously. He got up and headed to the paddy field to plant the rice seedlings.Liu Duo said, while looking at Ye Mo\u2019s back, \u201cIt is now two to one. You lose. When Yang and Liu come back, both of them will agree with me.\u201dLiu Duo felt that both Yang and Liu respected her views.\u201c\u2026\u201d Ye Mo ignored her. He went down to plant the rice seedlings with a frown on his head.In any case, I don\u2019t agree. When it is my turn, I will sleep with you! Who cares if they agree or not. Ye Mo muttered in his heart.If Liu Duo knew what Ye Mo was thinking, she would have definitely shown a very strong reaction.After a while, Ye Ling also went over to help plant the rice seedlings. Liu Duo didn\u2019t go. She was still sitting there and wondering what kind of house she should build. She was going through the designs of ancient farmhouses that she had liked in her past life.At this time, Li Chunmei, Xiaoling, and some other people were also bringing in their rice seedlings and preparing to plant them in their paddy fields.When Xiaoling saw Liu Duo, she immediately turned around and walked away, as if she were avoiding severe floods and fierce beasts. Li Chunmei was puzzled but she didn\u2019t say anything. She still didn\u2019t know what had happened the previous day. Xiaoling hadn\u2019t told her. After all, it was too embarrassing.Liu Duo laughed charmingly when she saw Xiaoling\u2019s back as she ran away. She thought, The effects are quite good. This child can be taught! It\u2019s hard to know if someone has a good memory or not!When she thought of this, she looked at Li Chunmei\u2019s back and smiled slyly.\u201cBig Brother Mo, you came so early, and you have already planted so much.\u201d Li Chunmei greeted Ye Mo with a smile.\u201cYeah.\u201d Ye Mo always showed a very cool expression to Li Chunmei.As she knew, Ye Mo didn\u2019t talk much, so she smiled and started planting the rice seedlings in her family\u2019s own paddy field.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOn a mountain in the forest, Ye Yang walked out from a cave and washed his face and rinsed his mouth beside the mountain spring. He looked at the reflection of himself in the water, but the reflection transformed into an image of Liu Duo.Ye Yang suddenly felt like he really wanted to go home. He had thought about her during the past few days. He had thought of her continuous chatter, of her small, interesting, and lively expressions, and of her singing.After being lost in thought for a while, he got up and went to the trap to see if it captured any prey.The trap wasn\u2019t very big, so it could only catch small prey. Ye Yang could hear a sound coming from far away from the trap. He went closer and discovered it was a small wolf. It had probably gotten separated from the pack, fell into the trap, and couldn\u2019t get out.Ye Yang brought it up from the trap and then let it go. He wasn\u2019t planning on selling his captured prey, because the people in the imperial courts didn\u2019t eat wolf meat. Besides, this wolf was too small.

Some had managed to catch a few hares, but the rest had none. He placed them into the basket on his back, which was equipped with a bamboo covering to prevent them from escaping.He set the trap again, then carried his basket and left, heading towards the cave he would spend the night in. The game he had caught was all stored there, and he would take it all back when it was time to go home.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Having rested enough, Liu Duo leisurely walked to the paddy field to help the transplant the rice seedlings.The repetitive work was dull and boring, but Liu Duo would always stay close to Ye Ling, as they talked happily.Liu Duo felt a pang of pain in her right calf. She looked down and saw a black object attached to it, wriggling.Shocked, she yelled, \u201cAh!\u201dYe Ling trembled in fright at her sudden high-decibel scream, and dropped his seedlings. \u201cDuo Er, what happened?\u201dThe people in the nearby paddy fields all heard her scream too, and looked towards her direction.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Ye Mo got frightened too, but he did not tremble. He just went to her side and inquired.\u201cWhat\u2019s that biting at my leg? It\u2019s painful,\u201d Liu Duo pointed at the thing and mumbled.Ye Mo and Ye Ling looked down too and found the leech. Ye Mo took hold it it, \u201cIt\u2019s a leech. When they suck blood, it can be a bit painful, but it\u2019s not venomous. We just get rid of it.\u201dAnd then he tossed it ashore.\u201cDuo Er, don\u2019t be scared. It\u2019s gone now,\u201d Ye Ling saw the sweat at the tip of her nose and consoled her.Still quivering with fear, she exhaled in relief. She hated and was most afraid of molluscs like that. She found them terribly gross.\u201cI\u2019m done. I\u2019ll wait for you guys on dry land.\u201d Pale in the face, she turned around and went ashore, unwilling to stay in the paddy field any longer.It was normal to have leeches in the paddy fields. Ye Mo and his brothers were used to it. They found Liu Duo\u2019s exaggerated reaction very strange.Li Chunmei thought, That girl is making a mountain out of a molehill. It\u2019s not like she hasn\u2019t seen it before. With that scream, she might as well be slaughtering a pig.The workers nearby all felt that Liu Duo was making a big deal out of nothing. How scary could a tiny leech be?Liu Duo grabbed some wild grass and wiped away the mud on her arms and legs. She sat on the ground, looking at her calf and inspecting the red spot where she\u2019d been bitten.She massaged it softly with her finger as she murmured, \u201cI\u2019m never going down there ago! Too scary!\u201dIt was almost noon by the time Ye Mo and Ye Ling came ashore.\u201cDuo Er, it\u2019s not painful anymore, is it?\u201d asked Ye Ling as he wiped away the mud and went to her side.\u201cYes, it\u2019s fine,\u201d she nodded. \u201cTime to go home?\u201dThe two of them had come up, so she got up too and brushed the dirt off her hips.\u201cYes, we\u2019re going back to make lunch. No one\u2019s at home to deliver food to us, so we have to make it ourselves,\u201d Ye Ling explained.Families with many members would usually have their lunch delivered to the farm. This could reduce the time and the traveling to and fro, which would increase productivity.\u201cOh.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe three made their journey home.

We\u2019re not home yet.\u201dShe held his hand and dragged him along, not letting the girl talk nonsense to him.Ye Ling was innocent enough to not know how to reject anyone. He would still reply, no matter how unwilling.The girl noticed that Liu Duo was ignoring her and was taking Ling away with her too. She thought, What a shameless woman, holding hands with a man in broad daylight! She must be their shared wife. How uncultured! I have to tell granny! We didn\u2019t get any notice, and they didn\u2019t bring her over for introductions!The girl looked back as they disappeared from view. She carried her basket and walked along a different path.Along the way, Ye Ling said softly, \u201cDuo Er, why didn\u2019t you ask who that person is? Aren\u2019t you curious why Mo and I don\u2019t want to bother with her?\u201dShe shook her head and smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s not my business who she is. I\u2019m not nosy. But as to why you guys don\u2019t bother with her, it could be that she\u2019s not likeable! And if she\u2019s loathsome, why bother with her? Right?\u201dShe could have easily guessed the girl was their relative, and one that they had a bad relationship with at that, because she had never seen them treating other people this way.But if anyone could receive a cold shoulder from them, it should be the child of one of their estranged uncles!Ye Ling nodded in agreement with Liu Duo, \u201cYes, she\u2019s definitely loathsome, I don\u2019t like her.\u201dHearing that, Liu Duo added, \u201cOf course you don\u2019t. You only like me. Don\u2019t forget that!\u201dWhen she said this, Ye Ling asked back, \u201cThen, Duo Er, do you like me?\u201dTaken aback, Liu Duo thought, Oh, well, aren\u2019t you witty? Asking a question like this.But she was stunned only for several seconds, as she later said cheerfully, \u201cOf course I do. You\u2019re my husband. Who can I like, if not you?\u201dYe Ling got red in the face as she said so. He felt happy. Since they were on topic, he got to tell her what he had wanted to say last time. He whispered, \u201cI like Duo Er too. She\u2019s the one and only.\u201dLiu Duo giggled blissfully at Ye Ling\u2019s confession.A look of displeasure hung on his cool face as Ye Mo listened to their conversation, thinking, Why does she treat me so differently? She has never said those things to me.Back home, the three of them completely washed off the mud at the well, and then they went to make lunch.While they were cooking, Ye Ling said to her, \u201cDuo Er, just now on the road, the girl we met is our third uncle\u2019s daughter. She\u2019s Ye Lanlan, and she\u2019s seventeen years old.\u201dHe thought that Liu Duo should know.

Indeed he was jealous. Granny treated his cousin well. The parents were still alive. They were not rich, but at least they had family.They, on the other hand, had lost their parents, and they had been left out of the family. His brothers took care of him as parents would, but they had never experienced parental or familial love and warmth.Uncle Ye and Aunt Ye would only drop by to visit them once in while. After all, they had their own family to care about.\u201cLing, don\u2019t go envying others, alright? There\u2019s no need to. From now on, all of us will live a good life together. You hear me?\u201dLiu Duo felt that they had to look forward. The past was the past, no matter whether it was good or bad. Dwelling on the past would only bring more trouble.When she was first reborn, she missed her parents, but those were all bad memories. She remembered how her parents had suffered to care for her sickness.She felt that her leaving was a relief to them and a relief for herself too. So, she could only pray now that they were leading a healthy and happy life in the other world.\u201cYes, Duo Er is right. We\u2019ll definitely live a prosperous life,\u201d Ye Mo smiled, brimming with determination. He believed that without eccentric elders and sneaky in-laws, the five of them would live blissfully.\u201cThere we go. Who they are and how they are have no effect on us. Don\u2019t let your mood be affected because of them.\u201d She wanted them to know not to let irrelevant figures affect their mood.\u201cRight.\u201dLunch was almost ready. Liu Duo and Ye Ling ate happily at the table, as Ye Mo listened and looked on. If he spoke, Liu Duo would get on his case very soon, so he would rather keep his mouth shut in case he made her angry again. He ate in silence.\u2026\u201cMo, Ling, you guys having lunch?\u201d Ye Xuan buoyantly entered their yard.Ye Mo and Ye Ling furrowed their brows at him. What was he doing here?Ye Mo had no kind words to say, \u201cYe Xuan, what are you here for? Shouldn\u2019t you be studying at home, not running around?\u201dAt the mention of the name, Liu Duo looked up at this full-time student, who didn\u2019t have to do or care about anything and yet could not pass his exams.Ye Xuan did not look too ugly, but he wasn\u2019t handsome either. He was probably a bit better looking than the average person, but compared to the four brothers here, he was a long way off.Ye Xuan entered the yard and immediately saw Liu Duo. She was the reason he had come anyway. Ye Lanlan told him about the brothers\u2019 shared wife and how she was uncultured, holding a man\u2019s hand in broad daylight, so he had to come and see for himself.\u201cMo, one can\u2019t be too eager in his studies, and one can\u2019t study for the sake of studying, can he? No. I miss you and Ling, so I decided to stop by,\u201d he chortled, and without being invited, he went to sit at their table.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYe Mo did not believe him.

She had already told them not to let irrelevant people disturb their mood, and yet here they were being the same as always. She felt really bad for them!Ye Mo and Ye Ling exchanged glances? Were they just given the cold shoulder?They lowered their heads and ate quickly.When she returned from the outhouse, she saw they had emptied their bowls and were washing up, so she said, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to the paddy fields later, I\u2019m not going.
