His head was covered in cold sweat as he panted heavily.\"Holy sh * t, that scared the baby to death.\"As soon as he finished speaking, the youth's expression turned cold. He was instantly stupefied when he saw the furnishings in the thatched hut.\"Where the f * ck is this?\"\"That's not right, I was just playing in my dog-hole and casually killed a Boss, then \u2026\" The teenager did not 'continue' but thought, \"That Boss is the Ultimate Boss, it must be that holy artifact that dropped. I, your father, am the one leading the world and becoming rich. It's time to marry the rich and beautiful girl to the peak of their lives.\"\"Wait!\"The youth was stunned again, \"It seems like there was a bolt of lightning that struck my host. I didn't even have the time to check what the Boss dropped before I fainted?\"It was also at this moment.The youth's head began to hurt violently.He filled his mind with all sorts of memories.\"To be able to break through the fifth level of Warrior at the age of nine, he is indeed the number one genius of the Imperial City. As expected of the descendant of General Shen Long.\"\"The Emperor bestowed the marriage, bestowed Nangong Yan with the title of Long Fei, a genius with a beauty, a perfect match.\"\"The number one genius of the Imperial City, Long Fei, was heavily injured by a mysterious person. His Dragon Spirit Blood was pulled out.\"It's useless, the Supreme Dan is useless, the Pubes is broken, from now on, he can only be a mortal.\"\"Father, I am strongly opposed to spending more money on treating Long Fei. He's just a piece of trash now, he's already fifteen years old. Even if he's cured, he's still a piece of trash \u2026\"\"Long Fei, weren't you rather arrogant in the past? What's wrong? How does it feel to be stepped on by this young master? \"Hahaha...\"\"Look at this trash, he can't even beat the beggars on the streets, he's really embarrassing the holy dragon mansion. If it were me, I would have just died.\"\"The Grand Master is in seclusion.\"\"From today onwards, break all of Long Fei's supplies. If you want to eat, go earn it yourself. The Long family will not raise trash.\"\"Ahh \u2026\"The memory fragments began to slowly piece together.The last scene where Long Fei was kicked flying by Long Ao, his head knocked against a stone tablet, he fainted.At this moment.The youth was completely dumbfounded, \"Oh my god, I just killed a Boss in the game, is there a need to punish me like this?\"\"I killed a Boss, but I don't know what dropped. Now that I'm in a different world, I've become a piece of trash.\"Long Fei was very unhappy.It was quite unpleasant.According to his memory, he clearly knew that he had an extremely powerful identity, the successor to the holy dragon mansion.holy dragon mansion.The first Palace Chief, Long Zhantian.Relying on a handful of Mountain Spliting Knief, he entered the prehistoric territory, killed a Dragon God, and used the Dragon Spirit Blood to temper his body. He then became the number one Dragon God Warrior of the god's martial continent. Followed Nagong Ao, killed demons and killed strange beasts. In this chaotic domain, a domineering aura rushed into the sky, and after eighteen years of war, the Long Family army led to the creation of the current Fire Glass Dynasty. To be conferred the title of Marquis of the Dragon God, to establish the holy dragon mansion, and to enjoy the title of an eternal noble. Thus, the holy dragon mansion got its name.It was said that Long Zhantian had obtained the inheritance of the Dragon Spirit Blood Vein, and the Dragon God Warrior was born in every generation of the Long Family.And he was this generation's Dragon God Warrior.He broke through the fifth level of Warrior at the age of nine, was at the eighth level at the age of twelve, and had already become a second level War Master at the age of fourteen, becoming the number one genius in Fire Glass Dynasty.Long Fei became the most important treasure of the Long family.However.Not long after, the mysterious ranker suddenly appeared and shattered Long Fei's Pubes with one move, and then pulled the Dragon Spirit Blood Vein out of his blood.Geniuses instantly became trash.During the past year, he had been bullied to the point that his siblings did not like him. People outside the clan who had once flattered him laughed at him and teased him.He had also become the biggest laughing stock of the Fire Glass City.The Long family was ashamed of him.After the grand duke went into confinement, his position in the Long family plummeted. He wasn't even comparable to a servant.Three days ago.And the reason why he was sent flying with a single kick from Long Ao was because he had taken a glance at the woman beside Long Ao!It could be seen how bitter he was.Long Fei wanted to die, \"When the time comes, if you don't bring me here, now that I'm a trash, you want me to teleport here? Oh my god, are you trying to play with my rhythm?\"The god's martial continent respected martial arts.Pubes s could absorb the true qi of heaven and earth, refine their body, and break through cultivation. It was as if the Pubes was sentenced to death, unable to cultivate, and would never be able to rise above the masses.\"Even if the Pubes is intact, I, as a otaku, don't even know what it means to cultivate. If we're competing in games, I can destroy anyone who refuses to accept this with a single hand. This world doesn't even know computers, much less games.\" Long Fei forced himself to endure, and he felt waves of pain in his head.Suddenly.In his mind, there was something that was constantly flashing.This item was a gift box that was commonly seen in games.\"Playing games is too fascinating. I probably won't be able to adapt to a foreign environment all of a sudden.\" Long Fei laughed bitterly. The idea moved like it had been hit by a mouse and clicked.\"Ding!\"The gift box opened and released a game notification sound.Long Fei was shocked.\"Congratulations to host 'Long Fei' for activating 'Striking System'. Do you want to check the attributes?\"Long Fei was momentarily at a loss for words. He once again looked seriously at the furnishings in the room, and muttered to himself. \"Impossible, this is a real world, how could it be a game?\"Although he could not believe it, the idea still moved, \"Check!\"A game interface appeared in his mind.Player: Long FeiRank: 0 (The realms of god's martial continent, Warrior, War Master, war spirit, war chief, war elder, war emperor, war god, war king, each realm is divided into levels 1 to 9)true qi: 0 PointsSkills: Nonelucky value: NoneCharm Value: NoneStriking Value: 100 points\u2026 \u2026.A series of game attributes were all displayed in Long Fei's mind. There were a myriad of them, and there were also many things in the system that had yet to be developed.Long Fei laughed.The smile was a bit lewd and even a bit lewd.\"I don't know how to cultivate and break through to the next level, but to play this game, I'm a pro. I was unrivalled in my previous life, who would dare to fight me in this world?\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"Your father's life will be great in the future!\"Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

His eyes were as clear as spring water and were suffused with spirit energy. His clothes were gold in proportion, but because she was young and had yet to fully mature, she would definitely be a devastatingly beautiful beauty if given a few more years.The servant was called Jojo.It was because Long Fei's parents were missing and his personality was a little eccentric, he made Jojo accompany him.They grew up together.When Long Fei was still a genius, she was unknown. Long Fei's blood vein was pulled out, his Dantian?was broken, and he was relegated by the family to a thatched hut at the foot of the mountain. She had followed him the entire time, wholeheartedly taking care of Long Fei.In this year, if not for Jojo taking care of him, Long Fei would have died a long time ago.Long Fei was very grateful. Although he was not the Long Fei of the past, those memories told him that this girl was the person who was truly good to him in this world.One of the few.It could also be considered his only family member in this alternate world.Long Fei had an indescribable extravagant hope for relatives. In his previous life, he was an orphan, and had no parents since he was young, and didn't even have a single relative by his side. Now that he had relatives by his side, he would cherish them with all his might.Long Fei lightly nodded, \"Mn.\"At this moment.\"Clang!\"The door to the courtyard was kicked open.\"Jojo, today is the deadline. Let's see where else you can hide!\" A rough voice sounded.In the room.Jojo's face turned cold, and she trembled in fear.Long Fei frowned, the voice sounded familiar, \"Li San?\"One of the Long family's chores.Jojo nodded her head, \"He is here to collect his debts.\"\"Collect money?\" Long Fei didn't understand much about these things, he had never cared about the matters of life, and had always taken care of them for Jojo. However, from what he knew, this Li San was extremely lustful, and it would take more than one or two days for him to fall for Jojo's beauty.Jojo said in a low voice: \"A few days ago, you were knocked out by Long Ao, so I borrowed from him to buy some medicine for you to treat. I originally said that I would exchange money in three months, but I don't know why it became three days on the bill, today is the final deadline.\"\"Get out here right now!\" Li San's voice once again sounded out from within the courtyard. He laughed lewdly and said: \"As long as you agree to accompany me for the night, the matter of money will be fine.\"\"Of course.\"\"Jojo, I am giving you a chance, don't fail to appreciate my kindness! In the past, Long Fei was a genius and he was able to protect you, but now, he is a trash, a trash who has brought shame to the Long family, and the entire Long family is eager for him to die. If you follow him, you will only be affected, if you follow me, I will definitely cherish you well.\"\"Hahaha \u00a1\"Long Fei was instantly enraged.A small handyman dared to bully him.\"F * ck!\"Long Fei scolded, he immediately rushed out of the room and said: \"Li San, I think you are tired of living, a lowly subordinate actually dares to bully my, Long Fei's, people.\"Li San was startled, then sneered: \"Oh, you still think you're the genius of the Long family? You are only trash now, a trash with the broken Dantian,?who do you think you are?They did not place Long Fei in their eyes at all.In the Long family, no one put Long Fei in their eyes.Because he was a cripple whose Dantian had shattered and was forever unable to stand up.\"Cluck, cluck \u00a1\"Long Fei clenched his fists tightly, and his teeth chattered loudly.Li San mocked: \"You're angry, I'm so scared, come, come hit me, let's see if a trash like you can touch the corner of my clothes.\"Jojo immediately pulled Long Fei and shook her head, saying: \"Young Master, he is a Level 1 Warrior, his cultivation is above yours, we cannot fight against him.\"A Level 1 Warrior was this arrogant?That's right.Because Long Fei was Level 0, which meant that he had no Level.He was not a match for Li San at all.That was why he was so arrogant.Li San loudly mocked, \"What's wrong? Scared? \"You don't dare to come, you piece of trash. I can kill you with one hand, and yet you dare to act so arrogantly in front of me. Hmph, you overestimate yourself.\"Anger was raging.Being bullied to such an extent, Long Fei could not hold back.\"Jojo, it's time to return the money, you have to either return the money or accompany me for the night, or else, you know my methods, of course I won't hit you, you are such a delicate little beauty, how can I bear to hit you, but this trash, Long Fei, hehe \u00a1\" Li San stared at Jojo's cute little face.Jojo glanced at Long Fei, and took one final step.At this moment.Long Fei held onto Jojo, and said slightly: \"As long as I am here, no one in this world can bully you.\"Finished.Long Fei took a step forward and walked under the eaves, then stepped on a toad that had crawled out of a cave just now, its head filled with a bloody groove.\"Baji!\"\"Caw!\"The toad let out a blood-curdling screech, its internal organs bursting out from under its stomps.It was also at this time.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing the toad. You have received 10 EXP and 0 true qi.\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for triggering 'Striking Attribute' to reveal the divine skill 'Toading Skill'. Do you wish to cultivate it?\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for levelling up. Current Level: Level 1 Warrior.\"Three hoops sounded.Long Fei moved, \"Cultivate!\"Then.Unable to hold back his rage any longer, his body sank heavily onto the muddy ground, and strange cries echoed from his throat.\"Young Master!\" Jojo's face changed.Li San laughed wildly, \"Trash, even if you kneel down to me, it's useless. Today, I must obtain Jojo, this little beauty is \u00a1.\"Not waiting for him to finish.Long Fei's body shot out like a cannonball.\"Boom!\"It instantly crashed onto Li San's abdomen. Li San's body caved in, and his eyeballs were about to pop out. He couldn't even make a sound of pain, and was sent flying.\"Boom!\"He hit the mud wall, causing it to collapse.Long Fei stepped right on Li San's face, causing Kong Kim to glare at him, he shouted coldly: \"You dog, you dare be so arrogant in front of me, huh?\"Li San was in so much pain that his internal organs were about to split open, but he was still as powerful as before, and said: \"Long Fei, you better apologize to me, or else, I will immediately report to Dragon General that I'm his nephew.\"Do you think you can live?\" Long Fei revealed a cold smile.Li San's eyes trembled, and said: \"You, this trash, dare to kill me? My uncle won't let you go. \"When the dumbstruck Jojo heard that Long Fei wanted to kill Li San, she immediately came back to his senses and said: \"Young master, if he dies, Long Da Yao won't let us go.\"Li San said, \"Trash, did you hear that? \"If you dare to kill me, I \u00a1\"\"Bam!\"This punch also used the power of the Toading Skill, and directly smashed Li San's head to pieces. Fresh blood spurted out and splattered on Long Fei's face, and a flash of lightning reflected Long Fei's reaper's face as he coldly said: \"The person who threatens me only has one outcome, die!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

One type uses one's strength to launch an attack, and the other type uses the true qi to launch an attack.\"Oh my god!\"Long Fei was completely shocked by the properties of the Toading Skill, \"I've been playing online games for a few years already, and I've only cultivated a few divine skills, but I never would have thought that I would be able to bring out a divine skill after killing a toad in this different world. This time, your father's life in a foreign world is going to be great. \"\"Awesome!\"\"Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!\" Long Fei looked at Striking Value, \"Looks like it requires a hundred points to activate the Striking Attribute, killing a person would give you ten points of power. It looks like in the future, if you offend me, I'll send all of them to Hades.\"At the same time.Long Fei moved and ordered: \"Accept.\"In his mind, there was a box shining with red light. moved his hand and the box opened.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for training 'Basic Sword Art'.\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for learning 'Alchemy Technique'.\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for training 'Refining Technics'.\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for training 'Engraving Formation'.\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for training the 'Talisman Technique'.\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for training 'beastmastery'.\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for learning 'Puppet Technique'.\"\u00a1 \u00a1.He had practiced a series of beginner cultivation techniques.He had practiced all?the?supporting jobs of?god's martial continent?and cultivated them automatically.Long Fei looked at all the Auxiliary Method s.Cultivation Method: Alchemy TechniqueGrade: Yellow Rank Level 1 (Can be leveled up, proficiency leveled up, Grade leveled up)Consumption: 10 true qi (The higher the grade, the greater the consumption.)proficiency: 0/100Prompt: Beginner Alchemy Technique can only refine low quality pellets, if you want to refine high quality pellets, you can only raise proficiency s. The higher the level of the proficiency s, the higher the level of the pellets you can refine.The other Auxiliary Method were all the same.Long Fei laughed out loud, \"Other people need their talent in order to cultivate, but Alchemy requires one's talent in fire. In order to create an array, one needs their talent in nature, and beast taming requires one's talent in affinity \u00a1 However, I do not need anything, I only need the proficiency, like the skills in the game, as long as the proficiency rises in level, the skill will level up, give me enough time, any master refiners, any master refiners, any master of Alchemy, all will be trampled to death by me. \"\"Awesome, too fucking cool.\"Looking at Long Fei, she laughed and talked to herself, she was like a madman.Jojo felt unfamiliar, and looked at Long Fei seriously. He was still the same young master, but his face had regained the confidence he had a year ago. She was still a little worried as she asked: \"Young Master, are you alright?\"Long Fei regained his senses, excitedly hugged Jojo and heavily kissed her cheeks, saying: \"Jojo, our good days are about to come.\"Jojo's entire body seemed to have been struck by lightning, her body tightened up and her eyes became lifeless. After a long time, she was still unable to recover her senses and her heart was pounding like a little deer, \"Young Master kissed me, Young Master kissed me \u00a1\"Her face turned bright red, as if she was a ripe apple.\"What are you doing in a daze for, come and help.\" Long Fei looked at the dumbstruck Jojo, and urged her on.He had to get rid of Li San's body.Long Dayao would find out sooner or later.However \u00a1Before he realised it, Long Fei had quickly made himself stronger.After the corpse was taken care of, Jojo was still worried: \"Young Master, Li San is Long Dayao's nephew. Every day, he would report to his uncle about your situation.\"\"Huh?\"\"Then Li San sent someone to monitor me?\" Long Fei laughed coldly, \"Then Li San should die even more.\"Jojo asked: \"If he doesn't get Li San's report, he will definitely come to find you personally. At that time \u00a1\"Long Fei said: \"Don't worry, we still have one night to prepare. Jojo, here is two hundred silver, find a place to hide in the city and don't come out until I return.\"Jojo seemed to have sensed something, as she immediately grabbed onto the corner of Long Fei's clothes and said: \"Young Master, do you want to abandon Jojo?\"It made Long Fei's heart ache as he watched. \"How could I abandon you, I'll go out and cultivate for at most a year, and at most half a year, I'll definitely return. Long Family has too many things that I haven't done yet, and there are still some people that deserve to die, others that haven't been killed!\"He had to become strong.The entire Long Family was eyeing him covetously. He was only a level two Warrior, if he stayed in the capital, he would only be in danger.You have to know that he is the successor to the Long Family.It was an order from the Grand Elder himself in the Long Family's ancestral hall.His Dragon Spirit Blood Vein was being absorbed, his Pubes was being broken, his veins were knotted, all of these were part of his plan, although Long Fei did not have any proof, but he was sure that this had something to do with the higher ups of the Long Family.Now that he was able to cultivate, if they were to discover him, they would definitely come and deal with him. He had to leave.He would come back after he became stronger and clean up one by one!Jojo nodded her head with tears in her eyes. She couldn't stop Long Fei, and she had no reason to. She wanted to follow Long Fei, but she was worried that she would burden him.\"Jojo, I will definitely come back.\"\"Rumble \u00a1\"Heavy rain poured down.The two of them left Long Family amidst the rain. Jojo bought a small courtyard in the Western City slum and hid himself.Long Fei braved the heavy rain and left the west side of the city, heading towards the Yunlan Mountain.\u00a1 \u00a1.Prince's Estate.\"My lord, we just received news, Long Fei left the Fire Glass City from the west side of the city, and headed towards the Fire Glass Mountain Range, should we send someone there?\"The old housekeeper did not continue.Nangong Lei raised his eyebrows slightly and pondered for a few seconds, then said: \"He's already a piece of trash, to be able to enter the Fire Glass Mountain Range would only mean his death, and will not affect Yan'er's future.\"The old butler nodded and said no more.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They had died in the depths of the Fire Glass Mountain Range, and even the Long Family's heirloom and dragon salyer had disappeared along with it.Because of this, Long Family's vitality was severely injured.The dragon salyer was created from the refinement of the Dragon Spirit Blood after Long Zhantian slaughtered the Dragon God. It was the most important treasure of the Long Family and was also the godly weapon of all previous Dragon God Warrior. It was also the symbol of the Dragon God's Warrior.So many years had passed.Long Family had never given up on searching for dragon salyer. However, after thousands of years, countless people entered the Fire Glass Mountain Range, and very few came out alive. There was not even the slightest bit of news regarding dragon salyer.\u00a1 \u00a1.After a day and a half of trekking, Long Fei finally arrived at the foot of the mountain of Huo Li. Looking at the imposing Huo Li Mountain that was like a ferocious beast from the abyss, Long Fei clenched his fists and said, \"We'll begin the journey of levelling up from here.\"And then \u00a1Long Fei dived in head first.In Fire Glass Mountain Range, demon beasts ran rampant.Demon beasts were divided into levels one to nine. Above level nine was a divine beast, and above that was a sacred beast.Their physiques were incomparably strong, able to shatter mountains and break water. In these deep mountains, they were kings, and humans were invaders to them.Seeing humans meant that they were crazily pursuing them.Similarly.This was also a paradise for adventurers.The spiritual energy in the mountain range was very dense. Spiritual Treasures of the Heaven and Earth were nurtured here, Spirit Grasses were nurtured here, and Demonic Cores were produced in the bodies of Level 5 and above demon beasts. These were all supreme treasures.In addition, there were even more mysterious ruins. As long as one was able to find one, they would be able to soar into the heavens.Long Fei's goal was very simple.Upgrade!He did not go into the depths of the mountain range to hunt demon beasts. Instead, he went out of the mountain range to hunt wild beasts.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing 'Wild Rabbit' for obtaining 10 EXP.\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing 'Wild Chicken' for obtaining 10 EXP.\"\u00a1 \u00a1.\"In the game, I'm still a newbie, so of course a newbie would want to kill these monsters that don't have any attack power.\" Long Fei was not bored by killing these little wild beasts.

Currently at Level 4 Warrior.\"\"Level 4!\"\"Not yet, my strength is still not enough.\" Long Fei could feel his own strength, and at the same time, he could see that the attack power released by the Toading Skill was not strong enough.\"Break through again!\"Ten days later.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for levelling up. Currently Level 5 Warrior.\"\"Level 5!\"Long Fei closed his eyes and felt his strength. The power of a level 5 Warrior was much stronger than that of a level 4 Warrior, and then he checked the damage of the Toading Skill. He opened his eyes wide: \"It's time to challenge a low level demon beast.Behind him was a large group of hare and pheasant corpses.At the same time he killed these wild hare chickens, he released 'Basic Sword Art' and 'Toading Skill' every time he attacked.His?Basic Sword Art had already reached the third level.The cooldown time of the Toading Skill was long, adding on the fact that ten thousand proficiency were required to level up, he still had five thousand proficiency and was still five thousand away from breaking through.\"Head deeper in.\"Along the way, Long Fei did not miss a single bit of experience, not even a single mosquito.Half a month later.Long Fei's cultivation had already broke through to the sixth level of Warrior, and at this time, he had already completely entered the hinterland of Fire Glass Mountain Range.\"The atmosphere isn't right.\"After entering the hinterland, the air was filled with a dangerous aura. It was fine for a level six Warrior to deal with a level 1 monster, but if they met one, they could only wait to die.Thus \u00a1Long Fei was even more careful.Suddenly.\"Roar!\"A Ash Wolf that was as tall as a human, with hair all over its body that looked like steel needles pounced forward. Its two dark green glowing eyes stared at Long Fei as its two fangs glinted with a cold light, and saliva dripped down from the gaps of its teeth.wuaoo \u00a1 *Suddenly, he roared, he leapt up and pounced down, directly biting towards Long Fei's neck.\"F * ck!\"\"If you want to eat laozi's meat, laozi would like to eat yours as well.\" If you want to eat laozi's meat, laozi would like to eat your meat as well.\"Toading Skill!\"Long Fei suddenly dropped to the ground, his four limbs spread out like a toad, and started croaking in his throat, not waiting for the Ash Wolf to land, before he sprung up.\"Boom!\"It shot out like a cannonball.\"Bam!\"After striking the Ash Wolf's abdomen, the Ash Wolf let out a painful scream. Long Fei took out another large staff and smashed it down onto the Ash Wolf's head with all his strength.\"Bam.\"\"Awoooo \u00a1\"The Ash Wolf's brain burst open. Its eyes rolled back as it fell to the ground, twitching a few times. Its eyes rolled back as it thought, \"Die!\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing 'Ash Wolf' for obtaining 100 experience points, 10 true qi and 1 Energy Values.\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for gaining wolf skin.\"\"Hahaha \u00a1\" Long Fei smiled excitedly, \"Killing wild beasts for a month would only give a pitiful amount of experience. Killing demon beasts will give you true qi value and Energy Values.\"And then \u00a1Long Fei looked at his own attributes.Player: Long FeiRank: Sixth Warriortrue qi: 90 points (Level Increase, increase in true qi)Skills: Toading Skill, Basic Sword Artlucky value: 0 pointsCharm Value: 0 pointsStriking Value: 11 points.\u00a1 \u00a1.A series of attributes appeared in Long Fei's mind, and he said to himself: \"As expected, Energy Values is Striking Value. Killing a person can give ten points of Striking Value, killing a demon beast can give a bit of Energy Values.\"\"Killing people is ten times more difficult than killing Monstrous Beasts, but the number of Monstrous Beasts are a hundred times, a thousand times more difficult. In this mountain range, there are countless Monstrous Beasts.\"\"Wow!\"\"I can't wait.\"Long Fei's blood started to boil.Killing a toad would reveal a Divine level cultivation technique, but killing a Goblin Beast would result in the death of a holy artifact.\"Hahaha \u00a1\"\"Continue fighting.\"Long Fei was an expert at gaming, but he was also his favorite. His record was made up in the Internet Cafe seven days and seven nights in a row, where he never logged off and rushed to the top of the game's fighting leaderboard. However, at that time, he was only chasing after his sister, but in the end, his sister ran off with a Money Player, and in his fury, he killed that Money Player and returned to the Beginner Village.None of this is the point.The important point was that Long Fei could be very tough, and be strong for a very long time.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing 'Level One Python' for obtaining 100 experience, 10 true qi and 1 Energy Values.\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing 'Level 1 Tiger Leaper' for obtaining 100 EXP, 10 true qi and 1 Energy Values.\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing 'Long Arm Ape' for obtaining 100 experience, true qi x10, Energy Values x1.\"For an entire three days and three nights, Long Fei did not rest for even a second, and continued to hunt demon beasts.Finally.When he killed the 'Long Arm Ape', the system's notification sound rang out.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for filling up the Striking Energy Value!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This time, he wanted to find a secondary demon beast.\"Right, it's time to test the?secondary demon beast.\" Long Fei made up his mind, and then carefully walked forward.After walking for around an hour, Long Fei felt that something was not right, because he did not discover any demon beast in the surroundings.This silence was terrifying.In addition to the gloomy forest, the sky was dark, giving off an even more terrifying atmosphere.Suddenly.A strange fragrance floated out, Long Fei tensed up and immediately said secretly: \"Spirit Fruit of Heaven and Earth?\"He had already stayed in Fire Glass Mountain Range for two months but he had never smelled such a strange fragrance. He dared to use his virginity for twenty years to guarantee that this was definitely not a perfume used by women.In this incomparably dangerous mountain range, there was only one possibility for the fragrance to emit; it was the spirit fruit bred by heaven and earth.However!This kind of Spirit Fruit of Heaven and Earth would definitely have a divine beast protecting them.\"divine beast!\"\"If it can use Striking Energy Value to explode, then it must be \u00a1 It feels so good. \" Long Fei was excited, but the risk and the reward were always proportional.The greater the reward, the greater the risk.Long Fei slowly approached them and stopped in a patch of shrubbery. He used some leaf juice to cover his entire body and smeared mud on his face. There were a few tree branches stuck on his back. After doing all this, Long Fei did not move. He looked at the deep hole in the valley in the distance, and from time to time, a red light flashed out. \"This is definitely a place where Spirit Fruit of Heaven and Earth are nurtured, and it's probably going to mature soon.\"He was waiting.Because he had yet to see the Guard Divine Beast.Moreover.He believed that when this kind of Spirit Fruit of Heaven and Earth was born, other demon beasts would definitely come to fight for it.He wanted to be a fisherman.He could only be a fisherman, but with his cultivation, he would only be courting death.One day passed.The Guard Divine Beast still had not appeared.The contestant did not appear as well, causing Long Fei to be unable to sit still.The red light in the cave became even more intense, with rings on top of each other. The entire valley was filled with a strange fragrance, and just a slight sniff was enough to make people feel refreshed.The next day passed.It was the same, no Guard Divine Beast had appeared.Long Fei thought in his heart: \"Could it be that no divine beast found out? Or is there a Guard Divine Beast inside the cave? \"The struggle and entanglement in his heart was like two people fighting each other. In the end, reason won, but he still held it in and lay down motionlessly.On the third day.Dark clouds billowed in the sky, and thunder rumbled nonstop while the thunderclouds remained motionless above the valley.Suddenly.A bolt of lightning struck down. A snake with two horns on its head charged out of the cloud layer. It then soared into the air and directly landed at the mouth of the cave.\"Damn, Flood Dragon!\"Long Fei was shocked, \"This damn Absolute Monarch Sanctuary is a level nine Peak Demon Beast, they could even be called divine beast. I wouldn't know if they came or not, but they almost scared me to death the moment they arrived.\"It had four claws, and a horn on its head. Its body was like a snake's, and it hadn't yet fully evolved. If it were to evolve another step, it would be a dragon!It definitely wanted the Spirit Fruit of Heaven and Earth in the cave to break through its shackles and turn into a dragon.The moment the flood dragon descended.The earth shook and the mountains shook as a white light flashed out from the cave. When the white light fell onto the ground, a snow-white White Wolf stood at the entrance of the cave, emitting some light rays from its body, as if it was a shining weapon in a game.At this moment.The Flood Dragon and White Wolf looked at each other.Deafening thunder rumbled continuously in the sky, as if the two of them were fighting with mind.Long Fei lowered his body even further, he was extremely calm in his heart. He looked at the system and discovered that their bodies were glowing with a gold light, \"Boss!\"In the game, only Bosses would emit a golden light.\"Gudong!\"Long Fei swallowed his breath and prayed excitedly: \"Let's start, let's start, let's start quickly.\"He couldn't wait any longer.Maybe because of Long Fei's prayer, the flood dragon suddenly attacked and a water type attack was released.A huge wind blade in the shape of a half moon came slashing down.The White Wolf was not afraid, there was a shield on its body, the shield covering its entire body, after that, it suddenly leaped, flew into the air, and opened its mouth to bite the dragon's head.\"Bang, bang, bang \u00a1\"\"Boom, boom, boom \u00a1\"The two Peak Demon Beasts fought intensely, causing the earth to shake. All the demon beasts within a radius of thousands of kilometers ran out, afraid of being drawn in.To Long Fei, it was simply a battle between gods.The slightest force could grind him into powder.They fought from day to night and from night to dawn. They fought non-stop for an entire day and night.The scales on the flood dragon's body fell and there were scratches everywhere. The White Wolf's body was drenched in fresh blood and wounds were everywhere. No one had managed to gain anything from this one day and night of fighting.Long Fei was alarmed.Hu hu hu hu \u00a1.Hu hu hu hu \u00a1.Both the dragon and White Wolf were breathing heavily, feeling extremely tired.Long Fei was still lying in wait. Once they gained enough power, they could kill him.At this moment.\"Buzz!\"A red light burst out from the cave.The red light pierced through the mountain and soared into the sky.\"The spirit fruit has ripened.\" Long Fei frowned. He knew that the time for the victor to be decided had come.\"Boom \u00a1\"The Flood Dragon suddenly moved, exploding forth with all of its power, and directly attacked the White Wolf.It couldn't wait.The White Wolf was the same, it couldn't wait either. After the Spirit Fruit of Heaven and Earth matured, there was only a short time to pick it, and if it missed the time, it would fall to the ground and turn to ashes.wuaoo \u00a1 *The White Wolf ferociously roared and heavily clashed against it.At this moment.The flood dragon's body suddenly split into two.\"Illusion Beast?\"Long Fei was shocked, he then suddenly rushed out and shouted, \"Its true body is on your right side!\"The White Wolf seemed to understand what was going on, it turned its body and slapped down with its two claws.\"Hiss \u00a1\"The dragon suddenly moved, it screamed in pain, then opened its mouth wide and bit down on the White Wolf's body.\"Awoooo \u00a1\"The White Wolf let out a scream as well, and he bit down.The two Peak Demon Beasts bit on it tightly, neither of them letting go.\"An opportunity!\"Long Fei used all of his strength to run in front of the two big BOSSes. He took a quick look at their health, and saw that the dragon's health was lower than the others.\"I don't care!\"\"Let's kill you first!\"\"Toading Skill!\"Long Fei immediately released his Toading Skill, and used it this time.His body fell to the ground and suddenly crashed into the flood dragon's jaw. The flood dragon's teeth fell off and it let out a blood-curdling screech.At this moment.The hidden attack of the Toading Skill was triggered.\"Bind him!\"\"Shua!\"The flood dragon's body suddenly shrunk. Its internal organs had all been destroyed by a single burst of energy, and the remaining blood had all been used up.Its huge body fell down, its two lantern-like eyes stared straight at Long Fei, and died with grievance.At this moment.The system sounded out.Long Fei tightened her chrysanthemum and released her Striking Energy Value, \"Go berserk!\"\"Ding!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This feeling was too great, too wonderful, it was simply too wonderful to describe.He leveled up five levels consecutively and directly became a level two War Master.After obtaining the three types of Demonic Core, these Demonic Core were all at the peak of the ninth level.However.The three attribute Demonic Core s were still lacking when compared to the divine skill 'dragon salyer technique', however \u2026 All of these added up together didn't feel as good as the holy artifact and dragon salyer.Weapon: dragon salyerRank: holy artifact (Incomplete)Weight: 13,000 jinDamage: SSS RankDescription: The holy artifact s that kill demons have 200% attack power against evil beings, 500% attack power against dragons, comes with a 'Dragon Slaughter Strike' concealing technique, Activation Rate, 1%.A raging dragon was coiled on the back of the saber. The blade was pitch-black, and its blade was as sharp as snow. The hilt was engraved with a dragon pattern, and its entire body exuded a domineering aura.Who could contend against such a thing?It was not a blade at all, but an angry dragon roaring.However.The beauty of the blade was that it was broken, only half of it remained.This was because it was incomplete.However \u2026To have such attributes just from being incomplete, how powerful would it be if it were perfected? It was hard to imagine.\"Ding!\"\"Trigger Hidden Quest!\"\"Mission: Repair the dragon salyer.\"\"Mission level: S\"\"Quest time limit: One year\"\"task reward: 1 million Experience Points, 10 thousand true qi, increase the Dragon Slaughter Strike's Activation Rate to 10%, the secret of the dragon salyer!\"\"First clue of the mission, Nangong Imperial Clan.\"\u2026 \u2026.\"Damn!\"\"Additional rewards?\" It actually triggered a Hidden Quest, and it's an [S] class one. This is the sound of you waking up, hahaha!\" Long Fei was so excited that he was about to go berserk.Everything had happened too suddenly.It made him feel as if he was dreaming.Looking at the dragon salyer in his mind, the idea moved, wanting to take it out to play.\"Ding!\"\"My wrist is not strong enough, I can't use it.\"\"I'll go!\"Long Fei was annoyed, he looked at the dragon salyer s and saw that their strength had reached 99 points, he only had 50, When can I use this, no, I have to level up quickly, the dragon salyer s are the treasures of my Long Family, with this guy, I want to see who in the Long Family would dare to fart in front of me, to be disrespectful to me, kill him with one slash. \"The dragon salyer disappeared from the Fire Glass Mountain Range, and for thousands of years, the Long Family did not manage to find it. However, the reverence the disciples had towards the dragon salyer never disappeared, and it was instead because they lost even more respect.It represented the ancestors, it represented the legacy!Now that he had found the dragon salyer, he was the master of the Long Family!The dragon salyer could not bear it, so Long Fei moved, \"Cultivate.\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for training 'dragon salyer technique'.\"Skill Path: dragon salyer techniqueGrade: Divine LevelDamage: [S] class.Description: The dragon salyer technique has seven forms. The skin, tendons, bones, blood, spirit, soul and slay will all be released at the same time. Each form will accumulate a layer of blade energy and can unleash 500% of the 'dragon chop' 'damage when accumulated to the seventh level.Description 2: dragon salyer technique combined with dragon salyer, damage increased by twofold.\"Awesome!\"Looking at the attribute of the 'dragon salyer technique', Long Fei could only say the word \"awesome\".Next.Long Fei had completely fused the three Demonic Core 'Wind Attribution, Illusion Attribution, and Water Attribution'.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for increasing your comprehension of 'Wind Attribution' by 10%.\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for increasing your comprehension of 'Illusion Attribution' by 10%.\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for increasing your comprehension of 'Water Attribution' by 10%.\"It was not much, just an increase of 10%. However, do not underestimate this 10%, as long as Long Fei cultivates these three types of cultivation techniques, their power would increase, his training speed would also increase, and his defense towards these three types of attributes would increase by 10%.\"Berserk, this is too cool.\"Long Tian gave a comfortable moan. This kind of feeling was enough to explode.It was also at this moment.The White Wolf stared at him, causing Long Fei to feel a wave of pressure. He immediately recovered and saw the White Wolf looking at him with a begging gaze.At this time.After bleeding profusely from the bottom of the White Wolf, Long Fei looked at its stomach and said with a face of shock, \"It's really giving birth to a wolf cub.\"After fighting with the Flood Dragon for an entire day and night, the White Wolf had sustained serious injuries and even moved its birthplace, causing it to have a difficult time giving birth now.The White Wolf looked at Long Fei, then looked at the cave again.Long Fei asked tentatively: \"You want me to use the spirit fruit to save you?\"The White Wolf nodded, then shook its head and looked at its own butt.Long Fei asked again: \"You want me to save your child?\"The White Wolf immediately nodded.Long Fei did not hesitate, and said to himself: \"For so many treasures to be able to be dropped, even the dragon salyer had to thank you for them, I will help you obtain them.\"If not for the White Wolf, Long Fei would never have been able to kill it and reveal so many good things.He was a grateful man.After rushing into the cave, the Spirit Fruit of Heaven and Earth was glowing with a red light. It had matured completely, and it was the right time to pick it. Long Fei quickly took it off, and did not use the system to check the attributes of the Spirit Fruit of Heaven and Earth, he was worried that he would not be able to endure the temptation.As he ran out of the cave, the White Wolf was already on the verge of death, his entire body was drenched in blood, Xiao Bai Lang's entire body was wrapped in a blood film, if he struggled slightly, he was also on the verge of death.\"Save \u2026 Save \u2026 Save my child.\" The White Wolf's resounded in Long Fei's mind.There was only one Spirit Fruit of Heaven and Earth, so Long Fei could not help but ask: \"What about you?\"The White Wolf still said: \"Save \u2026 Save \u2026 Save my child.\"Even if Spirit Fruit of Heaven and Earth gave it to her, she wouldn't be able to live. In order to protect her child, she had given up her chance to live.This was motherhood.Long Fei decisively picked Xiao Bai up the wolf and cleaned off the blood on his body, allowing the Spirit Fruit of Heaven and Earth to enter his mouth slowly.The White Wolf looked at Long Fei and laughed, \"Thank you!\"Then.Her body stiffened and she died.At this time.After Xiao Bai wolfed down the Spirit Fruit of Heaven and Earth, he miraculously recovered and licked Long Fei's arm, nestling into Long Fei's embrace. A strand of idea entered Long Fei's mind, \"Master!\"Instantly.The system sounded out.\"Ding!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You have received 100 experience and 10 true qi Points as a reward.\"war pet: Little White Wolf\u00a0(Young)Rank: divine beastDescription: Possesses the unparalleled power of the Wolf King and is capable of summoning packs of wolves for its use.\"I'll go!\"\"divine beast, his mother is also only a ninth level demon beast, yet he is a divine beast. Is it because of the Spirit Fruit of Heaven and Earth?\" Long Fei was shocked.It was extremely difficult for a level nine demon beast to advance to a Divine Level demon beast.When Little White Wolf was just born, the Spirit Fruit of Heaven and Earth that he had swallowed had directly levelled up to become a divine beast. The strength of this Spirit Fruit of Heaven and Earth was simply too strong.However \u2026Luckily, Long Fei did not eat it greedily, otherwise, his current cultivation level would not be able to withstand the energy of the Spirit Fruit of Heaven and Earth and would directly cause his body to explode.Little White Wolf snuggled in Long Fei's embrace, sound asleep sweet, completely letting Long Fei go in front of his mother.Long Fei also smiled faintly as he muttered to himself, \"From today onwards, you are my, Long Fei's, brother. I will take care of you for the rest of your life.\"He said to the mother of White Wolf, \"You can go now. I won't let anyone bully Little White Wolf.\"Bullying the divine beast?How many people in this world could bully divine beast?Even if he didn't bully anyone, he would still burn incense.Of course.Little White Wolf was still a baby so even if he had a divine beast's rank, it would still be useless. He needed to grow, and just like Long Fei, he needed to break through and level up.Long Fei placed Little White Wolf\u00a0into the war pet space, and curled his body, continuing his deep sleep.\"Upgrade, upgrade!\"\"Let's upgrade everything that can be upgraded.\"The most important thing was still to level up.If he wanted to pick up the dragon salyer, the only way was to level up. Only with Level Increase would he be able to raise his wrist strength and pick up the thirteen thousand pound dragon salyer.\u2026 \u2026.\"Boom!\"\"Toading Skill, strangle him!\"\"Bam!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing 'Iron Beetle' for obtaining 90 experience, true qi + 9, Energy Values + 1.\"\"dragon salyer technique.\"\"First move, Skin Opening.\"Using the rod as a blade and instigated by the true qi, he chopped down with the rod, heavily striking the body of a demon beast. At the same time, a layer of blade Qi that could only be seen by Long Fei was accumulated on the rod.That demon beast's skin and flesh was cut open, and it was instantly killed.\"Ding!\"\"proficiency + 1\"\"Huff \u2026\" Long Fei sweated profusely, his entire body seemed to be exhausted, the dragon salyer technique exhausted all of his mental energy and physical strength, the true qi, but its injuries were simply off the charts.\"No matter what, I have to keep cultivating. The higher the skill level, the greater the damage.\"Pain and happiness.Long Fei continued to kill. As his cultivation increased, he started to kill secondary demon beast. Every time he made a move, he released the 'Basic Sword Art'.Then came the 'Toading Skill', followed by the 'dragon salyer technique'.The proficiency's skill improved bit by bit.Five months later.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for levelling up.

Even a servant like Li San dared to bully him.Furthermore, he was laughed at by the other noble disciples in Fire Glass City.These scenes kept repeating in his mind.In this half a year in Fire Glass Mountain Range, Long Fei had been telling himself everyday that he had to desperately cultivate, fight his way back, and make those who had mocked him kneel down and sing of \"Conquest\".\u2026 \u2026.At night.Long Fei lit up the bonfire. Baking the demon beast meat, a burnt fragrance spread out, sprinkling some salt and pepper.\"Gu gu \u2026\"Little White Wolf was snuggled up to Long Fei, his two eyes drooled as they stared at the grilled meat on the grill, not even blinking.After five months of growth, Little White Wolf's level did not increase at all. However, he had gotten fatter due to Long Fei, becoming chubby.\"Alright!\"Long Fei said as he prepared to take down the barbecue on the fire.Suddenly.A white shadow flashed beside him.He grabbed the piece of roasted meat with his mouth, bit on it, and swallowed it.He didn't feel any burning sensation at all.After eating, he wagged his tail, looked at Long Fei with his two big eyes, and laughed: \"Master, I want more.\"\"You glutton!\"\"Good things are not for you to eat like that. You have to taste them bit by bit.\"Little White Wolf\u00a0nodded fiercely.Long Fei laughed faintly, and then carried the second piece of roasted meat.The weight of the roast meat was even heavier than his body. Long Fei was really curious how Little White Wolf managed to eat it, and where did the roast meat go, he still had the same stomach.divine beast?In my opinion, he is simply a glutton divine beast!After continuously eating more than ten pieces of roasted meat, Xiao Bai was finally satisfied and he ran to Long Fei's war pet space to sleep again.He would sleep after eating.\"What kind of wolf is this? He's just like a pig.\" Long Fei scolded as he raised his head to look at the night sky. There was a girl in his mind, Jojo.\"I wonder how you're doing.\"\"Jojo, wait for me. I'll be back soon.\"It was time to go back.\u2026 \u2026.Fire Glass City, the slums on the west side of the city.\"Reporting to the general director, Jojo that girl is definitely in this slums area. She definitely knows where that trash, Long Fei, is hiding.\" A guard from Long Family reported with another surname.Long Dayao's body was a little fat, but his cultivation was not low. He had reached the Eight-level Warrior, and trained in a technique unique to Long Family, his strength comparable to the ninth level of War Master's Peak Realm.Long Dayao frowned, \"Find Jojo for me.\"\"Long Fei, you piece of trash actually dared to kill my nephew. Don't let me find you, or else I will make you beg for death!\"\u2026 \u2026.Fire Glass Mountain Range, dark clouds covered the moon.Suddenly.A deep voice resounded from the forest.\"Search this area.\"\"They're all under the effects of the sleeping incense. They definitely won't be able to get far.\"\"Little beauties of the Heaven Sect, come out obediently. I will definitely treat you well, hahaha \u2026\"\u2026 \u2026.Long Fei opened his eyes: \"Who?\"Suddenly.A cold sword rested against his neck, \"Don't say anything, otherwise I'll kill you!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Opening his eyes, he saw a cold sword placed around his neck. Immediately, the chrysanthemum in his body tightened.\"Don't say anything!\"\"I promise I won't talk.\" Long Fei immediately said, the cold sword was just at the artery of his neck, if he cut it down, his life would be gone.Even if he could keep his life, it wouldn't be good to leave a scar on his neck.\"Didn't you hear me tell you not to talk?\" The lady's forehead was drenched in cold sweat, her eyes staring straight at Long Fei, her cold sword trembling.\"Senior Sister, what should we do?\"\"The people from the Blood Refinement Sect\u00a0are about to arrive.\" Another girl said anxiously. Her forehead was also covered in cold sweat, her eyes were blurred, and her body was slightly trembling. On her back was a younger woman.It was too dark to see their faces.However \u2026Judging from their voices, they were not bad.The woman called Senior Sister said in a low voice, \"We were hit by the Blood Refinement Illusion Smoke and we only have less than 10% of our power left. If we go out, we would be discovered by people and we would have to defend this cave to the death. We can only pray that they don't find us here.\"Another woman said, \"The people from the Blood Refinement Sect\u00a0ate people without even spitting out their bones. They specially refined their blood to raise their cultivation. If they caught them \u2026\"As the woman spoke, she was so anxious that tears began to fall.This was only one of them.What they were truly afraid of was that the men from the Blood Refinement Sect\u00a0would tear their clothes and make them beg for their lives.That Senior Sister said, \"If we get caught by them, we will commit suicide. We cannot let them sully our bodies, and even more so, we cannot let them refine us into Blood Corpse.\"The Junior Sister\u00a0nodded and prayed, \"If anyone comes to save us, it'll be fine as long as they don't fall into the Blood Refinement Sect and let me repay them with my body.\"Just as they were chatting in hushed tones.Long Fei's body moved slightly, he suddenly pulled back and immediately escaped from the cold sword.The Senior Sister was startled, Long Fei's speed was very fast, adding that she only had 10% of her cultivation left, she couldn't react at all. By the time she reacted, Long Fei had already jumped to a safe distance.The Senior Sister moved her sword, pointed at Long Fei, and said: \"It's best if you don't speak, and don't move about randomly, or else \u2026\"Without waiting for her to finish, Long Fei laughed wickedly: \"Otherwise what? You have only ten percent of your power left, and you still dare to threaten me? I, Long Fei, hate being threatened the most. \"\"Long Fei?\"The Senior Sister stared blankly at him, as if she had heard of this name somewhere before, but then she said without thinking, \"Even if I had only used ten percent of my power, I could still have easily killed him \u2026\"Not waiting for him to finish.Long Fei's body moved, instantly arriving behind her, locking her by the throat, he said: \"Kill me? Who's going to kill who now? \"The other woman followed suit.However \u2026Just as she stood up, she suddenly fell down. Her face was pale and a shadow appeared in her eyes, \"Go \u2026\" Release \u2026 Let my Senior Sister go \u2026 \"Before she could finish her sentence, she fainted.\"Junior Sister...\"The voice was loud, and a voice immediately came from outside the cave, \"Senior Brother, they are inside the cave.\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"Little beauties, this young master has come. Tonight, I will definitely treat you all with care. Hahaha \u2026\"Laughter came from the forest.With a 'clang' sound, the Senior Sister fell onto the ground and said to Long Fei: \"I beg you, please kill me, kill us, I beg you \u2026 \u2026\"\"Kill women?\"\"This is not something that I, Long Fei, can do.\"There were no grievances, Long Fei was not a homicidal maniac demon, although killing people would grant him ten Energy Values, but he had his own bottom line, those who deserved to be killed must be killed.He wouldn't kill anyone he shouldn't.\"Men, go in and bring them out.\"As soon as his voice faded \u2026The two Blood Refinement Sect disciples strode towards the cave.Long Fei let go of the Senior Sister and grinned: \"Damn it, disturbing my beautiful dream and bullying women, I, your father, cannot bear to see a man who bullies women, and still uses such despicable methods.\"Long Fei walked to the cave entrance.The Senior Sister leaned on the wall, wanting to reach out to grab the sword, but she couldn't muster up any strength. Looking at Long Fei who was at the mouth of the cave, she laughed bitterly, \"If you can save us today, I'm willing to give my body to you.\"The consequences of falling into the hand of\u00a0Blood Refinement Sect would be too terrifying.It was so terrifying that she didn't dare to think about it.Her body would be tainted and toyed with by the disciples of the Blood Refinement Sect one by one. Finally, they would refine her blood and turned her into a Blood Corpse.Thinking of this, she couldn't help but tremble.Long Fei turned around and smiled, then said to the Senior Sister: \"You're the one who said this, don't go back on your words when the time comes.\"However, while he was speaking, that Senior Sister had already fainted.In that instant.The two disciples walked into the cave.Long Fei opened his bow with his fists, the power of the Toading Skill poured into his fists, \"Get out of my sight!\"\"Bang!\" \"Bam!\"Two muffled sounds rang out as the two Blood Refinement Sect disciples flew out and crashed into a large tree. Their stomachs split open and they vomited blood.Dead!\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing 'Blood Refinement Sect disciples' for obtaining 200 experience, 20 true qi and 10 Energy Values.\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing 'Blood Refinement Sect disciples' for obtaining 200 experience, 20 true qi and 10 Energy Values.\"\u2026 \u2026.Two punches, instant death!\"Senior Brother, there's an expert!\"The Blood Refinement Sect disciples quickly retreated.The Senior Brother's expression turned sinister as he said faintly, \"In the Blood Refinement Sect's business, it is best for those unrelated to scram. Otherwise, don't blame me for being impolite.\"\"F * ck you.\"\"You're welcome. I want to see who's the one that's being impolite.\" Long Fei cursed.The Blood Refinement Sect's Senior Brother flew into a rage as he took a step forward.His steps were as heavy as a thousand kilograms. With every step he took, there was a series of tremors, and Blood Evil Power appeared in his palms.The moment they entered the cave.A palm struck down, \"Die!\"However.His palm struck nothing but air. The moment he stood in the cave, he was slightly shocked. \"No one?\"There seemed to be something wrong with the ground.When he saw it with confidence, he was shocked, \"A big toad?\"\"Huh?\"\"Ahh \u2026\"Long Fei's body shot out like a cannonball, heavily smashing into the stomach of the Blood Refinement Sect's senior fellow apprentice, sending him flying.\"Rumble!\"The Senior Brother fell to the ground. He had never seen such a technique, turning him into a toad and never thought that he would be ambushed instead.He felt waves of pain in his abdomen.With great difficulty, he stood up with a pale face and said, \"You dog, if you dare to go against my Blood Refinement Sect, just state your name.\"\"Register?\"\"Let me think.\" Long Fei muttered, \"Your father is called Zhuge Jianqiang, if you have the ability then go to your father's Zhuge Mansion. If you cannot, then scram.\"\"Zhuge Mansion?\"\"One of the Great Four\u00a0Heaven Pillars of\u00a0Fire Glass Dynasty?\"The senior brother's abdomen was hurting more and more, his entire body was covered in cold sweat, and he said solemnly: \"Zhuge Jianqiang, I will remember, just you wait!\"\"Let's go!\"Finished.The Blood Refinement Sect disciples quickly retreated.\"Tch!\"\"What era is it now, yet you're still announcing your name?

He opened his eyes and stretched his arms. His slender arms were as white and flawless as two scallions. \"I slept very comfortably.\"Then.Her eyes stared blankly for a moment, \"Didn't I get hit by the Blood Refinement Art? Why am I here? \"Seeing his two senior sisters, he immediately got up and ran over to them. He shook one of them and said, \"Senior martial sister, senior martial sister, wake up! Wake up! We've probably been captured by the Blood Refinement Sect!\"The three words \"Blood Refinement Sect\" were filled with fear, and it had deeply affected their mental state.He woke up in an instant and his body slightly curled up.The eldest senior sister quickly picked up the cold sword and looked at the cave's environment. She let out a long breath and said, \"Little junior sister apprentice, you have to scare me to death. This is the cave we hid in yesterday.\"\"Huh?\"\"Was it the cave he hid in yesterday?\" The little junior sister apprentice scratched her head and said, \"Why don't I remember?\"Second Senior Sister said, \"Of course you don't remember. Before you entered the cave, you fainted. Was it not me who was carrying you all the time?\"The little junior sister apprentice immediately rushed forward and kissed Second Senior Sister heavily on the cheek. \"Second Senior Sister has treated me the best, hehe \u2026\"\"What happened last night?\" The Second Senior Sister pushed the little junior sister apprentice away and looked at the Eldest Senior Sister as she reminisced in her mind. \"I still remember that there's a kid in the cave, right?\"The eldest senior sister nodded. After thinking for a while, her head hurt a little. She said, \"Before I lost consciousness, I saw him standing at the entrance to the cave. He seemed to be protecting us. I wonder how he is.\"Little junior sister apprentice came over and asked: \"Kid, what kind of brat is he? Is he a handsome guy? \"Wow, a hero saving a beauty! How could I miss such a passionate, good show? Aiya, I'm so hateful. A hero saving a beauty. Have you all promised yourselves?\"The eldest senior sister looked at the second senior sister and laughed, \"junior sister apprentice, what did you say last night?The Second Senior Sister teased him, \"When I was unconscious, I also heard you say something like that.\"I really want to see what that brat looks like. If he's a handsome guy, then this young miss will also betroth her body to him. The three sisters will marry the same man, hehe \u2026 \"The Eldest Senior Sister and Second Senior Sister glared at each other, and the little junior sister apprentice immediately no longer dared to speak carelessly again.The eldest senior sister said, \"I wonder how he is. The people from the Blood Refinement Sect are vicious. I think he \u2026\"\"What smell is it so fragrant?\" Second Senior Sister's stomach growled as she continued to run for the whole night. Her stomach was already growling from hunger.The little junior sister apprentice swallowed her saliva and said, \"I can smell it too. It's so fragrant, I can't even stand it. I'll go out and take a look first.\"\u2026 \u2026.\"Xiao Bai, slow down. It's hot.\" Long Fei hurriedly said as he watched Xiao Bai wolf away a piece of roasted meat.Xiao Bai skillfully pulled out the roasted meat. Just as he was about to swallow it whole, he saw a slim and graceful girl standing at the entrance of the cave.She looked to be about fifteen to sixteen years old. She wore a white dress and had a peaceful expression on her face.His eyes were watery, and his clothes were even better.A standard beauty.Immediately.Xiao Bai's eyes shone, his pupils turning into a 'heart' shape, he instantly jumped over and stood in front of the girl, and gave her the barbecue.\"What a cute puppy.\" The girl's heart was in a flurry as she directly carried Xiao Bai.Hearing the voice, Long Fei turned to look and was secretly shocked, \"Damn, there are so many beauties in this world, there's another super beauty?\"\"Wait.\"\"There are three super beauties, the small one is the loli type, the second is the youthful and beautiful type, and the third is the mature oneesan type. My god, every one of them is much more beautiful than the so-called goddesses or celebrities in my previous life.\" Long Fei was a little confused, and immediately thought of what they had said last night. He was secretly happy in his heart: \"My blissful sexual life is about to come, it's too sudden.\"After chasing the disciples of the Blood Refinement Sect away last night, he hadn't returned to the cave and instead went hunting for demon beasts.Preparing for breakfast.Thus \u2026Long Fei hadn't entered the cave after dawn, and now he was somewhat regretful. No, he was extremely regretful!With his vulgar personality, if he knew that it was these beauties, wouldn't he be called Long Fei if he didn't take advantage of them?However \u2026It was different now.Long Fei pretended to be serious and smiled faintly: \"You're awake?\"\"It's him?\" Little junior sister apprentice immediately stared at Long Fei from head to toe. Her eyes were completely red, and didn't have any hint of how Long Fei felt.\"He looks average!\"\"Sigh, he isn't the handsome guy from the legends. It seems like the heroes aren't all handsome men.\" The little junior sister apprentice said with disappointment, then she said to her two senior sisters: \"Senior sister, just a little, it's better now, since I'm in bed with the lights on and I can't see anything.\"\"Stupid girl, what are you talking about?\" The big senior sister twisted the junior sister apprentice's arm and bowed to Long Fei, saying politely: \"Thank you, Young Hero, for saving me.\"Long Fei immediately said: \"Why should I thank you for saving my wife?\"\"That's not right!\"Long Fei immediately changed his words, and said seriously: \"To be loyal to the hero, saving millions of girls is what this young master should do, I do not need to thank you.\"\"Besides, the two ladies said that last night \u2026\"Long Fei had not finished speaking.The three girls gathered around, tearing up the roast meat, and discussed, \"What a cute Xiao Bai dog, too cute.\"\"This roast meat is not bad, I've never eaten such a fragrant roast meat before.\"\"Aiya, does this Xiao Bai dog know how to roast meat?\"\u2026 \u2026.They had ignored Long Fei.As if he didn't exist, he just stood there dumbly, watching as Xiao Bai rubbed his wolf against the three sisters' chests. With a face full of bliss, he looked like a little pervert.Moreover.What was even more unacceptable to Long Fei was that the three girls were still enjoying it very much, taking turns to hug Xiao Bai Lang, while letting him rub their chests, especially the Eldest Senior Sister's jade mountain.Long Fei hated that he couldn't just say to them, \"Let that wolf go and come at me.\"However.It was useless. He interrupted several times and was ignored.He was suffering so much.Since he had no choice, Long Fei could only roast the meat by himself.The meat had only just been roasted by Xiao Bai, but it had already been snatched away by him. He had to fawn on the three girls, causing Long Fei to want to cry yet have no tears at all, \"What kind of fucking world is this, it's too heartbreaking.\"\"I really want to become Xiao Bai Lang.\"\"Not as interesting as a wolf.\" Long Fei said bitterly.No matter how bitter the suffering was, the meat still had to be roasted, because \u2026 He hadn't eaten a single piece of meat after roasting a dozen or so pieces of meat. He was really hungry!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just walk back yourself, why do you need my protection?\"\"Liar.\" After saying that, she whispered, \"They are all liars.\"The eldest senior sister also walked over and said, \"There is still some Blood Refinement Art left in us. Although we will not be unconscious, our cultivation will not be able to recover completely in a short period of time. I hope Young Hero can escort us back to Fire Glass City.\"Second Senior Sister also said, \"Young Hero, just let the good person do it to the end.\"At this time, even Xiao Bai was biting the leg of Long Fei's pants, looking at him with misty eyes, asking him to help the three girls.It had truly been raised for half a year.Long Fei had wanted to refuse.However, the system sounded out.\"Ding!\"\"Trigger mission: Escort the three Heaven Sect sisters back to Fire Glass City.\"\"Mission level: B\"\"task reward, 10 thousand experience, 1,000 true breath Points, one set of Huang Level 3 Desolate Blade.\"\u2026 \u2026.\"You triggered an escort mission?\" Long Fei exhaled, and could only helplessly agree, and said: \"Alright.\"He thought to himself: \"Anyway, it's better for me to return to the Fire Glass City.\"As soon as his voice fell, the three girls immediately became happy. They carried Xiao Bai and started playing with him again, and then \u2026 He continued to ignore Long Fei's existence.Xiao Bai was the same, completely intoxicated by their bodies.The little junior sister apprentice giggled, \"I really can't bear to part with Xiao Bai, otherwise I wouldn't need his protection.\"Long Fei was speechless.However \u2026Since he had accepted the mission, he would complete it.He also wanted to return to the Fire Glass City as soon as possible, but suddenly realised, the only person who was good to him in this world was jojo.\u2026 \u2026.After travelling for half a month, he finally walked out of Fire Glass Mountain Range.After half a month of contact, the feeling of Long Fei's existence was extremely small, and he was already used to it.The three girls were beautiful, but they were all disciples of the Heaven Sect.He knew the power of the Chao Tian Sect, it was stronger than even the Fire Glass Dynasty. Simply put, the Chao Tian Sect was an aristocratic school, the gathering place for the most talented was filled with experts. Even if he was a member of the Long family from the four pillars, he would still have to pass many tests to get in.There was a branch of the Heaven Sect in Fire Glass City.The three women were here to recruit disciples next spring.Half a day later.West gate of Fire Glass City.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for completing the escort mission. The reward is 10 thousand experience, 1,000 true breath points, and a Huang Level 3 Desolate Blade.\"\"Alright.\"\"Farewell. Bye. Take care. Bye.\"Long Fei was anxious to return home as soon as possible, so he didn't want to stay any longer than necessary after completing the mission.The three girls were stunned.They looked at each other, wondering if their charm was not good enough? Why did this man want to leave them earlier?Women are the strangest creatures, scornful of her good, unattractive to her bad.The eldest senior sister took out an order badge from her chest pocket and said, \"This is the Heaven Sect's order badge, you can come and find me at the branch if you have anything to do. You can also use this order badge to participate in the selection of the Heaven Sect without needing to participate in the audition.\"The token of the Heaven Sect!This was an extremely precious item, one that even the noble sons of the palace could not obtain.If there was something to take, Long Fei would naturally not reject it.After receiving it, he said, \"Thank you.\"\"Xiao Bai, let's go!\"With that, he left without even looking back.The three girls were stunned on the spot.\"Who is it? Does he not know what the Heaven Sect Token means?\" \"Hmph, it's definitely an earth leopard.\" The little junior sister apprentice said angrily.The eldest senior sister smiled and said, \"He might be in a hurry to leave, let's go.\"Second senior sister muttered to herself, \"His name is Long Fei, I keep having the feeling that I've heard that name somewhere before.\"\"Second Senior Sister, the moment he left you, he started to think about him. You're thinking about spring.\" The little junior sister apprentice teased.Second Senior Sister immediately flew into a rage. \"Good little girl, you're actually joking with Senior Sister. See if I teach you a lesson or not.\"\"Big Senior, save me!\"Just like that, the three girls continued to play around with each other. They slowly forgot about what had happened in Fire Glass Mountain Range and their fear towards the Blood Refinement Sect slowly faded away.However.They didn't know that people from the Blood Refinement Sect had arrived at the Fire Glass City before them.However \u2026They were not here to deal with the Heaven Sect, but to find Zhuge Jianqiang.\u2026 \u2026.At the Hibiscus Restaurant.One of the most famous restaurants in Fire Glass City.Long Fei did not immediately go to the slums to look for jojo, but instead came here first.Moreover.He was hungry as well. After eating grilled meat for half a year, he also wanted to change his taste.He ordered a private room and a table full of dishes.Just as Long Fei was about to start eating, the door to the private room was pushed open, and a young man dressed in luxurious clothing walked in followed by two bodyguards.\"Aiyo, didn't I see wrongly? It's indeed the Long family's good-for-nothing, Long Fei.\" The young man mocked, \"Long Fei, you have been hiding for half a year. You have finally returned.\"The young man's name was Long Ao.He was the youngest son of the Long family's Great Clan Elder, Long Zhanwu.It was once because Long Fei had the Dragon God's blood essence legacy and his innate talent was above him, that he was unable to raise his head up. Ever since Long Fei had been crippled, Long Ao had rapidly risen in power, becoming even more powerful against Long Fei. It could be said that he had beaten him once, and the last time was when he knocked Long Fei out.Long Fei sneered, and said: \"You better get the hell out of my way, don't disturb this father here eating; if not, I'll let you crawl out from here.\"\"How dare you!\" A bodyguard immediately shouted.Long Ao's expression changed as he sneered: \"You think you're the great genius of the Long family? You are but a broken piece of Pubes now \u2026 \"Before he could say the word 'thing', Long Fei's figure flashed.\"Pah!\"With a slap, Long Ao fell to the ground with a loud sound. The five finger marks on his face could clearly be seen, and his cheek also quickly became red and swollen. Long Ao was startled, he could not react at all, the two bodyguards looked at him, and Long Ao roared out, \"What are you looking at, why are you still not going up, aiyo, it's so painful for me.\"The two bodyguards immediately rushed forward.\"Pah!\"\"Pah!\"After another two slaps, the two bodyguards were the same as Long Ao. They fell to the ground, unable to get up for a long time.Long Fei returned to the table to continue eating.Long Ao did not dare to say another word. In half a year, he felt that his cultivation had improved quickly enough, to become a Level 8 Warrior. However, he did not even know how Long Fei made his move.The difference was too great.And then \u2026Long Ao had sneakily tried to crawl away, but his head was stepped on by Long Fei, and he said: \"You want to slip away?\"Long Ao smiled apologetically: \"Didn't you tell me to crawl out? I'm crawling.\"Long Fei stomped his foot hard and directly stomped Long Ao to the ground, and said: \"Carry out the accounts.\"The anger in Long Ao's heart burned hotter, but he did not dare flare up, and thought to himself: \"When I return to the Long family, I will definitely teach you a lesson, Long Fei, just you wait.\"After Long Fei finished packing the Hibiscus bun, he walked towards the slums.Half an hour later.\"jojo, I'm back.\" Long Fei walked into the courtyard. He realized that no one had cleaned the place for a long time, and his heart sank a little, \"Something happened?\"An old granny at the door said carefully, \"Miss jojo was captured by a group of people a few months ago.\"\"Dragon Dazzling!\"\"You're courting death!\"Instantly.Long Fei was infuriated, because someone had touched his reverse scale!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Didn't he leave the Fire Glass City, why is he back \u2026 \"Before he could finish.\"Pah!\"The palm landed on his face, and he instantly turned into a dead dog lying on the ground.Long Fei's gaze turned cold and he snorted, \"You dog, is it possible for a servant like you to call this young master by his name?\"His voice was filled with a domineering aura, shocking the several guards of the Long family.One must know that the guard who was previously a level 2 war division realm, was slapped unconscious by Long Fei.After half a year of not seeing her, Long Fei was no longer the same Long Fei from before.\"Yi, isn't that trash Long Fei? Why is he still alive? \"\"Pah!\"\"Ah... \"How dare you hit me, Long Fei, how dare trash like you attack me, I \u2026\"\"Pah!\"With another slap, he fainted again.The holy dragon mansion was very big.Whether it was the disciples of the Long family or the servants of the Long family, as long as they dared to call Long Fei a waste, they would all be put on the ground.\"Long Fei, what are you planning to do?\"\"Is he trying to barge into the holy dragon mansion?\"\"Long Fei, stop right there. Otherwise, don't blame me for being impolite \u2026\"At this moment.Two rows of the Long family's troops, both dressed in armor, walked in an orderly manner, all holding Dragon God's Steel Spear, and pointing it at Long Fei.The leader was a small leader, Long Shan.He was not a member of the Long family, and the surname 'Long' was given to him by the Dragon family's grand ancestor. He was one of the soldiers that followed him in battle, and due to his outstanding achievements, he was given the surname 'Long' by the grand ancestor.Long Shan was considered one of the top younger generation, reaching war division realm of the fourth level.Long Fei frowned, \"Long Fei?\"\"How can you call this young master by his name?\"\"Long Shan, as the Long family's Imperial Guard, you don't differentiate between the primary and the secondary. You have great guts to call the Young Lord by his name.\" Long Fei bellowed, and immediately suppressed Long Shan.Everyone in the Long family knew that Long Fei was the young master.It was the successor personally identified by the Grand Elder in the ancestral hall.No matter if it was when he became trash, or now, Long Fei was the future master of the Long family.As a Long family's Imperial Guard, he had to be respectful.To address him by his name was a great disrespect to the young master, and a disrespect to the Long family.However \u2026In this past year, who took Long Fei seriously?Who would still think that he was the young master of the Long family?No one!Long Shan and his Imperial Guards were the same. Even though Long Shan knew in his heart that it was wrong to call Long Fei by name, the Long family's future should not end up in the hands of a wastrel. You are not worthy, you are not qualified! Long Fei, you better calm down a little. Otherwise, don't blame me for being impolite. \"Long Fei laughed, and then laughed coldly: \"I am not worthy, am I?\"\"Alright then!\"\"Your elder will know what qualifications are today.\"As soon as he finished.\"Bang, bang, bang \u2026\"\"Gugu...\"Long Fei suddenly leaped, spread out his four limbs, and then heavily laid on the ground, letting out a 'quack' sound from his throat, like a big toad.Around his body, the dust and dirt were blown away by the force released from his body.Long Shan's face turned sinister as he disdainfully said, \"Pretending to be mysterious \u2026\"Before he could finish speaking, Long Shan's vision blurred. When he looked carefully, he realized that Long Fei had already disappeared.\"Whoosh \u2026\"\"Hualala \u2026\"Long Shan's eyes were wide open in anger. Before he could react, his body was sunken in, his internal organs were rolling, blood was rolling in his throat, and a mouthful of blood was gushing out. He screamed out in pain, \"Ah \u2026\"\"Bam!\"The impact sent Long Shan flying dozens of meters away. His body smashed into a wall, and the wall caved in like a spider web.The true breath was activated!\"Bind him!\"Long Fei bellowed.\"Ahh \u2026\"A wave of energy from Long Shan's abdomen stirred his internal organs, causing them to clench together. It was extremely uncomfortable, and he repeatedly let out miserable cries.His face was pale, and he was sweating profusely.He was in an extremely sorry state, and he didn't look as arrogant as before.Long Fei said coldly: \"Is that enough?\"The muscles in the corner of Long Shan's eyes trembled as he roared, \"Attack!\"There were a total of sixteen people in two rows of the Long family's army.Long Shan gave his order, and the sixteen Dragon God steel spears pointed at Xiang Longfei at the same time.Long Fei squinted his eyes, \"You are just servants of the Long family, to dare point your weapons at your master, I shall give you one chance, one chance to live.\"\"Get out of my way!\"Their voices were like thunder, exploding in the hearts of the sixteen people.Their bodies were trembling.Long Fei was the young master, and it was disrespectful for them to deal with the young master.They looked at Dragon Mountain.However.At this time, Long Shan had already fainted from the intense pain of 'strangling'. This was because the Toading Skill only used three levels of strength, if he used his full strength, he would already be dead.Everyone was scared. One of them opened up a path, and the others also opened up a path.The current Long Fei gave them a very unfamiliar feeling.Even that genius Long Fei was not as terrifying as him. The aura being released from his body was extremely dense and overbearing, to the point where they were almost unable to breathe.\"Very good!\"\"You can still live.\" Long Fei coldly snorted as he left in large strides, not even bothering to turn his head to look at them.If they had dared to stop him just now.Long Fei will kill them!He was the young master, the Long family's young master. Apart from the Grand Preceptor, everyone else dared to disrespect him and break the Long family's rules.Waste for a year.After being bullied for a whole year, no one in the Long Family thought highly of him. Now that he had returned from the Fire Glass Mountain Range, they were all prepared.Who wouldn't accept this?Until he submitted.Not convinced yet?Kill!He wanted to destroy those who were unconvinced. He wanted to be the young master of the Long family.Looking at Long Fei's departing figure, the Dragon Family's Imperial Guards looked at each other and asked softly: \"Is that Long Fei? \"How strange, why is it completely different from before?\"\"? You should call him Young Lord. \"\"Right, right, Young Lord.\"\"In half a year's time, that genius young master came back again. He was arrogant, overbearing, and arrogant. The feeling he gave others was simply too great.\"\u2026 \u2026.If strength was king, then the strong would be respected.After defeating Long Shan with a single move, the explosive aura, power, and the disposition of a king made them feel a sense of subservience.\u2026 \u2026.\"Father.\"\"You must punish him well. It's best if you kill him.\"Long Ao covered her red and swollen face, and begged while crying, \"If Long Fei is still alive, he will stop you from ascending to the position of the Long family's Patriarch. He is the Long family's shame, and cannot be allowed to live.\"Long Zhanwu's forehead turned sinister.It was also at this moment.A servant anxiously ran in, \"Patriarch, something's wrong, Long Fei has rushed in, no one can stop him.\"Long Ao's body suddenly trembled in fear, and then he shouted: \"Long Fei, you still dare to behave atrociously in the Long family, you're dead today.\"Long Zhanwu's face was filled with anger, and he said: \"You dog, you're really going against the rules?\"\"Where is he?\"The servant said, \"They've gone in the direction of Chief Eunuch Long's courtyard.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How could one of the four pillars s be a small family?If not for the fact that there were still memories in his body, Long Fei would really have lost his way.However \u2026He quickly found Long Da Yao's courtyard.\"Clang!\"Long Fei kicked the courtyard door and it flew away. He stood at the entrance and shouted, \"Long Da Yao, get the hell out here right now.\"\"Where did this bastard come from?! How dare he behave so atrociously in Chief Steward Long's courtyard?!\"\"Men, beat this vicious dog out of here!\"\"You dare to behave atrociously here, you're courting death!\"The courtyard was huge, and a man who looked like a steward shouted loudly.Next.Five or six servants rushed out with long sticks in their hands.One of them seemed to have realized something, and said: \"Isn't he Long Fei?\"The little steward raised his eyes and sneered, \"Big trash Long Fei? Hahaha... I've been looking for you for half a year, but you actually delivered yourself to my doorstep. Men, come and beat me to death. \"Evil slave!\"Ignore the Young Lord, insult the Young Lord! Sin, die!\" Long Fei said in a low voice.They did not understand.The head steward sneered in disdain, \"You are going to die today. If you dare to touch the nephew of the general director, you should have died a long time ago.\"\"Charge!\"Long Fei stepped out of the fifth rank as a teacher and released. He activated the power of the Toading Skill and punched out with his right fist.\"Bam!\"The head of one of them moved, and half of his body was sent flying back more than ten meters.He fell to the ground, blood gushing out from his wounds.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing 'Evil Slave' for obtaining 90 experience, true breath + 10, Energy Values + 10.\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for receiving 50 silver.\"\u2026 \u2026.The others' faces turned grim. With a murderous glint in their eyes, they all pounced forward.\"Bam!\"\"Bam!\"\"Bam!\"Each punch contained the full power of the opponent's attack.Since they had looked for him for half a year, this also meant one thing. jojo was captured by them, and when he thought of this point, the fury in Long Fei's heart was completely uncontrollable.Fist Blast!\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing 'Evil Slave' for obtaining 90 experience, true breath + 10, Energy Values + 10.\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for receiving 30 silver.\"\"Ding!\"\u2026 \u2026.Every time someone was killed, a prompt would sound out.Very good!Facing someone who deserved to be killed, Long Fei would never be merciful. To be able to kill with a single punch, he definitely would not use the second move.After a few minutes, all six slaves fell to the ground, blood flowing out from their wounds.Long Fei slowly walked towards the evil slave manager and coldly said: \"A lowly servant actually disregarded the young master, and insulted the young master.\"Plop!\"\"Spare me, please spare me, please spare me.\" The head steward knelt on the ground and begged for mercy. \"It was all instructed by the great general. It's none of my business.\"Long Fei asked coldly: \"Where is Long Da Yao?\"\"The Long family's back mountain, where the prisoners are held.\" \"He went to interrogate jojo. He wants to know your whereabouts, hurry up and go. That little girl jojo is almost unable to hold on any longer \u2026 Long Haochen is going to be tortured. \"\"Cluck, cluck \u2026\"Long Fei clenched his fists tightly, causing cracking sounds to come out from his joints, his eyes were bloodshot, condensing a cold killing intent, he turned and kicked the evil slave butler out.\"Bam!\"Like a shot from a soccer ball, he curved his way into the hall and sat on the teacher's chair. His entire skeleton was broken and he died a miserable death.\"Ding!\"A notification sounded.Long Fei quickly rushed to the back mountain of the Long family.\u2026 \u2026.\"This is crazy!\"\"Crazy, you dare to kill people like that, Long Fei, today even if you have ten heads, it won't be enough to kill you.\"Not long after Long Fei left, Long Zhanwu and his team rushed over.The scene of Long Da Yao's courtyard dripping with blood was too tragic to bear to look at.\"Where did he go?\"A servant tremblingly replied, \"They went to the back of the mountain.\"Long Zhanwu's eyes slightly narrowed, and said in a deep voice, \"Inform the Long family's Law Enforcement Hall, tell Long Zhanye to bring some people to the rear mountains, I will teach him a good lesson today!\"\"Yes sir!\"A guard hurriedly left the room.Long Ao smiled proudly, \"Long Fei, prepare to die.\"Long Zhanwu thought, \"Long Fei, you asked for this yourself. Your Dragon God blood essence has already been extracted. If you were to become the Long family master, it would definitely be a shame for the Long family, and you, as a trash, aren't even worthy. I have to let the Long family continue on. If you become the Long family's patriarch, you will only bring destruction to the Long family, and even the Long family will not lose face as the trash Patriarch! \"\u2026 \u2026.At this moment.The Long family was in chaos as the Law Enforcement Hall made their move.The Long family's army had also made their move.However \u2026The back of the mountain was completely unaware of everything. It was incomparably quiet.At the back of the Long family's mountain, there was a cave.This was a place where the Long family was imprisoned for violating family rules, or where they punished their servants.Long Fei never thought that Long Da Yao would actually keep jojo locked up here, and the person who goes in would at least lose a layer of skin, even if they don't die.Hearing the Evil Slave Manager's words, Long Da Yao even started to torture jojo.This made Long Fei even more furious.\"Long Fei, you can't enter here, you can't \u2026\"\"Bam!\"\"Bam!\"The two guards blocked Long Fei's path, and were knocked out in two punches from him. Long Fei did not want to waste time with them, he stepped into the cave, and quickly rushed in.\u2026 \u2026.At this moment.At the very bottom of the cave, in an empty space.On the rack, jojo was covered in blood, her hair was in a mess and her breathing was weak.Blood continued to ooze out from his fingers and joints. It was clear that he had just been pinched, and his hands were trembling non-stop. He was in so much pain that he couldn't even make a sound. He was sweating profusely and his body was trembling.\"jojo, you just need to tell me where Long Fei went and you won't need to go through all this torture.\" Long Da Yao said coldly, his voice filled with anger.From the look in his eyes, he was losing his patience.jojo didn't say a word. He had used all the torture methods in the past half a year of interrogation.He couldn't understand why a maid would risk her life to protect a trash.Because they grew up together?Just because Long Fei was good to her?Or was it something else?He was very clear that no one could resist his methods, but the maid in front of him made him lose his patience. He coldly said, \"You won't say anything, right?\"\"Alright!\"\"Then go to hell. I'll find him anyway.\"\"I'll send him to hell with you.\"As soon as he finished.Long Da Yao moved his palm, and a black baleful qi appeared in his palm. He said coldly, \"I will make you die a cruel death, hahaha \u2026 \u2026\"A palm slammed down.But right at this moment.A gust of wind blew from his back.\"Huala \u2026\"Long Da Yao's eyes widened and he instantly retracted the killing intent in his hand. He turned around and shouted, \"Who?!\"\"Your ancestor!\"\"Boom!\"Toading Skill shot out, colliding with Long Da Yao.Long Da Yao.Eight-level Warrior Realm, his strength had already reached the peak of the ninth level of the Battle-Master. His reaction was extremely fast, and in an instant, his hands sank as he blocked Long Fei's attack. His body also jerked in an instant as he leapt a few meters away. As he focused his eyes, the corners of his mouth revealed a sinister and proud sneer, \"Long Fei?\"\"You delivered it yourself.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He pounced, laid on the ground, and turned into a giant toad. He released all of his energy, and the Qi on his body swirled up like a wave of air.His four limbs moved.\"Buzz!\"His body bounced back, his figure was like a bolt of lightning, cutting through everything and rushing towards Long Haochen.At the same time.The true breath in his body was activated.\"Humph!\"\"Trash is trash. After not seeing you for half a year, you're still trash. You're still delusional enough to want to fight me. You're courting death!\" With a look of contempt, Long Da Yao formed two fists into a palm.Boom! Boom! Boom!The two energies formed into force and pounced towards Xiang Longfei.\"Bang, bang!\"Long Fei withstood the attack, directly breaking through the two energies, and fiercely crashed into Long Da Yao's abdomen.Long Da Yao tried his best to resist.\"Bind him!\"The power of the Toading Skill suddenly changed, and spiraled into Long Da Yao's body. Long Fei also followed this opportunity and flew out.\"Buzz!\"Long Da Yao's body issued a muffled sound of impact, his face secretly turned malevolent, revealing a pained expression, \"You dog, God Tier cultivation technique?\"\"Pfft \u2026\"He spat out a mouthful of black blood, and the gloomy and cold expression on his face became even more sinister.Long Fei laughed coldly: \"That's great!\"\"You dog, you think that you can beat me after cultivating the Divine level cultivation technique?\" Long Haochen's voice suddenly changed, and a black baleful aura emanated from his body.\"Demonic art?\"\"You're from the Devil Sect?\" Long Fei's mind trembled, he finally understood why Long Da Yao was monitoring him and had been looking for him this whole time.He initially thought that it was Long Zhanwu's arrangement.But from the looks of it, that wasn't it at all. This Long Haochen was definitely from the Demonic Sect hiding in the Long family, so why did they want to capture him?As for this point, Long Fei had yet to figure it out.Long Haochen revealed a sinister smile, \"You are indeed worthy of being the former genius of the Long family. Now you're afraid, right? Kneel down and beg for mercy. I will leave you an intact corpse.\"jojo said with his last breath: \"Young Master, don't, don't worry about me, you, you better hurry up, he's crazy \u2026\"\"Leave?!\"\"Can he leave?\" Long Haochen said confidently.Long Fei retracted his fists and said, \"Since you are a member of the Devil Sect, then there is no need for me to worry.\"While they were talking \u2026He moved his right hand and took out the Desolate Splitting Blade.\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"You dare to take out a mere yellow-rank Xuan Weapon?\" Long Da Yao laughed mockingly. At the same time, his figure moved, directly merging with the black baleful qi and with a cold voice, he shouted, \"Long Fei, kneel down!\"As soon as his voice faded \u2026A skeleton claws suddenly grabbed Xiang Longfei's head.\"Open the skin!\"The Desolate Blade moved, Long Fei slashed down.\"Ding!\"\"Gather a layer of saber Qi!\"After that, Long Fei moved as fast as lightning and locked onto Long Da Yao's body. He continuously slashed with his blade, \"Tendon Break, Bone Splitting, Blood Severing, Spirit Opening, Soulshake, slay \u2026\"Every time he made a move, a system notification rang out.The amount of blade energy accumulated.The dragon salyer technique was released, and every single slash was extremely savage. After the third slash, Long Da Yao's black evil aura was completely shattered by Long Fei's Desolate Blade. The last four slashes forced him into a corner, his hair scattered in a bun. His entire body was covered in knife marks, as if he was about to be chopped into pieces. He was in an extremely sorry state.It was also at this moment.Long Zhanwu's angry voice came from outside the cave, \"Long Fei, I order you to come out immediately.\"Long Ao also proudly shouted loudly, \"Trash, come out and die, hahaha \u2026\"\u2026 \u2026.\"Ahh, ha, ha \u2026\"Long Da Yao's forehead was filled with cold sweat. He never thought that Long Fei was already this powerful; in just half a year, he had changed so quickly.His cultivation level was actually not his match.Moreover.The two types of skills that Long Fei had cultivated with were too powerful, he had never seen anything like them before, especially the later parts of the blade technique, blocking three slashes was already his limit.The other four blades hacked down on his soul in the same way. It was incomparably uncomfortable.However \u2026Hearing Long Zhanwu's voice, he immediately became excited and shouted loudly: \"Great Clan Elder, Long Fei has gone mad! He wants to kill me, quickly come and save me!\"\"Come in and save me.\"And then \u2026Long Da Yao said to Long Fei proudly: \"Long Fei, you think you can kill me? Hahaha... When Long Zhanwu comes in, he will only see you trying to kill me and will not know that I am a member of the Devil Sect. You will die under his hands. You must know that in the Long family, the one who wants you the most is him, hahaha \u2026 \"\"Once you die, my goal will be achieved.\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"You have already finished the sword technique, and you still have to practice it. There's no time at all, hahaha... Long Fei, kill me? You deserve it, hahaha... \"Everything was going according to his calculations.Long Da Yao laughed complacently. In his opinion, Long Fei could not kill him at all.wouldn't know that he was from the Demon Sect, and killing a Long family's general director was not a small crime. In addition, the Long family scoffed at Long Fei, and would definitely not be forgiven.He could live on with ease.Everything was perfect.However...He completely did not understand that the current Long Fei was no longer the Long Fei of the past.When his temper flared, even if it was in front of Long Zhanwu, he would still kill him!Long Fei sneered, and said: \"I can't do anything to you right?\"Long Da Yao said with a smile, \"Your blade technique is indeed amazing, but can you kill this daddy here? Long Zhanwu is about to come in, and you'll just have to wait to be brought away by the Law Enforcement Hall, hahaha \u2026 \"\"Laugh?\"Long Fei's arm was trembling, his Desolate Blade was trembling, as though it could not withstand the dragon salyer technique's energy, even the air itself was trembling.The cave trembled.Long Da Yao's expression turned cold and his face paled as he asked: \"Long Fei, what are you planning to do?\"\"For what?\"The corner of Long Fei's mouth curled up, revealing a death god's smile, \"I'll take your life!\"\"dragon chop!\"\"Puchi \u2026\" Rumble \u2026. \"Rumble \u2026\"The seven layers of saber Qi condensed into one, forming the Half Moon Saber Qi. The Half Moon Saber Qi was released. \"Shua, shua, shua \u2026\" A gust of wind swept the ground.He wildly slashed out.It was not just a layer of saber Qi slashing but more than a hundred layers of saber Qi slashing out crazily.It was as if the autumn wind had swept the leaves.\"Bam!\"A slash landed on Long Haochen's body, instantly killing him. He didn't even have the chance to retaliate.The second slash followed.Third slash, Fourth slash, Fifth slash \u2026 It was constantly being released, and the entire cave was filled with an unstoppable sword aura. The scene was extremely shocking.\"Boom!\"A loud sound echoed out.The hundredth slash was unleashed.At this time.There was not a single bit of flesh left on Long Da Yao's body. All of it had been turned to powder.dragon salyer technique was berserk and domineering.The dragon chop that was merged together after seven slashes was even sharper than before.\"You don't dare to kill you? Can't kill you? Is it good now? \" Long Fei exhaled, the idea moved, and said excitedly: \"Explode for me!\"The system beep began to ring...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What a disappointment.\"He was not finished.The system beep sounded again.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to the player 'Long Fei' for triggering the 'Demonic Training System'. Do you want to start cultivating magic?\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for triggering 'Points System'\"\"Huh?\"\"Two 'systems' dropped?\" Long Fei was shocked, he immediately checked the system.Demonic Cultivator System.Players could change their cultivation body once a day, which would require 1000 points each time.In short.As long as Long Fei confirmed that he was able to cultivate the \"Demonic Training System\" and turn himself into a Demonic Cultivator, he could, of course, only after gaining a thousand points.Next.Magic cultivators also needed 1000 points to convert it back.However, if the devil body was injured, then so was the exchange.When the devil's cultivation broke through, and was converted back, the original body's level would also break through, which was the level. true breath and techniques were all shared.In addition, cultivating the devil also had the benefits of cultivating the devil. The demonic cultivation method could increase the damage a sect disciple could do, and vice versa.Only after confirming that he had cultivated in the demonic arts could he start cultivating in the demonic arts.\"Duo Cultivation?\" Long Fei did not even think about it, the idea moved, and immediately confirmed: \"Cultivate!\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for activating 'Demonic Cultivating System' for obtaining 100 Experience Points, 100 true breath points, and 100 Points as a reward.\"\"In the future, I will be a righteous man in front of the sect.

In front of the Demon Sect, I am a Berserk Demon, who have specially killed those hypocrites, and am practically reaping the rewards from both sides. The Striking System s are simply too satisfying, hahaha \u2026 \" Long Fei couldn't stop laughing in his heart.Whether he was in a sect or a demonic sect, he would be able to flourish in the future.More importantly.He was able to enjoy the resources of two places. That was the most important thing.And then \u2026Long Fei checked the 'points system'. He didn't know whether to look or not, but after looking \u2026 He was scared to the point of peeing.Integral system.Description: Killing an ordinary disciple of a sect will result in a reward of 10 points. Killing an ordinary disciple of a Devil Sect will result in a reward of 10 points.Description 2: Obtained points from completing the quest. Points are dependent on the difficulty of the quest.Description 3: Forge a superior pill, carve out a superior formation, refine a superior mystical weapon, and subdue a superior demon beast \u2026 You can even get points.Description 4: Items such as magical equipment, spiritual equipment, cultivation technique and war pet can all be exchanged for points.Description 5: Activating points exchange, points lottery. As long as you have enough points, you can exchange for what you want together.\u2026 \u2026.\"Oh my god!\"Long Fei was completely shocked by the 'points system', \"With this awesome points system, doesn't this daddy have what I want?\"\"Wait!\"\"Let me see what kind of goods can be exchanged for.\"Long Fei opened the trading column, \"Dragon Blood, Great Net elixir, Experience Elixir, Teleportation Formation, Fire Unicorn, Taotie \u2026 Holy shit, there's still the soul flag, Linglong Treasure Pagoda, Buddha palm technique, Pangu's Clone \u2026 Damn, it can actually be exchanged for the Nine Heaven Fairy to fight for \u2026 \"\"I can't take it anymore!\"\"My heart can't take it.\" Long Fei's heartbeat accelerated in a straight line, and his blood boiled; he almost couldn't take it anymore.Every single thing was a good thing, and to the god's martial continent, they were all Divine ranked treasures.It was too tempting.However \u2026Long Fei looked at the trading points, his entire being was stunned, \"One portion of dragon blood, trading point requirement: 80,000 points, Da Lou elixir \u2026\"A long string of 'zeros' made Long Fei feel a little powerless.\"F * ck your grandpa, did you come up with something to tempt your father?\" Long Fei was instantly displeased, he wanted to pull out the System to give it a good beating.Every item was good, but the points required for each item was shockingly high.The heck \u2026 This was too darned!Initially, he was extremely excited, but as though he had fallen into a hole in the ice, he felt as though his life had lost all meaning.Under his curiosity.Long Fei thought: \"Let's see how many points this dragon salyer is worth.\"Looking through the system, Long Fei's mouth formed an 'O' shape, and he was unable to recover his wits. He had to count for a full ten times before he could clearly count the long string of zeroes, \"To think that it could actually be counted with 80 million points, that's too awesome. If we can completely repair the dragon salyer, wouldn't it need to break a few hundred million?\"\"Gudong!\"Long Fei swallowed his saliva heavily, \"Suddenly, I realised that I was too awesome, hahaha!\"\"It feels so good!\"It was also at this moment.\"Long Fei, get out here right now!\"His voice was filled with rage.Long Fei's eyes tensed up, and he immediately scolded: \"F * ck, I'm calling you grandmother's breasts.\"Zhang Xuan suppressed the agitation in his heart.He anxiously walked to the rack and carefully removed jojo's injuries. Seeing her on the verge of death, the anger in her heart roiled, wishing that he could pull Long Da Yao out from hell and kill him a hundred thousand times to vent.Long Fei hugged jojo and said: \"It's fine, it's fine, I'll bring you home now.\"jojo curled up in Long Fei's embrace, sensed Long Fei's warmth, breathed Long Fei's aura, and was unable to feel the pain from her body. She only felt happiness, and felt that she was the happiest woman in the world.It was unknown if it was because of happiness or because she was too tired, but she fell into a deep sleep in Long Fei's embrace.Long Fei looked at jojo, who was in his embrace, and said with a gentle smile, \"What is the little girl thinking about, it's so sweet.\"However \u2026The feeling of hugging a woman was really good.Moreover, if it was a woman as beautiful as jojo, Long Fei's feelings were even better. In his heart, he placed jojo in a very important position.\"Such a beautiful woman should be happy and alive every day.\" Long Fei laughed.\u2026 \u2026.\"Dad, could he have died inside?\"\"That's right, Manager Long is a Eight-level Warrior Ranker, he easily killed Long Fei.\"\"Even Manager Long hasn't come out. What's going on inside?\"The few of them whispered to each other.Long Zhanwu said slightly: \"Where is the Law Enforcement Hall?\"Long Zhanye walked over and said, \"Here.\"Long Zhanwu shouted in a low voice, and said: \"Go inside and search, and bring Long Fei's dog out!\"\"Yes sir!\"Long Zhanye's eyes moved, a few disciples of the Law Enforcement Hall quickly rushed out.It was at this moment.Long Fei held jojo as he stood at the entrance of the cave and arrogantly said: \"You don't have to go in to pick me up, I'm coming out myself.\"Her gaze was directly fixated on Long Zhanwu.Long Zhanwu's body released an extremely strong aura, which was extremely strong.This was an aura that only war chief Rankers would be able to release.Long Zhanwu's eyes turned sinister. Without saying a word, he bellowed: \"Capture him!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You think you are worthy of it?His voice was like a thunderclap.Two groups of forbidden army immediately rushed forward, surrounding Long Fei in an instant.\"I want to see who dares!\" Long Fei sneered, and directly called out his name: \"Long Zhanwu, you don't have the qualifications to capture me. What kind of identity are you, an elder of the Long family, and what kind of identity do you have?They did not place Long Zhanwu in their eyes at all.Long Zhanwu frowned, his fists clenched tightly, releasing the invisible anger, and said: \"Long Fei, you ignore the clan rules, injured the Imperial Guard, and killed the Long Family's servants. Now, even Long Da Yao has been killed by you, you are guilty of heinous crimes, anyone from the Long Family can definitely offend you.\"\"Talking about qualifications with me?\"\"You think you're worthy?\"Long Ao laughed complacently, \"Long Fei, just obediently kneel down and admit your mistake, hahaha \u2026\"Long Fei said unhurriedly: \"Long Zhanwu, let me ask you, what is the punishment for insulting the Long family's young master and the future Duke of Divine Dragon?\"Long Zhanwu's face froze.Long Fei continued, \"The Imperial Guards have stopped the young master of the Long Family. What kind of crime is this, to attack the young master?\"Long Zhanwu's face sank again.Long Fei asked again, \"As a servant of the Long family, you framed the Young Master, and captured my servants.The cave entrance suddenly quieted down.Being questioned by Long Fei in three rounds, Long Zhanwu actually could not answer., who was in the Law Enforcement Hall, was also slightly shaken. Looking at Long Fei, he felt that he was no longer the Long Fei from before.However \u2026This was the domineering and arrogant attitude that the young master of the Long family should have.Then.Long Zhanwu did not give up, and said: \"You can forget about everything else, but as a disciple of the Long family, even if you're the young master, you have no right to kill him \u2026\"Only the Long family's Law Enforcement Hall was able to enforce the law.Long Fei was also aware of this.Without waiting for Long Zhanwu to finish speaking, Long Fei laughed: \"Do you see me killing Long Da Yao? If you didn't see it, then please shut up! Understand? \"Kcha! *Long Zhanwu's expression became somewhat sinister.He was angry.He was furious, but \u2026 But he couldn't find a place to vent it out.He could feel the change in Long Fei as well, that Long Fei was indeed the Young Master, and insulting the Young Master was a serious crime that could be punished with death.However \u2026He was unwilling to let Long Fei go just like that, and he did not want to miss this great opportunity.Long Ao said from the side, \"Father, don't talk so much with him. Let's kill him first.\"Long Zhanwu's forehead turned sinister.It wouldn't be difficult to kill Long Fei, but... He wanted the people's hearts, the Long family's people's hearts, if he didn't give a reasonable reason to kill Long Fei, even if Long Fei was a trash, he would still be criticized by others, and it would affect his ascent to the position of Patriarch. Furthermore, the Long family wasn't as simple as it seemed on the surface.If he did not make a good step, he would be doomed forever.Long Zhanye stepped forward and asked, \"Just now, Long Da Yao's cry for help came from inside the cave. Since he hasn't come out yet, he should be dead?\"Long Fei asked, \"May I ask what Long Da Yao's cultivation level is?\"Long Ao took the initiative and said, \"I know about this, Peak Realm Dragon Manager.\"Long Fei said: \"Then may I ask, who is stronger when compared to me? I killed him? Do you think that's possible? \"he asked.Long Zhanye also became silent.A difference of a small realm was impossible to pass, let alone a Pubes that had shattered, its tendons and veins congealed, and Long Fei whose dragon blood had been sucked out, was even more so not a match for him.But everyone had heard it very clearly just now.Long Fei laughed: \"Since the Law Enforcement Hall does not believe, we can send people to check inside to see if there are any corpses of Long Da Yao.\"Without waiting for Long Zhanye to speak, Long Ao stepped forward and said: \"I'll go check it out.\"Walking to Long Fei's side, Long Ao said complacently: \"Long Fei, when I find the corpse of Manager Long, prepare to die.\"\"Pah!\"As soon as he finished.Long Fei slapped him across the face, \"You actually dare to threaten Young Master, you're looking for a beating!\"Long Ao fell to the ground immediately, his face was red and swollen, he screamed in pain: \"Father, he hit me!\"\"Huff \u2026\" Long Zhanwu took a deep breath, narrowed his eyes, and said solemnly: \"Go in and search!\"Hit his son right in front of Long Zhanwu.Arrogant!Long Zhanye had a deeper understanding of Long Fei, and thought to himself, \"Even if it was the Long Fei of a prodigy period, he would not dare to do something like this. His cultivation has become stronger. \"Long Ao held onto his cheek, and rushed into the cave with a few guards.Half an hour later.Long Ao walked out dejectedly, and said in a low voice: \"We didn't find the corpse of Manager Long, there's nothing at all.\"At this moment.Long Fei laughed playfully: \"Uncle Zhan Wu, slandering the young master, this is a heavy crime, seeing as you are an elder, I will not care about it, next time don't make such a mistake, okay?\"Finished.Hugging jojo, she said softly, \"Let's go home.\"He walked away without taking a single glance at Long Zhanwu and the others.\"It was really dangerous just now. The war chief's aura on Long Zhanwu's body is too strong, I actually couldn't take it.\"\u2026 \u2026.Long Zhanwu did not immediately leave the cave.Instead, he walked into the cave and examined it. He believed that Long Da Yao was definitely inside, and that he had definitely died by Long Fei's hands.He was also accompanied by Long Zhanye.\"Saber Qi!\"\"Such a violent and tyrannical blade qi, otherwise it would not have created such a small crack, and this was not even created by a single blade qi.\" Long Zhanye said in shock.Long Zhanwu looked at a thin crack on the wall, his eyes sinister as he muttered to himself, \"Concentrate all the blade Qi at one point, with this level of accuracy, this power is definitely not something an ordinary person can control.\"Long Zhanye's face was ice-cold as he said: \"Big Brother, it seems like our young master trash has become stronger.\"Long Zhanwu exhaled, his fists clenched tightly, and muttered to himself: \"So what if I become stronger? There is no aura of dragon blood on his body and he is just a piece of trash. \"The aura of dragon blood.Only the main disciples of the Long family could have such an aura.It is the standard to judge your position in the Long family, and also the standard to judge the talent of the Long family's disciples.There was no aura of dragon blood on Long Fei's body.In other words, he hadn't recovered yet. As long as he didn't have the aura of the dragon blood, he would still be a piece of trash!He absolutely could not allow a person without dragon blood essence become a Divine Dragon Marquis!Because \u2026Once Long Fei became the Divine Dragon Marquis, the entire Fire Glass City would laugh at the Long family.The Long family was a useless master, but there were no more Dragon God Warriors who had existed for ten thousand years. He couldn't let this kind of thing happen, but \u2026 The courage that Long Fei displayed today and this violent and overbearing blade aura caused shock in his heart, and it took a long time before he could calm down from the shock.Actually.With Long Zhanwu's strength and his right in the Long family, it was as easy as flipping his palm to get rid of Long Fei. He could have done it a year ago, but he didn't.Now, Long Zhanwu was regretting it a little!Long Zhanye asked: \"Big brother, what do we do next? Do you want me to \u2026? \"Long Zhanye made a throat erasing gesture.\"No need. I need to kill him as a matter of fact.\" Long Zhanwu thought for a moment, then said: \"The matter of Long Fei's sudden increase in cultivation must not be spread out.\"The more word spread out, the worse it would be for him.\"Understood!\" Long Zhanye nodded heavily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was no news at all.The only change was.Some of the servants, the Long Family's forbidding army, would hide when they see Long Fei.\"I'm here to ask for a high-grade healing pill.\" Long Fei walked to the Long family's Medicinal Pills Pavilion. jojo's entire body was injured, and he needed to be treated with healing pills.When the manager saw that it was Long Fei, his expression turned cold, and then he coldly said: \"No!\"Long Fei was startled, \"Such a large pill warehouse like the Long Family doesn't have any healing pills, you f * cking want to get beaten up, don't you? \"Hurry up and give me a set of healing pills.\"The supervisor clenched his teeth and said, \"Young Master Long, your monthly allowance has long been revoked by Elder Long. Not to mention healing pills, you can't even get one tael of silver, so stop making things difficult for me.\"\"Long Zhanwu...\"\"This old thing!\"Long Fei cursed. Seeing the steward who was slightly trembling, he flung his sleeves and walked out.He took a few steps and then stepped back.The steward trembled in fear and almost fell to the ground.Long Fei asked: What materials are needed to create a healing pill?\"Refine healing pills?\"The steward was surprised. \"Sky Orchid Root, Seven Stars Grass, Iron Lotus Flower \u2026\"Long Fei wrote down the names of all the materials.Then, he turned towards the street and gloomily said in his heart: Long Zhanwu, once I break through the war chief, I will come find you. \"Damn, he's also surnamed Long, I'll go!\"Long Fei did not dare to look for Long Zhanwu either.He was a war chief realm, and the aura being emitted from his body was enough to crush him to the point where he couldn't even move.Before he broke through the war chief realm, Long Fei wasn't willing to meet Long Zhanwu again.\"Thank goodness I trained in Alchemy.\" Long Fei thought.Walking to a shop that sold Medicinal Pills, Long Fei asked: \"How much is a set of Superior Grade Healing Pills?\"If he could buy it, it was better to buy it.The assistant said, \"One thousand three hundred taels.\"\"F * ck!\"\"What about robbing?\" Long Fei was shocked. One set of pills was more than 1000 taels of silver, and he only had more than 1200 taels of silver on him. He couldn't even afford a high quality healing pill.The shop assistant frowned and disdainfully said, \"I can't afford high-grade pills. You can buy low-grade pills. High-grade healing pills are only affordable for noble children. I think you \u2026\"\"Do I look like someone who can't afford it?\" Long Fei did not wait for him to finish speaking before he slammed the one thousand silver on the table.The assistant sneered. \"You don't have enough money.\"Long Fei glared at him and said: \"Do you want me to buy some High Rank Healing Pills? I'm here to buy some spiritual herbs. Sky Orchid Root, Seven Stars Grass, Iron Lotus Flower \u2026 One thousand silver for all these Spirit Grasses. \"The shop assistant was stunned for a moment before laughing mockingly, \"The spiritual herbs you bought were all used to concoct healing pills. Don't tell me you want to concoct your own pills?\"The moment his words left his mouth, countless people in the shop began to mock him.Alchemy?Not everyone could refine a pill.If anyone could use Alchemy, then the pellets wouldn't be so expensive.Alchemy Masters required talent.A fire attribute talent, control over fire. Only a martial artist with fire attribute talent would have the qualifications to become a Alchemy Master, but if they had the qualifications, they might not necessarily be able to become a Alchemy Master.Talent was extremely important.But money is more important.It was because Grand Alchemy Masters required countless spirit herbs to accumulate. It was unknown how much money they spent to cultivate a Alchemy Master and how many spirit herbs they had to purchase to be able to cultivate them.Even a clan like the Long family, which was one of the four pillars s, could only nurture a Yellow Rank Level Eight Alchemy Master.Becoming a Alchemy Master was simply too difficult.Even the imperial family had to curry favor with a high-grade Alchemy master, and even the sect wanted to hire him at a high price.\"Laugh at your sister.\" Long Fei cursed in annoyance, \"What are you being long-winded for? Whatever I buy, you just need to take whatever I buy.The assistant slightly said: \"I am only reminding you, not just anyone can become a Alchemy Master.\"After saying that, he did not waste any more words and quickly brought out a large bag of spiritual herbs. He placed it on the counter and said: \"Thirty portions each, take them away.\"This kind of low-grade spiritual herb was very cheap.However \u2026It was also because of the low level spiritual herbs that the success rate of refining pills was much more difficult.Good spiritual herbs could increase the success rate of medicinal pills, as well as their quality.Long Fei picked up the spirit grass and left.The assistant said in a mocking tone, \"You're welcome to come again next time.\"Long Fei turned his head to look at him, a ball of fire burning in his heart, and thought to himself: \"When I come next time, I'll definitely smash medicine in your face, f * ck you.\"On the way home, he bought a ground stall pill furnace and then hurried back to the thatched cottage.\u2026 \u2026.\"Young Master, what are you doing?\" jojo walked out of his room and watched Long Fei fiddle around in the courtyard.His face was pale, and his body was incomparably weak.Long Fei immediately stepped forward to support her, and said: \"jojo, I want to personally refine a healing pill to cure the pain on your body.\"\"Huh?\"jojo was stunned.Long Fei said: \"You don't believe me?\"jojo immediately shook his head, laughed lightly, and said: \"jojo believes in you, Young Master you are the best, no matter what you do, you will succeed.\"\"Heh heh \u2026\"\"This is my good jojo, you just stay here and watch. I will definitely concoct a healing pill to heal your injuries.\" Long Fei smiled confidently.\"Young Master, actually, the injuries on my body are all right.\" jojo did not want Long Fei to tire herself too much, so her Alchemy was extremely taxing on her mental energy.Moreover.The wounds on her body \u2026 She couldn't say it herself, but she could feel a strange power slowly healing her wounds. She couldn't say it either.They were locked up for half a year.There must be a reason why she was able to live through the torture she faced every day.However.She didn't know, neither did Long Fei, no one knew!Long Fei laughed: \"Just wait for me to personally concoct the Loving Healing Pill.\"jojo's face reddened, and his imagination ran wild again.A few minutes later.Long Fei fiddled around randomly and released the 'Alchemy Technique'.\"Bam!\"The pill furnace exploded.Long Fei's face was completely black, just like an African.jojo felt his heart ache, but he still held back from laughing.\"Ding!\"\"Alchemy failed, Alchemy Technique proficiency + 1\"The system sounded out.Long Fei was dumbstruck, he turned and gave jojo a silly smile, and said: \"A mistake, a mistake, it was all a mistake.\"Regarding Alchemy, he knew nothing at all.Long Fei muttered: \"He's really not giving me any face at all. The first time he failed, and in front of a beautiful woman, he even did it!\"When the furnace was gone, he ran into the kitchen to take down the huge iron pot and scolded, \"I want to see how you will blow up the furnace.\"jojo laughed again.Long Fei started his Alchemy again.\"Pfft!\"This time, the furnace did not explode, but instead made a noise as it turned into a ball of stinky air. Long Fei took a deep breath, his face red, his stomach rolling, he spat out everything he ate in the morning, and continued to shout: \"jojo, hold your breath, hold your breath!\"jojo looked at Long Fei's funny appearance and laughed heartily.As soon as she caught a whiff of the stench, her face immediately turned red, \"Young master, this is a gas bomb, right?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, he opened the system to check the attributes of the Alchemy technique and started to ponder.Cultivation Method: Alchemy TechniqueGrade: First-grade Yellow Rank (The better the grade, the higher the success rate and the higher the quality of the pill.)proficiency: 9/100\u2026 \u2026.Suddenly.Long Fei suddenly realized, \"Hahaha... I know, I finally know. \"\"What I need is not success, but the proficiency. As long as I raise the proficiency level up, I will be able to level up. The higher the level, the higher the success rate.\"What he needed to do now was to level up proficiency.It was just like a cultivation technique. The higher the level of a cultivation technique, the greater its damage!This was the same principle.Next.Long Fei's little universe began to erupt. It did not use all of the materials and Alchemy, but specifically used a stalk of spirit grass to refine pills.\"Then I shall use a hundred, a thousand, or even ten thousand failures to accumulate the levels of my Alchemy.\"\"Ding!\"\"Refinement failed, proficiency + 1\"\"Ding!\"\"Refinement failed, proficiency + 1\"\"Ding!\"\"Refinement failed, proficiency + 1\"\u2026 \u2026.The notification sound of failure continuously resounded in his mind.\"A failure is a success is his mother. If he fails, then so be it.\" Long Fei threw caution to the wind, every time he would use a stalk of Spirit Grass to level up his Alchemy, reducing his losses to the minimum.jojo was a little confused.Because \u2026Long Fei was too crazy, as though he had been bewitched, he continued to refine and fail.\"Ding!\"\"proficiency + 1\"Every time his Alchemy consumed one point of true breath, this point of consumption was still something he could bear.From day to night, Long Fei did not eat at all. He took off the big iron pot and there was nowhere for him to cook.\u2026 \u2026.\"What did you say?\"\"Long Fei is at the Alchemy? Hahaha... Just a broken waste of Pubes like him wants to use Alchemy? \" Long Zhanwu could not help but laugh out loud.After Long Fei returned home, he sent people to monitor them.Long Fei went to get the High Rank Healing Pills, to buy the Spirit Grass on the streets, he was completely aware of this.\"Tell me, how is his pill forging progress?\" Long Zhanwu asked.Then the guard said: \"From what I can see, young master Long Fei doesn't have any innate Alchemy, he blew up the pill furnace the first time, and used the poisonous gas the second time. He almost fainted himself because of it, and what followed after are endless failures, failures, and failures.He could not understand!He really didn't understand it.Even someone without Alchemy Inherent skill wouldn't be defeated like this.Long Zhanwu laughed even harder, \"Long Fei, I thought you had changed into something different. I didn't expect you to be that useless trash who can't even support a wall.\"It was even more difficult for a Alchemy Master than it was for a martial arts training.Becoming a Alchemy Master was even harder than ascending the heavens.Long Zhanye could not help but laugh as well: \"Big Brother, what exactly does Long Fei want to do?\"\"No matter what he does, he won't live long.\" Long Zhanwu laughed sinisterly, \"There is still one more month until the family assessment, at that time \u2026\"\"Long Fei, this is your last month, cherish it well.\" Long Zhanwu muttered to himself.Long Zhanye was slightly taken aback, then said: \"Big Brother, you can't be thinking \u2026\"Long Zhanwu said: \"That's right, I want to get rid of him in the clan examination.\"\"In the clan's test, life and death are determined, and with Long Fei's current cultivation, he will definitely die inside.\" Long Zhanye said.said: \"I don't have time, the Acting Clan Chief Long Zhanhai is about to come out of seclusion in one and a half months. I have to get rid of Long Fei before he comes out, that way I can use all of my strength to deal with him.\"\"The Long family should be in my hands. If it wasn't for Grand Elder's bias, why would it be Long Zhanhai's turn to take control of the Long family?\"\"Humph!\"Long Zhanwu was extremely unconvinced.\u2026 \u2026.\"Ding!\"\"Refinement failed, proficiency + 1\"Late at night.Long Fei was still unceasingly cultivating his Alchemy techniques and had not rested at all. As long as his Alchemy techniques finished cooling down, he would immediately release them.\"Ding!\"\"Alchemy technique upgraded, current level is Level 1!\"\"It leveled up!\"Long Fei was secretly excited, he checked the attribute of the first level of Alchemy technique and muttered: \"Level is not enough yet, let's go again!\"And then \u2026He threw himself into the embrace of 'Success His Mother' and sprinted forward with all his might.\"Ding!\"\"Fail!\"\"Ding!\"\"Fail...\"Always failing.Early morning.\"Ding!\"\"The Alchemy technique has been upgraded to rank 2!\"\"Huff \u2026\"After cultivating with all his might for an entire day and night, Long Fei finally managed to raise his Alchemy to the second level.Looking at the remaining herbs, he still had five apiece.Long Fei's heart calmed down and his expression became serious, \"Level two Alchemy Technique, a night of failed experience, I can be considered to have started training.\"\"Alchemy has truly begun below.\"And then \u2026Long Fei started to ignite the fire, the Spirit Grass was like a metal pot, \"The orchid root is of the yin attribute, after being placed in, the attribute of the metal chain flower will become stronger, and then placed in \u2026\"Long Fei was not idle after a day and night of failure.After failing a few hundred times, he had thoroughly understood the properties of these spiritual herbs. Now, he could say that no one knew the properties of these spiritual herbs better than him. Alchemy was not only about controlling the temperature of the fire, it was also about being able to clearly understand the attributes of the spirit herbs and the ratio of the spirit pellets.The fire was ignited.\"Boom!\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for successfully refining it.\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for refining the Highest Grade Medicine Powder, you have obtained 100 experience, 100 true breath and 20 points as your reward.\"\"Hahaha... Highest Grade Medicine Powder? \" Long Fei immediately checked it.Pills were also divided into good and bad quality.It was divided into 10 to 100% quality, and the highest quality pill was at least level 8.Pill: Healing PillGrade: Grade 1 Yellow Pills (Exquisite)true breath: 50 pointsQi and blood: 100 points\"jojo...\"Long Fei shouted excitedly, he turned and looked, and realised that jojo had fallen asleep while leaning on the doorframe, his peaceful appearance, was truly lovable.Long Fei gave a slight smile and said softly: \"jojo, this young master has succeeded, hehe \u2026\"\"I'll refine more first.\"\"Pills are too important to me. To be able to replenish my true breath, my Pubes is broken, and I am unable to comprehend or absorb the true breath. If I use up all my accumulated true breath, I will be unable to replenish them, and the pills will be able to make up for this weakness.\" The more he discovered the effects of the medicinal pellet on him, the more he was shocked.The remaining four parts were all successful.Two top-grade healing pills and three high-grade healing pills.Long Fei left a set of Highest Grade Medicine Powder s for jojo and then headed towards the street, \"Damn it, I will use pills to smash your face today!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It looks like I'll be able to receive a big order today.\" Zhao Er was so happy.The moment he opened the door.\"Whoosh!\"A black object was smashed into his face.Because he was caught off-guard, Zhao Er staggered backwards from the impact and directly fell to the ground, cursing angrily, \"Who is it? Who dares to behave atrociously in the Fengyuan Merchant Union? \"Fengyuan Merchant Union.One of the ten copmmercial alliances s.It was spread out in every corner of the god's martial continent.The Fengyuan Merchant Union involved pills, herbs, Magic Weapon, spiritual treasure... Any profitable business involved.Although they were in the business world, they still had a lot of power and influence. In the god's martial continent, anything could not be done without the support of force and influence.Although Zhao Er was just a shop assistant, he had always felt that he was not an ordinary shop assistant.Zhao Er's voice fell.Long Fei took a step forward, and said: \"It's this father!\"\"It's you?!\" Zhao Er recognized Long Fei with a single glance and said furiously, \"Then you must be tired of living.\"Long Fei laughed coldly and said, \"Come, come, come. Let me see who is tired of living. \"Before that, you'd better pick up the pills on the ground and have a good look.\"Finished.Long Fei immediately sat on the chair used to receive distinguished guests in the shop, \"Why is there no tea? Is this how you treat distinguished guests? \"Zhao Er's face burned with rage as he picked up the pellet on the ground, thinking to himself, \"I'll come take care of you later.\"He picked up the medicinal pill and carefully examined it. His brows secretly tightened as his heart thumped, \"High-grade healing medicinal pill?\"Then.Zhao Er retracted his anger and asked: \"You refined this healing pill?\"Long Fei said: \"Could it be that you refined it?\"Zhao Er was slightly angered and said: \"So what if you can refine a high quality healing pill? This is the pill shop of the Fengyuan Merchant Union. You'd better lower your arrogant attitude. \"Long Fei laughed: \"I am used to being arrogant, I don't know what it means to lower my head.\"\"Didn't you laugh at me yesterday?\"\"Your elder has refined a healing pill today, why don't you show me your smile?\"Zhao Er's brows tightened. Someone who could concoct a medicinal pellet, and a high quality healing pellet at that, must be using Alchemy. Even if he was a associate from the Fengyuan Merchant Union and gave him a hundred times the courage, he would not dare to offend a Alchemy master.However \u2026He sneered and said, \"You said you refined it?\" Maybe you bought it from somewhere else. \"\"What is it?\"At this moment, a sixty year old man walked out from inside. The old man was in high spirits and his steps were swift like the wind. With a single glance, one could tell that he was an expert.Zhao Er immediately went up to greet him, and said respectfully: \"Old Liu, this person has come to our shop to behave atrociously.\"Liu Feng looked at the healing pellet in Zhao Er's hand and took a glance at it. His expression immediately changed as he turned and stared at Long Fei, \"This is the healing pellet that you refined?\"Long Fei's face tensed up, he nodded: That's right.\"Huff \u2026\"Liu Feng muttered: \"The quality, quality, and imbued true breath, healing and recovery abilities are all high ranked.\"He was also a Alchemy Master, so he saw more things than Zhao Er.Liu Feng looked at Long Fei and asked again, \"Was it really cultivated by you?\"\"F * ck!\" Long Fei said: \"I refined it, I refined it, how many times do you want me to say it, stop blabbering, name a price.\"He was in a hurry to use the money.Alchemy techniques are basically piled up with spirit grass, without money how would a spirit grass come by?Liu Feng did not hesitate, and said: \"Three thousand.\"Long Fei almost choked, \"Three thousand gold?\"High-grade medicinal pills were only sold for 1300 taels, so he only sold them for 3000 taels. It seemed that this pill was several times better than ordinary high-grade medicinal pills.Liu Feng said: \"Too little?\"Long Fei said: \"It's only three thousand gold. I still have a healing pill with me, please give me your price.\"As he spoke \u2026Long Fei handed the Highest Grade Medicine Powder over, \"How much is this pill?\"At first, Liu Feng did not believe that Long Fei could concoct Alchemy, but after he received the second Highest Grade Medicine Powder, his expression shook, and his expression became extremely shocked. Even his hands were trembling a bit, \"The quality of the pill is one of the best quality, how did you concoct this healing pellet?\"Too excited.As he held Long Fei's hand, his face was filled with desire, as if he was a gay man.Long Fei quickly shook himself off and said: \"I'm telling you, how can I possibly have anything to eat? Do you think that anyone can refine Highest Grade Medicine Powder? \"He wasn't an idiot, who would dare to reveal the secret of the pill?Then again.It took him a day and a night to figure it out.However \u2026Every single Alchemy master was different. Even if Long Fei were to say it out loud, Liu Feng would not be able to do it that easily.\"I'm being rude. Wait a moment, I'll be right back.\" Liu Feng's face was full of excitement. He took the healing pellet and walked into the room, and said to Zhao Er halfway: \"Bring some tea, s.\"\"Holy Tea?\"Zhao Er was shocked, this was a tea that could raise true breath s.Liu Feng's brows furrowed, and said: \"Did you not understand? Shall I say it again? \"Zhao Er immediately nodded: \"I understand.\"Long Fei straightened his legs, crossed his legs, and hummed an unknown tune in his mouth. However, in his heart, he felt contempt: \"It's one of the ten copmmercial alliances, not just a Highest Grade Medicine Powder, you're scared to that extent, tsk!\"He then said to Zhao Er: \"You elders won't run away with my pills, right?\"Zhao Er handed over the Holy Tea, not daring to ridicule again. Disdain, replacing it was a respectful, fawning smile, even more intimate than his father's. He said: \"Don't worry, Elder Liu will definitely give you a satisfactory price.\"To cause Liu Feng to be so excited, he had never seen anything like this before.Long Fei picked up the tea and sniffed it, then gulped it down, \"Not bad, good tea.\"At this moment.His spirit was jolted.\"Ding!\"\"true breath Value + 10\"\"Huh?\" Long Fei did not know how to drink tea, he was just thirsty, but he never thought that it would increase the value of the true breath? He immediately said, \"One more cup, no \u2026\" Give me a pot. \"Zhao Er felt a wave of pain, the Holy Tea was worth thirty thousand gold per catty, the consumer could be very eye-catching and refreshing, it could also help with cultivation.Others were only sipping on it, but he was drinking it all in one gulp. It was such a waste of a precious resource.He had no choice.Zhao Er carried another cup.Long Fei disdainfully said: \"F * ck, you are too stingy. A cup after cup is not enough, I already told you to brew a pot for me, even if I can't finish it, I will take it with me and not waste it.\"After a day and night of using all his Alchemy, the true breath had been completely used up.Zhao Er really wanted to die.

I was thinking of packing some tea leaves to take with me.\" Long Fei sighed.Zhao Er's face turned green, as he held his stomach.Long Fei asked: \"What's wrong?\"Zhao Er replied: \"My liver hurts.\"It was also at this time.Liu Feng walked out with a face full of smiles, \"Little brother, our pavilion master is very satisfied with your pills, you can offer a price of five thousand silvers per pellet.\"Zhao Er walked over to Liu Feng's side and whispered: \"Elder Liu, the Holy Tea you loved has been completely drunk by him.\"It wanted to be angry, but when he saw that Long Fei could not send it out, he forced a smile and said: Little brother, you really know how to drink.Looking at the tea leaves on the table, he felt a pang in his heart.Long Fei laughed: \"This tea is not bad, too bad you guys don't have it, why don't you pack it up and take it away.\"Liu Feng's face darkened, as if his body was unwell.Long Fei could not help but ask: \"Elder Liu, what's wrong?\"Liu Feng said bitterly: \"My liver hurts.\"\"Huh?\"\"Why does everyone's liver hurt?\" Long Fei muttered, and said: \"Give me the money, I still have to go buy breakfast for jojo.\"Liu Feng smiled merrily as he looked at Long Fei, and said: \"Little brother, we pavilion masters are extremely satisfied with the pellets you refine. I wonder which clan or sect you belong to? If you don't, our Pavilion Master wants to hire you to become a high-level Alchemy Master in our Fengyuan Merchant Union. \"Long Fei replied without thinking: \"Not interested, my Alchemy is just an amateur plaything.\"\"Amateur?\"Liu Feng really wanted to die. Amateur could refine top quality pills, but he, who was a professional Alchemy master, had never refined a top quality pill in his entire life.Competing with someone else, he simply didn't need to live anymore.Most importantly, according to what Zhao Er had said, the boy in front of him, in just a day and a night, had become a Alchemy master, and was able to refine top quality pellets.Liu Feng did not want to miss this opportunity, and said: \"Rest assured, we will not restrict your freedom \u2026\"\"I'm really hungry. Why don't we talk about it next time?\" Long Fei said, he was thinking that jojo might be even hungrier, and when he thought about the Hibiscus Bun, he felt that he couldn't take it anymore.To make Liu Feng, the alchemist of the Fengyuan Merchant Union, beg for help, it was probably only Long Fei.The key was \u2026Long Fei still did not appreciate it.Liu Feng had no choice but to say: \"How about this, we will buy all of your pills, we will have priority on buying them, and give you a twenty percent discount on the Fengyuan Merchant Union's goods and spirit herbs, what do you think?\"The Holy Tea had already been drunk up by Long Fei. If he couldn't earn it back from Long Fei, then he would really suffer a huge loss.Long Fei thought for a moment, then nodded: \"Alright.\"He had made a killing this time.Just fifty percent of it was enough to save him a lot of time, and he still had to cultivate the Refining Technics, the Engraving Formation, and the Puppet Technique \u2026 All of these would require a large amount of money to buy the materials. The Fengyuan Merchant Union would provide the materials and even offer a discount to buy them, it was simply too satisfying for Long Fei.Liu Feng's face was filled with excitement, he immediately took out a purple gold card and handed it over to Long Fei, and said: This is a purple gold card issued by our Fengyuan Merchant Union, in the future, as long as you show it, it will give you a 20% discount.Following that \u2026He then took out a gold card and said, \"This is ten thousand taels of silver. Eight thousand taels is for buying medicinal pills, and the other two thousand taels can be considered as a small token of goodwill from our Pavilion Master.\"Long Fei kept the two cards, without even looking at them, he smiled: Alright, then that's settled, if there's anything else, I'll be leaving first, bye!After which, he hurriedly ran out.Liu Feng and Zhao Er were completely dumbstruck.Zhao Er looked at Long Fei's disappearing figure and muttered: \"Elder Liu, is he not shocked? \"That's a purple-gold card! The Fengyuan Merchant Union has only issued 500 purple-gold cards in the five thousand years it was established. Did he not even take a look?\"I don't understand!I really don't understand.The price of the Purple Card in the black market was ten thousand Spirit Stones. This was something that ordinary money could not afford.Long Fei didn't even glance at it.Liu Feng was also at a loss, he did not understand, and said: \"If he doesn't know what a Purple Gold Card is, it is understandable, but if he knows that the Purple Gold Card is still so, it can only prove one thing, he does not even put the Purple Gold Card in his eyes, and does not even put the Fengyuan Merchant Union in his eyes, his identity may be so precious that we cannot even imagine it.\"\"If that's the case...\"Liu Feng did not dare to think further.However \u2026They would never have thought that Long Fei was really, really, very hungry.Of course.As for the Purple Gold Card?He had no idea.In the attic.A young lady wearing a veil looked at Long Fei's back and muttered: \"In one day and one night, I will be able to refine top quality medicinal pellets. If I can use it, I will be able to control the entire medicine market in Fire Glass Dynasty.\"The power of the Purple Gold Card was tremendous.This was the first time in the history of the Fengyuan Merchant Union that a low-grade Alchemy master was gifted this easily.She was not betting on Long Fei's current state, but on Long Fei's future!\u2026 \u2026.Long family, a thatched cottage at the foot of the mountain.jojo was conflicted for half an hour before she swallowed the Healing Pill that Long Fei left behind. She was worried about some kind of 'smelly bomb', but after consuming it, she realized that the wounds on her body were healing quickly.Even the injuries within his body were rapidly recovering, and they were extremely miraculous.\"Young Master succeeded.\"\"It really succeeded.\"jojo was overjoyed.Not long after, Long Zhanwu arrived.jojo's face darkened, and became a little afraid.Long Zhanwu glanced at the pale-faced jojo, and coldly asked: \"Where did Long Fei go?\"jojo did not dare to look straight at Long Zhanwu. He lowered his head and said with a slightly trembling voice, \"Young Master Long Fei went out.Long Zhanwu's voice became even colder, \"You don't know?\"jojo immediately shook his head and said: \"I don't know, I really don't know.\"Even if he knew jojo would not reveal a single word.Suddenly.She knelt down and pleaded: \"Great Clan Elder, please don't hurt Young Master, I'm begging you, you can do whatever you want with jojo, I'm begging you, don't hurt him, it's not easy for him, I'm begging you.\"Tears streamed down his face.A disdainful sneer surfaced on Long Zhanwu's face. \"What kind of master would be what kind of trash slave?\"It was also at this moment.Long Fei ran into the courtyard and said with a smile, \"jojo, come and eat buns, your favorite hibiscus buns.\"Seeing Long Zhanwu, Long Fei's heart tensed up, and he shouted: \"Long Zhanwu, what are you doing here?\"Long Zhanwu said coldly: \"Is there anything about the Long family that I can't come to?\"Long Fei frowned, and started to act cautiously.At this moment.He was facing a great enemy!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He looked at Long Zhanwu as if he was facing a great enemy, and asked again: What are you doing here?Long Zhanwu saw that the courtyard was in a mess and there were spirit grass everywhere. He could not help but sneer and said: \"You think it's possible for you to obtain Alchemy?\"Long Fei laughed instead: \"What does this young master's refinement care about you? Long Zhanwu, if you have something to fart, hurry up and fart. If you're here to mock my Alchemy, then very good, you've done it.\"Long Zhanwu stared at Long Fei, and said: \"Tell me, how great is it for you to be a piece of trash. You've already left the Long family, what is your purpose in coming back?\"\"Since you want to come back, then I have no other choice.\"\"One month later, I will participate in the clan examination. If I fail the examination, I will be expelled from the Long Clan. The Long Clan will not raise trash!\"Long Fei's face turned cold, \"Family assessment?\"\"This young master seems to have special privileges, there is no need for me to participate right?\"He was the appointed young master of the Long family, the future duke of Divine Dragon.Long Zhanwu laughed loudly, \"Privileges? Hahaha... Long Fei, do you really think you are the Long Fei of the past? At that time, you possessed the Dragon God's blood essence, so you could indeed enjoy the privilege of not participating. Broken Pubes, dense meridians, low level of cultivation, Fire Glass City's laughingstock, are these? \"Ridicule!It was an undisguised mockery.Underneath his sleeves, Long Fei clenched his fists and clenched them tightly.Long Zhanwu continued: \"Long Fei, you don't have a choice. It's best if you participate this time.At this moment.Long Zhanwu's eyes looked at jojo who was behind Xiang Longfei, and coldly said: \"I am not Long Da Yao, and my methods are ten thousand times more vicious than his.\"\"Cluck, cluck \u2026\" Long Fei gritted his teeth so hard that his teeth were popping out, \"I hate people who threaten me the most.\"Long Zhanwu laughed: \"I'm just threatening you.\"Long Fei's eyes narrowed, and said: \"Okay, I will participate, but... Long Zhanwu, let me remind you, people who threaten me won't be able to live for long. \"In an instant.The martial king battle qi was released from Long Zhanwu's body, it was filled with dense killing intent.Long Fei's heart sank. Being crushed by the war chief's battle energy was incomparably uncomfortable.Another moment.Long Zhanwu retracted his battle spirit, and said with a cold smile: \"I'm waiting!\"Finished.Long Zhanwu left the courtyard with a smile on his face.\"Huff \u2026\"Long Fei instantly collapsed and fell flat on his butt, \"Fuck, the pressure of the war chief's battle qi is really unbearable, Long Zhanwu, just you wait, sooner or later, there will be a little bit of your chrysanthemum that will explode!\"jojo said worriedly: \"Young master, the family tests are all aimed at the elite disciples of the Long family that are older than twenty. You are only sixteen, yet Long Zhanwu allowed you to participate, he is obviously making things difficult for you.\"Difficult?They wanted him dead!Long Fei smiled, and said: \"Don't worry, who is this young master, a mere clan examination will not be difficult for me.\"In his memories, there were also things about the family assessment.It was very difficult!For the current Long Fei, it was extremely difficult.The elite members of the Long family were all at least fifth step Battle-Masters, and all of them had a strong aura of dragon blood.It was very clear that Long Zhanwu wanted him to participate in the Family Exam to get rid of him.Long Fei muttered in his heart: \"There's still a month's time. I must become even stronger in this one month.\"Even if Long Zhanwu didn't force him to participate, he would still participate.Because \u2026The rewards of being in the top few of the family assessment was simply too generous.Other than that.The system also had points as a reward, and Long Fei had to participate just based on that.\"jojo, don't worry. Come here, it's your favorite Hibiscus hibiscus buns.\" Long Fei smiled, and started to plan to become stronger.\u2026 \u2026.There were many ways to become strong.This was the most direct way to raise one's cultivation base.There are other ways.A spirit weapon possessed a top grade spirit weapon, and its combat strength would increase.Talismans possessed high-grade talismans. A single talisman could annihilate a group of people, and their combat prowess would increase.Puppet Technique was also possible.\u2026 \u2026.A month's time was very short, it was already impossible to enter the Fire Glass Mountain Range again.\"I want to become stronger!\"\"I have to become stronger.\" Long Fei thought fiercely in his heart, \"Let's start with the talismans.\"Time was of the essence, he would do as he said.Morning.Long Fei brought out cinnabar, talisman paper, an essential item to make talismans.\"Let's try our luck first.\"Long Fei moved his hand, pen moving and flying dragon, he injected true breath into it and started drawing on the talisman in one breath, at the same time releasing the talisman technique.One minute later.Long Fei withdrew his true breath. His forehead was covered in sweat as he shouted, \"Done!\"\"Ding!\"\"Talisman failed, proficiency + 1\"\"F * ck!\"Long Fei picked up the talisman that he had drawn just now, and could not look at it directly, it was just a drawing of a talisman, he thought bitterly in his heart, \"Damn, looks like I do not have any skills in talismans, alright, I will make up for it, if I fail, it will be his grandmother, I will train!\"The training began once more.\"Ding!\"\"Talisman failed, proficiency + 1\"\"Ding!\"\"Talisman failed, proficiency + 1\"\"Ding!\"\"Talisman failed, proficiency + 1\"\u2026 \u2026.Every single time, Long Fei was incomparably meticulous. It was not just simply accumulating proficiency s, but it was also an endless process of summing up the reasons for his failures.Next time.Progress by improvement.It was not that the accumulation of proficiency would make the technique and Level Increase very easy to succeed, but it was not like that.Just like Alchemy.You must be very familiar with the properties of the Spirit Grass, the golden ratio, in order to be able to refine the supreme grade pellet, the talisman is the same.One failure after another.One step after another.An hour passed.Long Fei was drenched all over, he was completely exhausted, and his body felt like it had collapsed.Alchemy, Talismans, Artifact Forging \u2026 A series of Auxiliary Method s required spiritual energy.The mind of the talisman was extremely focused, and a slight distraction instantly failed, while the mind energy was constantly being overtaxed, to the point that Long Fei was almost unable to endure it.However.He did not stop to rest.At the same time as he was carving talismans, he was also increasing his spiritual power.Three hours later.Long Fei continued.Five hours later, he was still failing.However \u2026He was getting closer and closer to success. He was already able to finish inscribing the talisman, and was only missing the last few strokes.Ten hours later.Long Fei continued.\"Long Zhanwu, just you wait, if you want to die, then wait and see, you have to see who dies first!\"\"Ding!\"\"Talisman failed, proficiency + 1.\"\"Continue!\"\u2026 \u2026.Long Zhanwu's courtyard.\"Hahaha... Now that his Alchemy has failed and he is now carving talismans, he can't be crazy, right? \" Long Zhanwu laughed out loud, feeling more and more that Long Fei was still that trash Long Fei.\"The talisman has failed, could it be that he was refining again?\"\"Long Fei, oh Long Fei, what are you going to use to fight me? If I were you, I would definitely commit suicide. \"\"Hahaha \u2026\"Long Zhanwu laughed out loud. As long as he could get rid of Long Fei and deal with him, the Long family would be in his hands!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Yesterday, he had even received a special reward for Long Fei's matter.This was the first time he had received such a reward.\"Quick, quick, give me a pot of Holy Tea.\" Long Fei walked into the shop and acted as if he was going to die.However \u2026He was reluctant to consume the healing pill.When Zhao Er saw Long Fei, his eyes darkened and he thought to himself, \"The ancestor is here.\"\"Little Ancestor, you drank all the Holy Tea yesterday. There's really nothing left.\" Zhao Er said bitterly.Even if he had it, he couldn't take it out.The guy in front of him wasn't just drinking a cup, he was drinking as much as he could.Long Fei grinned and said: \"Not even one cup?\"Zhao Er shook his head, and said: \"I really don't have it, I swear to the heavens.\"\"F * ck!\"\"The Fengyuan Merchant Union isn't much either. After drinking all the Holy Tea, they won't buy any more, it's so boring.\" Long Fei regained his composure.At this time, Liu Feng walked out of the house. Seeing Long Fei, he immediately went up and greeted him: \"Little brother, could it be that you have refined another batch of Highest Grade Medicine Powder?\"Long Fei laughed: \"No.\"Looking at Long Fei's exhausted expression, it was definitely caused by his Alchemy. Since Long Fei said that he didn't, he didn't press him.Long Fei asked: \"Old Liu, I came here to ask if you have any fresh beast blood here?\"Liu Feng was surprised for a moment, and said: \"What do you need the blood essence of a Goblin Beast for?\"Long Fei said: \"Don't ask about this, when it's time to let you know, I will definitely let you know, just tell me if you have it or not.\"Liu Feng looked at Zhao Er.Zhao Er immediately said: \"This morning, someone delivered a Level 5 Sword Teeth Tiger, its blood essence and energy is plentiful.\"\"five level monster s?\"Long Fei was shocked, and immediately said: \"I want all the blood essence, name a price.\"Zhao Er said: \"100 thousand, you are a purple gold member, 10% discount, 80 thousand.\"\"Your sister!\"Long Fei was immediately dumbstruck. The blood essence of five level monster was actually expensive to this extent? Even if I sold him, it wouldn't be worth so much money.Liu Feng laughed and said, \"Go and bring all the blood and essence of the level five Sword Teeth Tiger over.\"Zhao Er quickly took out a jar that was covered with runes and said, \"Everything is inside.\"Liu Feng received it and directly put it in Long Fei's hands: \"It's only eighty thousand silver. Take it and use it first.Long Fei was so moved that tears almost flowed out, \"Thank you, I finally met a good person, Old Liu, you really are a living Bodhisattva.\"\"Give me a thousand more sets of spiritual herbs to concoct a healing pill.\"\"Cough, cough, cough...\" Liu Feng started to pant, and his face flushed red. No matter how he looked at Long Fei, he just wanted to be a hooligan that didn't care about face.Long Fei said righteously: \"I will pay you. I will owe you.\"Liu Feng didn't know whether to laugh or cry, and said: \"Give it to him.\"Zhao Er had no choice, he packed for half an hour before he could prepare a thousand sets of Spirit Grass, and said: \"Clan Elder, our shop only has so many Spirit Grass for the Healing Pill.\"Without waiting for Liu Feng to speak, Long Fei took the large bag of Spirit Grass and laughed: \"Thank you.\"\"Since there are no Holy Tea here, then I will not stay any longer. Bye bye!\"After which, he ran away like a rabbit and disappeared without a trace in an instant.Liu Feng didn't know whether to laugh or cry.Even the mysterious woman in the pavilion couldn't help but laugh out loud.\u2026 \u2026.Back home.Long Fei immediately got busy.After concocting a few Superior Grade Healing Pills, he consumed them all.The value of the true breath rose to full.Rest for half an hour to recover your spiritual energy.Following that \u2026Long Fei walked to the table and opened the jar of level five Sword Teeth Tiger blood essence, muttering: \"The cinnabar's power is too weak, it's not easy to control, and the talismans made from cinnabar do not have a very dense true breath to insert into it, they are too weak.\"Long Fei was only a sixth level Battle-Master, his true breath value was pitifully low.He could not inject too much true breath into the talismans he refined. If he wanted to increase the power of the talismans, he could only use other powers to do so.Demon beast blood essence was an excellent substitute.The wolf pen moved.With the Sword Teeth Tiger's blood essence, he activated the true breath, causing the blood essence to flash with light, and at the same time, Long Fei started to use the 'Rank 2 Glyph Technique'.Every stroke was the movement of true breath.whoosh whoosh whoosh \u2026 *It was almost a synthesis.\"Ding!\"\"Refining a beast Sword Teeth Tiger Spell Note, obtaining 100 points of Experience Points, 100 points of true breath value, and 10 points of reward.\"\"Top quality talisman?\"Long Fei was ecstatic, and immediately checked.Glyph: Sword Teeth Tiger Spell NoteGrade: Grade 2 (Exquisite)Attribute: Mystic Beast TypeDescription: Able to release a level five Sword Teeth Tiger to fight.Description 2: The user will have an increase in illusion attributes. The user's power will increase by 15%.\"Wow!\"\"Ripping apart a war spirit Realm Ranker, that's too awesome, hahaha \u2026\" Long Fei was suddenly overjoyed, the power of the attack was simply off the charts.\"Good stuff, good stuff, hahaha \u2026\"\"Continue!\"Long Fei did not stop, he had only used his beast blood essence to replace the cinnabar for experiment, he was very excited about the success of the experiment now, but \u2026 What he was really refining was not a level five Sword Teeth Tiger, but a level nine Flood Dragon! If the talisman made from the blood of the Flood Dragon was successful, it would definitely be extremely terrifying!\"Ding!\"\"Refinement failed, proficiency + 1\"\"Ding!\"\"Refinement failed, proficiency + 1\"\u2026 \u2026.Not every time.Every time he failed, Long Fei would stop to think. The demon beast's blood essence was completely different from cinnabar.\"Ding!\"\"Refining a water attribute Sword Teeth Tiger Spell Note, 100 experience, 100 true breath, 10 points reward.\"\"Ding!\"\"Fused with a wind attribute Sword Teeth Tiger Spell Note, obtained 100 experience points, 100 true breath points, and 10 points reward.\"Long Fei spent the entire day refining it.Because he had fused with a level nine wind, water, and magic demon cores, many of the talismans he refined all carried additional enhancements.He had finished refining a whole jar of Sword Teeth Tiger's essence and blood.Long Fei was not in a hurry to refine the 'Level Nine Flood Dragon Blood Essence.' Flood Dragon Blood Essence was much stronger than Sword Teeth Tiger Blood Essence. Long Fei looked at the talismans beside him, \"Eighteen talismans, ten top quality talismans, eight ordinary talismans, think of a way to test its power.\"At this moment.A burst of laughter came from outside the yard.\"Little beauty, please play with me.\"Long Fei's eyes became angry, \"jojo!\"He immediately rushed out!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I will definitely not treat you unfairly.\" Long Cheng's face was filled with vulgarity, he stared at jojo's chest as he desperately swallowed his saliva.On the other side, Long Ao intentionally said: \"Big Brother Long Cheng, she is Long Fei's personal servant.\"\"Long Fei?\"\"That the Great trash whose Pubes was destroyed and the Long family's humiliation?\" Dragon City sneered and disdainfully said, \"It's actually his maid. This is simply a waste of a heaven's treasure. Little beauty, from today onwards, you will follow me. This young master will definitely let you live a carefree life, hahaha \u2026\"jojo berated angrily: \"Young Master Long Fei is not trash, he's stronger than any of you.\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"Little beauty, the Pubes has shattered and its tendons and veins are congealed. Isn't this trash?\"\"Even if he's not trash, beating him up with my cultivation of Eight-level Warrior is as easy as beating a dog.\" Dragon City sneered.Long Ao's face became even more proud.He was the one who brought the Dragon City.Last time at the Hibiscus Restaurant, at the back of the mountain, he couldn't take this lying down after receiving just a few slaps from Long Fei.Isn't your Long Fei war division realm?Then find a Eight-level Warrior, I don't believe I won't be able to kill you.Long Ao laughed: \"Brother Cheng, I guess that grandson Long Fei would not dare to come out. jojo, you just have to accompany Brother Cheng to have a good time, I will not treat you unfairly.\"Dragon City swallowed its saliva and said excitedly, \"Right, right, right, that useless young master of yours doesn't dare to come out. If he does, he'll be beaten down by me. Just obediently accompany me, hahaha \u2026\"At this moment.\"Humiliate the Young Lord.\"\"Sin, die!\"As soon as he finished.Long Fei was already standing at the courtyard entrance.jojo immediately ran over to Long Fei's side and pulled him back: \"Young Master, I'm fine, forget it, let's go back.\"She was worried about Long Fei.After all, the Dragon City possessed the Dragon Blood Qi and was in the Eight-level Warrior Realm.Dragon City's eyes turned sinister and he snorted, \"Trash, what did you say just now? Young Lord? If trash like you can become the Long family's young master, then any beggar on the street can become the Long family's young master. \"\"I advise you to hand over the little beauty, otherwise you will be beaten until she becomes a dead dog on the ground.\"\"F * ck!\" Long Fei was immediately enraged, \"The Eight-level Warrior realm right? It just happens to use the power of the Sword Teeth Tiger Spell Note you are training with. \"While they were talking \u2026Long Fei moved, taking out a talisman, he activated the true breath, \"Go!\"The talisman exploded in midair.A Sword Teeth Tiger suddenly rushed out.\"Roar \u2026\"He opened his bloody mouth and immediately threw Dragon City to the ground, biting down on it.Blood splattered everywhere.\"Ah... \"Ah \u2026\" A scream like a pig being butchered rang out.In less than ten seconds.Under the pressure of the Sword Teeth Tiger, he did not have any strength to resist and was quickly bitten to death.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for obtaining 1000 experience points when killing 'Dragon City', 100 true breath points, 10 Energy Values points.\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for obtaining 'Moonwheel Saber Technique'.\"\u2026 \u2026.\"Long Fei, how dare you! You actually dare to kill a disciple of the Long family in broad daylight.\" Long Ao roared.In that instant.Long Fei's figure moved, \"Pa!\"He directly slapped Long Ao down onto the ground with a slap, stepped on his head, and pressed him down into the mud as he coldly said: \"Long Ao, there is a limit to my patience. It's best if you don't provoke me again, otherwise, Dragon City will be your ending.\"Finished.He kicked Long Ao flying.It wasn't that he didn't dare to kill Long Fei, but that he still couldn't.Long Zhanwu's cultivation was something he couldn't fight against right now.If he killed Long Ao, Long Zhanwu would definitely get rid of him no matter what.Long Ao was so scared that his face turned pale. He crawled up with much difficulty and said: \"Long Fei, I won't let you go. Just you wait.\"Long Fei took out a talisman from his bosom.Long Ao turned around and ran, he was so scared that he pissed his pants, and hated his mother for giving him two less legs.\u2026 \u2026.\"Awesome!\"Long Fei was incomparably excited, \"A top grade Sword Teeth Tiger Spell Note could tear apart a war spirit Realm warrior, and a normal Sword Teeth Tiger Spell Note could even instantly kill a war division realm Realm warrior, this power is indeed not for nothing, hahaha \u2026\"Dragon City's Eight-level Warrior, one talisman was easily dealt with.If he had enough talismans, then who would he need to be afraid of in the clan exam?However \u2026Activating the talisman took Long Fei 300 true breath s to activate. He could only activate the true breath three times, so he had to be careful.\u2026 \u2026.\"What?\"\"You said that the Eight-level Warrior's Dragon City was instantly killed by Long Fei's talisman?\" Long Zhanwu was furious, she wanted nothing more than to kick this disappointing son of his out of the hall.Long Zhanye's brows sank, \"Didn't you say that he had always failed when refining talismans? \"What's going on?\"The disciple who had been monitoring Long Fei the entire time lowered his head and said: \"This subordinate has been keeping an eye on Long Fei, and he has indeed been failing, but this morning I found out that he had gone to the Spirit Potion Shop in the Fengyuan Merchant Union, and probably bought the talismans from the Fengyuan Merchant Union, even with his useless body, he would not be able to refine any talismans.\"Long Zhanwu didn't care about all this, and fiercely said: \"Long Fei, there is a limit to my patience, don't be too presumptuous, or else \u2026\"Long Zhanye immediately said in a low voice: \"Big brother, please calm your anger. It's just a dragon city, if we die, we die. Don't mess up our plans just because of him.\"\"If we attack now, Long Zhanhai will grab onto our weakness the moment he comes out of seclusion, and then we will lose the initiative.\"\"Cluck, cluck \u2026\"Long Zhanwu clenched both of his fists tightly, and with an explosive sound, he said, \"The Family Exam, Long Fei, that is your doomsday!\"Long Zhanwu said in a deep voice, \"From today onwards, you are not allowed to provoke Long Fei anymore, go into closed door cultivation for me.\"Long Ao did not dare to speak.And then \u2026Long Zhanye said: \"Big brother, in three days there will be an auction in the Fengyuan Merchant Union. I heard that this time, there will be a failure token.\"Flatten Feather Command!\"\"failure alliance!\"One of the most mysterious organizations in the god's martial continent.It was also the continent's strongest assassination organization.As long as he activated the Flowing Light Plating on the failure alliance, he would be able to request the failure alliance to do anything to kill anyone.From the creation of the failure alliance until now, there had not been a single failure.Long Zhanye said in a low voice: \"Long Zhanhai has yet to come out, you have the treasury of the Long Family in your hands. As long as you use the treasury to purchase this tokens, at that time \u2026 As long as Long Zhanhai comes out of closed door cultivation, I will be able to activate the Flowing Light Feather Order. \"This was an excellent opportunity.Taking advantage of the fact that the Acting Patriarch, Long Zhanhai, had yet to come out of seclusion, Long Zhanwu was able to control everything in the Long family.Long Zhanwu laughed.The smile was very sinister and sinister.It seemed.He saw the scene of himself ascending the Long family's Patriarch's throne, and becoming a Divine Dragon Marquis!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Take this, these talismans only need a little bit of the true breath to activate.\"jojo had no choice but to accept it.Long Fei asked again: \"jojo, have you ever thought about cultivating to become a warrior?\"jojo shook his head, and said: \"It's good that I can stay by Young Master's side.\"Long Fei muttered to himself: \"Once we get a good blood lineage to fuse with her, it would be hard to survive without cultivation in this god's martial continent.\"would definitely not stay by her side forever, so she had to make jojo stronger.After eating the delicious food cooked by jojo, Long Fei busied himself in the courtyard. After refining the ten Highest Grade Medicine Powder s, he walked on the main street.\u2026 \u2026.\"Why are you here again?\"\"Didn't you just come yesterday?\" Zhao Er was a little afraid when he saw Long Fei. Without waiting for Long Fei to ask, he took the lead and said: \"There really aren't any Holy Tea.\"\"Holy sh * t!\"\"You stingy fellow, did I say I want to drink Holy Tea?\" Long Fei was about to say a pot of Holy Tea s and ask: \"Is Elder Liu in?\"Liu Feng walked out of the house, and said with a smile: \"Brother is here.\"Long Fei did not dawdle and directly took out a normal Sword Teeth Tiger talisman.\"Huh?\"Liu Feng was startled, \"Talisman?\"And then \u2026The idea moved and entered the talisman's energy to sense it. A few seconds later, its face sank and immediately pulled Long Fei, and said: \"This is the talisman you refined?\"Long Fei said: \"That's right.\"Liu Feng stared at Long Fei, his eyes motionless.Long Fei said with disdain: \"Even if you don't want to bid, you're still looking at me like that.\"After a long time.Liu Feng said, \"Are you still human?\"\"I'm not human, could I be a ghost?\" Long Fei said.Liu Feng immediately changed his words: \"What I mean is, aren't you a little too abnormal? Being able to use Alchemy and even refine talismans, don't tell me your Innate Ability is a double attribute?\"Fire Attribute, Alchemy.One also needed attributes to refine talismans.The attribute of the bone root determines everything.However \u2026Long Fei didn't even know what kind of attributes his Innate Ability was, \"Don't clean up such useless things, hurry up and quote your price.\"\"Come in and talk!\" Liu Feng was afraid that Long Fei would not be able to escape, so he pulled Long Fei inside.They arrived at the inner hall.Liu Feng immediately shouted out, \"Bring the tea, serve the best Holy Tea.\"\"Didn't you say that there are no Holy Tea?\"\"F * * k, you're too stingy.\"\"Give me a pot!\" Long Fei shamelessly shouted out.This time Liu Feng was not stingy, and said: \"First pot!\"Following that, Liu Feng said excitedly: \"Your talisman is a high grade third rank talisman, the war division realm warriors will not be able to block it, the price per sheet is about fifty thousand gold.\"\"Rub!\" Long Fei was surprised for a moment, and said: \"Then, take a look at this piece, what's the price?\"Liu Feng took the other talisman, idea s, and his body instantly started trembling. A top quality talisman with attribute attacks, this \u2026 \"This is too unbelievable, how did you manage to refine it?\"Talismans and Alchemy were the same.It was extremely difficult to refine high grade talismans, and it was even more impossible to refine top grade talismans. Even a Grandmaster would find it difficult to refine talismans with attributes.It was precisely because of this that Liu Feng was so excited.Long Fei said: \"You don't need to care about that, just name a price.\"\"Two hundred thousand!\" Liu Feng said, \"This talisman should be able to easily crush a war spirit Realm warrior, what a powerful strength.\"\"My god.\" Long Fei was shocked, \"Seems like I won't have to worry about my future.\"Following that \u2026Long Fei took out six talismans, three of them had an attribute to them, and three of them were ordinary talismans, and said: \"A total of eight in total.\"\"Eight? Eight? \"Zhang!\"Liu Feng's breathing hastened, his hands shaking uncontrollably.Long Fei could not help but ask: \"Are you alright?\"\"It's okay, it's okay, man, you really surprised me.\" Liu Feng became excited, and just as he was about to offer a price, he thought about the auction three days later, and immediately said: \"Brother, do you believe in me?\"Long Fei immediately took back the talisman, and said: \"Don't tell me you want to owe us money?\"\"Cough, cough, cough...\" Liu Feng choked and then laughed: \"The Fengyuan Merchant Union never owes money. What I want to say is, if these talismans are placed at the auction in three days time, they will definitely fetch a high price. At that time, you can earn even more.\"\"So it's like that.\"Long Fei's heart dropped, and he said: \"Auction? Is there anything good there? \"Liu Feng smiled mysteriously: \"I cannot tell you the specifics, but the Fire Glass City, the Imperial Family, and even the nobles will participate.Currently, even the Fire Glass City was discussing about the auction in three days.Even.The consortia from other countries had come over.His goal was the Flowing Light Medallion.Long Fei didn't know much about the 'Falling Feather Token', so he asked: \"What is a Fail Feather Token?\"Liu Feng said in a low voice: \"The Flowing Light Feather Token is the token that was given out when the failure alliance was first created. A Flowing Light Feather Spirit can request the failure alliance to kill a person for you, no matter who it is, in a place with the Flowing Light Feather Token. Right now, there are very few Crocottas Quintet Spirit on the market. If you can obtain the Crunch Feather Token, that would be equivalent to receiving the protection of the failure alliance. No one would dare to offend you. \"\"So awesome?\" Long Fei secretly clicked his tongue, \"The assassination organisations are really popular.\"Liu Feng laughed: \"It's not just amazing, once the Flowing Light Feather Command is released, it will set off another wave of slaughter.\"Long Fei did not care about all these, his current goal was to become stronger, and it would be best if he could prepare to take the Clan Exam as soon as possible. As for other matters, he simply did not have the mind to care about them, and said: \"Then do as you say, I also want to buy some things, I don't have any money on me.\"Naturally, he would not miss a good show.Since it was an auction, there might be something that he could use.Liu Feng laughed: \"Nothing else in the Fengyuan Merchant Union is just money, just give me your gold card.\"Long Fei took out his gold card.It just so happened that Zhao Er was carrying a pot of Holy Tea at this time, and he said to Long Fei with an apologetic smile: \"I just arrived, just arrived, it really is a new Holy Tea.\"Long Fei rolled her eyes at him, and said: \"Since you just arrived, then pack me a catty of tea later.\"\"Huh?\"Zhao Er looked at Liu Feng bitterly.Liu Feng laughed: \"Isn't it just a Holy Tea, help me pack a jin of it. This is his gold card, deposit one million gold.\"\"Puchi!\"Long Fei spat out a mouthful of tea, \"One million silver?\"Liu Feng slightly said: \"Is that not enough?\"\"Then deposit it in two million.\"This time, Long Fei's breathing became a little hurried, and he immediately said: \"Enough, enough.\"Zhao Er did not dare to ask anymore as he ran out.\u2026 \u2026.\"Two million silver?\"\"What concept?\" Long Fei was a little distracted as he walked down the street, \"I'm rich, I'm rich, hahaha \u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If it failed, it would be gone.And then \u2026Long Fei immediately looked at the properties of the talisman.Talisman: Wyrm Long Fei Heavenly TalismanGrade: Third-rank (god level)Activating: 1500 true breath sDamage: Instant kill of all Level 5 war chief Warriors!\"Gudong!\"\"Instantly killing all the warriors at the fifth level of war chief, hahaha \u2026 Long Zhanwu, what level of cultivation are you at? \" Long Fei was incomparably excited.With this Winged Flood Dragon Long Fei's Heavenly Talisman, it was equivalent to possessing a protective talisman. There was no need to be afraid when facing Long Zhanwu in the future.However \u2026There was one thing that made Long Fei a little unhappy.Activating this talisman would cost 1500 true breath s. He only had 1,300 points, so he was still unable to use it.However \u2026Long Fei was not too worried. He only needed 6,000 experience points to level up, after reaching Level 7 as a Battlemaster, he would definitely be able to reach 1500 true breath.\"Sleep!\"\"I can finally sleep well.\" Long Fei was elated in his heart. Previously, Long Zhanwu was like a mountain crushing down on his heart, but now, he could finally breathe a sigh of relief.\u2026 \u2026.He was sleeping soundly, but the real Fire Glass City was in an uproar because of the dragon's roar just now.\"Dragon roar, Long family's direction.\"\"Do any disciples of the Long family awaken the dragon god's blood essence?\"\"Investigate, go investigate immediately!\"\"We absolutely cannot let the Long family have another Dragon God Warrior! We absolutely cannot!\"\u2026 \u2026.The Long family was also instantly lit up.Long Zhanwu frowned.One of the guards hurriedly reported, \"Grand Elder, we didn't discover anything.\"Long Zhanwu's face turned sinister as he said, \"There was a dragon roar next year, how could I not have noticed it?\"The dragon cry meant that the dragon god's blood essence had been awakened.The dragon cry just now wasn't loud enough, but it was also a dragon cry. It was definitely the awakening of the Dragon God Warriors. This meant that the Long family had a new Dragon God Warrior.The same!This meant that he had a new enemy.Long Zhanye walked into the hall and said: \"Big Brother, that dragon roar just now came from the rear mountains, could it be that Long Fei that brat recovered the Dragon God's blood essence?\"Then, the guard said in a low voice: \"We just arrived at Long Fei's courtyard. He is truly sleeping soundly in his room.\"Huh?\"Long Zhanwu pondered for a moment, and said: \"The Pubes is broken, the veins are stagnant, and the Dragon God's blood essence is extracted, making it impossible to recover, so it shouldn't be him.\"Long Zhanye also nodded, and said: \"Then who could it be?\"\"Could it be Long Zhanhai's men?\"This was what Long Zhanwu was most worried about.Long Zhanhai was the Acting Patriarch and seemed to be in closed door cultivation, but he had his own trusted aides in the Long family as well as many of his direct disciples.If it was Long Zhanhai's people, then it would be very disadvantageous to him.The muscles at the corner of Long Zhanwu's eyes twitched as he said solemnly, \"No matter who it is, I'm determined to win the battle three days later!\"\u2026 \u2026.In the secret room.Long Zhanhai was also awoken by the dragon's roar. \"Dragon's Roar, the Dragon God Warrior Awakening?\"\"Who could it be?\"\u2026 \u2026.In the secret room of Master.The Grand Preceptor's eyes opened as well. \"A dragon's roar?\" \"It seems like I have to leave early!\"\u2026 \u2026.Dragons had not appeared in the Fire Glass Dynasty for a long time.Other than the generation of the Great Ancestor, no one else in the Long family had ever seen a dragon before. This was the reason why the dragon's roar had fooled them, and everyone in the Fire Glass City.That night, it was unusually restless.The various powers were all inquiring about the dragon roar from before.Even the Nangong Imperial Family didn't sleep at all.At the house of the Divine Zhuge Marquis.Li Martial Arts Sect.Prince Nangong's house.All the Rankers in four pillars stayed up all night.The dragon cry meant the awakening of the Dragon God Warriors. This was something they were most afraid of.The Long family had lost a Dragon God soldier, injuring the Long family's vital energy greatly. Yet another Dragon God soldier appeared this time?They began to worry.At the same time.In the undercurrents of the Fire Glass City, because the dragon's roar had slowed down by quite a bit, the competition among the various forces had also slowly calmed down.This gave the Long family a lot of time.\u2026 \u2026.Of course.Regarding everything that was happening outside, Long Fei did not know a thing.Having not slept for several days, he really wanted to sleep for three days and three nights.\u2026 \u2026.Time flew.In the blink of an eye, three days passed.The auction held by the Fengyuan Merchant Union had begun.The four pillars, the famous aristocrats, the Nangong Imperial Family, as well as a few other countries' financial groups, all came!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Let's directly take out the behest.\"\u2026 \u2026.The audience roared.Liu Feng did not stop them. On the contrary, he wanted to see this scene with a smile on his face as he said: \"Allow me to explain to you how these healing pills are different.\"\"My healing speed doubled.\"\"The most important thing is that it will help you cultivate, because after you consume it, you will be provided with true breath.\"\"This is its unique charm.\"\"This pill was concocted by a Grandmaster.\"Although the last sentence was a lie, Liu Feng knew clearly that it would raise Long Fei's position and also raise the price. The most important thing was.It would raise the influence of the Fengyuan Merchant Union in the pill market.Because \u2026A Alchemy Grandmaster was not something that could be hired by the Merchant Union even by a family.Everyone shivered, but no one called out a price.Liu Feng was not in a hurry as he said: \"Fire Glass Dynasty, the Zhuge family of four pillars are famous for their Alchemy. Can you let Lord Zhuge inspect them?\"A figure landed in private room number five.\"I'll test it.\" A skinny old man said.Liu Feng replied respectfully: \"It is my honor to be examined by the chief Alchemy master of the Zhuge family, Zhuge Yuqing.\"Zhuge Yuqing did not dawdle either. She first picked up the pellet and sniffed it, then her eyebrows twitched. The idea moved, and her brows tightened up even more. She looked at Liu Feng and asked: \"Can I taste one?\"Liu Feng nodded: \"Sure.\"Zhuge Yuqing put the healing pellet into her mouth, but did not swallow it immediately. She closed her eyes slightly, savoring the taste, sensing, and muttered, \"The ratio of spirit herbs has reached a perfect state, the release of spirit grass's spirit energy is perfect, the true breath is surging, perfect, the treatment of wounds is perfect \u2026\"\"Impossible!\"\"How can there be such a perfect healing pill?\"\"Highest Grade Medicine Powder!\"Zhuge Yuqing was shocked and did not step down. She immediately said, \"I will pay five hundred thousand for the remaining nine healing pellets.\"As soon as his voice faded \u2026A huge commotion immediately broke out.It was impossible for the Fengyuan Merchant Union and the Zhuge family to join hands.And then \u2026Prince Nangong's family immediately raised the bid. \"Six hundred thousand.\"\"Li Martial Arts Sect, seven hundred thousand.\"\"holy dragon mansion, eight hundred thousand.\"\"Zhuge, Divine Hou Mansion, one million silver.\"\u2026 \u2026.Long Fei was dumbfounded.A healing pill for sale to Liu Feng was only eight thousand gold coins, and it could easily be sold for a million silver coins. He felt that he had suffered a huge loss.He even had the heart to die.The Divine Marquis of Zhuge had produced many Alchemy geniuses, who were the strongest existences in the Fire Glass Dynasty in terms of researching medicinal pellets.Zhuge Yuqing's shocked expression showed that even he was unable to refine it.Moreover.The greatest use of this healing pill lay in the cultivation of the young disciples.With such a healing pill by his side, it was the same as having an extra talisman.Of course.The Zhuge family would never let go of the opportunity to study the Highest Grade Medicine Powder.In the end.Nine healing pills were sold to the Zhuge family for 1,300,000 silver.This was also the first time in the history of god's martial continent that a sky-high price of one million three hundred thousand gold coins had been offered for nine first-grade healing pellets.\"Next, we'll proceed to the second item auction.\"\"Spiritual Void Ring.\"\"Space Ring made from a mysterious meteorite, a hundred square meters of Space Ring, starting bid 100 thousand silver.\" As soon as Liu Feng finished his sentence.Silence reigned below the stage.It was just a Space Ring, but it was a little big, so not many people called out a price.Long Fei called out, \"One hundred and fifty thousand.\"He needed a large Space Ring storage item.No one bid, Liu Feng smashed the hammer down and said: \"Deal.\"\"The third item.\"\"Xuan class six stage sword art, Sky Xuan sword art. The bidding price is 300 thousand.\"\"Five hundred thousand.\"\"Six hundred thousand!\"\"Eight hundred thousand.\"\u2026 \u2026.\"One million and five hundred thousand.\"\"Two million.\"\u2026 \u2026.The price soared.\"The fourth item.\"\"Wind Shadow Step, not appraised, does not guarantee quality. Starting price, 10 thousand silver.\"Unidentified.This meant that the Fengyuan Merchant Union did not know the grade of this technique. It could be a Divine level technique or the most trashy one of the Yellow Rank.Even more so, there was a huge risk involved in this gamble.\"Thirty thousand gold.\"\"Fifty thousand!\"\"One hundred thousand!\"Although it was unappraised, there were still many people bidding, and the price kept rising.Long Fei looked at the Wind Shadow Step through the system.Skill Path: Wind Shadow StepRank: First Rank of Heaven Stagetrue breath: 10 true breath will not be consumed in a second.Description: Like the wind, the shadow is erratic, the observation is unclear, unfathomable. Like a gale, like a gale, like a hurricane \u2026Long Fei was secretly excited in his heart, and said: \"One million!\"Many people turned to look at Long Fei.\"Is this person an idiot?\" You actually spent so much money to buy an unidentified cultivation technique. \"\"My brain must be full of water.\"\"A million to buy an unidentified cultivation technique, hahaha... \"He's too talented.\"\u2026 \u2026.The price of one million was not low, even Liu Feng was a little surprised. Seeing that it was Long Fei, her eyes moved slightly, signalling him not to buy it.However.Everything was too late, Liu Feng was sure that no one was bidding, he knocked on the hammer: \"One million, sold.\"Long Fei was secretly excited, \"For a high price of two million for a Profound Rank 6, I bought it for a million for a first rank Heaven Stage, hahaha \u2026 I've picked up a big mistake. \"Who would know that the Wind Shadow Step was a first rank Heaven Ranked technique?Next was a new auction.\"The ninth item.\"\"The treasure map of the Thunder Dragon Temple.\"\"The location of the Immortal Trail Thunder Dragon Temple, unappraised treasure map, starting bid 50 thousand silver.\"The Fengyuan Merchant Union had sent people to search for this item based on the instructions on the treasure map, but they could not find it.Other than that.It was hard to say whether there were any Thunder Dragon Temple s around, so he decided to auction them.\"Thunder Dragon Temple? I've never heard of it at all. \"\"It's another unidentified item. Take it out to swindle others.\"\"Sixty thousand!\"\"Eighty thousand.\"\"One hundred and fifty thousand.\"\"Two hundred thousand!\"\u2026 \u2026.If he couldn't appraise it, he would be gambling. If he won the bet, he would make a profit. If he lost the bet, he would die a loss!Long Fei still had eight hundred and fifty thousand left of the two million he had left. Just as he was about to buy something else, he saw the treasure map and muttered: \"Anyway, it's not my money, I'll buy it!\"\"Five hundred thousand!\"Immediately.The entire hall was silent. No one bid again.He was staring at Long Fei again, and in their eyes, this person was already a standard number two!Long Fei was even excited, and said: \"I've bought it again, hahaha.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His expression became excited as he said: \"The tenth item, Sword Teeth Tiger Spell Note.\"\"They are divided into two groups.\"\"Each group has four plates.\"\"The first group of Sword Teeth Tiger Spell Note will be auctioned next. The bidding price is 300 thousand.\"Finished.Liu Feng did not allow the auction to begin, but explained instead: \"Sword Teeth Tiger Spell Note, high Grade Two Talisman, able to release a five level monster in battle, able to instantly kill a practitioner of war division realm.\"At the same time.Liu Feng picked up a talisman, activated true breath and suddenly released it into the air, \"Go!\"\"Roar!\"A sturdy Sword Teeth Tiger rushed out of the talisman and roared. Its dense imposing manner spread to every corner of the auction place.It was extremely shocking.Liu Feng suddenly said: \"Let the auction begin.\"\"Five hundred thousand!\"\"Li Martial Arts Sect bids eight hundred thousand.\"\"The Nangong Imperial Clan bids one million.\"\"The Zhuge family of the Divine Hou clan bids one million and five hundred thousand.\"\"holy dragon mansion bids two million.\"\"Three million.\"\"The Nangong Imperial Clan bids five million.\"It instantly soared to five million.Long Fei was dumbfounded.Liu Feng said excitedly: \"Five million going once, five million going twice, five million going thrice, sold!\"\"Next is another set of talismans.\"\"Four chapters talismans, top quality Sword Teeth Tiger Spell Note s, are respectively wind, illusion, and water elements, two of which are magic talismans, and are instantly killed by a martial artist at the war spirit Realm. This set of talismans was crafted by a single person, a senior Master of Coding Draft of the Fengyuan Merchant Union. \" Liu Feng laughed: \"I will also tell you guys a secret, the Healing Pill was created by this master.\"\"Attribute talisman?\" Or are all three attributes created by a single person? \"\"Able to refine talismans and Alchemy?\"\"Could it be a ten-star root bone?\"\"Even a double attribute bone root can't do it, let alone a ten-star root bone.\"All sorts of discussions broke out, and even the various VIP booths were in an uproar.Long Fei sat in the middle of the crowd, listening to the various discussions, and thought to himself, \"I wonder what kind of scene would be like when the 'Flood Dragon Long Fei's Heavenly Talisman' was taken out for auction?\"Suddenly.Liu Feng suddenly shouted: \"The auction begins, the bidding price is one million gold.\"The Sword Teeth Tiger Spell Note's momentum of three days had already caused a stir, and many people came because of it.\"Two million.\"\"Three million.\"\"holy dragon mansion bids five million.\"\"Five million?\" Long Zhanwu, you are really poor, the price of the Zhuge family of the Divine Marquis is seven million. \"\"The King's Palace bids nine million.\"\"Li Martial Arts Sect bids ten million.\"\u2026 \u2026.The price kept rising.Suddenly.A melodious voice rang out from private room number 2, \"Twenty Spirit Stones from the Heavenly Sect.\"As soon as his voice faded \u2026The entire audience was shocked, \"The people from the Heaven Sect are here too?\"\"It's actually the Heaven Sect?\"At this moment.A voice also came from private room ten, \"The Blood Refinement Sect bids thirty spirit stones.\"Another uproar broke out.\"The Devil Sect's Blood Refining Sect is also here?\"\"What's going on?\"\"They're all here.\"\u2026 \u2026.The sect was extremely powerful, appearing in this mundane auction and bidding on it.A single spirit stone was worth a million silver.The currency in the secular world was silver, while the spirit stones in the sect were spirit stones.The voice from private room two sounded again, \"Fifty Spirit Stones bid on the Sky Sect.\"A wave of cold laughter came from the Blood Refinement Sect, and they stopped bidding.Liu Feng knocked on the hammer and said: \"Deal, the second VIP room will be auctioned off to the Sky Sect.\"In private room two.The three women were fuming.\"Eldest senior sister, why is the Blood Refinement Sect here?\"\"Hmph, since Senior Sister and the others dare to come, then don't let them leave the Fire Glass City alive.\"\"The matter at Fire Glass Mountain Range last time will be settled this time.\"The three girls were the girls that Long Fei had saved the last time. Amongst the three of them, the eldest senior sister was a rank 2 talisman master. She really wanted to know how to refine attribute talismans. Furthermore, she had recently encountered a bottleneck and wanted to break through so much that she had spent fifty spirit stones to buy them.One must know that these were the spirit stones that the three of them had accumulated over the years.He originally thought that announcing the name 'Heaven Sect' would scare off the other bidders, but he never expected that the Blood Refinement Sect would interfere.The Eldest Senior Sister huffed, \"Damn it!\"\"Senior Sister, should we inform the branch elders?\"\"Inform my ass, we'll immediately rush out.\"The little junior sister apprentice looked as if she wanted the world to be chaotic.The eldest senior sister spoke in a low voice for a moment. \"Fire Glass City is a secular place, once they fight, there will definitely be innocent people involved. Let's just forget about it.\"The little junior sister apprentice immediately said, \"I spent thirty more Spirit Stones for nothing. Eldest senior sister, those are the Spirit Stones you use to breakthrough to the next realm.\"\"How about...\"The little junior sister apprentice had an idea, \"Big Senior, why don't we use the Heaven's Court Order and get the Fengyuan Merchant Union to hand over the person who refined the talisman? We can get him to specially refine a hundred talismans for us. One thousand talismans, hehe \u2026 \"\"Nonsense!\" The eldest senior sister glared and said, \"How can the master be insulted? The Fengyuan Merchant Union will bring Master out to see us once, so we will have to respectfully welcome you all. \"In her heart, Grandmaster Glyph was sacred and inviolable.The little junior sister apprentice stuck out her tongue.\u2026 \u2026.The appearance of the Heaven Sect and the Blood Refinement Sect had caused the auction to become somewhat stifling.However \u2026This did not affect the hearts of the clans in the slightest.The last one was the Flowing Light Plaque. Everyone was rubbing their fists and wiping their palms.Long Fei sat in the middle of the crowd and muttered to himself, \"Even if it's one million silvers per spirit stone, fifty of them would be fifty million silvers.\"\"Gudong!\"Long Fei swallowed his saliva heavily, and became extremely excited, \"How much fifty million silver? \"In my previous life, laozi had insisted on keeping eighteen girls to play games with me every day. If that were the case, then life would be a lot better, hahaha \u2026\"At the same time.Long Fei looked at VIP booth 2 and said to Xiao Bai, who was fast asleep in war pet space, \"It's those three women again. Last time, they completely ignored me.So cool.\u2026 \u2026.\"Next, the last item will be auctioned.\"\"Ranking item, Flatten Feather Medallion!\"Liu Feng's voice trembled a little as she said, \"I don't need to explain to everyone the use of the Flowing Light Feather Token.

This was his last bottom line, even if he was the ruler of a nation, it would be difficult for him to take out more money.The four pillars was silent for a moment.At this moment.A woman's voice rang out from VIP booth 1, \"200 million!\"\"Pfft \u2026\"Nangong Huo immediately spat out a mouthful of blood, the anger was attacking his heart.It was the same for the people from the four pillars.Two hundred million was completely beyond their limit.Liu Feng's eyes were shocked as he loudly asked: \"200 million, is there a higher price?\"\"Who's from VIP lounge 1?\"\"What kind of background?\"\"The Xiang Tian Sect is only the second VIP lounge. The identity of VIP booth 1 must be even stronger.\"\"Who is it?\"\u2026 \u2026.Everyone was guessing, even the people from the four pillars were guessing as well.\"Two hundred million going once!\"\"Two hundred million twice!\"\"200 million, deal!\" Liu Feng smashed down on the hammer, \"Congratulations, esteemed guest # 1. Please pay your bill backstage.\"Half an hour later.Long Fei muttered: \"Too crazy, too crazy, my heart can't take it.\"Liu Feng took out a box and said: \"Brother, here are fifty spirit stones, plus two million silver notes.\"Long Fei was surprised for a moment, and said: \"Elder Liu, didn't you guys want to get it by the draw?\"Liu Feng laughed: \"If others want to smoke, you do not need it. Since you are a member of our Fengyuan Merchant Union, you naturally do not need it.\"Actually.This was a form of compensation.The Fengyuan Merchant Union had used the Healing Pills and Sword Teeth Tiger Spell Note s that Long Fei had refined to increase their power and influence. This was not something that could be accomplished by dozens of spirit stones.Long Fei did not hold back, and said: \"Then I'll be thanking you.\"Liu Feng asked: \"If you want money, I can help you exchange it for silver.\"Long Fei smiled and said: \"No need, just spirit stones.\"Liu Feng did not force him, and said: \"Then take it well, this is a lot of money, hahaha \u2026\"Long Fei also started laughing, and asked suspiciously: \"Elder Liu, can you tell me who is in private room one?\"Liu Feng smiled mysteriously and lowered his voice: \"Our Young Miss.\"\"Huh?\"\"Holy sh * t, are you guys playing this game?\" Long Fei completely did not expect that after hearing Liu Feng's explanation, he had come to a realization.Liu Feng said softly: We were forced to, and you know the competition situation very well. If we were to let the four pillars or the Emperor of Nan Gong Family obtain it, the Fire Glass City would set off a bloody war, and might even shake the very foundations of the Fire Glass Dynasty.\"Although the Fire Glass City may seem calm on the surface, in truth, there are undercurrents surging. All kinds of forces are fighting in secret.\"\"The genius of the Long Family in four pillars, dragon blood, was drawn out. The Long family lost their dragon god warriors, their status plummeted rapidly over the past year, and they were crushed by other three pillars's forces. \"A few days ago, there was a dragon's roar from the sky above the Long family. It should be due to the awakening of the new Dragon God Warriors, which would let the Long family slow down for a while. However, I think that as long as three pillars finds the Dragon God Warriors, they would probably assassinate them.Long Fei trembled slightly, and asked: \"Was the last Dragon God soldier assassinated by the three pillars?\"Liu Feng smiled faintly, \"The existence of the Long family is too much of a threat to them. The three pillars and the Nangong Imperial Clan want to exterminate the Long family, who else could it be? \"The Long family has been passed down for so many years, all thanks to the support of the Dragon God's warriors. Today, not obtaining the Falling Feather Token is tantamount to losing a single line of protection, which is not a good thing for the Long family.

You did everything possible to make me die, you are truly vicious, how can the Long family be strong enough to have someone like you?\" Long Fei felt unwell in his heart.\"Who cares!\"\"I'm not even as good as a servant in the Long family, why should I worry about the Long family?\"\"F * ck!\"Long Fei no longer cared about the Long family. What he needed to do now was to become stronger and take the test.\u2026 \u2026.Long family.Long Zhanwu's courtyard.Long Zhanwu's face was filled with anger as he said solemnly: \"A bunch of old fellows went all out to increase the price for the Flowing Light Flower Token.

Our next plan is going to change. \"Long Zhanwu looked at Long Zhanye.Long Zhanye said in a low voice: \"Big brother, without the Flowing Light Feather Token, we can similarly request killer at failure alliance. As long as we remove Long Fei and Long Zhanhai, the Long family will also fall into your hands.\"Long Zhanwu's eyes shone with a bright light.Long Zhanye continued to speak, \"I have already contacted the failure alliance. Fifty million silver is much cheaper than the price of the Flowing Light Feather Token.\"Long Zhanwu said excitedly: \"Alright! Great! Once the family exam is over, Long Zhanhai will come out from closed door cultivation and be killed immediately.Long Zhanye also laughed excitedly.Following that \u2026Long Zhanwu asked: \"Have you found the Dragon God Warriors yet?\"Long Zhanye shook his head, and said: \"Not yet.\"Long Zhanwu exhaled, feeling more and more that the Dragon God Warriors were Long Zhanhai's men. \"In addition, the three pillars and the Emperor Clan are investigating the Dragon God Warriors, if you can't find out that they are subservient to us, kill them!\"Long Zhanye nodded, and said: \"Understood!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only by breaking through the fourth level of Alchemy would one be able to refine true pill s, pills that could instantly raise one hundred points of true breath.Experts were as common as the clouds in the clan examination.The true breath was a hard wound, so if he ran out of true breath, there would be no one or demon beasts to hunt him down to make up for it.This was Long Fei's weakness, and he had to make up for it!\"Ding!\"\"Ding!\"\u2026 \u2026.He trained in Alchemy during the day and trained in talismans.Cultivating Basic Sword, Toading Skill, dragon salyer technique and the 'Wind Shadow Step' that he bought at the auction late into the night was extremely difficult to grasp.Every step was erratic.At the same time, each step was filled with hidden killing intent.

So it turns out to be an extra ten lucky value s, just that \u2026 Where did this lucky value come from? \" Long Fei's brows moved, he immediately thought of the 'Spirit Space Ring' on his finger, and his heart shook, \"Hahaha \u2026. I've picked up a treasure. \"And then \u2026Long Fei took off the 'Spirit Space Ring' and checked the system, \"Sure enough, lucky value has turned to zero, this Spirit Space Ring has a Luck attribute bonus.\"\"Isn't it too great?\"He hadn't noticed it in the past, but now, he realized that it was a great experience.What did lucky value mean?The drop rate had increased, the speed of the cultivation skill had increased, the success rate of Alchemy had increased, and there was even a chance for him to deal 'critical damage'.\"This ring is something that even a hundred million wouldn't be able to buy.\"\"Mysterious meteorite, if I can find even more of these mysterious meteors to raise my lucky value to one hundred, then \u2026\" The scene was too beautiful, Long Fei did not dare to think further.Following that \u2026\"jojo, I'll be going out for a while. You have to behave and stay at home.\" Long Fei teased.jojo's face flushed red, not daring to make a sound.\"Little girl.\"Long Fei smiled knowingly. After interacting with her for such a long time, she discovered that jojo was even more beautiful and cute. As long as she matured, she would definitely be a beauty who would take one's life.During this time, Long Fei was also thinking about when he could test if she had any talent in cultivation.Half an hour later.Fengyuan Merchant Union.\u2026 \u2026.\"When will the Highest Grade Medicine Powder come?\"\"Liu Feng, didn't you say that the master is the chief Alchemy master of the Fengyuan Merchant Union? It has been half a month, but you still haven't managed to refine a single healing pill? \"\"What are you doing, without the Highest Grade Medicine Powder, I won't leave.\"The drugstore was packed.Moreover.Ever since the end of the auction, these half a month had been packed to the brim, all for the Highest Grade Medicine Powder and the talismans. For the past half a month, Long Fei had not appeared a single time. Liu Feng waited like an ant on a hot pan, looking forward to see the stars and the moon every day, praying for Long Fei to appear a little earlier.If they could not get the Highest Grade Medicine Powder out, it would have a huge impact on the Fengyuan Merchant Union.\"So many people! Elder Liu, business is booming!\" Long Fei walked into the shop and smiled at everyone.When Liu Feng saw Long Fei, he was almost moved to tears. He pulled Long Fei inside, \"My little ancestor, you're finally here.\"Long Fei said in all seriousness: \"When did I become your ancestor? Elder Liu, since we are friends, please do not randomly establish a relationship.\"Liu Feng laughed bitterly: \"It's already burning up my eyebrows, do you still have the mind to joke around, do you know who the people outside are? They are all here for the Highest Grade Medicine Powder, how much have you refined in this period of time? Are there ten of them? If I don't have ten of them, you can give me five or six of them. If I don't have any Highest Grade Medicine Powder s, my shop will be destroyed by someone. \"\"Is it that serious?\"Long Fei touched his chest.Liu Feng thought that Long Fei was taking the pellet, but his eyebrows finally relaxed as he said: \"Of course it's serious.\"While they were talking \u2026Long Fei dug out a ball of mud and rubbed it with two of his fingers. He formed it into a ball and muttered, \"He went into closed door training for half a month and didn't even have time to take a bath.\"Liu Feng took it over, and his eyes were startled: \"Just one pill?\"\"Huh?\"Long Fei was dumbstruck.Liu Feng took the pellet and ran out, saying, \"One pellet is better than none.\"Without waiting for Long Fei to stop it, Liu Feng hastily ran out. He did not have the mind to inspect the pill, and he wished that he could immediately send those people away.Suddenly.The hall exploded with noise.A commotion instantly broke out.\"I bid 30,000 silver.\"\"I'll pay forty thousand.\"\"Fifty thousand.\"\"Seventy thousand!\"\u2026 \u2026.\"I, Zhuge Jianqiang, bid a hundred thousand. All of you paupers, scram to the side.\"Zhuge Jianqiang's face was a little bruised, one of his eyes had even been beaten into a panda's eye.It was strange.He had been walking well in the night when he was suddenly caught in a gunny sack and then violently beaten up. If it wasn't for the Zhuge family's expert coming fast, he would definitely have been beaten to death.There were not many people that dared to hit Zhuge Jianqiang, he had searched for the culprit but they could not find it.He could only admit his misfortune.Long Fei muttered in his heart when he heard Zhuge Jianqiang's name, \"Eh? Isn't that the name that was reported to the Blood Refinement Sect? \"He followed her out.Liu Feng said: \"Let Young Master Zhuge take the bid.\"Zhuge Jianqiang took out a stack of silver notes, looked at the people around him with disdain, and said, \"You want to buy a Highest Grade Medicine Powder without money? Is this pill something that you all can afford? \"\"Tch!\"No one dared to offend the Divine Zhuge family.This Zhuge Jianqiang was one of the tyrants of the Fire Glass City, and he did not end up well if they provoked him. Everyone kept their heads low and did not speak a word, even though they had been insulted.Zhuge Jianqiang received the pellet and looked at it carefully, saying, \"This pellet is a little different from the last time with the Highest Grade Medicine Powder.\"\"Master is indeed a master. He must have improved again.\"And then \u2026Zhuge Jianqiang swallowed it whole and began to chew, asking with doubt: \"Why does this pill smell a little sour?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It must be great, hahaha \u2026 \" Zhuge Jianqiang laughed.The corner of Long Fei's mouth curved up as he sneered.Zhuge Jianqiang said with disdain: \"Trash, what are you laughing at?\"Long Fei said coldly: \"I'm laughing at you, you will fly out from here in a bit, don't think that you've eaten my \u2026\"Without waiting for Long Fei to finish speaking, Zhuge Jianqiang's stomach started rolling and shouting, following that, he covered his stomach, and revealed a look of pain, \"Long Fei, I had something urgent today, so I'll let you go. Next time, don't let me see it, or else I'll beat you up until your teeth are all over the ground.\"\"Aiyo...\" Ouch... \"I can't take it anymore.\"\"I can't take it anymore!\"Suddenly.\"Pah pah pah pah pah \u2026\"A weird sound came out from Zhuge Jianqiang's butt.\"So smelly.\"\"Damn, Zhuge Jianqiang got such a shock.\"\"It really is. Look at his butt, it's wet.\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"Following that \u2026Everyone burst out laughing.Zhuge Jianqiang's face was pale white. She could not resist it any longer as she stared at Liu Feng and said, \"You, you, the pill you gave me earlier was poisonous.\"Liu Feng was willing to give up, the pill had already been consumed by him, he could refuse to acknowledge his words, and said seriously: \"Young Master Zhuge, you can't speak carelessly, my pills were all made by the Grandmaster, if you dare to discredit the Fengyuan Merchant Union again, I won't be polite.\"\"Pah pah pah \u2026\"Zhuge Jianqiang's buttocks made a series of popping sounds, and couldn't hold on any longer. He grabbed onto his leg, and escaped with all his might. \"I'll definitely come back.\"As he ran, his butt made \"Pa Pa Pa\" sounds.Moreover.From the bottom of his pants came a continuous stream of loose shit, causing him to burst out in laughter.\"Serves you right!\"\"Hahaha... This Zhuge Jianqiang is going to cause a sensation in the entire city. \"\"I almost suffocated to death, hahaha \u2026\"\u2026 \u2026.He couldn't stop bursting into laughter.Liu Feng pulled Long Fei inside, and said: \"You brat, what did you give him to eat?\"\"I haven't bathed for half a month, I didn't expect this thing to be so powerful, it seems like I need to go through it some in the future.\"Liu Feng's face turned green.Long Fei asked, \"Are you afraid of the Zhuge family?\"Liu Feng's expression immediately changed, and said: \"The Fengyuan Merchant Union is afraid of him? four pillars is not a match for the Fengyuan Merchant Union, if I want to be afraid of him, it would be you. \"\"I really didn't expect you to be Long Fei.\"He did not send anyone to investigate Long Fei, because he was afraid of offending Long Fei.Of course.If Long Fei found out that the Fengyuan Merchant Union had followed him and investigated him, he would definitely not cooperate with the Fengyuan Merchant Union anymore.Long Fei scratched his head and laughed shamelessly: \"Handsome is always radiating light wherever he goes, I have always chosen to keep a low profile, I never thought that I would still be able to hide it, sigh \u2026\"Liu Feng disdainfully said: \"Stop acting like this.\"Long Fei said: \"You won't reveal my identity, right?\"Liu Feng became serious and said, \"Don't worry, the Fengyuan Merchant Union does have some credibility. Your identity is absolutely confidential and will not be discovered.\"He was not an idiot so why would he reveal Long Fei's identity, he was looking forward for Long Fei to not reveal it.This would be of great benefit to the Fengyuan Merchant Union.Liu Feng said: \"You had a grudge with Zhuge Jianqiang? Did you also injure his body? I heard that a few days ago, someone secretly infiltrated the Zhuge family and beat up Zhuge Jianqiang. If it wasn't for the fact that Zhuge Tianlong came fast, he would have been beaten to death. \"\"Huh?\"Long Fei thought, \"Did the Blood Refining Sect make their move? Hahaha... \"It's really fast.\"He shook his head at Liu Feng and said, \"I've been cultivating in seclusion at home for half a month.\"\"Right!\"Long Fei thought about his goal for coming here this time, and asked: \"Do you know what the material for refining this ring is?\"\"Spiritual Void Ring?\" Liu Feng was surprised for a moment, and said: \"Spending one hundred and fifty thousand to buy a Space Ring is really not worth it. I heard that it was brought out from the adventurer team's ancient tomb. We have tested the exact material, but we were unable to determine if it was actually a normal Space Ring. \"Long Fei was startled, and said: \"Then why did you say it was refined from a mysterious meteorite, can't you have a bit of truth?\"Liu Feng laughed: \"So that's how you say it, to think someone like you would pay such a high price, hahaha \u2026 But then again, the material of this ring is really special, what are you asking it for? \"Since Liu Feng didn't know, Long Fei didn't ask anymore and didn't provide any explanation either. He said in an exasperated manner: \"Don't mind me.\"\"One more thing.\"Long Fei asked: \"What spirit herbs does the true pill need to refine?\"\"true pill?\"Liu Feng was shocked, and said: \"That is a Yellow Rank Level 5 pill, and this pill is scarce. The demand for this pill is also the biggest amongst Yellow Rank pills, you can refine it?\"\"I want to try.\" Long Fei did not hide anything this time. He had seen the true pill s on the Alchemy Book and knew their attributes. To him, this was one of the Yellow Rank medicinal pellet that could help him replenish his true breath.He had to prepare well for this time's family assessment.There must be a true pill!Just knowing what spiritual herb to use was not enough, one still needed a pill formula to refine faster.Liu Feng was excited at first, but then his brows tightened as he said: \"The true pill Fang Fengyuan Merchant Alliance does indeed have one, just that... \"Wait here for a moment, I'll go ask my young miss. She can only give you the pill formula if she agrees.\"Long Fei said: \"You can't even make decisions? Then I'll just talk it over with your little miss, I also want to see your little miss' true appearance. \"Liu Feng said: \"Miss is currently receiving an important guest, and under normal circumstances, she will not receive any guests.\"Finished.Liu Feng then walked towards the pavilion.\u2026 \u2026.\"I just want to see that master talisman refining master.

Since Pavillion Master Fu is in trouble, we shouldn't disturb him any further.\"Fu Xishan got up and said: \"I'm really sorry, I can't reveal his identity.\"Liu Luoxi laughed: \"I know, master's identity is a top secret.\"It was impossible to expose such a situation. Once it was exposed, other forces would suppress it and even assassinate it.At this moment.Liu Feng asked from outside: \"Miss, he needs the true pill's pill formulas, what should we do?\"Xiao Tiantian asked curiously, \"Who is he? It can't be that master, right? \"Fu Xishan's brows slightly moved, she knew who Liu Feng was speaking of in her heart. After pondering for a moment, she said, \"The true pill is my Fengyuan Merchant Union's top secret medicinal formula.\"Liu Feng immediately nodded: \"I understand.\"Just as Liu Feng was about to leave, Fu Xishan suddenly called out to him. \"Did he say what he wants to do with the true pill?\"Liu Feng answered: \"He said that he wanted to try refining a true pill, because there is no pill so he did not.\"Fu Xishan glanced at Liu Luoxi, and said: \"Give him the true pill's pill formula, but there's a condition for him to solve a question. If he's not willing to appear, then let his disciple explain it to him.\"Disciple?\" Liu Feng muttered in his heart.Then.\"Big Cousin, you're willing to help me?\"\"Hee hee... Big Cousin, you're the best. \" Xiao Tiantian was overjoyed.Liu Luoxi gratefully said: \"Thank you, Pavillion Master Fu.\"Fu Xishan laughed: \"You're welcome, my little cousin wants to trouble you all to take care of her a bit more.\"Who is Liu Luoxi?Fu Xishan didn't know, but \u2026 He knew that there was an inner sect elder surnamed Liu in the Heaven Sect who was able to get along with Xiao Tiantian. This meant that her identity was not simple.Helping her once was equivalent to owing him a favor, so he might be able to use it in the future.Then there was Long Fei.It was a fair deal to give him the true pill formula and let him meet someone.To Long Fei, he would definitely be grateful to the Fengyuan Merchant Union.Fu Xishan was a businessman.Everything she did was for the sake of benefits and the development of the Fengyuan Merchant Union.Liu Feng naturally understood after hearing the conversation in the room, and immediately said: \"Today, it just so happens to be his disciple. I'll go tell him right now, there shouldn't be any problems.\"\u2026 \u2026.\"I have to solve a girl's puzzle?\" Long Fei was startled, then laughed vulgarly: \"Is a girl beautiful? I am an expert in love, specifically to rescue the lost in love of the beautiful girl! \"Liu Feng said: \"You agreed?\"Long Fei said: \"I agree, but the condition is that she has to be pretty, otherwise I will not wait on you.\"Liu Feng laughed: \"She's as beautiful as a fairy, but there's one thing you need to be careful of, you definitely cannot let her know your true identity.Long Fei said: \"Don't worry.\"Not long later.Liu Feng brought the three Sky Sect sisters to the back room.Long Fei was truly savoring the taste of the Holy Tea in big gulps. Every time he came here, he would use up all of his true breath and then soak himself in a big pot of Holy Tea to slowly recover.Feeling the recovery of the true breath, how comfortable.\"Huh?\"\"It's him!\"Xiao Tiantian was the first to walk into the hall. Seeing Long Fei's satisfied look, he could not help but say: \"Why are you here, you aren't doing odd jobs here are you?\"\"F * ck!\"\"It's you guys?\" Long Fei was also surprised, and immediately said: \"You aren't polite to your savior.\"\"Forget it!\"\"Old Man Liu, what happened today is just like this. It's just a mere true pill pill formula, I believe that with my master's ability, it'll take him less than half a month to figure out the pill formula.\" Long Fei pretended to be a disciple of an expert and arrogantly strode out of the hall.Liu Feng was also stunned, he thought to himself: \"What kind of act is this?\"Liu Luoxi immediately stepped forward and said respectfully: \"I am unsensible, I hope Young Hero will not take offense, Young Hero is our savior, we three sisters dare not forget.\"Ye Ziyan looked at Long Fei and muttered in her heart, \"Wasn't it said that the young master of the Long family had his blood essence of the Dragon God extracted, and the Pubes's veins would be broken? How can it be used for Alchemy or for refining talismans? \"Long Fei said coldly and arrogantly: \"Get her to apologize to me.\"\"You!\"Xiao Tiantian was immediately angered, \"You wish! Do you think you can save us all?! It was because I was unconscious, otherwise my cultivation would not need you to save me.\"Liu Luoxi stared at him and bellowed: \"junior sister apprentice!\"\"Oh.\" Xiao Tiantian immediately became impotent, and said unwillingly to Long Fei: \"I'm sorry.\"Long Fei picked his ears and said: \"What did you say? I didn't hear you. \"Xiao Tiantian's fiery temper rose again, and she wanted to pinch Long Fei to death. Seeing her big senior sister's eyes, she immediately said obediently: \"I'm sorry, Young Hero Long.\"He really couldn't accept it.However, the voice was truly sweet, giving off a feeling of numbness.Long Fei purposely said: \"Let me hear it again.\"Xiao Tiantian could not hold it in anymore, \"Long Fei, don't push your luck.\"Long Fei looked at Xiao Tiantian and asked: \"Do you still want to know the refining process of top quality Sword Teeth Tiger Spell Note?\"\"For Senior Sister, I will endure it. Next time, don't let Long Fei fall into my hands, if not I will definitely tear you into pieces, hmph!\" Xiao Tiantian said angrily.She looked really cute when she was angry.Long Fei said: \"Wait till I land in your hands, why don't you apologize now.\"Xiao Tiantian was so angry that his face was flushed red, he had been holding back his anger, and had to pretend to be gentle and gentle, and said: \"Young hero, I am sorry, I was wrong.\"Long Fei revealed a forgiving look and said: \"Forget it, this young master will not care about this little girl anymore.\"\"You!\"Xiao Tiantian was furious.Without waiting for her to finish speaking, Long Fei looked at Liu Luoxi and said: \"If you have any questions, feel free to ask; I can answer them for you.\"Xiao Tiantian rolled his eyes as he said to Long Fei: \"You can't answer my senior sister's question. I think it's better to just call your master out, you don't have to embarrass yourself.\"Liu Luoxi reprimanded her: \"Tiantian!\"Xiao Tiantian immediately pouted, and looked outside.Liu Luoxi respectfully asked: \"I have already researched the top quality Sword Teeth Tiger Spell Note, how can I make the talisman display its full power? I can't create too many true breath s into the second grade talisman, its might is limited, how do you do that?\"If the true breath was injected too much, the talisman would easily fail.With less true breath being injected into the talisman, its might would decrease. It would be difficult for low grade talismans to explode with such power.Long Fei said: \"Very simple, use the beast's blood essence in place of cinnabar.\"\"Huh?\"\"Huh?\"Liu Luoxi was shocked.Liu Feng, who was at the side, was also dumbfounded. He suddenly realized something and thought to himself: \"So it was a talisman refined using the blood essence of a Sword Teeth Tiger.\"No one in the god's martial continent had ever done this before.Looking at their shocked faces, Long Fei said: It's just blood essence in place of cinnabar, is there a need to be so shocked?\"Never seen the world!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His heart worshipped Long Fei's \"master\" greatly, and directly treated him as his idol.She was a low-grade talisman master. After studying for so many years, only today could she finally see what a talisman was!\"Then how can I refine an attribute talisman?\"\"Wind, illusion, and water elements! It's impossible for a genius with three elements to exist! How did your master do it?\" Liu Luoxi asked.This question was very direct.Liu Feng also pricked up his ears as he listened. He also wanted to know.Long Fei laughed faintly: \"Luck!\"\"Huh?\"\"What?\" Liu Luoxi did not understand, and asked: \"Luck?\"Long Fei said: \"Three type Talismans are extremely difficult to refine, even my master has to put in a lot of effort, as for how to refine it, it can only be said to be due to luck.\"\"Of course.\"\"If you can fuse with a wind, magic, or water type demon core, it will definitely be beneficial for your talisman refinement.\"That was all he could say.If he said more, it would only end Long Fei's road to riches.Long Fei was not an idiot, he would not say everything out loud just because the other party was beautiful.Liu Luoxi still did not understand, and asked: \"Can Young Hero please explain it in more detail?\"Long Fei laughed: \"No! \"However...\"Liu Luoxi was a little disappointed. When he heard that there was a turning point in his words, he immediately asked: \"But what?\"Long Fei revealed a silly look and said: \"My master said that this is his ancestral secret technique, other than me, it cannot be passed on to outsiders.Xiao Tiantian raged, \"Long Fei, you toad want to eat swan meat, don't go overboard.\"Long Fei also did not dare show weakness as he disdainfully said, \"Even if I were a toad, I would not eat this chest less swan meat of yours.\"No breasts?!Airport!This was Xiao Tiantian's reverse scale.Immediately.The small universe completely exploded out, just like a little tiger pouncing on Long Fei and killing him, \"I don't have a chest, your eyes saw that I don't have a chest, my chest is big.\"Ye Ziyan continued to pull Xiao Tiantian.Long Fei intentionally said: \"I didn't see it, because I didn't see it, that's why I knew you didn't have a chest. I wanted to prove that you have a big chest, take it off and let me see it.\"\"You, you, ah... Senior Sister, let me go, I want to take off my clothes for him to see \u2026 \"No, no, no. I'm spitting. I, I, I'm going to kill him.\" Xiao Tiantian was enraged.Liu Luoxi was a little embarrassed as he said: \"Young Hero, I've let you down. I thank you for your explanation today.\"\"Zi Yan, take little junior sister apprentice away.\"Liu Luoxi then bowed to Liu Feng and said: \"Please inform Pavillion Master Fu that Luo Xi is extremely grateful. If you have any matters in the future, come and find me at the Sky Sect branch office.\"\u2026 \u2026.On the street.\"I'm so angry, I'm so angry! I'm so angry!\" Xiao Tiantian thought about it and was angered, \"He actually said that I don't have a chest, is he blind?\"After saying that, she lowered her head to look at her chest, then looked at her two senior sisters' protruding breasts, crying out, \"Senior Sister, how come your breasts are so big?\"Ye Ziyan laughed: \"Little junior sister apprentice, have you fallen for Long Fei?\"\"What?\"\"I like him? Even if all the men in the world die, I won't like him. I wish I could cut him into pieces. Xiao Tiantian said angrily.Ye Ziyan said, \"You felt something wrong the moment you saw him. There are so many handsome geniuses in the Heaven Sect, yet you didn't even look at him. But he's different. I'm sure you've fallen for him.\"Xiao Tiantian wanted to cry, but there were no tears. \"Senior Sister, don't make fun of me, you and eldest senior sister on the other hand, were the ones who threatened to marry him in the cave.\"\"Looking for a beating.\" Ye Ziyan angrily rebuked.Xiao Tiantian shouted loudly, \"You must be thinking deep down inside, hee hee hee \u2026 \u2026 Ah... Senior Sister, save me! \"Along the way, Liu Luoxi was deep in thought.She was completely focused on the matter of the talisman, her mind was continuously practicing, and her heart was also incessantly asking herself, \"Is it really possible?\" He can refine top quality talismans just by fusing with a demon core? However... Where can I get my hands on the demon core? If only Long Fei could explain things a little clearer. \"\u2026 \u2026.After the three Sky Sect sisters left.Liu Feng gave Long Fei a big thumbs up, and said: \"Do you know who they are?\"Long Fei said: \"A disciple of the Heaven Sect.\"Liu Feng was even more shocked, and said: \"You know their identities and you dare to speak like that, you are truly powerful, they are not just the disciples of the Heaven Sect, their fathers are all elders of the Heaven Sect, they are not simple people.\"\"How is the elder's daughter?\" Long Fei did not think much of it, and said: \"Don't say such useless things, I have already done what you requested, now you should give me the true pill's pill formula, right?\"Liu Feng did not hesitate as he took out the pill formula, and said: \"The true pill is the top secret pill formula of the Fengyuan Merchant Union, I hope you do not spread it to anyone.\"\"Understood!\"Long Fei took the pill formula, and handed over a simple Space Ring, and said: There are 100 healing pills and 30 Highest Grade Medicine Powder, all of the spirit herbs are provided by you, the price will be according to the original price, but, I want you to provide me with the spirit herbs used to refine true pill, give me as much as you want.\"A hundred?\"\"Thirty Highest Grade Medicine Powder?\"Liu Feng's breathing immediately became hurried.Long Fei looked at him and said: \"If your body isn't well, then rest more. I'm not responsible for scaring you into a heart attack.\"\"Right.\"\"If I have more of the five level monster's blood essence, I would need to refine some talismans.\"The more talismans, the better.If I can't beat you, I'll smash you to death with my talisman.Liu Feng downed a cup of Holy Tea and suppressed his shock, saying: \"The Long family is taking the family's examination, are you preparing for the family's examination?\"Long Fei nodded and said: \"En.\"Liu Feng asked doubtfully, \"Your age doesn't meet the family's assessment criteria, could it be that someone is forcing you to do so?\"\"It's Long Zhanwu?\"Long Fei said: \"Other than him, who else could it be?\"Liu Feng kept this in mind and didn't ask any further questions.The Long Family's examination was the hardest one of the four pillars's families. The disciples who participated were all over twenty years old, and their cultivation were all Level 5 Battle-Masters and above. Most of them were warriors of the war spirit realm.To Long Fei, this examination was extremely difficult.Other than that, he was most worried that Long Zhanwu had a trick up his sleeve.\u2026 \u2026.After Long Fei left, Liu Feng immediately reported this matter to Fu Xishan.Fu Xishan pondered for a moment, then said: \"Inform Uncle Black, get him to pay attention to Long Zhanwu's movements. If possible, ask him to protect Long Fei, and tell him that I'm begging him.\"Liu Feng said: \"I'll go look for him now.\"Long Fei was very important to him.The Fengyuan Merchant Union had a decisive role to play in monopolizing the Fire Glass City's market, Long Fei.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Cannot be used again within 5 minutes.\"Recovering 500 true breath s in 3 seconds is more than enough for me.\" Long Fei became excited, he had already grasped the refining method of true pill and started to refine crazily.The true breath was used up, so he ate the Healing Pill.The true breath was full, and he began to refine it again.\u2026 \u2026.Late at night.Long Zhanwu's room.Long Zhanye said in a low voice: \"Big Brother, killer at failure alliance has already arrived at Fire Glass City, and is waiting for Long Zhanhai to come out.\"\"Alright!\" Long Zhanwu let out an excited cry, and said: \"Tomorrow is the family assessment, how are you going to resolve the matter with Long Fei?\"Long Zhanye laughed sinisterly, \"Everything has been prepared. No matter how powerful Long Fei is, he can't possibly be a match for someone in the war spirit Realm.Long Zhanye smiled mysteriously and said: \"Big Brother, this time, failure alliance will buy one free, other than Long Zhanhai, I will also report Long Fei to the sect. If our people can't settle Long Fei's problem during the clan assessment, failure alliance will also make a move, and this time, Long Fei won't be able to escape either.\"Long Zhanwu's eyes flashed with a bright light, \"Long Fei, as long as you die in the family assessment grounds, no one will suspect me, so what if they suspect you? You are just a broken waste of the Pubes. How many people would care about a piece of trash dying? \"Hahaha...\"\u2026 \u2026.Fengyuan Merchant Union.Liu Feng reported to Fu Xishan: \"I received news from the Black Elder that Long Zhanwu had invited the killer at failure alliance to participate in the Family Exam so we can take care of Long Fei.\"\"As expected!\"Fu Xishan frowned.Liu Feng hesitated for a moment, then said: \"Black Old Man wanted me to tell you, the Fengyuan Merchant Union cannot interfere in local affairs, I'm afraid the higher ups will blame them if they get involved.\"This was the reason why the Fengyuan Merchant Union was able to survive for a thousand years.He would absolutely not interfere in earthly affairs.They were not involved in any dispute.Fu Xishan was very clear of this point, and said: \"Elder Liu, I'm going out for a while.\"Half an hour later.Fu Xishan appeared in the branch of in the Chao Tian Sect.The Fengyuan Merchant Union could not interfere in local affairs, but there were people who could.For example.The Chao Heaven Sect!\u2026 \u2026.The Long Family's examination was an extremely important matter in the Fire Glass City.Furthermore, the three pillars and the Nan Gong Royal Family were closely watching the Long family's examination.Of course.Every year, there would be people infiltrating the exam grounds to investigate the Long family's disciples.This year was even more different.The dragon's roar continued to ferment, causing the three pillars and the Nangong Imperial Family to pay more attention.Divine Zhuge Prefecture\"This is a very good opportunity. We have to find out who the Dragon God Warriors are.\"\"If you can, kill him!\"\"Understood?\"\"Yes sir!\"Zhuge Tianlong had trained a group of Death Soldiers specifically to assassinate the geniuses of other families. He couldn't let the Dragon God Warriors rise to greatness, as it would affect the future of the Zhuge family.Li Martial Arts Sect was the same.Nangong Lei, Nangong Huo also sent people to the examination grounds.\u2026 \u2026.The Long family had been going downhill all these years.However \u2026No one dared to underestimate the Long family, especially the Long family's army.In Fire Glass Dynasty, the Long Family Army's reputation was shocking, and its fighting strength was peerless.The Long family's Grand Elder was in closed-door training. Whoever was a Dragon God soldier, could control the Long family's army.In the three pillars, the Nangong Imperial Family didn't want to see the Dragon God Warriors appear again in the Long Family. If they didn't expect the Long Family's army to suddenly appear in the Fire Glass City, that would be fatal for them.In the dead of night, the killing intent was boundless.Long Fei sat in the courtyard and ate the supper that jojo had prepared for him, quietly staring at the night sky. jojo massaged his shoulders and back, this feeling was too comfortable.\"jojo, when I'm not around, you should avoid going out as much as possible. If anyone dares to bully you, don't worry so much and just smash their face with talismans.\" Long Fei warned again, \"If that doesn't work, you should escape to the Fengyuan Merchant Union to find Liu Feng. He will protect you.\"Right now, the only person he was worried about was jojo.These days, Long Fei had always been thinking of ways to help jojo cultivate, but he did not know why jojo was unable to grasp the main point.Born to be stupid?No!Rather, it was her body that was a little special, as if she was unable to accept the martial arts training.In the end, Long Fei had no other choice.jojo laughed faintly: \"Young Master, don't worry, I will remember all the things you taught me. But you have to be careful, the Long family's exam is the harshest. \"Long Fei reached out and grabbed jojo's slender hand, and said: \"Don't worry, this young master is invincible.\"jojo struggled a bit, but was unable to free herself from it, causing her face to turn red, her heart to thump wildly in her chest, not daring to say another word.\"Damn it!\"\"If you want to take the family test, then do it properly. Whoever dares to provoke laozi, laozi will definitely kill him.\" Long Fei muttered in his heart.All night.Even Long Fei was not idle.He was still cultivating his cultivation technique.The one month of cultivation of the Wind Shadow Step had increased to level 1.dragon salyer technique cultivation was too slow.Long Fei kept trying, and also succeeded in making a breakthrough. Right now, the dragon chop's blade energy was stacked up to one hundred and twenty levels, making it even more harmful.If the Toading Skill was completely unleashed, it would deal 400% of the best damage.With the bonus from the Spirit Ring, the damage would be even more severe if it was a critical hit.The pills were well-prepared.The talismans were well-prepared.If there was still time, Long Fei would have definitely refined a few super puppets.Everything was ready, and all he had to do was wait for the exam.Early morning. The sky was bright.The Long Family's martial-arts arena was packed full of people.Long Zhanwu stood on the stage and said loudly: \"For the clan examination, every disciple of the Long family must use all their strength and bring out all the results of your years of cultivation.\"\"You are the future of the Long family, the hope of the Long family.\"And then \u2026Another elder walked up and said: \"The family examination is divided into two parts. The first round is the Fire Glass Mountain Range Trial.\"The results of the first round are based on the demon beast points you have hunted.\"\"level 1 monster 10 points, 2nd level 50 points, 3rd level 100 points, 4th level 500 points, 5th level 1000 points \u2026 Of course, let me remind everyone, if you meet any three-rate monster and beast, you should leave as soon as possible. If you meet level 4, you can run as fast as you want when you're level 5. \"\"The second round, the Long family arena battle.\"\"Only the top 16 disciples of the first round can participate.\"\"The first place reward is great.\"At this time, Long Zhanwu smiled, and said: \"The first person will be qualified to select the Sky Sect next year, be able to enter the banquet of forbidden peak Palace at the end of the year, and also receive the right to cultivate the Long family's Heaven Ranked technique 'Dragon Break'.\"As soon as Long Zhanwu finished his sentence.A system announcement suddenly sounded out in Long Fei's mind.\"Ding!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Adding my current points, I can exchange it for a Demonic Cultivator.\"\"Heh heh \u2026\" \"Your father is determined to win!\"At the same time.martial-arts arena was shocked.\"For the Heaven Sect's selection, the entire Long family only has one spot. If they can enter the Heaven Sect, that would be great.\"\"It must be mine, whoever wants to fight with me, I'll fight with him with my life.\"\"Also, the banquet of forbidden peak, this is the most grand annual banquet that only the geniuses of the various families are qualified to attend.\"\"Those are all empty, the Dragon Break is the most important. This is a secret manual left behind by the Great Ancestor, if you train it, you will be invincible within the same level.\"\u2026 \u2026.Many of the Long family disciples were incomparably excited.This year's rewards for the family exam were much more generous than last year's.Apart from the prizes on the surface, they would also receive the full upbringing of the Long family.Long Zhanwu slightly pressed down with both hands, and said: \"Does anyone have any other questions?\"One of the disciples looked at Xiang Longfei and sneered: \"This year, there is also a piece of trash participating in the clan's examination.With that, everyone looked at Xiang Longfei.The gazes of those people all revealed cold and disdainful smiles.Long Zhanwu also revealed a proud smile.The disciple continued, \"I don't care how he participated in the clan's exam, I just want to ask, if he died inside, should he be responsible?\"\"Cousin brother Long Yong is right. Didn't he claim to be the young master of the Long family? What if they fought over something with the young lord and accidentally killed him? What would they do then? That is the young master of the Long family, the young master of Pubes that is broken, and whose veins are stagnant, the laughingstock of the Fire Glass City. \"\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"The martial-arts arena mocked.Long Zhanwu said: \"The main purpose of the family assessment is to increase your cultivations, as for the incident in the competition, as for the accident, everyone try your best to avoid it, if not, then you can only blame yourself for not being good at learning.\"Long Yong smiled confidently, looked at Long Fei, and arrogantly said: \"Young Master, you must not meet me in the examination grounds, or else there will really be an accident.\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"Young master? Hahaha... The God of War is more or less the same. \"\"Long Fei, you are the shame of the Long family, you better not meet me, if not I will teach you a lesson.\"\u2026 \u2026.Long Fei silently stood in the midst of the crowd, his face expressionless as he looked at the disciples of the Long Family who were ridiculing him, and muttered in his heart: \"10 points in Energy Values, 20 points, 30 points \u2026 Counting it, we should be able to increase our Energy Values by a few hundred points this time. \"Since Long Zhanwu had the 'accident theory', then Long Fei was a lot more at ease.Long Zhanwu looked at Long Fei and thought, \"Long Fei, you won't be able to escape this time, hahaha \u2026\"After pausing for a moment, Long Zhanwu looked at the hour and said: \"Let's go!\"\u2026 \u2026.Half a day later.Outside Fire Glass Mountain Range, Fire Wolf Valley.In a huge valley, there was only one kind of demon beast, the Fire Wolf.An elder standing outside the valley said: \"You have to come out on time three days later or your results will be invalid.\"\"Remember!\"\"You must not leave the territory of the Fire Wolf Valley, otherwise you will be in great danger.\"\"Let's enter the valley now!\"As soon as he finished.Over a hundred disciples of the Long family quickly shouted.\"Is there anyone who would like to go together?\"\"Level one war spirit. We need to team up quickly.\"\"Hurry up, we only need five people.\"\u2026 \u2026.It was just like in the game where a party was requested to hunt a Boss, but a group of people quietly entered the Fire Wolf Valley.\"Huff \u2026\"Long Fei took a deep breath, and said: \"It's really a familiar feeling, it's just that in the past it was within the game, now it's the real world.\"\"Let's start!\"And then \u2026Long Fei stepped into the Fire Wolf Valley.After he entered the Fire Wolf Valley, there were immediately a few disciples of the Long family following behind him.\u2026 \u2026.In another place.Long Zhanye reported: \"Big Brother, my men have already followed them.\"Long Zhanwu asked: \"Where are the people from the failure alliance?\"Long Zhanye said: \"I'm already in position, if my men don't finish off Long Fei within two days, failure alliance's assassins will attack. You can be at ease, failure alliance has never failed before!\"Long Zhanwu laughed with satisfaction: \"Very good!\"\u2026 \u2026.three pillars and the Nan Gong Royal Family received the news at the same time.\"The Long family's examination venue, Fire Wolf Valley!\"Zhuge Tianlong laughed coldly, \"The Li family, Nangong Lei, and Nangong Huo should have already made their moves, we can't fall behind either. The Long family has already descended into the west, it's time to change the situation of the Fire Glass City.\"\"Have the Death Soldiers move!\"\"Yes sir!\"\u2026 \u2026.Fire Glass Mountain Range was not far from him.\"Senior Sister, are we really going to protect that bastard?\" Xiao Tiantian was very unwilling, but when she thought of the scene of Long Fei saying that her breasts were small, she felt her heart going crazy.Now that she had come to protect him, she was extremely unwilling.Ye Ziyan laughed, \"Little junior sister apprentice, you talk about him everyday. I see that you want to see that bastard more than us, hehe \u2026 \u2026\"Xiao Tiantian immediately said: \"I really wish to see him again, then chop me into eight pieces, and actually said that I have a small chest, hmph!\"Liu Luoxi said: \"I owe Pavillion Master Fu a favor, and I also owe Long Fei a favor. This time, I just happen to repay them back, and like this, we won't owe each other anything.\"\"It's the two of you.\"\"Why are you following me?\"Regarding this matter, Liu Luoxi had promised her that she would do it alone, but Xiao Tiantian and Ye Ziyan insisted on following.Without waiting for the two girls to speak, Liu Luoxi joked: \"You two like that bastard, right?\"\"Not at all!\" Xiao Tiantian immediately denied.Ye Ziyan's face was slightly startled, she said, \"I came to protect Senior Sister, that is the killer at failure alliance.\"Xiao Tiantian also immediately said: \"I'm here to protect Second Senior Sister, that's a killer at failure alliance after all.\"Liu Luoxi laughed: \"You two don't need to quibble, Long Fei looks average, but he is also a type that can bear to watch. Moreover, his body is giving off a unique charm, so the two of you are definitely captivated by him.\"\"Eldest Senior Sister, you even noticed the unique charm of his body, don't you also \u2026\" Xiao Tiantian said slyly.Liu Luoxi glared at him.Xiao Tiantian immediately ran out, \"Hehe \u2026. Senior Sister, you also like that bastard, hahaha \u2026 \"\u2026 \u2026.Four hours later.The Long family's disciples had completely disappeared from the valley.Long Fei increased his speed to the maximum and travelled continuously. After four hours of trekking, he finally reached the edge of an extremely remote place and looked around to see if there were any other disciples from the Long Family present.Long Fei stopped, a smile hung on his face, and turned: \"Aren't you tired after following me all the way? Come out and play! \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The leading man coldly laughed: \"Long Fei, what do you want me to say about you?\"\"He actually brought me to such a desperate situation and found me such a remote place. Is he looking for a tomb?\"\"Brothers, attack!\"\"We just caused an accident with Long Fei because he overestimated himself and wanted to steal our Fire Wolf Beast.\"After speaking a few words with dignity, the three of them immediately surrounded Long Fei.Long Fei smiled faintly: \"Before I die, can you tell me why?\"The man in the lead said, \"Why what?\"Long Fei asked: \"Why did you kill me as if I had never offended you before? Or is it that you were ordered by someone, Long Zhanwu? \"The man in the lead sneered, \"I don't mind telling you. You are a dead man anyway. You're right, it was indeed the Grand Elder who sent us. The reason is simple, is because you overestimated yourself and blocked the Great Clan Elder's path. \"\"Oh!\"\"Understood.\" Long Fei nodded and said: \"I am sure now.\"The man in the lead asked, \"Are you sure about what?\"The corner of Long Fei's mouth drew back, and a Sword Teeth Tiger Spell Note landed between his two fingers. It revealed a death god's smile, and said: \"Indeed, you can all go and die now!\"\"Go!\"He released a Glyph.Then.Long Fei released his' Wind Shadow Step ', causing a wind to blow beneath his feet as layers of illusions appeared.It was impossible to see his speed and direction.With a move of the Desolate Blade, he slashed down, \"Skin Cracking!\"\"Roar \u2026\"The Sword Teeth Tiger Spell Note threw one of the Long Family's disciple to the ground, opened its mouth wide and bit off the disciple's neck, blood gushing out wildly.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' \u2026\"Instant kill!At this moment.The 'dragon salyer technique' that Long Fei had released had killed another disciple who was at the eighth level of the Battle-Master.Another instant kill!He then jumped into the air and landed heavily on the ground, \"Gua Gua...\"The leader felt his scalp go numb. In less than three seconds, his two brothers were killed in an instant, and when he saw Long Fei crawling on the ground and doing some weird actions, the first thought that flashed through his mind was to escape!\"Long Fei, just you wait, I won't let you off!\"He quickly fled.Seeing that Long Fei had not caught up, his heart slightly relaxed as he thought to himself, \"He should not be able to catch up.\"Before he could finish.\"Bam!\"He rushed forward, and his spine was fractured. A strong wave of true breath rushed into his internal organs, and he heard a cold voice from behind him, \"Kill him!\"\"Crack!\"His internal organs were all twisted, as if they were being stirred up by a meat grinder.\"Puff puff puff \u2026\"Blood spewed out as his internal organs were completely minced and he fell to the ground!Die!\"Ding!\"The system rang out once again.Long Fei said coldly: \"Don't provoke me, if not, even if it's the Emperor, I will still kill him!\"He was incomparably domineering.After taking care of the three members of the Long Family, Long Fei did not stay any longer.\u2026 \u2026.One hour later.Long Ao bellowed: \"Useless trash, you're going to lose it along with other people!\"\"Young master, what do we do now?\"Long Ao said coldly: \"Of course we have to keep searching. Let Long Yong move out, remember to definitely capture Long Fei alive, I want to personally deal with him.\"He had to take revenge for two slaps!\"Yes sir!\"\u2026 \u2026.Long Fei only stopped when he was deep within the Fire Wolf Valley. Looking at the wolf that had a body that seemed to be covered in flames, he shouted out, \"It's moving!\"The Wind Shadow Step moved.His steps were like an illusion, like the wind, but also like a mirage.The Level 1 Fire Wolf didn't even have time to react before its head was chopped off by Long Fei.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for defeating 'Fire Wolf' for obtaining 300 experience and 10 true breath.\"\"The journey to level up has begun!\"Hearing that, the system beep's blood started to boil. Long Fei placed the Fire Wolf Head into the Space Ring released by the Long Family. Then, he locked onto the second Fire Wolf Head and continued to kill.\"Ding!\"\"Ding!\"\"Ding!\"The system's voice rang out incessantly.Two hours later.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for levelling up! Currently Level 7 Battle Master!\"\"A seventh grade Battle-Master is still not strong enough!\"Half of the examinees were in the war spirit Realm, so if they met him, it would definitely be very troublesome. Moreover, if Long Zhanwu wanted to get rid of him, she couldn't possibly only send a few war division realm disciples, there would definitely be some experts behind her.Long Fei had to hurry and make a breakthrough!Only by levelling up would he be able to obtain even more power, and be able to fight against experts at the war spirit Realm!\"Continue!\"The more Long Fei killed, the fiercer he became. With the experience from killing beasts in the Fire Glass Mountain Range, it was very easy for him to deal with Rank 1 Beasts.For an entire day.Long Fei kept killing fire wolves in the depths of the valley, and the corpses of the fire wolves were everywhere.His Experience Points had also risen by half.Night descended. The time for demonic beasts to be controlled had arrived.Night was the time for Monstrous Beasts to search for food. At that time, all sorts of Monstrous Beasts would come out, and at night, they would become even more ferocious to Monstrous Beasts.Most importantly, their vision at night was much better than humans.\"Roar \u2026\"On a cliff, a wolf howled.Next.The ten thousand wolves in the valley roared together, and the entire valley was filled with a dangerous aura.Under normal circumstances.At night, all the disciples of the Long family were in hiding. Only one madman was still there, and he was killing to his heart's content.\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"Fire Wolves are becoming more and more concentrated. It's really too awesome. If I kill another night, I'll definitely be able to break through the Eight-level Warrior.\" Long Fei was not afraid of anything, he was just afraid that there would be no demon beasts to kill.The smell of fresh blood pervaded the air.Fire Wolf was gathering.They were all gathered near Xiang Longfei.Wolves!More than 500 wolves.\"I'll kill, I'll kill, I'll kill again.\" The more Long Fei killed, the easier it became for him to kill him. Using the Wind Shadow Step, Fire Wolf couldn't even hurt him at all, his entire body seemed like he was dancing.\u2026 \u2026.\"Big Senior, do you think he's crazy?\"\"Does he not know that it is demon beast time at night and he wants to hide?\"\"Senior Sister, the surrounding fire wolves are rapidly gathering, all of them are facing the sky, should we \u2026\"The three Sky Sect sisters had discovered Long Fei an hour ago.They were closely watching Long Fei from the shadows.Liu Luoxi pondered for a moment, then said: \"What we promised Pavillion Master Fu is to deal with him, as for the other matters, they are not our business.\"Xiao Tiantian was stunned for a moment, and then muttered: \"Big Senior, what we're doing isn't really good, right?\"Ye Ziyan teased, \"Is the little junior sister apprentice's heart aching?\"Xiao Tiantian immediately said, \"I don't have any heartache, it's best if he dies. Big idiot, big stupid pig, I don't even know if I'll be surrounded by Fire Wolves right now.\"Ye Ziyan smiled even more, \"You're still saying it's because your heart hurts, but I think you just want to rush out and help him.\"Liu Luoxi's voice sank, and he said: \"Don't make a sound, the wolf pack is coming!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The surrounding area was densely packed with Fire Wolves, occupying the entire narrow valley.\"Bam!\"\"Bam!\"One after another of Fire Wolves jumped down and stood in front of Long Fei.The fangs shone with a cold light, as he walked towards Xiang Longfei step by step.\"Wolves?\"Long Fei was too engrossed in the battle, and by the time he found the wolf pack, it was already too late.However!Long Fei clenched both his fists tightly, raised his head and swallowed a true pill. His true breath recovered 500 points, and he muttered: \"I've cultivated for a month's worth of skills.It was also at this time.Xiao Bai poked his head out from Yun Che's embrace, rubbed his eyes, still in a slightly drowsy state, and said: \"Master, do you want me to come?\"Long Fei said: \"If you continue sleeping, I can handle it.\"\"Oh!\" Xiao Bai yawned, without saying a word, he turned and walked back to the war pet space to sleep.Long Fei said: \"You're not being courteous at all.\"\"Hu!\"His heart calmed down as his right hand gripped the Desolate Saber tightly. His body slightly sank as he wildly laughed and said, \"Come!\"\"Shua!\"With a step, Long Fei suddenly rushed out.\u2026 \u2026.\"Does he want to die?!\"\"What does he want to do? Does he think he's a match for the wolves?\"\"Eldest Senior Sister, what should we do?\"Xiao Tiantian became anxious.She usually liked to bicker with Long Fei, but she had a kind heart.Ye Ziyan did not tease Xiao Tiantian anymore, but asked seriously: \"Senior sister, if we did not attack, he might have been torn apart by the fire wolves.\"Liu Luoxi was also a little worried in her heart, but she still maintained her composure, and said: \"Let's take a look first!\"The feeling Long Fei gave her was not ordinary at all.In the face of the wolf pack Long Fei, he did not panic at all. Instead, he could see a hint of excitement in his eyes.\u2026 \u2026.The true breath moved.Long Fei's feet moved like the wind, the Desolate Blade in his hands continued to slash down, \"Skin opening, tendons breaking, bones breaking, blood cutting, Spirit awakening, Spirit Stunning, slay \u2026\"The dragon salyer technique was released one after another.The saber Qi continued to superimpose on each other.The Octoterra Blade almost couldn't endure the dragon salyer's Qi anymore, and it started to tremble non-stop in Long Fei's hands.The seven moves of dragon salyer technique were released.Long Fei retreated quickly.The surrounding fire wolves swarmed over, and dozens of fire wolves swooped down, wanting to tear Long Fei into shreds.At this moment.Long Fei's body sank, revealing a cold smile, and said: \"dragon chop!\"\"Shua!\"As the saber slashed down, layers of saber Qi were released.whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh \u2026 *Half Moon Saber Qi flew out violently and instantly killed one Fire Wolf after another.\"First level, second level, third level \u2026\" With every layer of blade aura released, Long Fei would silently read out a number. As he counted, the fire wolf cried out miserably, its severed limbs flying everywhere, and its fresh blood splattering everywhere.One after another, Fire Wolves were killed.One after another, notifications rang out. \"Ding ding ding \u2026.\" It was like setting off firecrackers!\"One hundred twenty-eight!\"\"Another level of improvement!\"Long Fei was a little bit excited. The dragon salyer technique was a Divine level technique, it was extremely difficult to upgrade it even a little. One more layer of the blade aura was equivalent to one more layer of damage.Furthermore, the further the saber Qi went, the greater the damage.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for levelling up!\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations player 'Long Fei' for killing a thousand Fire Wolves, you have received the title 'Wolf Slayer'. You have received 1000 experience points, 100 true breath, 10 Energy Values, 10 points reward, and 10% increase in damage to Fire Wolf!\"\"Huh?\"\"I've obtained a title!\" Long Fei was overjoyed. Looking at the chaotic scene around him, and then looking at the fire wolves that were continuously retreating, \"Hehe \u2026 Are you afraid? \"\"Trying to run?\"\"If I don't agree, none of you will escape!\"While they were talking \u2026Long Fei pounced forward with his Desolate Blade. The more than three hundred Fire Wolves were scared to the point of peeing, as if they were chased by demons.The battle strength of the wolves were extremely ferocious, but Long Fei was even more ferocious than them.The ruthlessness of the dragon salyer technique made every single fire wolf feel fear. That kind of blade energy that could destroy everything was too crazy and too tyrannical, it was not an attack they could endure.\u2026 \u2026.\"I've only heard of wolves chasing people, and I've never seen people chasing wolves. Eldest senior sister, are our eyes playing tricks on us?\" Xiao Tiantian rubbed his eyes, a little unable to believe what he had just seen.Ye Ziyan's face was also filled with disbelief, she said, \"Isn't this guy too abnormal?\"Liu Luoxi was also extremely shocked in his heart, and muttered: \"The power unleashed by the war division realm is even stronger than what the war spirit told me, the kind of blade technique he cultivates is at least at the Heaven Stage, it seems like his mysterious master is too powerful.\"\"To be able to use Alchemy, refine talismans and have a powerful cultivation technique, is there such a strong practitioner in the Fire Glass City?\"\"Or is it the Grand Elder of the Long family?\"The three of them were getting more and more confused by Long Fei.Xiao Tiantian looked at Long Fei who was chasing after the pack of wolves, and laughed: \"So handsome!\"Ye Ziyan laughed, \"Didn't someone say that his looks are average?\"Xiao Tiantian muttered with her small mouth, and cunningly said: \"I never said that. Moreover, I'm not talking about his appearance, I'm talking about that temperament on his body.\"\"Yo!\"\"You are the same as Senior Sister, you can even see the kind of aura he has.\" Ye Ziyan smiled and said.Xiao Tiantian placed his hands on his waist and said: \"Senior Sister Zi Yan, don't think that you can bully me just because you have a big chest.Ye Ziyan looked at Liu Luoxi's chest, and immediately said: \"Little girl, if you dare to sow discord, I won't let you see!\"Xiao Tiantian immediately hid to Liu Luoxi's side and begged for help: \"Big Senior Sister, please save me.\"Liu Luoxi said with slight anger: \"Stop messing around, let's go!\"Ye Ziyan asked, \"Where are you going? Isn't it supposed to be protecting Long Fei? \"Liu Luoxi said: \"Can you see Long Fei now?\"Xiao Tiantian looked around and realized that Long Fei was already gone. He immediately ran out and said: \"What are you waiting for, why aren't you guys moving faster?\"\"Senior sisters, hurry up.\"\"If something happens to that bastard, how am I supposed to explain myself to my big cousin?\"Ye Ziyan laughed: \"Pavillion Master Fu isn't asking you to help, what do you want to explain? I think you're afraid that your lover will get hurt, hehe \u2026 \u2026\"\u2026 \u2026.Chasing and killing along the way.His Experience Points continued to rise.This feeling was too wonderful!At daybreak.Not a single Flame Wolf remained out of the three hundred or so which were all killed by Long Fei. Their Experience Points had increased by nearly a level, and they still had more than two hundred thousand experience points before they could level up again.While he was leveling up.Throughout the entire night, more than a dozen Long Family disciples had been assassinated. Their methods were extremely cruel. Every one of the Long Family disciples had their limbs cut off and their blood extracted!The death warrior of the Zhuge family!An assassin from the Nangong Imperial Clan.Nangong Lei's Warriors.These disciples of the Long family were all elites of the Long family, and the Long family did not discover anything!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If it wasn't for the appearance of the Grand Elder, his blood essence would have been sucked dry.\"Seems like it's not Long Zhanwu. Someone from another sect is invading this place.\" Long Fei's heart trembled, this was already the third time he had met a member of the Long family whose tendons and limbs had been cut off and whose blood essence had been sucked dry.The method was different.The techniques used were also different. From the various marks on the corpse, it seemed like it was not just an external force.Long Fei thought of the other three pillars s of the Fire Glass City, and thought to himself: \"Could it be them?\"At this moment.\"Long Fei, you actually dared to assassinate a disciple of the same clan, and your methods are so cruel. Today, I am going to exterminate evil for the Long family.\"A voice sounded.His figure moved, and instantly sealed Long Fei's escape route.Long Yong!Level one war spirit Ranker.Long Yong looked at the corpse on the ground, his eyebrows turned sinister as he asked: \"Long Fei, do you still have anything else to say?\"Long Fei stood up, and said with a grin: \"I have nothing to say to you, didn't you say you want to exterminate evil by punishing us? \"Come!\"\"There's no way to argue, right?\"Long Yong sneered: \"Then obediently kneel down and accept your death.\"Long Fei said: Accept your death?\"Is this Long Zhanwu's goal?\" Long Fei sneered, and his footsteps suddenly started to move.Long Yong frowned, and laughed: \"How dare you play with a mere war division realm in front of me? I'll let you know what is called the power of the war spirit. \"Both of his fists sank, and a series of popping sounds could be heard from his fists.A wave of dense war spirit Qi was released, his fist moved, \"Mountain Splitting Fist!\"\"Huff \u2026\"A whistling sound came out, as his fist struck straight at Long Fei's head.Mountain Splitting Fist was able to split mountains and shatter rocks. If this punch struck, Long Fei would definitely die.The first move he used was a killing move!If you want to put Long Fei to death, since that's the case \u2026 Long Fei revealed a cold smile, and said: \"Die!\"The Wind Shadow Step was released.His body swayed and swayed.Before Long Yong's fist could land on the ground, Long Fei was already behind him.Long Yong punched nothing but air, and turned to look.A figure rushed over, and before his defense could land on his chest, \"Kacha\", his ribs were broken and his body was blown away.In that moment, a surge of true breath power entered his internal organs.Long Fei didn't even turn his head as he coldly snorted, \"Strangle him!\"\"Crack!\"\"Pfft!\"Long Yong spat out a large mouthful of black blood, his internal organs were completely twisted into mush, and his body swayed, as he looked at Long Fei who was slowly walking further and further away, his face filled with disbelief, \"How could \u2026 how could this be?! He's obviously the war division realm, how could this be \u2026\"\"Bam!\"His body collapsed and died!\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing 'Long Yong' for gaining 1500 experience, 70 true breath and 10 Energy Values.\"\"Do you want to release Striking Attribute?\"\"No!\"It was just a waste for these small shrimps to release Striking Attribute.Striking Attribute naturally had to be released on the Boss' body, as only then would he be able to get more good items.After Long Fei left.A black clothed man landed from a big tree, without making a sound, he checked Long Yong's injuries, his eyebrows slightly furrowed, and then disappeared.\u2026 \u2026.One hour later.Long Ao was incomparably furious, \"Useless trash, he actually killed you!\"\"Let Long Tai and Long Lin go. We must take him down for me.\"Seeing Long Yong's expression as though he had died with grievance, Long Ao kicked him and coldly snorted: \"Truly a piece of trash!\"\u2026 \u2026.Long Fei killing Long Yong seemed to be a small matter.However \u2026The people of three pillars knew very quickly.The result was the same. KILL!This was because they were worried that Long Fei would recover the Dragon God's blood essence. If that were to happen, the rise of this genius would be unstoppable, and he definitely wouldn't be able to live in this world.The Fire Wolf Valley became filled with killing intent.Beside a small stream, Long Fei got a wild rabbit, opened its stomach, and started roasting it.\"Xiao Bai, do you want to try something?\" The idea moved, but surprisingly, Xiao Bai did not have the slightest reaction. He was a big foodie, yet he did not continue to sleep peacefully despite facing the barbecue.Long Fei did not call him anymore.Ever since he had returned from the Fire Glass Mountain Range, Xiao Bai had been sound asleep. Aside from the one time he woke up from his daze last night, he had not woken up at all.Long Fei had a feeling that Xiao Bai was about to have a breakthrough!After eating the roast meat, Long Fei continued to look for beasts to level up.\u2026 \u2026.In the dark.\"Gu gu... \"Gurgle gurgle \u2026\"\"Gulp...\"The stomachs of the three women were growling.Xiao Tiantian kept swallowing his saliva, and when he smelled the fragrance of the roasted meat, he could not resist.\"What a fragrant barbecue.\"\"He's simply a bastard.\"\"Eldest Senior Sister, since we are so hungry to protect him, shouldn't we collect some interest? At the very least, you have to feed us. \" Xiao Tiantian said in annoyance.Long Fei's barbecue was deadly enticing to them.In the few days since they returned from the Fire Glass Mountain Range, they could not eat anything. Compared to Long Fei's barbecue, the food in the restaurants were like pig's food.Liu Luoxi replied: It's just a barbecue, we can roast ourselves too.\"Zi Yan, go slaughter a demon beast.\"\"I don't believe it.\"Xiao Tiantian volunteered, \"I'll go find firewood.\"Half an hour later.A demonic beast was placed on the fire rack to roast it.However...Not even ten minutes later, a burnt smell wafted out.Liu Luoxi immediately took down the roast meat, and said: \"Come, come, let's have a taste first, it's definitely not worse than that bastard's roast meat.\"Xiao Tiantian couldn't wait and tore off a piece of the roasted meat. He discovered that there were still traces of blood below the meat, but because he was too hungry, he couldn't care less about it. Senior Sister, what is this? \"Ye Ziyan also tore off a piece and ate it. After eating a few bites her face turned purple, clutching her chest and said, \"I can't do it, I'm going to be poisoned.\"Liu Luoxi glared at them, \"Is it that bad?\"He tore off a piece and bit at it a few times. His face was pale as he spat it out. \"It's also a piece of barbecue. Why is the difference so huge?\"This was bullying!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If he falls into my hands next time \u2026\"Without waiting for her to finish, Ye Ziyan smiled and said, \"It's only a piece of meat. You've said it countless times, when can you move?\"\"Wrong!\"Xiao Tiantian said angrily: \"I will cut him into nine pieces, and give one piece to you, Senior Sister.\"\"Stop talking, hurry up and catch up with us. Don't forget our mission.\" Liu Luoxi was extremely fast, and in the blink of an eye, he had caught up.When he reached the hillside, he discovered that Long Fei was no longer there.\"Senior sister, I'm so hungry.\" Xiao Tiantian said weakly, following that, a burst of fragrance entered his nose, \"What smell is this, the smell of barbecue?\"\"Senior Sister, there's half a roasted hare here.\" Xiao Tiantian's nose was of a dog's.\"It must have been the bastard.\"\"What a waste.\"Xiao Tiantian tore off a rabbit leg and took a bite, his entire body immediately filled with power, \"It's too delicious.\"Liu Luoxi frowned, he secretly thought: \"Has he been discovered?\"\u2026 \u2026.Everything was normal during the day.There were also very few demon beasts, but Long Fei did not let go of any of them.Night fell.The forest became dark, and wolf howls broke the silence.At the same time.The various powers in the forest also began to move.That night, Long Fei did not continue to kill fire wolves. Instead, he carefully hid himself, wanting to see who exactly was assassinating the disciples of the Long family.Long Zhanwu eliminated others?Or was it the power of the Fire Glass City?An hour later.From not too far away, the sound of hurried footsteps could be heard. \"Who the hell are you?\"whoosh whoosh whoosh \u2026 *The sound of several quick shuttles sounded.\"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\"\"Big brother Long Shan, run!\"\"Ah... \"Ah \u2026\"Three blood-curdling screams rang out.There was still one more person frantically escaping, and he was getting closer and closer to Long Fei.Long Fei quietly waited.\"Bam!\"Long Shan tripped on the ground, and at the same time, three black shadows fell from the sky and surrounded him. One of the men in black sneered, \"Run, run again. Let's see where you can run to.\"The long spear in Long Shan's hand shook as he coldly snorted and said, \"Who the hell are you?\"If he couldn't escape, then let's fight!The man in black sneered, \"He's the one who wants your life.\"\"Then let's see what you can do.\" Long Shan suddenly moved. With a thrust of his spear, a spear flower appeared. He leaped into the air and landed on the ground. Suddenly, he turned his spear, \"Returning Spear!\"The spear suddenly pierced a black-clothed man behind him.The black-clothed man did not have any defense at all as he faced it head on.\"Puchi!\"A spear pierced through Black Robe's left shoulder, but the black-clothed man stabbed towards the center of Long Shan's eyebrows.Long Shan had no choice but to give up his spear and quickly dodge.Then.The other two men in black wielded their swords. One of them stabbed into Long Shan's left and right shoulders, directly nailing him to a big tree.\"Master said that we can't let go of any of the Long family disciples' blood essence.\"While they were talking \u2026Each of them took out a special bottle.Long Shan's face was pale from the pain, but he didn't let out a single cry of pain. Instead, he said coldly, \"A Death Soldier from the Divine Marquis of Zhuge!\"That shot just now was indeed very clever, but with the cultivation of the man in black, he could easily dodge it. However, he did not. Thus, Long Shan thought of the Death Soldier the Zhuge family had secretly trained.The three of them shivered slightly.Long Shan confirmed their identities with their eyes, \"They are the death warriors of the Zhuge family indeed. The assassination of our young master last time was also done by you, the Marquis of Zhuge, right?\"\"So what if we know our identities?\"\"Don't worry, after you die, we'll send your Young Lord down to accompany you.\"And then \u2026A black-clothed man took out a dagger and cut at Long Shan's meridian \u2026At this moment.The top quality Sword Teeth Tiger talisman shot out.A water attribute Sword Teeth Tiger rushed out, and instantly threw the black clothed man onto the ground. It opened its bloody mouth, and bit off the person's neck.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing 'Death Soldier Zhuge' for obtaining 2,300 experience, 120 true breath and 10 Energy Values.\"\"As expected!\"Long Fei's heart trembled.The other two Death Soldiers immediately turned, and seeing Long Fei walking out from the darkness, the two of them looked at each other, and immediately rushed forward.Long Shan was secretly shocked, and immediately said: \"Young master, quickly run, they are all war spirit Realm experts, you are not their match!\"Ever since the last time Long Fei had knocked him out in one move, Long Shan had once again admitted in his heart that Long Fei was the young master of the Long family.This was the world.Strength was respected, not to mention that Long Shan was a soldier. His worship of strength was stronger than anyone else's.Long Fei coldly said: \"When has the Long Family ever run away before?\"\"Huh?\"Long Shan's heart sank. This sentence stung him, but it made him even more certain of Long Fei's capabilities. He exerted force in his arms, wanting to pull the sword out from his shoulder.Long Fei said slightly: \"Don't move.\"\"Long Fei, you came out to seek death yourself!\"\"Attack!\"The two men in black attacked from the left and right, their movements were like ghosts.The aura of the war spirit was released and a strong power continued to crush Long Fei.They were completely different from Long Yong.They were the warriors of the Zhuge family. They would not show the slightest mercy when they fought, nor did they care about their own lives. They only had one goal in life: kill their target, complete their mission, and pay any price.Long Fei did not dare to be careless.He took out his Desolate Blade and used Wind Shadow Step.\"Open the skin!\"As the blade slashed down, the black-clothed man didn't dodge at all. Instead, he stabbed forward with his sword.Long Fei's feet moved like the wind.The shadow moved, barely dodging a sword attack. In his heart, he thought, \"A desperate way to fight?\"It was also at this moment that the sound of rapid footsteps came from the mountain slope and truly charged at him.Long Fei locked his eyebrows, \"I can't stay for long!\"\"Since you like to fight for your lives, then let's quickly finish you off!\"Long Fei did not want to continue battling, and the longer it dragged on, the worse it was for him. How many more death warriors were left in Fire Wolf Valley?Suddenly.Long Fei bellowed, \"Wind Shadow Step, Second realm, Ripple Tiny Steps!\"\"Buzz!\"A wave of true breath was released from his body.The true breath activated its cultivation technique, and Long Fei had been cultivating the Wind Shadow Step every day for the past few days. He had already levelled up to the second realm, the 'Profound Rippling Steps'.He increased his speed.Not only his speed, Long Fei's speed of attack also increased.\"Shua!\"\"Tendon Break!\"\"Break the bones!\"\u2026 \u2026.'slay!\"\"Die!\"Before the accumulated blade energy could be released, the two black clothed men died miserably under Long Fei's blade. Because it was too fast, even if they were in the war spirit realm, they could not keep up, and were completely slaughtered by Long Fei!\"Ding!\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for levelling up!

From today onwards, my Long Shan's life is yours.\"\"Young master, you're too strong.\"\"Young Lord...\"Long Fei glared at him and said: \"Can you shut up?\"Long Shan immediately shut his mouth.Long Fei said: \"Now listen to me, hide in the hollow of the tree, and don't let anyone find out. This is a healing pill, if you take another pill in four hours, all the wounds on your body will be healed.\"Long Shan replied, \"Many thanks Young Master, but Young Master, where do you want to go? According to my speculations, not only are there death warriors from the Zhuge family, there are also warriors from the Li Martial Arts Sect, Nangong Lei's men and there are also people from the Nangong Imperial Clan that had secretly sent them. The Fire Wolf Valley is too dangerous, Long Ao has also sent people to search for you, to kill you. \"The night was too dangerous. Demonic beasts and killers were destined to be a feast of assassination.\"As expected.\" Long Fei's heart trembled, and said: \"Since everyone wants my life, then let's see who wants who's life!\"And then \u2026Long Fei began to move quickly.\u2026 \u2026.\"Elder, we lost contact with the three warriors. They must have fallen.\"Zhuge Wei frowned and said in a low voice, \"Find out who did it?\"\"No!\"\"Trash!\" Zhuge Wei harrumphed coldly and said, \"The Dragon God Warriors are definitely still alive. Kill them all for me. Kill all the disciples of the Long family. Don't let anyone leave here alive.\"\"Yes sir!\"\u2026 \u2026.Li Martial Arts Sect also received the news that the death warrior of the Zhuge family was killed.Li Tian Feng asked: \"Did Long Zhanwu discover something?\"\"No, from the beginning till the end, Long Zhanwu did not send anyone into the Fire Wolf Valley, he did not seem to care about what was happening in the Fire Wolf Valley at all.\"Li Tian Feng said, \"I understand. Let's follow our original plan and continue to kill!\"\u2026 \u2026.Nangong Lei was secretly shocked, \"Are there any disciples that can kill Zhuge, the Death Soldiers?\"An old man replied: \"Reporting to Your Highness, the strongest disciple in the Long family examination is at the fifth level of the war spirit, this kind of strength might kill one person, but killing three at the same time is simply impossible.\"Nangong Lei muttered: \"Could it be the Dragon God Warriors?\"The old man was silent.And then \u2026Nangong Lei sneered, and said: \"No matter who it is, this batch of Long Family disciples all died in Fire Wolf Valley, send my order, let Gui Shou take action!\"The old man immediately nodded, and said: \"The five level monster is already prepared, once you enter the Fire Wolf Valley, you will be furious. At that time, not a single one of the Long family disciples will be able to survive, and all the death warriors of Zhuge family and the warriors of Li Martial Arts Sect will all die.\"Nangong Lei laughed sinisterly and said: \"We can definitely heavily injure them this time!\"\"Who would have thought that I, Nangong Lei, would have a Beast Master Stage expert?\"\"Hahahaha...\"\u2026 \u2026.The night was so quiet that it was terrifying.Suddenly.A black shadow flashed past.A Long family disciple walked out of the cave and suddenly shouted, \"Who is it?\"It was also at this moment.The four Li Martial Arts Sect s who rushed out were all elite warriors of the war spirit Realm.He moved at full power.\"Roar \u2026\"A talisman exploded, and a Sword Teeth Tiger rushed out. It directly pushed a warrior to the ground and bit off his neck.Instant kill!\"Ding!\"The system sounded out.Soon after, a ghost-like man wielded a saber and hacked down.His blade technique was incomparably fierce.\"Open the skin!\"\"Shua!\"\"Broken tendons, broken bones!\"whoosh whoosh \u2026 *The combination of dragon salyer technique and Ripple Tiny Steps was perfect and invulnerable.After a few consecutive slashes, the remaining three were killed.The Long Family disciples who were standing at the entrance of the cave were shocked. Looking at the dim Long Fei, they asked, \"Who are you?\"Long Fei said, \"Members of the Long family.\"And then he disappeared in the blink of an eye.\u2026 \u2026.\"Ahh \u2026\"A Long family disciple cried out in pain.Long Fei's eyes darkened, and rushed forward with all his strength.No matter what Long Zhanwu wanted to do to him, he always remembered one thing, he was a member of the Long family!The Long family's eldest son was the person who treated him the best in the world.The Long family was his hard work. He couldn't let the external forces kill the Long family's disciples so easily, absolutely not!In addition!Killing was so much better than killing Fire Wolves.He had plenty of experience and could drop some items. Although these items were trash, they could still be exchanged for points.Then there was the possibility of obtaining Energy Values!Long Fei spent the entire night assassinating the people of three pillars.Li Tian Feng and Zhuge Wei's hearts chilled. There were constant reports of death. They even felt that this was an assassination from the Long family.He was a little confused.Moreover.Most importantly, they did not even know who killed him.More and more disciples of the Long family were saved, and they too, did not know who it was. Long Fei only left behind one sentence each time, \"Members of the Long family.\"This caused the Long family disciples to feel warm in their hearts.The disciples of the Long family quickly gathered together.This way, it would be difficult for the death soldiers of the Zhuge family and the warriors of the Li family to assassinate him.\u2026 \u2026.Long Ao flew into a rage, \"You two are trash, if you can't even find them, what's the use in raising you two?\"Long Tai and Long Lin lowered their heads in silence.Long Ao frowned, and said: \"Since you can't find it, then hunt all the monsters here! You must get first place in the first round of the examination!\"\"Yes sir!\"This was what Long Zhanwu had instructed him to do. If he was still unable to deal with Long Fei on the second night, then there would be no need for him to act anymore.In the end, even Long Ao did not know who it was.However \u2026Long Ao believed that Long Fei would definitely not be able to survive.\"Long Fei, just you wait!\"\u2026 \u2026.A night of killing.Long Fei couldn't remember how many people he killed, but he couldn't remember who those black-robed Death Soldiers were anymore.Early morning.He squatted down by the stream and washed his face, checking everything except for the pills.His points had now reached 800.\"I still need 200 more points to exchange for a Demonic Cultivator.\"Suddenly.On the other side of the hill there was a loud noise.\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"The earth shook and the mountains shook. The towering trees were uprooted, the broken mountains crumbled, and in less than half a minute, they rushed into Fire Wolf Valley.\"Demonic Beast!\"\"five level monster, the five level monster has rushed into the Fire Wolf Valley. Everyone run!\"\"The five level monster is here, run.\"\u2026 \u2026.The disciples of the Long family frantically fled.The more they ran, the more crazily the mountain-like demonic beast chased. Its two palms swept out, grabbing a towering tree and ferociously throwing it out.\"Rumble!\"A few of the Long family disciples were overturned.They usually hid deep within the Fire Glass Mountain Range, so they would not appear outside the mountain range.

How could they give up so easily?Long Fei immediately shouted out, \"I'm coming!\"At this moment.A flash of cold light appeared, locking his entire body in place.

The sword beams seemed to have locked onto the back of Long Fei's head, no matter how he changed his position, they closely followed behind him.Long Fei bellowed: You three are still not making your move?Liu Luoxi moved, floating like an immortal, her long sword transforming into 108 sword flowers, each sword striking towards the tight-uniformed killer.Xiao Tiantian said angrily: \"After waiting for you for three days, I am finally willing to make my move.He released his aura.A strong sword intent was released and it wrapped around the dagger.Ye Ziyan's sword art moved as she shouted, \"Break!\"Her body released a burst of Sword Qi, which rushed towards the Sword Qi behind Xiang Longfei, and completely destroyed the assassin's Sword Qi.\"Boom!\" BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! \"Boom!\"The three sisters of the Sky Sect landed and surrounded the killer.Long Fei gasped for breath like a cow, cold sweat trickling down his back. Looking at the tight-uniformed woman whose body was extremely hot, he asked: \"Damn, do I owe you money or did I just molest you? Do you need to go all out like that?\"\"She's so beautiful, yet she's so ruthless?\"Xiao Tiantian said: \"She is a killer at failure alliance, in their eyes, she is only a target, nothing more.\"\"failure alliance?\"Long Fei trembled slightly, and said: \"I don't have a sinful failure alliance, right? Who was it that wanted to kill me? They actually invited a killer! \"Fortunately, there were three sisters from the Heaven Sect, otherwise, they would have been screwed today.However \u2026Speaking of which, the strength of the three Heaven Sect sisters wasn't just for show.Liu Luoxi said indifferently: \"It's your Long Family's Great Elder, Long Zhanwu.\"Long Fei squinted his eyes as he clenched his fists tightly and thought to himself: \"Long Zhanwu, are you using this to deal with me? Damn, using the Long family's money isn't going to be easy on you. \" Long Fei was very unhappy in his heart, \"Long Zhanwu, how much hatred do you have for me? I'll be damned, your sister. It's not enough to send the disciples of the Long family to kill you, but you still have to hire assassins.Liu Luoxi asked: \"What about her?\"Long Fei looked at the female assassin whose face was covered with a veil with great interest, and said: \"I'll give you a chance to live, help me kill Long Zhanwu!\"The female assassin coldly snorted, \"Hmph!\"Liu Luoxi said: \"Once the deal is completed, it will not be changed, this is failure alliance's rule for killing people.\"Long Fei said: \"Does that mean I will definitely be killed?\"Xiao Tiantian said: \"Theoretically, yes, but with the protection of us three sisters, you can rest assured.\"Ye Ziyan did not forget to bicker, and said: \"Little junior sister apprentice, we did not say we would protect him.

No way!\"Xiao Tiantian wanted to rush out, but Liu Luoxi immediately shouted out, \"Stop chasing, we can't catch up anymore.\"\"Let's go!\"When she was speaking, Long Fei had already rushed out. Towards killers, he was more concerned about the BOSS, since the killer already said it, she will come back, there was no need to be hasty anymore.However \u2026The Boss could not be let off!Liu Luoxi said anxiously: \"Long Fei, where are you going? Do you want to die? \"\"Senior sister, what should we do?\" Ye Ziyan frowned.Xiao Tiantian had already followed him, and said: \"What else can we do, aren't we here to protect him? Senior sister, what are you all standing around for?\"\"Hurry up!\"\u2026 \u2026.\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"The entire valley shook violently. Long Fei rushed to the bottom of the mountain and checked the attributes of the beasts through the system.Beast: Large Power King Kong ApeLevel: Level 5 PeakSkills: Rumbling Mountain PalmDefense: 5 starsAttack Power: 5 starsDescription: Large Power King Kong Ape s are naturally blessed with godly strength and possess an unparalleled amount of power.

When he saw the HP on top of the Large Power King Kong Ape's head, he immediately cursed in his heart, \"500 thousand HP, your sister.\"\"Long Fei, run.\"\"The demonic beast is going crazy.\"At this moment.The three sisters of the Sky Sect rushed over.\"Roar \u2026\"Suddenly.The Large Power King Kong Ape caught a disciple of the Long family who was hiding inside a tree hole. Lifting him up in the air, it directly tore his body into two halves, and fresh blood poured down.\"Roar!\"The Large Power King Kong Ape's fists hammered on its chest, becoming even more furious.\"What are you doing?\"\"Stop, what are you trying to do?\" Liu Luoxi called out to Long Fei.Xiao Tiantian also anxiously said, \"Come back quickly, we can't move any further.\"Ye Ziyan also anxiously said, \"You're courting death.\"He was completely unable to understand Long Fei.Even the strong experts of the war chief realm were not a match for it. Long Fei was only a war division realm cultivator, he was simply courting death.\"Roar \u2026\"The Large Power King Kong Ape roared again as it grabbed an enormous tree and smashed it down, turning a few of the Long family disciples who were hiding behind the rocks into meat paste.Dozens of Long Clan disciples had died in the valley.Adding the Long family's disciples who had been assassinated in the past two days, the Long family had lost nearly two-thirds of their disciples in this time's family exam.Seeing the Large Power King Kong Ape being incomparably arrogant, overbearing and furious, Long Fei was exceptionally unhappy.\"three pillars bullies the Long family and a beast is coming to bully us, do you really think our Long family is so easy to bully?\" Long Fei's gaze tensed up.He turned around and grinned at the three sisters. \"I want to kill it!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was disturbed and looked displeased, \"What happened? Why are you in such a hurry?\"\"Great Clan Elder, not good, a five level monster rushed in from the Fire Wolf Valley, massacring crazily. Countless disciples of the Long family have died.\"Long Zhanye also hurriedly entered, and just as he was about to report this matter, he asked: \"Big brother, what do we do?\"He whispered into Long Zhanwu's ears: \"Not only the five level monster, the death warriors of the Zhuge family, the warriors of the Li Martial Arts Sect, and the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan have all entered the Fire Wolf Valley.\"Long Zhanwu calmly wiped the sword in his hand, and asked softly: Where is Long Fei, that trash? Did you get rid of it? \"The first thing he cared about was not the life and death of the disciples of the Long family, but whether Long Fei had died or not!Long Zhanye sunk, gently shook his head, and said: \"Not yet!\"Long Zhanwu's eyes turned sinister, the sword in his hand suddenly erupted with a myriad of Sword Qi, with one slash, a Plum Blossom Tree more than 10 metres away directly exploded, breaking into over 10 thousand pieces.Long Zhanye's eyes widened as he said in pleasant surprise: \"Big brother, you succeeded \u2026.\"Without waiting for him to finish speaking, Long Zhanwu shouted in a deep voice, \"If you can't even take care of a small piece of trash, what are you doing? killer at failure alliance did not make his move? \"Long Zhanye's expression changed, and he said: \"Fire Wolf Valley's current situation is extremely complicated, I'm not sure whether or not I'll be able to kill them.\"The Fire Wolf Valley was in a mess now.Long Zhanye said again: \"Big Brother, Long Ao is still inside. If he gets hurt, we should rush over right now. This assessment is over early \u2026\"\"No way!\"Long Zhanwu interrupted: \"The assessment is just an assessment, it cannot be ended early. As for the five level monster entering Fire Wolf Valley, that is a test for the disciples of the Long family!\"Long Zhanye was dumbstruck, and said: \"Big brother, those are the elites of the Long family, they are \u2026.\"\"Don't say anymore!\"Long Zhanwu bellowed, \"Since it's an elite, then it should have the appearance of an elite, otherwise, it's nothing!\"\"Also.\"\"Long Fei did not die, he must die. Even if it means taking the lives of all the disciples of the Long family, we must make him die in Fire Wolf Valley. As for Ao'er, there is someone by his side who will protect him.\"Long Zhanwu's goal was very simple.If they wanted Long Fei to die in Fire Wolf Valley, they would not hesitate to bury him along with hundreds of other disciples of the Long Family.Even Long Zhanye was frightened. These hundred over elite warriors of the Long family were related to the foundation of the Long family. If they all died, it would be more serious than losing a Dragon God Warrior.Long Zhanye felt a chill in his heart.For the sake of his position, for the sake of becoming the Long Family's Patriarch, Long Zhanwu had gone crazy!\u2026 \u2026.The Long family did not send anyone into the Fire Wolf Valley.Furthermore, without even announcing the conclusion of the examination, the disciples of the Long family were left to fend for themselves in Fire Wolf Valley.This was something that no one had expected.Even Zhuge Wei and Li Tian Feng didn't expect this.However \u2026Long Zhanwu did not send anyone to protect the disciples of the Long Family, they were even more happy and immediately passed down the order to everyone in the Fire Wolf Valley to retreat.\"The Long family is finished.\"\"These elites will all die in the Fire Wolf Valley. Without these elites, the Long family will be in a state of disarray, and at that time \u2026 \u2026 \"Hahaha...\"\"It won't be long before there's no more Long family in Fire Glass City.\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"Zhuge Wei was laughing, Li Tian Feng was laughing, Nangong Lei was laughing extremely happily, and the Nangong Imperial Family was also very satisfied.At the same time.They were also quickly evacuating.He couldn't leave any clues for the Long family.To them, although they had lost a group of elites, but with the deaths of over a hundred of the Long family's elite disciples, their profits were just too great.A few hours later.The retreat of the three pillars's family was done without a sound, and did not leave any trace.All that was left in Fire Wolf Valley was the fleeing disciples of the Long family.At this moment, the Long family's conviction was shaken in their hearts.\u2026 \u2026.And then there was Long Fei.Long Fei quickly got closer, found the chance, and heavily jumped. He tightly grabbed onto his Desolate Blade and used dragon salyer technique, hacking down, \"Slicing the skin!\"It struck onto the back of the Large Power King Kong Ape.\"Puchi!\"\"\u2014 2\"A damage rose up, so low that it caused one's hair to stand on end.\"Holy sh * t!\" Long Fei cursed.It was also at this time.The Large Power King Kong Ape flipped over and struck down with its palm, \"Bang!\"\"Be careful!\"Liu Luoxi suddenly shouted out.Long Fei's body fell down heavily like a kite with its string broken.\"Boom!\"After smashing onto the ground, a deep crater appeared. Long Fei quickly swallowed a Highest Grade Medicine Powder as his internal organs felt as if they were going to shatter.The injuries in his body stabilized slightly.Long Fei pushed himself off the ground with his long blade and struggled to get up, cursing: \"Dammit, that's a little too strong isn't it?\"When the Large Power King Kong Ape saw that Long Fei did not die, it looked like it had been humiliated.\"Mountain-hit Fist?!\"Long Fei's expression changed, \"Ripple Tiny Steps.\"He was bursting out with all his strength.\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"\u2026 \u2026.The earth quaked and the mountains shook. It was as if the earth was being split open. The rocks turned into dust, and dust filled the sky.\"Long Fei!\"\"Long Fei!\"\"Long Fei!\"The three girls shouted out Long Fei's name at the same time.That fist \u2026 I'm afraid there is no hope of survival.\"Cough, cough, cough...\"\"Cough, cough, cough...\"\"Don't worry, I'm not dead yet.\" Long Fei was slightly touched in his heart. It was great to have someone to worry about. That punch just now was too terrifying.He nearly peed his pants.\"Boom!\"After losing Long Fei's figure in the dust, the Large Power King Kong Ape locked onto Liu Luoxi and the other two. With a heavy shake of its feet, it roared towards the sky, \"Roar \u2026\"The sound waves could shake the sky and disturb one's mind.It was like the suppression of a cultivator in his realm.The three women's expressions were dull as they stood there motionlessly.The Large Power King Kong Ape once again used both hands to punch, striking towards Liu Luoxi.Long Fei's eyes turned sinister, \"Your ancestors dared to touch my, Long Fei's, woman, you're tired of living!\"At this moment.Long Fei couldn't care so much anymore.He lowered his body and spread out his limbs.\"Caw...\"The big toad made a strange noise, then the idea moved, \"Activate all true breath s!\"One thousand eight hundred true breath were completely released.This was all of his true breath, and he used it all on the 'Toading Skill'.With a heavy bounce, he struck out fiercely.\"Whoosh!\"\"Boom!\"The big toad Long Fei crashed into the Large Power King Kong Ape's chest, causing 1800 true breath to rush into its body.\"Rumble \u2026\"The Large Power King Kong Ape's body slightly trembled, her steps were a little unsteady, and she staggered a few steps back.The Mountain-hit Fist was also interrupted.\"Crack!\"A bright red number appeared above its head, '\u2014 8090', a damage of 8000 points!\"Too abnormal.\"\"Eighteen hundred true breath s can cause that much damage? \"Damn you.\" Long Fei felt cold in his heart, this fellow was too abnormal.Raising his head to swallow a true breath Pill.true breath could recover 500 points in 3 seconds, but it was no longer useful in a short period of time.Long Fei quickly rushed to Liu Luoxi's side and looked at the three of them.Xiao Tiantian's face flushed red as she asked shyly, \"What did you say just now?\"Liu Luoxi and Ye Ziyan were also looking at Long Fei.\"Just now?\"\"I said run.\" Long Fei said.Xiao Tiantian fiddled with the corner of his clothes, his face even redder, and said: \"It's not this one, it's the previous one.\"\"Last sentence?\" Long Fei thought for a moment, then said: \"Your sister.\"Xiao Tiantian's expression immediately changed, and he immediately shouted in fury: \"Your sister, your sister, your entire family's sister!\"\"Are you crazy?\" Long Tian was completely confused!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Once the dragon salyer was found, he would also be in danger.\"Let's wait first!\"In the end, Long Fei still decided to slow down. Unless it was absolutely necessary, he did not want to use this trump card!\"Top quality Sword Teeth Tiger Spell Note!\"\"Go!\"A talisman exploded outwards, smashing straight into the Large Power King Kong Ape's face.The gigantic illusion Sword Teeth Tiger heavily bit down, causing thousands of damage. However, it was only a talisman, not a five level monster.The Large Power King Kong Ape tore it apart.He couldn't block it!The Large Power King Kong Ape was getting closer.\"What should we do?\"\"If we continue to run away like this, we'll die of exhaustion.\" Liu Luoxi said to Long Fei.Xiao Tiantian was still angry, and said angrily: \"It's all that bastard's fault.\"Ye Ziyan said, \"Little junior sister apprentice, don't blame anyone else at this time.\"Suddenly.from the war pet space said all of a sudden, \"Master, lure it into the depths of the valley.\"Long Fei was secretly surprised, \"Xiao Bai, do you have a way?\"\"En!\"\"Alright!\"And then \u2026Long Fei said loudly, \"You guys run out of the valley. I'll go the other way and you'll be safe. I'll find a chance to throw it away. Remember, do not follow me. \"Finished.Without waiting for Liu Luoxi and the others to reply, he immediately rushed towards the Large Power King Kong Ape, swallowed a 'true breath Pill', and loudly said: \"Grandson, Grandfather is here to kill Grandfather.\"He released another set of Sword Teeth Tiger talismans.\"Boom!\"The Large Power King Kong Ape was even more furious, it roared towards the sky and fiercely slapped Xiang Longfei with its palm.A towering tree had been cut in half from the waist, splinters flying everywhere as it shot out like flying daggers.\"Puchi!\"Long Fei's body sunk, his back was struck by a piece of wood, causing blood to flow out, he did not dare hesitate at all, and shouted at the dazed Liu Luoxi, \"Run, what are you standing there for, run!\"He also ran towards the direction of the valley.\"Awoooo \u2026\"\"Awoooo \u2026\"The Large Power King Kong Ape was furious beyond compare. Its forelimbs dropped to the ground, and with a violent push, it immediately flew into the air.It was like a black cloud pressing down on a city.Long Fei turned to look, \"What the f * * k!\"\"Tiny Rippling Steps!\"Turning his speed, he activated true breath, increasing his speed in all aspects.\"Rumble!\"The Large Power King Kong Ape's body pressed down, dust flew all over and a huge pit appeared around it, which was a mess.Long Fei leaned on a rock and panted heavily, \"Damn, this is too abnormal!\"The Large Power King Kong Ape was still in a berserk state, increasing all of its attributes.After adjusting himself for a few seconds, Long Fei rushed out again and shouted loudly: \"Grandson, Grandfather isn't dead yet.\"Awoooo \u2026\" The Large Power King Kong Ape once again fiercely pounced forward.\u2026 \u2026.\"Senior sister, what should we do?\"\"Are we just going to watch?\" Ye Ziyan said anxiously.Large Power King Kong Ape were too strong.Even they were not a match for him.Xiao Tiantian was also worried: \"Big Senior, didn't we come to protect him? He is not a match for the Large Power King Kong Ape at all, let's hurry up and help him. \"Liu Luoxi frowned, he stopped Xiao Tiantian and said calmly: \"He must have his reasons for doing this, let's quickly leave.\"\"Senior Sister!\"\"Eldest Senior Sister!\"The two girls looked at Liu Luoxi in shock.Liu Luoxi was annoyed: \"Don't I want to save him? Do you think so? But you all have seen the power of the Large Power King Kong Ape, do you think we were its match in the past? \"\"Long Fei chose to sacrifice himself to protect us. Don't you see?\"\"If we go over there, it will only distract him and cause him trouble. We might even get three more corpses.\"When Long Fei made his decision, Liu Luoxi already knew what he was going to do, and his heart started aching.No man had ever done it for her.Protect her with your life.It was the same time in the cave, but it was the same again!Although Liu Luoxi looked neither cold nor hot on the surface, she was actually kind and had been moved by Long Fei a long time ago.If a man was willing to give his life for you, he could entrust it to his lifetime. If he could die for you twice, that was a blessing from his previous life.Moreover.Liu Luoxi also made her own decision.Xiao Tiantian said with a slightly trembling voice: \"Senior Sister, will he die?\"Liu Luoxi did not answer. Instead, he pulled the two junior sister apprentice s and said, \"Quickly, leave this place!\"\u2026 \u2026.The disciples of the Long family all rushed out of the valley. Long Fei grabbed onto the Large Power King Kong Ape's' hatred 'and escaped deeper into the valley.When time was up, he consumed a true pill and kept the true breath above a thousand points.Long Fei was secretly glad that he had refined a large number of true pill. Otherwise, he would not have been able to use true breath a long time ago.\"Xiao Bai, can you do it?\"Long Fei asked.Xiao Bai replied: \"Further in.\"\"Ugh.\" Long Fei didn't know what Xiao Bai wanted to do, but since Xiao Bai had spoken, then he definitely had a way. Furthermore, after luring the Large Power King Kong Ape deep into the valley, under the circumstances where there was no one around, he could take out the dragon salyer and ruthlessly ravage it.\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"\u2026 \u2026.The entire Fire Wolf Valley was trembling as they moved further and further away from the disciples of the Long family.In the gathering place.\"It was Long Fei who lured the five level monster away.\"\"That piece of trash is dead for sure.\"\"Why would a five level monster appear in Fire Wolf Valley?\"\"Such a big thing happened, why didn't the Great Clan Elder send anyone in? And we're not allowed to go out. Does he want us to die inside? \"\u2026 \u2026.The crowd of Long Clan disciples felt indignant in their hearts.The wounds on Long Shan's body had almost healed due to the Highest Grade Medicine Powder, and he said solemnly: \"If not for Young Master Long Fei, we would all be dead here.\"\"We once looked down on him and called him trash. From today onwards, if anyone dares to call him trash in front of me, I, Long Shan, will fight with my life on the line!\"Everyone fell silent.Just like what Long Shan said, if Long Fei didn't lure away the Large Power King Kong Ape, they would have all died in the valley.Long Ao was a little unhappy and asked: \"Long Shan, what benefits did Long Fei give you? \"He's actually speaking up for him like this. Trash will always be trash, and he's actually so stupid as to provoke five level monster. He's really a fool.\"\"Boom!\"Long Shan's aura suddenly moved, his spear moved, directly thrusting towards Long Ao, and said solemnly: \"Because he is our savior, because he is the young master of the Long family, who do you, Long Ao, think you are?\"Just as the spear was about to reach Long Ao, Long Ao was so scared that his entire body was trembling and he fell to the ground. He immediately ordered Long Tai and Long Lin, and said: \"Kill him, kill him!\"\"Stop fighting, stop fighting...\"Long Shan was also stopped.Many disciples of the Long family stood beside Long Shan and coldly stared at Long Tai and Long Lin.Neither of them dared to fight.Very clearly, Long Fei's position in their hearts had changed!Long Shan looked at the depths of the valley and muttered, \"Young master, you must survive!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He checked the pellets and only had a few left. He said: \"Xiao Bai, is it still not enough?\"Xiao Bai finally said, \"Enough.\"Long Fei's entire body relaxed. If Xiao Bai still could not say it, he would really go crazy.Suddenly.Xiao Bai jumped out of the war pet space, and after a few leaps, he arrived at the top of a withered tree.A wolf's howl resounded, spreading over a distance of thousands of km.Next.The forest began to stir up, wolf howls came from afar, and the Fire Wolves that had escaped from Fire Wolf Valley rushed back like madmen.Wu wu wu \u2026\"Roar... Roar... Roar...\"There were more and more of them, slowly gathering into a pack of wolves, a thousand of them.They all surrounded the dead tree trunk and raised their heads to look at Xiao Bai quietly. Their eyes were filled with respect and reverence, as if they were looking at their god.Even Long Fei and the other wolves did not take a glance.Long Fei was shocked, and immediately thought of Xiao Bai's Divine Beast Attribute, \"Possessing the power of an unmatched Wolf King, able to summon a herd of wolves and use them.\"Xiao Bai was the Wolf God!\"So that's how it is!\"Long Fei was excited.Suddenly.Xiao Bai glared at the Large Power King Kong Ape and from his throat came a vicious roar, \"You dare to bully my boss, small ones, bite it to death!\"He was incomparably domineering.Next!The thousand wolves roared together and started to rush towards the Large Power King Kong Ape like a flood.\"Roar!\"Xiao Bai jumped to Long Fei's feet and said: \"Master, with my current strength, I can only summon a Level 1 Wolf Demon.\"Long Fei watched as over a thousand wolves tore apart the Large Power King Kong Ape. The scene was simply too shocking, and said: \"That's enough, even if we can't kill it, we can't use up half of its blood.\"He heaved a sigh of relief.With the help of over a thousand wolves, it would be much easier to deal with the Large Power King Kong Ape.And then \u2026Long Fei asked: \"Xiao Bai, can you help me sense if there are humans around?\"Xiao Bai's brows twitched, and after a moment of pause, he said: \"No.\"\"Alright!\"\"It's good that no one is here.\" Long Fei looked at the dragon salyer among the Space Ring and muttered in his heart: \"It's time for you to display your might.\"\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"The Large Power King Kong Ape was furious, it swept its palms across and slapped each wolf down, following that, another large group of wolves rushed forward.Its attack power was not high, but its quantity was great.For a moment, the Large Power King Kong Ape could not do anything.Long Fei stood at a high place and laughed wildly: \"F * ck, you want to kill me? Come, come kill me. \"Come kill me.\"When the Large Power King Kong Ape saw Long Fei's bloodshot eyes, it moved its palms and released Mountain-hit Fist.\"Rumble!\"With a violent shake, dozens of wolves' brains burst out from the shockwave.Next.The Large Power King Kong Ape roared towards the sky and released a sonic wave attack. The hundreds of wolves around it were stunned senseless for a moment.\"So freaking abnormal!\"Long Fei was extremely shocked and furious for an entire day. To still be able to unleash such power, this Large Power King Kong Ape was truly abnormal.And then \u2026Long Fei said to Xiao Bai: \"Wait for my order, when I tell you to retreat, tell those wolves to retreat, otherwise, you will harm them.\"Xiao Bai asked doubtfully: \"Boss, what are you planning to do?\"\"Heh heh \u2026\"\"You'll know soon enough.\" Long Fei jumped down from the high ground as his body moved like lightning, continuously rushing towards the Large Power King Kong Ape.The Large Power King Kong Ape was also continuously looking at Long Fei's charge with a sweeping gaze as it charged forward.Xiao Bai said in a loud voice: \"Stop it, stop it.\"The group of wolves counterattacked.Suddenly, Long Fei's right hand moved, \"dragon salyer, come out!\"As soon as his voice faded \u2026The incomplete dragon salyer landed in Long Fei's hands. Long Fei's arm sank as his speed obviously slowed down.The dragon salyer was too heavy!Even if Long Fei was a Level 9 Battle-Master, he could only use two hands to pick it up.In a place called the dragon salyer.As the long blade dragged on the ground, sparks flew along with lightning as Long Fei's arms fiercely moved, and heavily leaped up.\"dragon salyer technique!\"\"Open the skin!\"The dragon salyer slashed down.Xiao Bai immediately roared: \"Don't let it move.\"\"Bam!\"The blade came down, striking the Large Power King Kong Ape's chest, lacerating its skin and flesh.\"\u2014 29800\"It dealt nearly 30,000 points of damage!\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"The dragon salyer can even break the dragon's defense, how can a mere gorilla like you withstand it?\"The dragon salyer felt great.Combined with the dragon salyer technique, the damage was simply outrageous.Both of the Large Power King Kong Ape's palms slapped onto Long Fei's body, causing Long Fei to heavily fall onto the ground.\"Tendon Break!\"With the same wound, Long Fei slashed down once again.\"Puchi!\"\"\u2014 48000\"Extremely high damage.\"Break the bones!\"\"Blood Severing!\"\"Opening the spirit, Spirit Stunning, slay \u2026\"One slash was stronger than another, and one slash was fiercer than the last.Every time he slashed out, Long Fei would feel as if all the energy in his body had been hollowed out, and was unable to endure the powerful force being released.The seven blades slashed out.The dragon salyer was trembling.The saber Qi roared and released an aura of death.It was also at this time.Long Fei suddenly shouted at Xiao Bai, \"This is the moment!\"Xiao Bai shouted at the same time, \"Little ones, retreat!\"The pack of wolves quickly retreated, allowing the Large Power King Kong Ape to regain its freedom. It was not looking at Xiang Longfei, its eyes staring at the dragon salyer in Long Fei's hand, its body trembling.The Large Power King Kong Ape was afraid!The five level monster was actually afraid.Suddenly.The Large Power King Kong Ape suddenly turned and escaped.However.And it was also at this moment that Long Fei grinned sinisterly and laughed, \"You want to escape, let me see where you can flee to!\"\"dragon chop!\"\"Shua!\"Long Fei leaped into the air and the dragon salyer slashed downwards. Like a hurricane, the blade energy struck the Large Power King Kong Ape's body and sent it flying into the air with one slash.His hill-like body was actually sent flying.The scene was hard to imagine.In an instant.The saber qi raged as it slashed out crazily, continuously and violently.\"One hundred and thirty cuts!\"\"Explode for me!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As though they were filling the right arm with the profound energy of the Large Power King Kong Ape, the rich energy climbed one after another, filling the entire right arm, from his fingers to his arm, from his blood vessels to his tendons, and even his every pore was being strengthened, and this was even with the strengthening of the first realm!\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for merging with 'magic power of right hand'.\"magic power of right hand, the source of Large Power King Kong Ape's divine power.Rank 1 strengthening completed!Concentrating strength for three minutes, killing any martial artist below the sixth level of war chief with a single strike, severely injuring the war chief realm!Strengthening of the second realm, possessing the arms of Large Power King Kong Ape.\"What the f * * k!\"\"Too fierce, too strong, hahaha \u2026\" Long Zhanwu, your good days are over, hahaha \u2026 \" Long Fei was grinning from ear to ear.Now, he no longer had to be afraid of Long Zhanwu.The feeling of being crushed by the war chief was extremely uncomfortable, Long Fei's blood started to boil.Next.Long Fei looked at the special reward again. This was the system's reward for him.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for obtaining the special reward 'Wushuang'. Do you wish to cultivate it?\"\"What is it?!\"\"None \u2026\" \"Double?\"In that moment, Long Fei was dumbstruck. Her heart could not take it anymore, the attribute of 'Wushuang' was something that she had learned in many games before.Magic immunity, attack increase, defense increase, and it will also get bigger.This skill was practically invincible.Immediately.Long Fei said in a trembling voice: \"Cultivate!\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for training 'Wushuang'.\"Skill Path: UnparalleledGrade: Divine Levelproficiency: 0/8000Consumption: 100 true breath points per second (lasts for 1 minute, the higher the level, the longer the duration.)Description: Unparalleled Activation, Attack, Speed, Strength \u2026 All the attributes of the player were doubled!\"My heart \u2026\"Long Fei staggered and pushed, leaning on the big tree behind him, his heart could not take it any longer, \"Too sudden, too fierce, too cool, I like it too much, hahaha!\"All his stats had been doubled, what was there to say?This was simply awesome!In the future, when Wushuang reaches the Great Perfection Stage, he would kill gods and gods, kill buddhas and ascend to heaven. Who could stop him?A mere Long Zhanwu was nothing.three pillars, Nan Gong Royal Family, just wash your butt and wait for me to explode one by one, hahaha... Long Fei was incomparably excited.This was because Wushuang's attributes were just too strong.It was just that \u2026When Long Fei saw Wu Shuang's consumption of energy, his brows secretly tightened, \"One hundred true breath per second, I can only maintain my current true breath for twenty seconds. This consumption energy is indeed a big problem, but \u2026. Twenty seconds is enough for me to kill the opponent, hehe \u2026 \"Long Fei was too excited.As a result, he didn't notice a person standing not too far away.Liu Luoxi!She flew all the way, worried about Long Fei with all her might, but... When she rushed over, she just so happened to see Long Fei sweeping the Large Power King Kong Ape up into the air with one slash, and then killing it instantly with one hundred and thirty layers of blade Qis.In that instant.Liu Luoxi looked at Long Fei in a daze, and was so shocked that he couldn't say a single word.A white shadow flashed past.The little pervert immediately threw himself into Liu Luoxi's embrace, then rubbed against Liu Luoxi's protruding twin peaks with all his might, his face full of satisfaction.It was also at this time.Long Fei looked at Liu Luoxi, his expression startled for a moment, and then gently smiled. He scratched his head and said: \"Didn't I tell you to leave, why are you back?\"Liu Luoxi asked in shock: \"You sent us away just so that you could kill the Large Power King Kong Ape alone?\"Long Fei laughed foolishly, \"I'm not confident either. I can't possibly let you three sisters take the risk with me, right?\"\"Are you sure?\"\"One hundred and thirty layers of saber Qi killed a demon beast at the peak of the fifth level. Are you sure you can do this?\"\"Who are you lying to?\"Liu Luoxi didn't believe Long Fei at all.It was also at this moment.Liu Luoxi stared at the blade in Long Fei's hand, \"What is that broken blade in your hand?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The dragon clan's ancestor refined the dragon god's blood into a dragon slaying blade? \"Long Fei nodded. \"You sure know things quite well.\"Liu Luoxi said: \"Who in Fire Glass Dynasty doesn't know of this treasured blade? Even in my sect, it's like thunder piercing my ears, that's a supreme artifact! But, I heard that a certain ancestor of the Long family died during the war with the Evil Demon at Fire Glass Mountain Range, how did you find him? \"Long Fei said: \"Let's have a fortuitous encounter.\"\"You won't reveal the secret of the dragon salyer on me, right?\"It wouldn't hurt to tell.However \u2026It would bring about unnecessary trouble. These few days, had learnt that the three pillars had assassinated the Long family. Once the matter of the dragon salyer was exposed, the three pillars and the Nangong Imperial Family would definitely make their move against the Long family.Liu Luoxi said in all seriousness: \"Are you going to kill me to keep my mouth shut?\"Long Fei was startled for a moment, and said: \"You're so beautiful, how could I bear to kill you? However, I hope that you can keep a secret for me.\"\"Puchi!\"Liu Luoxi could not hold back his laughter.When she was smiling, two shallow dimples appeared on her cheeks. Usually, she rarely smiled, but this time her smile was extremely intoxicating.Liu Luoxi pouted and said: \"Is her smile as beautiful as little junior sister apprentice's?\"\"Of course!\"\"Better than any of them.\" Long Fei said in a serious tone. Liu Luoxi was usually serious, but suddenly he smiled.\"Smooth talker!\"\"Humph!\"Liu Luoxi playfully snorted, and said: \"It's fine for me to keep this a secret for you, but you have to promise me three things.\"She rarely displayed her innocent girlish feelings in front of outsiders, but in front of Long Fei, she couldn't help but want to be a little girl.She didn't know why she felt this way herself.Long Fei asked: \"Which three?\"Liu Luoxi thought for a moment, then said: \"First, I'm hungry, hurry up and roast meat for me. I want to eat barbecue, eat a lot of barbecue.\"\"Huh?\"\"It's that simple?\" Long Fei thought that making things difficult for him would be easy, so he immediately saluted and smiled: \"I guarantee that I will complete the mission.\"Half an hour later.The fragrant roasted Large Power King Kong Ape meat would be fine.Liu Luoxi's mouth was filled with oil as she ate piece after piece. She had been following Long Fei around to eat barbecue these past few days, and her ascarp was about to come out.After eating and drinking to his heart's content.Liu Luoxi's mind moved, and he said: \"The second thing, I want to learn the talisman arts, I want you to teach me how to refine top quality talismans, your master will definitely teach you the trick.\"\"Huh?\"\"Alright, alright!\"Long Fei snickered in his heart, \"My master \u2026 Hahaha... If she knew that I was the one who invented the top-grade talisman technique, what would she think? \"And then \u2026Long Fei said in all seriousness: \"Refining top quality talismans is extremely difficult.\"Liu Luoxi immediately said: \"I am not afraid of hardships, I just want to refine a high quality talisman, I will give it to you...\"As he spoke till here, Liu Luoxi's expression turned cold, and he did not continue, but said: \"You just have to teach me.\"\"It seems like there's a story?\" Long Fei thought, and then said: \"We shall begin with drawing.\"They found a flat rock to use as a table.Long Fei said: \"Draw one first, I'll take a look.\"Liu Luoxi did not hesitate and immediately started drawing.\"Wrong!\"The moment Liu Luoxi finished writing, Long Fei shouted out, \"You haven't even finished adjusting the true breath, how can you infuse the true breath into your painting?\"\"First step, adjust your true breath well.\"Liu Luoxi was as obedient as a student as she listened to Long Fei.After adjusting her true breath, she started writing once again.And then \u2026\"Wrong!\"Long Fei shouted again, and said: \"Have you thought about what kind of talisman to draw in your mind? Without even thinking about it properly, you started writing. How can you succeed? \"\"Adjust the true breath, the idea is fused.\"Liu Luoxi suddenly felt that the talisman techniques he had learnt in the past were all trash, the talisman masters in the Heaven Sect were also a bunch of trash.Following that \u2026Liu Luoxi did it again.He drew a few strokes.\"Wrong!\"\"Wrong!\"\"Wrong!\"\u2026 \u2026.\"Sigh... \"Too stupid.\"Long Fei sighed, and said: \"First, watch how I draw.\"Long Fei picked up the brush and with a move of his forehead, it was stained with the blood of the Large Power King Kong Ape. Immediately after, the idea sank, and its body unknowingly released a very strong Qi, transforming into a dragon and serpent. Every stroke was perfect, constantly drawing, constantly perfecting, and combining the true breath and blood essence together, constantly drawing.Liu Luoxi stood at the side and watched Long Fei's serious expression, she was a little infatuated, Long Fei's serious look was really handsome, so handsome that she could not resist.\"Alright!\"Long Fei was generous, following that, the idea activated and released the talisman.\"Boom!\"The Large Power King Kong Ape shot out and roared towards the sky.Liu Luoxi was so shocked that she couldn't speak. She looked at Long Fei pitifully and said, \"Teach me again.\"\"Sigh!\"\"I really can't do anything to you.\"Long Fei sighed, and said: \"Hold onto the brush!\"Liu Luoxi held onto the pen, Long Fei stood behind her, and one of his hands held onto Liu Luoxi's hand; her small hand trembled slightly.Long Fei shouted, \"Don't be distracted.\"\"Adjust your true breath, fuse the idea \u2026\"Long Fei held Liu Luoxi's hand and slowly drew step by step.A few minutes later.The talisman was completed, and it released the domineering aura of a five level monster.\"Again.\"\"Again!\"\"Again!\"\u2026 \u2026.Unknowingly, the two of them were almost hugging each other.Long Fei leaned behind Liu Luoxi, his forehead leaning on her shoulder as he continuously directed and blew onto her ears. Her body lightly trembled and she swallowed something at her throat.His body was getting hotter.Slowly.Liu Luoxi became more and more proficient at it.However \u2026At the same time, her body was getting hotter and hotter, the first time she felt such a strong connection to the forbidden fruit.Because he could feel Liu Luoxi's body emitting the scent of a virgin, Long Fei also could not calm down a little. What was even more frightening was... His underling raised his head and set up a high tent, which coincidentally reached right into Liu Luoxi's little fart \u2026It was filled with killing intent.Their breathing became rapid.Their gazes met.At this moment.It was like firewood touching fire!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They had never actually practiced this before.He didn't quite understand either.But even if he didn't understand, he still wouldn't be able to stop his physiological reaction.The worst part was.Liu Luoxi's blurry eyes looked at him, her cheeks were red, her entire body was hot, causing Long Fei to be unable to control himself, the desire in her eyes was too strong.It was also at this time.\"Roar!\"The cry of a demonic beast sounded.Break the silence.Liu Luoxi's expression changed, and she quickly escaped from Long Fei's embrace and ran to the side. She tidied up the hair around her ears, and her cheeks were as red as an apple, wishing she could find a hole to hide in.Long Fei was also a bit uncomfortable. He coughed and said: \"You have learned quite well. If you continue to cultivate for a while longer, you should be able to refine top quality talismans.\"Liu Luoxi replied with a light \"En\".And then \u2026The two of them fell silent.It was too awkward to be silent.Long Fei wanted to find a topic to talk, but then he said: \"The moonlight today is truly not bad.\"Liu Luoxi lowered his head, lightly nodded, and said: \"Mn, not bad.\"Xiao Bai couldn't bear to listen any longer, and said to Long Fei: \"Boss, the sky is completely black, where did you see the moonlight?\"\"Huh?\"\"Puchi \u2026\"The two of them simultaneously looked up at the pitch-black night sky and laughed at the same time.Long Fei laughed: \"Your smile is truly beautiful, and is the most beautiful female I have ever seen. You should smile frequently, that's the right thing to do.\"Liu Luoxi said: \"No matter how beautiful my smile is, it's not as beautiful as your fianc\u00e9e Nangong Yan's. She's the number one beauty in Fire Glass City, she's even more beautiful than I am.\"\"Huh?\"Long Fei was slightly shocked, and laughed: \"Are you jealous?\"He had not seen this emperor's fiancee since he was transported to this world.Moreover.In his memories, Nangong Yan had frequently come to find him before he was crippled. However, ever since his dragon blood was drawn out and the Pubes s shattered, Nangong Yan had not appeared once.Long Fei did not take it to heart.Liu Luoxi said: \"Why should I be jealous? I don't even have the qualifications to be jealous, I'm not even one of you.\"It was obvious that he had overturned his jealousy.Long Fei smiled slightly, and quickly drew something. He then wrapped the wind attributed demon core that the Large Power King Kong Ape dropped into a piece of paper, and said.\"What?\"Liu Luoxi received it in one hand, looked at the demon core, and asked: \"Is this the Large Power King Kong Ape 'demon core?\"Only five level monster have Demonic Cores, and these Demonic Cores are extremely expensive.Long Fei said: \"This is a wind-type demon core, don't you want to refine top-grade talismans? \"After you absorb this demon core, your comprehension of the Wind Laws will become a bit stronger. When refining talismans, you can use the Wind Laws to create top-grade talismans.\"\"It's too precious, I can't take it.\" Liu Luoxi was secretly shocked, even if it was the Heaven Sect's Demonic Core, it was an extremely valuable existence.Long Fei said: \"I'll just give it to you, since I've already merged with the wind element demon core, there's no use in giving it to me, just treat it as a fee to keep my secret.\"Liu Luoxi was extremely grateful in his heart. After putting away the demon core, he looked at the flowery talisman again and saw a little girl's brilliant smile. On top of the smile was a line of small words, \"Every day, laugh a little more.As he looked at it, Liu Luoxi began to sob and tear up. She stared at Long Fei and said, \"You're the fool, you're the big fool, the big fool \u2026.\"Seeing Liu Luoxi's tears, Long Fei's heart ached. He walked forward and wanted to hug her.Before he could take a few steps forward, he heard shouts coming from afar.\"Young Lord!\"\"Young Lord!\"\"Senior Sister, Senior Sister \u2026\"\u2026 \u2026.Long Fei and Liu Luoxi looked at each other, before Liu Luoxi immediately said, \"We need to leave this place first.\"The two of them quickly left.Half an hour later.Long Fei stood in the other direction and shouted loudly, \"I'm here, I'm here.\"Long Shan led a dozen or so Long Clan disciples and quickly rushed over.Long Shan rushed up, looked at Long Fei, and asked: \"Young Master, are you alright?\"Right now, he completely treated Long Fei as his Young Master, and was also someone he was loyal to.From the bottom of his heart, he acknowledged Long Fei, and worshipped him!To be able to kill three death warriors of the Zhuge family within a few rounds was something he admired from the bottom of his heart.Many of the Long family's disciples also rushed forward, \"Young master, Young master!\"They weren't as strong as Long Shan, but... They were grateful to Long Fei. If not for Long Fei luring the Large Power King Kong Ape away, all of them would have died.Long Fei pretended to be weak and said: \"I'm fine. I have to thank this big senior from the Heaven Sect for saving me, if not I would have been ripped into two halves.\"Long Shan immediately kneeled down and said, \"Thank you, female hero, for saving me. The Long family will never forget this favor.\"Liu Luoxi returned to his usual ice-cold expression and said: \"There's no need to be so polite, I was only casually saving him.\"At this moment.Xiao Tiantian and Ye Ziyan also ran over, \"Senior sister, are you alright?\"\"Bastard, are you hurt?\"\"I definitely can't do such a dangerous thing again.\"Liu Luoxi continued to give Xiao Tiantian looks, but Xiao Tiantian did not react and even asked dumbly: \"Big Senior, what's wrong with your eyes? Could he have been injured by a Large Power King Kong Ape? \"\"Stupid girl!\" Liu Luoxi felt powerless in his heart, he cupped his fists and said: \"We will be leaving first.\"She looked at Long Fei and smiled mysteriously: \"There's still the third thing.\"After saying that, she quickly pulled Xiao Tiantian and Ye Ziyan away, afraid that Xiao Tiantian would say that they were here to protect Long Fei.On the way.Xiao Tiantian asked in a crafty manner: \"Big Senior Sister, you have been alone for an entire night, could it be that nothing has happened that should have happened?\"Ye Ziyan knowingly asked, \"Little junior sister apprentice, what is the thing that should happen?\"Xiao Tiantian giggled. \"A lone man and woman in the middle of the night, escaping from a calamity. This kind of scene should have the two of them hugging each other, and then \u2026\"Liu Luoxi stared at her, \"Stupid girl, teasing Big Senior is here, you're asking to be beaten!\"\"Aiya!\"\"Second Senior Sister, save me!\"\"Eldest senior sister, I must have hit the mark on you, right?\"\"Aiya, stop hitting me, I was wrong!\"\u2026 \u2026.The three women teased each other as they left the Fire Wolf Valley.Liu Luoxi looked at Fire Wolf Valley, then placed the painting Long Fei drew under his clothes, sticking it to his chest.In the blink of an eye, he was staring at the rising sun. He took a deep breath and smiled. He then shouted, \"Ah \u2026\"\"A beautiful day has begun.\"Xiao Tiantian and Ye Ziyan were stunned, \"Senior Sister has changed!\"\"Become more beautiful and handsome, hehe \u2026\"In another place.The first round of examination had finished. At the exit of Fire Wolf Valley, many of the Long Family disciples walked out of the Fire Wolf Valley in succession.Long Ao stared at Long Fei, the corners of his eyes twitched, and he said coldly: \"You dog, actually didn't die! \"Just you wait, you're going to have a good fight in the arena!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was only a matter of time before they would be destroyed.Thus \u2026This morning, the four great powers had sent people to wait at the city gates.They wanted to know how many of the Long family's disciples returned alive. According to their guesses, there should not be more than twenty.However, what they did not expect was that there were more than fifty disciples that had come back from the Fire Wolf Valley.Did the five level monster not cause any big casualties?Half of the Long family's disciples had already been killed by the assassinations of the three powers. There were still more than fifty that had come out, which was something they hadn't expected.Did something happen after they left?Confusion!However, they quickly sent people into the Long family to see the results of the first round of exams.\u2026 \u2026.\"He's back!\"\"They're back, they're back.\"A disciple of the Long family ran into the Dragon family's martial arena and reported to Long Zhanwu: \"We're back, Young Master Long Ao is back.\"Long Zhanwu's heart relaxed, after all, Long Ao was his only son, so he asked: \"How much did you return?\"The person replied, \"More than fifty.\"Long Zhanwu's expression changed, he was surprised, \"There's actually more than fifty of them, seems like the power of the three pillars is also mediocre.\"Long Zhanye could not bear it any longer: \"They lost more than sixty disciples, they are all the elite of the Long family. The three great families are truly vicious, they want to destroy our Long family's foundation.\"Long Zhanwu did not mean it, \"If I become the next Patriarch, then even if I die, many disciples of the Long family will be worth it.\"His heart was incomparably vicious.Long Zhanwu asked: \"Did you see Long Fei?\"That person replied, \"Yes, he is among them.\"Long Zhanwu's eyes turned sinister as he stared at Long Zhanye and asked coldly: \"Did killer at failure alliance not make a move? Why did you let that brat return alive? \"Long Zhanye's face sank, and said: \"I don't think so.\"\"It shouldn't be, right?\"\"But Long Fei is still alive, how are you going to explain that? \"Useless thing, I can't even do such a small thing.\" Long Zhanwu was extremely furious.The Fire Wolf Valley was the ideal place to kill Long Fei, yet Long Fei actually managed to return alive.Long Zhanye did not dare argue for himself, and said: \"Big brother, there is still the arena competition, and Long Fei does not necessarily have the qualifications to enter the arena.Long Zhanwu said coldly: \"It's best if you say the same thing, otherwise \u2026\"A cold killing intent flashed in the corner of his eyes.Long Zhanye's mind trembled.Half an hour later.The Long family's martial arts practice field became lively, Long Ao was the first to rush into the martial arts practice area, and shouted loudly: \"Father, your son is back.\"\"Grand Elder, we're back.\"These were all Long Zhanwu's men. He had sent more than thirty disciples and only a dozen returned.These people were all very excited.However \u2026All of the disciples that came back had no expression on their faces. Their hearts were filled with hatred towards the Long family.Especially towards Long Zhanwu.He was sure that the five level monster had charged into the Fire Wolf Valley, but they were still not allowed to escape.Long Zhanwu could clearly feel their expressions.Suddenly.\"The Young Lord is back!\"A voice sounded.Next.Those Long Family disciples who had just entered the Martial Arts Practice Grounds were immediately brimming with energy. The moment they saw Long Fei entering the Martial Arts Practice Grounds, they shouted at the same time: \"Young Master!\"His voice was deafening.The entire Long family was covered.Many people were stunned, \"Young Lord, which Young Lord?\"The most shocked was Long Zhanwu. Watching Long Fei walk into the training grounds and win over so many people, he trembled and trembled from anger. Under his sleeves, he clenched his fists, releasing the rich war chief Qi.Long Zhanye reminded him in a low voice, \"Big Brother, don't be angry, let him be proud first.\"Long Ao also said in a low voice, \"Father, Long Fei is different now.\"Long Zhanwu stared at Long Ao and bellowed: \"Even if it isn't the same, you still have to die!\"Long Ao did not dare to speak anymore.Long Fei walked to Long Zhanwu's side and smiled faintly: \"Great Elder, I've come back and have disappointed you.\"Long Zhanwu gave a cold laugh, and said: \"Long Fei, you're the young master of the Long family. I'm so happy that you're able to come back, why are you so disappointed?\"Long Ao contemptuously said: \"Long Fei, it is your luck that is good this time, but what can you do after you return? How many demon beasts have you killed? I'm afraid you don't even have the qualifications to enter the arena, do you? Do you want me to give you a few demon beasts? The young master of the Long family lost too miserably. \"\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"How many Demonic Beasts can this trash kill?\"\"I've never seen him kill a demon beast.\"\"He probably hasn't killed a single demon beast.\"\"Long Fei, hurry up and get out of the martial arena, don't embarrass yourself.\"\u2026 \u2026.Long Shan rushed forward and shouted, \"Ridiculing the Long family's young master, you \u2026\"Without waiting for him to finish, Long Ao said disdainfully: \"Long Shan, who do you think you are? You even gave the surname 'Long' to the Long family. Since when did the Long family have your turn to speak?\"This was Long Shan's sore spot.It was also a sore spot for many of the Long family disciples.There were many disciples of the Long family whose ancestors had been bestowed the surname of the Long family.At this moment.\"Pah!\"The palm fiercely slapped down, directly slapping Long Ao onto the ground, blood flowing out.Long Fei coldly said: \"And who do you think you are? All of the disciples surnamed Long are heirs of the Long family. Long Ao, you dare ignore the ancestor's instructions and openly insult the descendants of the Long family who have rendered meritorious service. Without them, the current Long family's ancestor would not have existed. \"\"Grand Elder, was my lesson right?\"No one expected Long Fei to strike so suddenly.Long Ao's mouth was full of blood, he crawled up and was about to charge forward, \"Long Fei, you dead trash dared to hit this daddy, this daddy will kill you \u2026\"Not waiting for him to finish.\"Pah!\"After another ruthless slap, Long Fei coldly laughed: \"Threatening the Young Master and scaring the Young Master, should I hit you? Long Ao, why don't you have a bit of memory? \"Long Ao fell to the ground again, with his front teeth broken.Long Ao crawled back up, and said while crying: \"Father, take revenge for me, take revenge for me, I want to kill \u2026\"Long Zhanwu bellowed: \"Enough! Isn't that disgraceful enough? \"Two slaps to Long Ao's face, but it was in Long Zhanwu's face.At the same time.These two slaps of Long Fei's made the surnamed Long Shan and the other disciples of the Long family feel warm in their hearts. They had always been criticized by others, but now, they felt that they were inferior to others in the Long family.But Long Fei gave them hope!In their hearts, Long Fei's status had skyrocketed.Then, Long Zhanwu's eyes turned sinister as he stared coldly at Long Fei, and laughed coldly: \"Long Fei, since you're the young master of the Long family, then you must have the ability of the young master. If you're not able to get first place in the first round of examination, then you're embarrassing the Long family.Long Fei frowned slightly, and laughed coldly: \"Great Clan Elder, are you going to abolish me?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If you want to abolish the young master, you have to wait for him to come out of seclusion.\"Many people spoke up for Long Fei.Most of these people were disciples with surnames bestowed to them by the Long Family. They were grateful to Long Fei in their hearts.Long Zhanye also reminded him in a small voice, \"Big Brother, this is a little \u2026\"Long Zhanwu sneered: \"Whatever decision I make is not up to you guys to say. If you have the ability to do so, then invite the Grand Elder and Patriarch out. If you can't, then shut up!\"The voice released the aura of the war chief.The aura of the war chief crushed them, causing them to be unable to say a single word.Long Fei's eyes became sinister, and said: What if I win first place?Without waiting for Long Zhanwu to speak, Long Ao took the lead and said, \"Long Fei, if you can take first place, you can do whatever you want to me; I'll let you see just what kind of sh * t I'll eat.\"Full of confidence.Forget about everything else, Long Ao was confident that no one would be able to kill more beasts than him.Of course.It was not him who had hunted, but a dozen or so disciples of the war spirit Realm who had helped him kill.Seeing his son so confident, Long Zhanwu laughed: \"Long Fei, did you hear that?\"\"You really want to play it big?\" Long Fei said.Long Ao laughed complacently: \"What? Are you scared? If you don't dare to bet, then scram to the side and obediently hand over your position as the Young Master. \"Long Fei said: \"How about the bet is a little bigger, and you two eat sh * t together?\"Long Zhanwu's expression immediately changed.Long Ao scolded: \"Long Fei, just prepare to hand over the Young Master's seat, and eat shit in front of your entire family.\"Long Shan pulled Long Fei and said: \"Young Master, there are more than a dozen disciples helping Long Ao kill demon beasts.Many people saw it.Long Ao could not miss the chance to step on Long Fei. Afraid that Long Fei would go back on his word, he immediately said.\"Men, go to the toilet and bring me a bowl of sh * t.\"Long Zhanwu also immediately said: \"Begin counting.\"The father and son duo did not give Long Fei any leeway to go back on his words.Long Ao said to his father: \"Father, just watch carefully, this time I am going to kill that bastard Long Fei.\"Next.The disciples that were participating in the examination quickly stood in two rows.One after another, they brought out the demonic beasts they had killed.\"Long Yu, 160 points.\"\"Long Tai, 10 points.\"\"Dragon Lin, 10 points.\"\"Long Shan, 90 points.\"\u2026 \u2026.\"Next, Long Ao!\"Long Ao walked out, his face full of smiles, as he stared coldly at Long Fei, and said disdainfully: \"Long Fei, just prepare to eat sh * t!\"While they were talking \u2026Long Ao shouted loudly, \"Look carefully at all of this!\"After saying that, he took out Fire Wolves from the Space Ring one by one. martial-arts arena quickly piled them up like a mountain, and the Statistical Elder also quickly recited, \"108 heads, 109 heads...\"\"One hundred and fifty.\"At this time, Long Ao slightly stopped and switched the Space Ring with an incomparably pleased look on his face. He stared at Long Fei and said: \"Here's the thing that scared you to death.\"Suddenly.An even more powerful Fire Wolf pulled out its Space Ring.Everyone was shocked.The statistician said in a trembling voice: \"Secondary Monster, Secondary Monster...\"More than one.There were a total of ten Secondary Monster.Long Zhanwu revealed a smile that he did not have for a long time, and thought: \"Long Fei, I'll see what you can do this time, hahaha \u2026\"The statistics were out.\"Long Ao, 2,000 points, break the Long family's history.\"\"2,000 points?\"\"Oh my god, there are so many of them. They can actually break the Long family's history.\"\"More than a dozen people helping him kill them, this isn't his result at all.\"\u2026 \u2026.Many people knew this, but not many people dared to say it because Long Zhanwu's gaze was genuinely cold as he stared at them.Long Ao was extremely arrogant, he walked to Long Fei's side and said: \"Do you still want to compete? Get ready to eat shit, hahaha \u2026 \"Don't mention how excited he was.After being slapped five times by Long Fei, he had the heart to kill Long Fei.As long as he ate feces in front of his entire clan, Long Fei would never be able to raise his head up. The more he thought about it, the more excited Long Ao became, \"Bring the feces over here.\"A disciple walked over while holding his breath, and said: \"Young Master Long Ao, these are all just produced today, the fragrance is especially fragrant.\"Long Ao covered his nose with one hand and said, \"Good, you did very well.\"Long Shan stood in front of Long Fei and said: \"Young Master, I'll \u2026\"And then \u2026A few more disciples walked up and said, \"We'll replace you.\"Long Ao immediately bellowed: \"Scram to the side, the one eating shit is Long Fei, if you guys want to eat, then I'll get someone to make a big barrel for you guys to eat.\"\"Long Fei, hurry up. Is there still a need to compete?\"Long Fei was secretly grateful and said with a smile: \"Why are you in such a hurry? If you're in a hurry, then eat this sh * t first. \"While they were talking, Long Fei had already walked out.He looked at the statistics elder: \"Look carefully.\"As soon as he finished.Long Fei's hands moved like the wind as he crazily took out the monster head from the group of Space Ring.\"36!\"\u2026 \u2026.\"89!\"\"107.\"\"139.\"\u2026 \u2026.\"189.\"\"207...\"\"350.\"\"590.\"\"780.\"\u2026 \u2026.The final number was set to 780. This was because Long Fei had many monster head that he had yet to cut, otherwise, he would have been able to double the number.The entire hall was silent.He was speechless!Long Fei walked to Long Ao's side, patted his dumbstruck face and said: \"Still want to compete? Who's eating shit? \"Long Ao's expression changed, he could not say a word.At this moment.The Statistical Elder shouted loudly, \"780 level 1 monster, for a total of 7800 points, first place!\"Suddenly.Long Ao suddenly roared, \"I can't accept this, Long Fei, these are all level 1 monster that you have hunted down, all are trash beasts! Do you have any Secondary Monster? Is there? \"\"If you can't even kill the Secondary Monster, what qualifications do you have to be the Long family's young master?\"Long Zhanwu followed: \"You're right, you don't even know if you killed these level 1 monster. If you want to prove yourself, then take out the Secondary Monster's head.\"Long Fei frowned, \"You dare to go back on your word?\"Long Zhanwu sneered: \"I think you're cheating right?\"Long Fei suppressed the anger in his heart and said: \"How can I prove that I didn't cheat?\"Long Zhanwu said complacently: \"It's very simple, take out the corpses of Secondary Monster and higher, if not your competition results will be ineffective, and you will lose the bet.\"\"Give up the position of Young Lord!\"Long Ao said sinisterly: \"And you still have to eat this sh * t.\"\"I don't have any Secondary Monster.\" Long Fei said indifferently, his hand reached into the Space Ring s.Without waiting for Long Fei to finish speaking, Long Ao laughed excitedly: \"Then you will lose, Long Fei will eat shit \u2026 \u2026\"Similarly.Without waiting for Long Ao to finish speaking, Long Fei's arm suddenly exerted more force, his voice became heavy, and he roared out: \"But I have this beast!\"\"Boom!\"The Large Power King Kong Ape's head was taken out and placed on the ground of martial-arts arena like a small mountain. The Large Power King Kong Ape happened to be staring at Long Ao and Long Ao immediately fell to the ground, retreating continuously while trembling.Shock!Domineering!Not a single sound could be heard from the entire auditorium.

The five level monster was incomparably cruel, even if it was just a head.\"Shout!\"\"Laugh!\"\"Didn't you say that I didn't kill any demon beasts?\"\"Didn't you say that laozi is trash?\"\"Didn't you say that I don't have the qualifications to be the young master of the Long family?\"\"Scream for laozi again!\"Long Fei swept his gaze across the entire audience, looking incomparably arrogant and domineering;Crazy! He had to be crazy to the extreme!The aura from Long Fei's body unknowingly crushed the entire audience. Those people who had mocked Long Fei before did not dare to raise their heads to look at him, their hearts filled with fear. Long Fei was really no longer the trash of the past, Long Fei. It should be said that Long Fei, who was even more arrogant than his own genius, had returned!No one in the audience could say a word.Long Fei looked at Long Zhanwu coldly, and said: \"I'm just asking if you're convinced or not.!\"\"Cluck, cluck \u2026\"Long Zhanwu clenched both of his fists tightly, causing loud cracking sounds to appear from his joints, and the dense war chief Qi was released from his body, pressuring Xiang Longfei crazily, as though flames were about to spew out of his eyes.At this moment.He really wanted to tear Long Fei into pieces in an instant.war chief Suppression!Long Fei's body sank as he struggled to resist.Because the level gap was too big, when facing the pressure attack, the King Kong Shield had no way to defend, and Long Fei could not do anything either. However, he was still extremely arrogant, his voice was like thunder as he shouted, \"Who's going to lose now?\"As soon as his voice faded \u2026Long Shan and the others had long been boiling with excitement. They shouted loudly, \"The Great Elder has lost!\"Long Fei roared again: Who lost?!Long Shan and the others also threw caution to the wind, and shouted: \"Long Zhanwu!\"His voice was deafening and domineering!This was the grandeur of the Long family's army.Long Fei resisted the pressure and laughed: \"Great Clan Elder, if you are willing to admit defeat, you have to eat shit!\"At this moment.Long Ao rolled over and over, trying to get into the crowd to escape.The corner of Long Fei's eyes moved, his body leaped, and he instantly jumped in front of Long Ao. He laughed lightly: \"Young Master Long Ao, where do you want to go?\"Long Ao laughed obsequiously: \"Long Fei, I was just joking, please don't take it seriously, we are cousins.\"\"Now tell me we are cousins?\"\"Every time you see me this year, you beat me up. Why didn't you call me a cousin at that time?\"\"Why didn't you say it was a cousin when the dung bucket was placed on my face just now?\"\"You father and son have done all that you can to make me die. Even the killer at failure alliance has invited me to die, why don't you just call me cousin? Now you're telling laozi that you're a cousin, hehe \u2026 \"Too late!\"While they were talking \u2026Long Fei grabbed Long Ao's neck, as if he was holding a duck, and said: \"Bring the sh * t over here!\"Long Shan took over the dung pot and said, \"I'm here. It was just produced just now. The smell is really fragrant. Hahaha \u2026\"Long Ao continued to struggle and shout for help, \"Father, save me! Father, quickly save me! I don't want to eat sh * t!Not waiting for him to finish.Long Fei pushed his head down into the dung bowl.As his mouth was opened, Long Ao's mouth was quickly filled, his stomach rolled, and he vomited. When he vomited, another large mouthful of feces would rush into his mouth.\"Drink up!\"Long Fei shouted loudly, \"Don't spill a single drop.\"\"Ah... Woo \u2026 Father... Ah... \"Woo woo \u2026\" Long Ao continued to struggle, his face was extremely pale, and his nose was full of sh * t.Long Zhanwu's eyes were bloodshot as he stared at Long Fei sinisterly.Long Fei laughed coldly, \"Great Clan Elder, you want some too?\"\"Long Fei!\"\"You're courting death!\" Long Zhanwu was incomparably furious, the rage in his heart had already been suppressed.His son had eaten shit in front of all the other clan disciples. From today onwards, he would be a cripple.How could he bear it?Long Fei laughed: \"Long Zhanwu, it won't take just one or two days for you to want me dead. Since you want me dead, then come and kill me.\"\"You think I don't dare?\" Long Zhanwu bellowed.Long Fei said: \"Dare, of course I dare, but if you kill the Long family's young master in front of the entire clan, can you bear the consequences?\"It was also at this time.Long Zhanye took a step forward, firmly held onto Long Zhanwu, and said in a low voice: \"Big Brother, you can't be rash. If you were to make a move now, you would be fooled by Long Fei.\"Kill the Long family's young master?This was no ordinary crime.If he killed the Long Family's Young Patriarch, even in his dreams, Long Zhanwu wouldn't be able to sit on the seat of the Long Family's Patriarch.Hu hu hu hu \u2026.Long Zhanwu took a deep breath, with a swing of his sleeves, he shouted: \"The first round of the examination is over, start the arena battle tomorrow.\"\"Long Fei!\"\"I hope you still have a life to be arrogant tomorrow.\"Long Zhanwu glanced at his son who was unconscious and lying on the ground with his stomach bulging and his mouth spitting feces, and shouted: \"Carry him away for me.\"Finished.Long Zhanwu and his men quickly left.\u2026 \u2026.\"Oh!\"\"The Young Lord is mighty!\"\"Young Master is domineering, hahaha... The Young Lord is too handsome. \"\u2026 \u2026.The entire Martial Arts Practice Grounds was cheering. It was as if they had won a battle against their opponents. This was too exciting.The Long family's imperial guards, led by Long Shan, were cheering.Long Fei's entire body relaxed as cold sweat seeped out of his back. The pressure of the war chief was simply too unbearable, it was even more unbearable than facing off against Large Power King Kong Ape s.At the same time.There were also people discussing.\"He truly doesn't know his place. He offended the Great Elder in public and the Patriarch and the Grand Elder are still in seclusion. With him being so high-profile, there's only one \u2026\" \"Disappeared.\"\"The demonic beasts' assessment is just a child's test. No one knows where the monster head came from, but how can he kill them? I wouldn't believe it even if I were beaten to death. \"\"We will know about the stage tomorrow. I think the Great Clan Elder will not let Long Fei off easily.\"\"He's too young and he doesn't know how to restrain himself. He will definitely die in the arena tomorrow.\"\u2026 \u2026.No matter what the Long Family said about Long Fei.There was one thing that he had to admit, Long Fei was no longer a piece of trash from one year ago.The fact that Long Fei was the Long family's young master was finally recalled by everyone. No one in the Long family anymore dared to look down on Long Fei, and no one dared to say he was a piece of trash.Then again.Long Fei's personality was: If you respect me by one foot, then I respect you by three.You want to fuck me?Sorry about that, I'll return it a hundred times!High profile?Arrogant?These were just Long Fei's overbearing personality, he would continue to be arrogant!\u2026 \u2026.\"What did you say?\"\"That peak rank 5 beast was killed?\"\"Was it killed by Long Fei?\"\"Impossible, absolutely impossible. Long Fei doesn't even have that kind of strength.\" Nangong Lei was extremely shocked, even if that five level monster was a war chief Ranker, it was not easy to deal with it, how could he, a broken Pubes trash, kill it?\"Reporting to the Duke, I have investigated, it was Long Fei who led the demon beasts into the deep valley, no one knows what happened after that.\"\"But...\"Nangong Lei immediately asked: \"Just what?\"The guard replied: \"It's just that when the Long family disciples noticed them, there was another person by Long Fei's side, a member of the Heaven Sect.\"\"Eh?!\"Nangong Lei's eyes darkened, \"So the Large Power King Kong Ape were killed by the experts of the Heaven Sect, and Long Fei only took advantage of the opportunity to cut off their heads?\"\"This subordinate does not know!\"Nangong Lei looked out of the window with his hands behind his back, and muttered: \"Since when was Long Fei related to the disciples of the Heaven Sect?\"\"I'll make a trip to the Long family tomorrow!\"\u2026 \u2026.It was not only Prince Nangong's house.The entire Fire Glass City was shaking.The Divine Zhuge Manor, the Li Martial Arts Sect, and even the Nangong Imperial Palace were the same.At the same time.They had all made the same decision. They would personally come to the Long family arena tomorrow!Because \u2026They wanted to investigate whether that genius Long Fei had really returned!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This made him feel a sense of danger, an intense sense of danger.All of the direct disciples of Long Zhanwu's sect lowered their heads, not daring to breathe too loudly.\"Say something, why are you all mute?\" Long Zhanwu bellowed.One of the disciples said carefully: \"Great Clan Elder, Long Fei is related to the people of the Heaven Sect.\"\"Huh?\"\"What did you say?\" Long Zhanwu was shocked.Long Ao, who was still lying on the ground with feces continuously coming out from his mouth, gasped for breath and said: \"Father, I wanted to tell you about this when I was in martial-arts arena.\"Long Zhanwu's eyes turned sinister, and he shouted: \"Then why don't you say anything?\"Long Ao said in a low voice: \"It's you who didn't let me say it.\"\"Trash!\"\"You've lost all my face.\" Long Zhanwu no longer looked at Long Ao, but narrowed his eyes and said: \"The Sky Sect huh? Long Fei, you must be trying to get yourself a big backer. \"His voice was colder, and his killing intent grew stronger.Long Zhanwu thought in his heart: \"No matter who you climb up to, you must die tomorrow!\"At this moment.Long Zhanye hurried into the courtyard.Long Zhanwu slightly said: \"All of you go down first. Remember, you must kill Long Fei in the arena tomorrow.\"After those disciples left, Long Zhanye immediately stepped forward and said, \"Big Brother, I just received a message from the three great families and the Imperial Family. They will be personally present at the Long family's arena tomorrow.\"Long Zhanwu's expression became serious, frowned, and said: \"Because of Long Fei?\"Long Zhanye said: \"The entire city knows about Long Fei killing the five level monster. A piece of trash turning into a genius and with that dragon's roar last time, they are worried \u2026\"At this time, Long Zhanwu's expression became ugly, and he said in shock: \"Are you saying that the Dragon God blood lineage in Long Fei's body has recovered?\"\"If that's the case...\"Thinking about Long Fei's arrogant and rampant appearance today, Long Zhanwu felt that Long Fei must have recovered his Dragon God blood lineage. Otherwise, where did he get the confidence to challenge him?Long Zhanye said: \"The three pillars and the Imperial Family also want to confirm this matter. If Long Fei were to recover the Dragon God's blood lineage, then our situation would be even worse.\"The Dragon God blood lineage was a Dragon God Warrior.Apart from the Grand Elder, he was the only one who could command the Long family's army.The Long family army didn't have any military talismans, they only listened to the orders of the Grand Elder, or the Dragon God's soldiers!Once Long Fei regained his status as a Dragon God Warrior, his power would be immense. Give the order, the Dragon Cavalry would rush to the Fire Glass City in the shortest time possible, but he wouldn't be able to stop them at all!Long Zhanye said in a low voice: \"Big Brother, do you want killer at failure alliance to make a move? Deal with Long Fei tonight. \"\"No!\"Long Zhanwu immediately denied it, and said: \"The Long family's cavalry will need at least five days to return to the Long family, and there are too many things that can be changed in five days. I want Long Fei to die, to die on the arena, and I want everyone in the Long family to think that he is trash again, a trash who cannot get up, and to make the Long family lose hope in him.\"If he dies in the arena, everyone in the Long family will despise him.\"\"This time, I will make it so that he will never be able to turn over his body!\"Long Zhanwu's voice was sinister, as he whispered something into Long Zhanye's ear.After Long Zhanye finished listening, his eyes shook and he said, \"I'll go do it right away.\"After taking a few steps.Long Zhanye turned around and said: \"Big brother, the killer from failure alliance did not come back, whether he is dead or alive is still unknown.\"Long Zhanwu didn't think much of it, and said: \"She's just a low-levelled killer, there's no need to care about her life.\"Long Zhanye replied: \"Got it!\"\u2026 \u2026.\"jojo, I'm back!\"The first thing Long Fei did when he came out of the training grounds was to go home and see jojo.In these three days, the person he was most concerned about was jojo.Hearing the voice, jojo immediately ran out, and with a smile on her face, she smiled sweetly and said: \"Young Master, you're back, I've prepared dinner for you.\"She silently watched what was happening in the martial-arts arena from a corner. Every time she saw Long Fei being forced to the edge of a cliff, her heart would always throb in pain.She hated herself for not being able to help Long Fei.She was sorry she couldn't do anything.In the past three days, she had followed Long Fei's instructions and continuously tried to cultivate, but she could not. He simply could not sense the spirit energy flowing between heaven and earth, and he could not absorb the Pubes into the true breath.She felt like the stupidest, most useless person in the world.There was a smile on his face, but he covered it up extremely well, not letting Long Fei notice it in the slightest.Long Fei laughed: \"jojo treats me the best, you've starved me to death, I want to eat ten bowls, hahaha \u2026\"jojo also laughed, and said: \"I'll bring you food.\"A cozy dinner was over.Long Fei made sure that there were no Long Zhanwu's people around before he said, \"I'm going out for a while. Stay at home and wait for me to come back.\"jojo nodded obediently and said: \"En!\"\u2026 \u2026.Half an hour later.Long Fei came to the Fengyuan Merchant Union.Looking at Long Fei, Zhao Er's eyes filled with admiration: \"Young Master Long, you're simply too cool, even the five level monster were killed by you, you're too powerful. From today onwards, you're my, Zhao Er's, idol.\"Long Fei smiled and said: \"I'll first brew a cup of Holy Tea for this idol, no \u2026 It's a pot! \"This time, Zhao Er surprisingly cooperated and said: \"Elder Liu guessed that you were coming and told me to prepare.\"When Liu Feng heard this, he also walked down from the pavilion. Laughing, he said, \"Brother Long, you really don't reveal your true colors. You even killed a peak level 5 beast.\"F * ck!\"\"News travels really fast. I wanted to keep a low profile. Sigh \u2026\" A handsome person will never be able to keep a low profile. \" Long Fei said shamelessly.While they were talking, the two of them entered the backyard.Liu Feng said: \"What do you want this time?\"Long Fei went straight to the point: \"The true pill s have a hundred sets of spiritual herbs, and the healing pills have a hundred sets of spiritual herbs. I will need them immediately.\"Liu Feng said: For tomorrow's arena battle?Long Fei said: \"Mn, in these three days, I have used up all the true pill and healing pellets in Fire Wolf Valley, so Long Zhanwu will definitely not let me off during tomorrow's arena battle. I need to prepare well.\"Liu Feng shouted, \"Zhao Er, bring the things over.\"Then.Liu Feng laughed: \"I have long prepared it for you, but you know \u2026 I would like to ask, can you really refine true pill? \"Long Fei downed a cup of Holy Tea and said: \"Yes, but the success rate is not high, only fifty percent.\"\"Cough, cough, cough...\"\"Cough, cough, cough...\" Liu Feng coughed rapidly, his face flushed red, as though he had been provoked by something, \"How high do you think the success rate is?\"Long Fei drank another cup of Holy Tea s and said: \"50%, huh? \"Old Liu, is your heart feeling uncomfortable again?\"\"No!\"\"My liver hurts.\" Liu Feng really wanted to die. He was also a Alchemy Master, and he had refined pills for dozens of years, but he did not even have a ten percent success rate when refining true pill. Even a Profound Rank Alchemy Master could not even reach fifty percent. To be able to achieve a success rate of fifty percent, he simply didn't want to live anymore.It was really deadly!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

One night was too short, he still had a lot of things to do.However, Liu Feng stopped him, and asked in a low voice: \"Brother Long, tell me the truth, has your Dragon God blood lineage recovered?\"\"Huh?\"\"Dragon God blood lineage?\"Long Fei asked doubtfully: \"Why do you ask that?\"Liu Feng said: \"Not only me, the entire Fire Glass City has guessed that your Dragon God blood lineage has recovered. three pillars, the entire Nan Gong Royal Family thinks that your blood lineage has recovered. And how would you dare to challenge Long Zhanwu? \"\"Tell me the truth, I promise I won't tell anyone. Have you recovered?\"Long Fei smiled mysteriously and said: \"Guess!\"Liu Feng muttered: \"My guess is that you must have recovered, if not how could your Alchemy technique be so easy to succeed? It must be because of the Dragon God's blood essence, I heard that the Dragon God blood lineage s are supreme blood lineage s, whether in terms of martial arts or Alchemy, the runes all have a strong supporting ability, able to allow one to soar into the sky. Before you entered the Fire Wolf Valley, you were only a master in battle, but now you have reached the war spirit realm, is it not because of the Dragon God's blood essence? \"Dragon God blood lineage, supreme.He was the leader of the ten great blood lineage in god's martial continent.Those who possess this kind of blood lineage are all peerless geniuses in the Martial Dao.Regardless of cultivation or anything else, he would be able to comprehend the profound mysteries, the true meaning, and the speed at which it happened!Long Fei had changed a lot recently.He couldn't help but think that the Dragon God blood lineage in his body had recovered, otherwise how could there be such a huge change?What happened today in the martial-arts arena proved this point even more.Long Fei sneered in his heart, \"Is the Dragon God's blood essence that powerful?\"\"Even blood lineage that is ten thousand times stronger than the Dragon God's blood essence can't defeat my Striking System, Dragon God's blood lineage is nothing.\"Striking System is the way of the king!This is what I rely on the most!Long Fei laughed: \"You'll know tomorrow.\"\"Huh?\"Liu Feng was startled for a moment, then laughed: \"You still want to keep me in suspense? Alright, I won't ask anymore. However... Tomorrow, the Zhuge family of the Divine Hou, the Li Martial Arts Sect, Prince Nan Gong and the Nangong Imperial Clan will personally come to your Long family to watch the stage. Their goal is very simple, they just want to know if you have truly recovered the Dragon God's blood essence.Long Fei's heart sank, and said coldly: \"You want to drain my blood essence again, and shatter my Pubes?\"Liu Feng said: \"I'm afraid that I won't let you off so easily this time.\"\"Thank you, Elder Liu!\"\"At the same time, help me thank your Pavilion Master.\"Long Fei hugged his fists, then quickly left.He didn't think that the Long family's yearly family exam would attract so many people.Assassination by the three pillars family and the Royal family.Now that I killed the five level monster and made them fearful, if I were to recover the Dragon God's blood essence, would they join hands to assassinate me again?Was it them last time?Long Fei clenched his fists tightly and thought in his heart: \"three pillars, Nan Gong Royal, wash your ass and wait for me to explode. I will not let any of you go!\"\u2026 \u2026.After Long Fei left, in the pavilion of the Fengyuan Merchant Union.Liu Feng said respectfully: \"Miss, he seems to know that you were the one who arranged for the disciples of the Heaven Sect to enter the Fire Wolf Valley to protect him.\"Fu Xishan did not answer, but believed that Long Fei had guessed it, and she did not intentionally hide it either. Long Fei knew that it was better, as she would remember the kindness of the Fengyuan Merchant Union, but right now, she was not interested in any of it, so she looked at Hei Ye, and muttered: \"Did he really recover the Dragon God's blood essence?\"\"Err \u2026\"Liu Feng didn't know how to reply to that for a moment.Fu Xishan's brows slightly twitched, and said: \"Elder Liu, go and arrange something. I'll go to the Long family's residence tomorrow.\"\"Huh?\"Liu Feng trembled, and said: \"Miss, I'm afraid this is not good, the rules of the Fengyuan Merchant Union \u2026\"Fu Xishan interrupted: \"I know the rules of the Fengyuan Merchant Union, I'm just going to take a look, I don't want to interfere in the affairs of the Long family.\"Liu Feng immediately asked: Should I inform Black Elder?Fu Xishan said: \"Do as you please!\"\u2026 \u2026.Sky Sect, Fire Glass City Branch.\"Eldest Senior Sister, I just received news that the three pillars and the royal family will be going to the Long family to watch the arena fights tomorrow.\" Xiao Tiantian walked into the house and said.Ye Ziyan laughed: \"What watching the arena battle, they just want to know if Long Fei has recovered the Dragon God's blood essence. If he has, they can carry out a second assassination.Xiao Tiantian was shocked, \"Then what do we do? Isn't Long Fei in danger? \"\"No way!\"\"I have to protect him.\"This time, Ye Ziyan and Xiao Tiantian were in unison. Ye Ziyan said, \"I will go too.\"Xiao Tiantian walked to Liu Luoxi's side and asked: \"Big Senior, what about you?\"Liu Luoxi had seen Long Fei's true strength before, and she understood in her heart that Long Fei's strength did not need their protection, but \u2026 In just a short day that they had not met, she had been thinking about Long Fei in her heart.\"Huff \u2026\"Liu Luoxi exhaled, and said: \"Go!\"\"Yay!\"\"Long live Big Senior!\"Xiao Tiantian jumped up in joy and clenched her little fist, saying, \"Tomorrow, if anyone dares to bully that bastard, I'll definitely teach them a lesson!\"Ye Ziyan joked, \"Little junior sister apprentice, you're thinking of spring.\"\"Ahh \u2026\"Xiao Tiantian's face immediately flushed red. \"No way, no way, that bastard can only be bullied by us, no one else will allow him!\"\u2026 \u2026.Back home.\"jojo.\"Long Fei shouted.There was no response from the courtyard.Long Fei was shocked in his heart, and shouted even louder: \"jojo.\"\"Young Master!\"A voice came out from the hall. jojo was sitting inside, and beside her was a woman with a veil covering her face.killer at failure alliance!Long Fei released his Wind Shadow Step and rushed to the hall in the blink of an eye. He stared at the female assassin and asked: \"Do you know the consequences of provoking me?\"\"If you touch her, you won't be able to get out of here today!\"Anger raged.jojo was his reverse scale, no one could touch him.Anyone who touched it would die!The female assassin said coldly, \"Oh? I thought you didn't have a weakness, but it turns out that your weakness is her. \"jojo said anxiously, \"Young Master, I'm fine, she didn't do anything to me.\"Long Fei looked at jojo's body and confirmed that there were no injuries on his body. He then looked at the female assassin and said, \"You only want my life.\"No way!\"jojo immediately said: \"Don't hurt my Young Master, if you want to kill me, then do it.\"Long Fei frowned, and said coldly: \"I already said, if you touch her once, you will die here. Your target is me, so come and kill me.\"jojo started to cry anxiously.Suddenly.The female assassin moved like a ghost, her ice sword moved, attacking Xiang Longfei's forehead.jojo exclaimed, \"No!\"Long Fei stood in place without moving an inch.Han Jian was still half a centimeter away from his forehead when he stopped. The female assassin was slightly shocked as she asked, \"Are you not afraid of death?\"Long Fei said straightforwardly: \"I'm afraid, I'm more afraid of death than anyone else but she's my everything and her life is much more important than mine.\"\"She's just a small maid, but she's a little pretty. Is it worth it for you to risk your life to protect her?\" The female assassin sounded puzzled.Long Fei said without hesitation: \"It's worth it!\"Because \u2026jojo was the first person who treated him well when he came to this world.She was willing to offer up her precious body for him. From that moment onwards, Long Fei swore to protect this silly girl even if he had to die.\"Drip!\"\"Drip drip \u2026\"Blood suddenly dripped from the female assassin's sleeve.Long Fei was secretly shocked, \"You're injured?\"The female assassin's body shook slightly, the cold sword fell out of her hands, her eyes became blurry, she directly fell into Xiang Longfei's embrace, and pleaded: \"Save me!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The sword had penetrated her body, and the wound was extremely severe.jojo also immediately recovered.\"First help her clean her wounds, and I'll concoct a healing pill.\"Now that he didn't have a single healing pill, he could only concoct it immediately.A few minutes later.A Highest Grade Medicine Powder was out of the furnace and quickly handed it over to jojo.Long Fei wanted to go in and take a look, but he was blocked outside by jojo, and said: \"Young Master, what she injured is her chest, if a man like you sees it, how can she face others in the future?\"\"Huh?\"Long Fei looked through the gap in the door and coincidentally saw half of the female assassin's chest, \"Damn, it's so big!\"\"Young Master!\"jojo stomped his feet in anger.Long Fei quickly ran out.\"The top quality bamboo shoot type beast is simply too savage.\"Following that \u2026Long Fei took care of the Qi in his body to calm himself down, and then began to refine the Healing Pills.He felt more and more that there would be a fierce battle waiting for him tomorrow.\"Ding!\"\"Refining is a success!\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for obtaining a Highest Grade Medicine Powder, gained 100 experience points, 10 true breath points, and 10 points as a reward.\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations, player \u2026\"\u2026 \u2026.The Highest Grade Medicine Powder s were now completely easy for Long Fei.However.true pill's success rate was still not high.Long Fei still only had a success rate of fifty percent, but he secretly felt that there was a problem with the spirit herb formula.It was not that the pill formula Liu Feng gave him was wrong, but there seemed to be some spirit herbs within the spirit herbs that could restrain him, causing Long Fei to be unable to find them.He could only refine the pill according to the method he had used before.Midnight passed.\"Ding!\"\"Refining is a success!\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for raising your Alchemy to its current level of Yellow Rank Level 6! Obtain 500 experience points, 50 true breath, and 50 Points as a reward. \"\"Young master, she's awake! She's awake!\" jojo suddenly ran out and shouted.Long Fei inspected the pellets, and found that there was enough for tomorrow. He also walked into the room and said: \"jojo, stay away from her.\"He had no choice but to be on guard.In the beginning, Long Fei seemed to not have moved, but he had already activated his King Kong Shield s, so even if she stabbed down with her sword, she would not be able to harm Long Fei.Long Fei was not an idiot.How could he give up his life for nothing?jojo said: \"Young master, she did not attack you just now, much less now.\"She was just so kind.No matter what other people did to her, she would always think highly of them. Even if they wanted to kill her earlier, she wouldn't hold a grudge.jojo was too simple and kind.Long Fei walked to the side of the bed, the killer was still wearing his veil, Long Fei asked: \"I want to know who injured you? You were not injured in Fire Wolf Valley. \"This was very strange.Liu Luoxi did not chase after her.The female assassin knew her situation, and hid nothing from Long Fei: \"She was my original master.\"\"Huh?\"Long Fei frowned, \"You said that Fire Glass City has another killer at failure alliance?\"The female assassin said: \"failure alliance...\" He laughed self-deprecatingly and said, \"We are not killer at failure alliance at all. Entering the failure alliance is my lifelong goal. \"\"Not the killer at failure alliance?\"\"Are you guys fake?\" Long Fei asked.The female assassin said, \"We will impersonate the killer at failure alliance because we can get a very high price this way.\"\"Holy sh * t!\"\"What a clever way.\" Long Fei could not help but praise him, and thought to himself: \"When are you going to act like the killer at failure alliance to earn some extra money?\"The female assassin smiled bitterly: \"I'm not afraid of your joke. This is the first time we are pretending to be the failure alliance, because the price your Great Elder offered is too attractive. 50 million silver!\"\"Fifty million...?\"\"Fuck, Long Zhanwu that bastard, he really doesn't take the Long family's money seriously.\" Long Fei secretly clicked his tongue and asked: \"Fifty million shouldn't be enough to invite you all to kill me, right?\"The female assassin said: \"They are on Long Zhanhai's side, but \u2026 \"The plan has changed. Now, the fifty million bounty is being used on you alone.\"\"Long Zhanwu's condition is that you die in the arena!\"Long Fei laughed coldly, \"Truly ruthless, do you want this daddy to die on the stage and be laughed at by the entire city?\"And then \u2026Long Fei asked: \"You still haven't told me how you were injured.\"The female assassin bit her lips and said, \"I \u2026 I wanted to give up the mission. Long Zhanwu ordered my master to kill me, I never thought that he would actually attack me, and fortunately, I escaped very quickly, they did not expect that I would flee to your place. Originally, I wanted to kill you to complete the mission, but \u2026 I can't go back. \"\"Can you take me in?\"\"As long as I can survive, I'm willing to do anything, kill people and set fires. I can do anything despicable and dirty things, as long as I live!\"Long Fei smiled, \"Your master will let me die on the stage, what meaning do you have to follow me, a person who is about to die?\"\"You won't die!\"The female assassin looked at Long Fei seriously and said: \"I saw how you killed the Large Power King Kong Ape. That kind of sword aura is unrivalled.\"Huh?\"Long Fei frowned, a trace of killing intent flashed past his eyes.The secret had been discovered!?At this point in time, he would not trust anyone.Even a woman with a bamboo shoot shaped chest wouldn't believe it.The female assassin felt the cold Qi from Long Fei's body, and immediately said: \"I did not say a single word, and I did not say the weapon you were holding either.\"\"There's more!\"My master will definitely think of a way to disguise himself as a disciple of the Long family to compete with you in the arena. He has a very sinister technique called the 'Conical Yin Method', it is an extremely vicious technique, a vortex of air will appear on his palms, once it touches your nerves, it will temporarily paralyze you and you will be killed in an instant.Long Fei's heart trembled, and said with a bland smile: \"If you betray your master like this, and I accept you, will you betray me like this?\"The female assassin was startled and looked into Long Fei's eyes. She said without hesitation: \"Before I have my revenge, I will! I want to live, I want revenge, I don't even have my life left, how can I take revenge! \"No concealment.Because, she knew, she couldn't hide it from Long Fei.jojo looked at the female assassin and said: \"Young Master, please take her in. Look at her, she is very pitiful. Her parents and family were all killed by someone.Long Fei laughed: \"Do you really believe what she says?\"jojo muttered to herself, \"She won't lie to me.\"Long Fei said: \"I am not jojo, and will not believe you just because of a few words. After the stage is over, I will decide whether you are going to stay or not.\"Actually.Long Fei had already decided.He needed someone who could do anything for him.However.Long Fei didn't believe her at the moment.After tomorrow, if what she said was true, Long Fei would let her stay.Furthermore...Furthermore, she was a top-grade bamboo shoot chest-type beauty, a killer beauty!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Behind him were a few Zhuge family disciples, Zhuge Jianqiang among them.He was Zhuge Tianlong's only son.He was also one of the young elites of the Fire Glass City, a person deeply admired and respected by the royal family.As Zhuge Jianqiang stepped into the martial arts arena, he could not help but sneer, and said disdainfully: \"This kind of low level martial arts arena, is really poor.\"Many of the Long family disciples were displeased.Zhuge Tianlong slightly said: \"Qiang'er, don't be so unruly, just put some words in your heart, why would you say them out loud?\"He even added another stab.Zhuge Jianqiang laughed: \"I will remember.\"Long Zhanye personally went up to welcome him and said: \"The Divine Marquis has arrived, it's a long distance to welcome you.\"Zhuge Tianlong cupped his fists and said: \"Brother Zhan Ye, you are too courteous. We are only here to observe the disciples of the Long family today, and to let the disciples of the Zhuge family study properly. The Long family is a family that has existed in the Fire Glass City for tens of thousands of years, and the disciples of the Long family are all elites.Zhuge Jianqiang said: \"Father, I will definitely learn properly, but I heard that the Long family has lost all of their talented people in these years, and they do not have any outstanding disciples.Long Zhanye frowned.Zhuge Tianlong laughed: \"Brother Zhan Ye, please forgive me for being so rude.\"Long Zhanye laughed: \"It's alright, the Divine Marquis' side, please take your seat.\"\"Many thanks!\"Zhuge Tianlong laughed, and thought: \"Long family? Even after ten thousand years? Humph... I don't think the day is far off. \"Zhuge Jianqiang also laughed: \"This is the Long family, they look like slaves. Just looking at me makes you want to laugh, and you think you can become one of the four pillars?\"Zhuge Tianlong slightly said: \"Don't underestimate the Long family. The true terrifying person of the Long family has yet to come out.\"\"Father, are you talking about the grand elder of the Long family?\" Zhuge Jianqiang said, \"I heard that the Long family's Grand Elder is in closed door training to attack the war master ream, even if the Long family were to collapse, he would not come out, so there's no need to be afraid of him. Furthermore, our Zhuge family already has that \u2026\"Zhuge Tianlong glared at him.Zhuge Jianqiang immediately shut his mouth and did not say anymore.\"Prince Nangong has arrived!\"Nangong Lei came.\"Look, it's Nangong Yan!\"\"Fire Glass City's number one beauty.\"\"Too beautiful! How can there be such a beautiful woman in the world? \"\"Look at the young man beside her. Isn't Nangong Yan the fiancee of the Long family's young master? \"\"This is the Long family, they are so intimate with the Long family, and even more so, Long Fei.\"\u2026 \u2026.The martial-arts arena began to discuss softly.The biggest Nangong Yan in the entire Fire Glass City was Long Fei's fiancee.However...She was holding onto a man's arm as she walked into the Long family. Wasn't this insulting the Long family?Wasn't he bullying the Long family?Moreover.She had a look of deep affection on her face and was talking and laughing along the way. She didn't care about the Long family at all.This made many people of the Long family unhappy!But no one dared say anything.The Dragon Grand Elder had gone into closed door cultivation, the Acting Clan Chief Long Zhanhai had gone into closed door cultivation, Great Elder Long Zhanwu had gone all out to deal with Long Fei, who would stand up for Long Fei at this time?Another slap on the Long family's face!\"Li Martial Arts Sect, General Li has arrived.\"Li Chongtian brought the two rows of Li Clan soldiers and entered the Long Clan's residence.He was fully armed, as if he was going to the battlefield.This was like watching an arena war battle?This was using the Long family as a battlefield.Another slap on the face!The last to step up was the Nangong Imperial Clan. Nangong Huo did not come personally, but chose to send a prince, Nangong Xiao.Some people greeted him at the martial arts practice field.Nangong Xiao's complacency could be seen from his words, and he said: \"This prince is only here to observe the arena fights, I'll just treat it as my normal identity.\"And then \u2026After taking his seat, Nangong Xiao coldly snorted, and said. \"Long Zhanye, you don't even have a Holy Tea here?\"Long Zhanye's expression changed slightly as he said, \"Your Highness, we are indeed...\"\"F * ck!\"\"What kind of dog shit clan is this, and what kind of dog or cat family can become a four pillars family? Even the tea was of such low quality, the Long family... Hehe... I think it's better to change your name to dog. \" Nangong Xiao said in disdain.Long Zhanye clenched his fists tightly, he was patiently enduring, he had come today to deal with Long Fei.There was nothing he could do!If it was the Long family at their peak, they would have long since moved their heads!The three pillars family and the Nangong Imperial Family all gave the Long family a ruthless slap.In the eyes of the outsiders in martial-arts arena, the Long Family had withered!The Long family's might was gone, their talents were waning, and they were also fighting inside. On the surface, the Long family was no longer strong enough. This huge family that had existed for ten thousand years would disappear from this world.In the future, he definitely couldn't stand with the Long family. Otherwise, his fate would be very miserable.Many members of the Long family felt a ball of fire in their hearts.Since when had the Long family been so aggrieved?!\u2026 \u2026.Long Zhanye was also extremely unhappy as he said to Long Zhanwu, \"This is going too far, who do they think they are?\"Long Zhanwu did not care about all these, but asked: \"Is everyone ready?\"As long as he became the Long family's head, he believed that he would definitely be able to change the Long family.Long Zhanye nodded his head: \"Everything has been prepared according to plan, the sixteen disciples who are participating in the arena, other than Long Fei, are all our people.\"\"The killer has been arranged.\"\"Alright!\" Long Zhanwu excitedly sneered: \"Long Fei, you're dead today!\"\u2026 \u2026.Suddenly.martial-arts arena was in an uproar.\"The Young Lord is here!\"It was also at this time.Long Shan and the others changed into the armors of the Imperial Guards, and their dragon-shaped spears shook violently.whoosh whoosh whoosh \u2026 *With one step, he shook the ground and quickly suppressed the voice of the martial-arts arena. He walked to Long Fei's side and knelt down heavily, and shouted out loud: \"Greetings, Young Master!\"His voice shook the heavens!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If you dare to call our Young Lord useless, then don't blame us, the Long family's imperial guards, for being impolite.\"As soon as his voice faded \u2026The Long family's imperial guards shouted in unison, \"Hah!\"The Long family's aura.Zhuge Jianqiang sneered, and said: \"Who do you think you are? I say, what happened to his trash? Isn't he a trash? The Pubes has shattered, his veins and tendons are congealing, and even the dragon blood that your Long Family is proud of has been sucked out, so what if this kind of person is not a trash? \"Another insult!Long Shan's steel spear moved.Many of the Long family's guards also started to move.Zhuge Jianqiang laughed with even more contempt. You want to bully him with numbers? \"Come, come, come, this young master wants to see the power of your bullshit Dragon Guards.\"It was also at this time.Long Fei moved, he landed on the stage and pressed down on Long Shan, then turned and pointed at Zhuge Tianlong: \"Zhuge Tianlong, why did you bring a dog to the Long family?\"Zhuge Jianqiang was immediately angered, he stood up and bellowed: Long Fei, who are you calling a dog?Long Fei laughed: \"I'm talking about you, Zhuge Jianqiang.\"\"I think you're courting death!\"Zhuge Jianqiang was enraged, and leaped into the air, his body soaring as he threw a punch at Xiang Longfei, \"Fierce Tiger Roar Mountain!\"\"Roar!\"A tiger's roar sounded out.The wind from his fist was biting cold and full of strength.\"The crime of ambushing the Long family's young master is death!\"As soon as his voice faded \u2026Long Fei leaped up and similarly flew into the air. His right arm moved, \"Mountain-hit Fist!\"\"Bam!\"He threw out a punch.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for triggering the ability of the Large Power King Kong Ape!\"The trigger had a 10% chance of being triggered!\"Rumble!\"The two fists collided.\"Kacha, kacha \u2026\"Zhuge Jianqiang instantly fell to the ground as all the bones in his right arm shattered. He howled in pain like a pig being butchered, \"Ah, ah!\"Defeat in one move!The Mountain-hit Fist was the Large Power King Kong Ape's sacred art, a fifth level Heaven Stage. How could Zhuge Jianqiang withstand the energy that was used to trigger the divine ability?The instant he landed on the ground.\"Wind Shadow Step.\"Long Fei's body was like an illusion. He landed beside Zhuge Jianqiang, stepped on his chest, stared at Zhuge Tianlong, and said: \"Ambushing the Long family's young master, you deserve to die for your crimes!\"It was too fast!Incomparable dominance!Many people could not react in time.However \u2026At this moment, the disciples of the Long family fiercely released their anger.Long Shan let out a loud roar, \"Young Lord is mighty!\"Zhuge Tianlong suddenly stood up, his eyes turned sinister as he bellowed: \"Long Fei, you dare!\"Long Fei laughed: \"Your son ambushed me, or was he ambushing me in my Long family. Everyone saw that you, Old Dog Zhuge, are trying to deny it?\"Zhuge Jianqiang trembled from the pain, and scolded: \"Long Fei, you dog, you dare to touch me \u2026\"\"Pah!\"A slap fell, and directly caused Zhuge Jianqiang's eyes to shine with stars.Long Fei sneered, and said: \"Continue shouting!\"Zhuge Jianqiang's eyes were almost popping out as he stared at Long Fei, and said: \"Long Fei, my ass!\"\"Pah!\"With a backhand slap, Long Fei said: \"Keep shouting for me!\"And every time he slapped her, he would only glance at Zhuge Tianlong.The slap on Zhuge Jianqiang's face was similar to the slap on Zhuge Tianlong's face.Zhuge Tianlong released the thick battle qi from his body, he was furious and said while gnashing his teeth: \"Long Fei, don't be too arrogant.\"\"Hahaha \u2026\" Long Fei laughed loudly, and said arrogantly: \"I am just this arrogant, just this arrogant. Old dog Zhuge, if you have the guts, bite me!\"\"I want to see whether it's you or me who is faster!\"While they were talking \u2026Long Fei stepped on Zhuge Jianqiang's throat, and with just a little bit of force, he could break Zhuge Jianqiang's neck.Zhuge Jianqiang became terrified, and shouted with difficulty: \"Father, Father, save me, save me!\"Zhuge Tianlong frowned, and snorted: \"Long Fei, what do you want?\"Long Fei laughed: \"Bow to my Long family and apologize!\"Slapping the Long family's face?Could anyone slap the Long family's face?The Divine Marquis of Zhuge was arrogant?If I can make you act so arrogantly in the Long family, then what is your father doing?\"Dad, quick, save me!\" Zhuge Jianqiang's face became paler and paler. He did not have much strength to speak, and his breathing became hurried.Zhuge Jianqiang looked at Nangong Xiao.Nangong Xiao carried the tea in his hand and began to taste it, completely ignoring Zhuge Tianlong who had already walked in.It was the same for Nangong Lei and Li Chongtian.Zhuge Tianlong clenched his fists tightly, he then bowed and said faintly: \"I will bring my son to apologize to the Long family!\"\"What do you mean by bringing my son?\" Long Fei sneered, and said: \"I want your Zhuge family of the Divine Hou to apologize to the Long family!\"Zhuge Tianlong's eyes were filled with killing intent, and he shouted: \"Long Fei, don't push your luck!\"Long Fei said arrogantly: \"I am just pushing my luck too far, what can you do to me?\"Finished.Exerting force with his legs, Zhuge Jianqiang fiercely struggled.Personal apologies and family apologies are two entirely different concepts.At the same time.What Long Fei wanted was not only an apology from the Long Family that they had humiliated, but also an apology from the dead Long Family disciples in Fire Wolf Valley.\"Father... \"Father...\" Zhuge Jianqiang was no longer able to speak, and his voice was stuck in his throat.Zhuge Tianlong's only son, his precious son, had to \u2026 Zhuge Tianlong bowed again and said: \"The Zhuge family of the Divine Hou clan apologizes to your Long family.\"\"Very good!\"Long Fei's legs loosened up, and then he kicked Zhuge Jianqiang heavily, sending him flying. Long Fei stared at the sky and muttered to himself: \"Rest assured, this is only the beginning. I will take revenge for each and every one of you.\"Zhuge Tianlong immediately flew over to Zhuge Jianqiang's side and stared at his back, the killing intent in his heart had never been so strong.Long Fei stomped hard on the ground to save the Zhuge family's face!Everyone in the Long family felt their blood boiling.\"It feels so good!\"At this moment.Long Shan raised his steel spear and roared, \"The young master is mighty, the young master is mighty!\"The whole of the Long family's disciples shouted, \"Young master is mighty, young master is mighty \u2026\"Everyone cheered.Even the people from the Long family were cheering.

His eyes turned cold, but he did not leave the training field. Instead, he returned to his seat.He wanted to see what kind of waves Long Fei could create!\u2026 \u2026.After pausing for half a second, Long Zhanwu walked out facing a smile. He first gave a slight bow to Zhuge Tianlong, and said: \"Don't worry about the Divine Marquis that the Long Family has offended. After all, every family has their own savage and ignorant man.\"What did he just say?Kneeling and licking the Divine Marquis of Zhuge?Long Shan and the others were in a bad mood.It was just that \u2026Without waiting for them to speak, Long Zhanwu turned and looked at the training grounds, and said loudly: \"You all know the rules of the arena fights well, so I will not repeat them again.\"\"This year is different from previous years.\"\"Before we begin the arena battle, we will need to test your gifted vein.\"As soon as his voice faded \u2026Many people from martial-arts arena were confused.\"How come I didn't have one before?\"\"It's not good to test the gifted vein in front of outsiders right?\"\"Great Elder, are you targeting Young Master Long Fei?\"\"Right now, the entire city is saying that Young Master Long Fei has recovered the Dragon God's blood essence. The reason you tested him like this is to confirm whether he has recovered the power of a blood lineage or not, right?\"\u2026 \u2026.Discussions broke out.Long Fei's brows sank.Long Zhanwu slightly smiled: \"I am not targeting anyone, it's for the sake of better nurturing you in the future.\"\"Of course.\"\"If you reject the gifted vein test, then it's fine, but the qualification to participate in the arena competition will be cancelled automatically.\"\"Long Fei, as the young master of the Long family, you won't reject us, right?\" Long Zhanwu looked at the cold smile on Long Fei's face, and directly forced Long Fei to the edge of the cliff.The intention behind this move was extremely sinister.Long Shan said loudly, \"First Elder, you clearly knew that the Young Master's Dragon God blood essence had been extracted, but you still wanted him to test the blood lineage in front of so many people. Are you trying to humiliate the Young Master again?\"\"Exactly.\"\"If you want to test for blood lineage, you don't need to do so today.\"\"The people from the three pillars and the royal family are here, isn't testing them again just to humiliate the young master?\"Long Zhanwu simply did not pay any attention to them. He continued to look at Long Fei, a pleased cold smile hanging on his face as he said to himself: \"If there was no Dragon God blood lineage, you would have been humiliated once again, and if there was a Dragon God blood lineage, you would have died in the arena. Long Fei, no matter what choice you make, your fate would not have escaped death!\"Right now, Long Fei had no other choice.Reject, disqualify.Long Zhanwu would immediately remove him from the position of Young Master.Accepted.Long Fei was very clear in his heart that there was no Dragon God blood lineage at all. The result of the examination would only make Long Zhanwu laugh, and cause the disciples of the Long family to feel heartbroken.Let the people of three pillars and the royal family, and even the entire Fire Glass City, laugh at him.To test for blood lineage Inherent Skill was to sprinkle salt on his wounds.Long Fei clenched his fists tightly under his sleeves, and then loosened them, and said faintly: \"I accept!\"\"Crash!\"The entire audience was in an uproar.\"He actually accepted it!\" Nangong Xiao's expression shook, and revealed a sneer of contempt, \"Seems like this Long Fei isn't that great after all.\"Li Chongtian also laughed, \"Indeed, it's not much. Even such a request would be accepted, even a fool would know to reject it. this Long Zhanwu is really not bad, to actually test Long Fei's [blood lineage] Inherent skill in front of us, isn't this exposing Long Fei's [] Inherent skill right in front of our eyes? \"Nangong Lei squinted his eyes and stared at Long Fei, muttering: \"Accepted the examination, could it be that he really has recovered his Dragon God blood lineage?\"At this moment.Nangong Yan also became slightly nervous.She hoped in her heart that Long Fei would never recover his Dragon God blood lineage, definitely not.Long Shan anxiously asked, \"Young master, why do you have to accept such unreasonable requests?\"Long Zhanwu revealed a proud smile, and said: \"As expected of the Long family's young master, full of courage, it has begun.\"Not giving Long Fei the chance to regret.A space immediately opened up in the middle of the Martial Arts Practice Grounds.Detecting Black Stone moved out.Long Zhanwu immediately read out the name, \"Dragon Lin!\"Long Lin immediately walked out of the crowd and said, \"Here!\"\"Huh?\"Long Shan felt that something was wrong and loudly said, \"The points for the first round of the Dragon Forest was only 10 points. How did he enter the second round?\"Dragon Lin only had 10 points, which meant that he didn't have the qualifications to enter the second round of the arena competition.Long Zhanwu laughed: \"I forgot to tell you, he is replacing Long Hai.\"Long Shan shouted, \"I protest!\"Long Zhanwu sneered, and said: \"Who do you think you are? The protest was futile, and Long Lin will go up to inspect! \"He was the Grand Elder.Right now, he could control the entire Long family with one hand and do anything he wanted.Changing the rules of the arena and arranging for one's own disciples to enter the competition was nothing.Long Fei held onto Long Shan, shook his head, and said: \"It's useless.\"Long Shan said, \"Young Chieftain, I suspect that the sixteen arena fights are all the disciples of the Grand Elder other than you. In other words, it's too despicable of you to fight against fifteen people.\"Long Fei was mentally prepared for this outcome.No matter what.His goal today was to destroy Long Zhanwu!\"Dragon Forest, third level war spirit, Dragon Blood Activation 40 points.\"\"Long Tai, third level war spirit, Dragon Blood Activation 42 points.\"\"Long Yao, war spirit of the fourth level, Dragon Blood Activation 44 points.\"\u2026 \u2026.The sixteen disciples stepped forward one by one to examine him.Long Fei observed every single disciple very carefully. He was looking for the killer!Suddenly.\"Long Fu, war spirit of the fifth level. Dragon Blood Activation 50 points.\"Long Fei's gaze tightened, and the corner of his mouth slightly lifted, as he thought in his heart: \"I guess it's you!\"He didn't show it on the surface.\"Next, Long Fei!\"When Long Fei's name was called, the entire audience suddenly went silent.They all stretched their necks to look at him, and quite a few people in the VIP seats stood up.\"Will it recover the Dragon God's blood essence?\"\"I think he has definitely recovered. Otherwise, how could he kill a peak rank 5 beast?\"\"I think he's recovered, too.\"\u2026 \u2026.Apart from the discussions of outsiders, the disciples of the Long family were also discussing, \"Young Master must have recovered the Dragon God's blood essence, he must be a Dragon God Warrior.\"\"Young Lord, you can do it!\"\"As long as he recovers the Dragon God's blood essence and becomes a Dragon God Warrior again, he will be able to control the Long Family's army and become the Divine Dragon Marquis of the future.\"\"Definitely.\"Their hearts were filled with anticipation.He was filled with confidence.The Long family urgently needed someone to stand up for them, and more importantly, they needed their Dragon God Warriors.Hearing the discussion of the Long family disciples, Long Fei's heart sank, and he slowly walked forward.\"Activate the true breath to the center of the palm, press it onto the Black Stone, and then squeeze out a bit of blood.\"At this moment.Long Fei could only do it.The true breath was activated, and the Black Stone started to shine.His cultivation was out!The person loudly muttered: \"Long Fei, first level war spirit.\"A drop of his blood essence fell onto the Black Stone.Black Stone absorbed the blood essence, slowly... There was no reaction after half a minute.\"Dragon Blood Activation... \"Zero \u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Young master, test it again.\"To the disciples of the Long family who placed their hopes on Long Fei, it was like a bolt out of the blue.The hope in his heart instantly collapsed.What did 0 points in Dragon Blood Activation mean?This meant that not even the tiniest bit of dragon blood had been restored, and it wasn't even as talented as the most ordinary disciples of the Long family. He might not be able to recover in this lifetime.In other words, Long Fei would never be able to become a Dragon God Warrior in his entire life.Despair!Even Long Shan was a little unsteady on his feet. Looking at the calm face of Long Fei, he asked, \"How could this happen, how could this \u2026\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"Long Zhanwu started laughing crazily without restraint, without any concealment. \"Negative Activation to Dragon Blood, Negative Activation to Dragon Blood, hahaha \u2026 Long Fei, even the Long family's dogs aren't limited to Negative Activation to Dragon Blood, you don't even have one, hahaha... You still want to become a Dragon God Warrior with this kind of behavior, go eat sh * t, hahaha \u2026 \"Laugh!He smiled complacently.Long Zhanwu finally released the anger that he had suppressed in his heart during this period of time.At the time of Long Fei's test, he was also worried that Long Fei's dragon god blood essence would recover.But now he didn't have to worry at all.Long Zhanwu's disciples all loudly laughed at him.\"Dragon God Warriors?\" \"Bullshit.\"\"Long Fei, you're just a piece of trash from start to finish, hahaha \u2026\"\"Negative Activation to Dragon Blood, there's no chance at all. From what I see, you are not even a descendant of the Long Family. You must have picked up some bastard somewhere.\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"A loud taunt.They too let out a vicious breath in their hearts.Apart from them.She said with a cold and disdainful smile, \"A trash will always be a trash. Father, there's no need to continue watching.\"\"This kind of trash is not worthy to be my, Nangong Yan's, husband. He will be mocked by the entire world.\"Her eyes looked at Long Fei, her eyes filled with contempt and scorn.At this moment.At the same time, she was thinking about, how could she break the engagement with this trash?\"Haha \u2026\" It was all for nothing to worry about. \"\"As expected, Long Fei is still that trash Long Fei.\" Nangong Xiao laughed and said: \"There is no longer a need to watch the arena fights anymore.\"Li Chongtian also secretly heaved a sigh of relief and laughed: \"I had thought that Long Fei had recovered the Dragon God's blood essence, I hadn't thought that it would actually be Negative Activation to Dragon Blood.\"Zhuge Tianlong laughed coldly and said: \"There is only one possibility for this activation rate; Long Fei is a bastard child that I picked up.\"Nangong Lei also heaved a sigh of relief, revealing a faint smile.Amongst the crowd.Fu Xishan frowned, she couldn't understand either, \"Why is it like this?\"Liu Feng was even more confused, and was unable to understand Long Fei, \"If he did not recover the Dragon God's blood essence, how did he refine a true pill? And how did he refine a top grade talisman? \"\"What the hell is going on?\"It was too difficult to understand!\u2026 \u2026.Long Shan walked to Long Fei's side and anxiously asked: \"Young master, it can't be like this, testing again, maybe the test results for the Black Stone are bad.\"Long Fei shook his head and laughed, \"There's no need.\"Long Zhanwu laughed proudly: \"Long Fei, do you want to test it again? We have a lot of time, so even if you want to test us a hundred times, it won't be a problem. \"\"Hahaha... Negative Activation to Dragon Blood is really too funny, tell me, how did you still have the face to stay in the Long family? \"\"If it's me, I'll just knock my head against the wall and die.\"Long Fei frowned, his fists clenched tightly as he said: \"Long Zhanwu, your talent test is complete, can we start the competition now?\"In the Long family, Dragon Blood Activation was extremely important.It is talent.Everything.Without Dragon Blood Activation, he would be sentenced to death, and would be unable to turn over his entire body in this lifetime.To the people of the other clans, the disciples of the Long Family who did not have Dragon Blood Activation were simply trash, trash for the rest of their lives.But!Dragon God blood essence?The supreme blood lineage?To Long Fei, they were just a joke!Dragon God's blood essence was nothing.Compared to the Striking System, it was not even a fart.Long Fei was very calm, his heart was not affected at all. In the face of the surrounding ridicule, contempt, and disappointment of some people, he was unperturbed.As a living person, this kind of bearing could still be obtained. Furthermore, this allowed him to clearly see the face of many people, such as his fiancee, Nangong Yan!\"Wait and see!\" Long Fei laughed coldly in his heart.Long Zhanwu said: \"Do you really not need to go through the test again? Long Fei, you can try to test it again. Maybe you can increase the activation rate by one point this time, hahaha \u2026 \"\"Is it funny?\" The anger in Long Fei's heart roiled about.Long Zhanwu said loudly: \"Of course it's funny, don't you see how happy I am smiling?\"And then \u2026Long Zhanwu lowered his voice and said, \"A trash like you with Negative Activation to Dragon Blood dares to challenge me? You don't even have the qualifications!\"\"Look! The Zhuge family, the Li family, Prince Nan Gong, and the royal family are all laughing because of you, trash! The Long family's face has been completely thrown away by you!\"\"If I were you, I would have killed myself long ago.\"Long Fei's gaze tensed up.\"Long Fei, don't blame me for not reminding you, you are in a hurry to leave the Long family right now. When the stage starts, you will die, this is your last chance.\" Long Zhanwu looked at Long Fei with a complacent expression.In his heart, Long Fei no longer had the qualifications to fight with him.The disciples of the Long family were disappointed and dejected.It was even more impossible to control the Long family's army.Long Fei had already been kicked out of the Long family competition.What right did he have to fight him?As long as he could get rid of Long Fei and get rid of him, then he would be the Divine Dragon Marquis of the Long family, the master of the Long family!At that time...Thinking of this, Long Zhanwu started to laugh maniacally in his heart.Long Fei raised his eyes and laughed: \"Are you afraid?\"\"Afraid?\"\"What a joke, would I be afraid of a Negative Activation to Dragon Blood scandal?\" Long Zhanwu sneered, \"You're too arrogant and conceited. Since I gave you a chance to live, and you don't know how to cherish it, then \u2026\"Suddenly.Long Zhanwu's voice sank, and he shouted: \"The competition arena will now begin!\"As soon as his voice faded \u2026The entire venue quieted down.\"First round!\"\"Long Fei versus Dragon Forest!\"\"Disciples, please step forward!\"Long Lin jumped onto the stage with a disdainful sneer on his face, and said: \"Long Fei, step on stage and die!\"At this moment.Only Long Shan and a few guards were by Long Fei's side. \"Young master, the Dragon Forest is at the level of Level Three war spirit, you must be careful!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Naturally, Long Zhanwu would not lose out to him, and his status in the Long family would also rise in the future.When he thought about this, Long Tian's heart was elated. An even more pleased cold smile surfaced on his face, and he said: \"Long Fei, if you're afraid, kneel down and kowtow and beg for mercy, this daddy will happily spare your pathetic life, hahaha \u2026\"The corner of Long Fei's mouth curved up as he sneered.Slowly walking onto the stage, Long Fei said slightly: \"I'll give you a chance. As long as you scold Long Zhanwu as an old dog, I'll spare your life.\"Long Lin's face turned sinister, his hands formed claws, and shouted, \"Long Fei, insult the Great Clan Elder, today you're dead!\"Two claws struck.The aura of a third level war spirit was released.whoosh whoosh whoosh \u2026 *A few scratches appeared in the air and directly attacked Long Fei's throat.Long Fei stood in place without moving an inch.\"What happened to him?\"\"Has he gone mad?\"\"Young master, be careful.\"\"He must have been scared silly. No matter how strong a level one war spirit is, it's impossible for a level three war spirit to be a match, not to mention that Long Fei is even a waste of Negative Activation to Dragon Blood.\"\u2026 \u2026.In everyone's hearts, Long Fei was bound to lose.There was no suspense at all.However.Just as Long Lin's right hand was about to lock onto Long Fei's throat, Long Fei raised both his eyes slightly, moved his right arm, and ordered, \"Mountain-hit Fist!\"\"Bam!\"He punched out.It was like a mountain had been split open.A dull power was released, and a fist smashed onto Long Lin's right claw.\"Crack!\"The joints were broken and turned into powder.Long Lin gave a pitiful cry as he hastily retreated.\"Wind Shadow Step!\"\"Whoosh!\"His body moved, instantly appearing behind Long Lin, the corner of his mouth raised, revealing the smile of a god of death, he cupped his fists, and suddenly jumped up, \"Mountain-hit Fist!\"He leapt into the air like a Large Power King Kong Ape possessed.The posture was exactly the same as the Large Power King Kong Ape.Hugging his fists, he smashed them down heavily.It crashed onto the top of Long Lin's head.\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"There was a silent explosion of force in the air, like the explosion of a building.Dragon Lin's head split open, all the bones in his body fractured, blood spewed out and he fell to the ground, dead.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing 'Dragon Forest' for obtaining 800 experience, 80 true breath and 10 Energy Values.\"The system beep rang.Long Fei kicked Long Lin's corpse flying, then walked to the center of the stage and coldly stared at Long Zhanwu, and said: \"Again!\"Long Zhanwu was unable to react in time.Not just him.There were a few people who did not react in time.The level three war spirit, Long Lin, died just like that?It was too fast!There was simply no reaction at all. How did Long Fei actually kill him?Two punches?Just what kind of cultivation technique could have such powerful strength? How did a first level war spirit kill a third level war spirit?Confusion!Shock!\"Too powerful!\" The fire in Long Shan's heart started burning up once again. He shouted out excitedly, \"Young Master is mighty.\"The three pillars and the royal family were also shocked.Nangong Xiao asked with doubt: \"How did Long Lin die?\"Zhuge Tianlong muttered: \"Mysterious steps, quick movements, coupled with his probably Earth Stage or higher cultivation technique, the power unleashed killed Long Lin.\"Li Chongtian also said in shock, \"I never thought that Long Fei would actually have such explosive strength.\"\u2026 \u2026.Amongst the crowd.Liu Feng muttered to himself. \"Wind Shadow Step, this \u2026 This \u2026 Wasn't this the martial skill from the previous auction? How can he be so fast? \"\"What cultivation technique is this?\" Fu Xishan asked.Liu Feng said honestly: \"Last auction, there was a set of martial skill steps that was not appraised, and then Long Fei bought it. Miss, what rank do you think was the martial skill he used?\"Fu Xishan slightly said: \"It's at least an Earth Stage Level 8 cultivation technique.\"\"My god!\"\"He only spent one million to buy an Earth Grade Eight martial skill \u2026\" Liu Feng said as his liver trembled, \"Coincidence, it must be a coincidence.\"\u2026 \u2026.Long Zhanwu was secretly shocked, but... He was not worried at all, he did not hold hope for the third stage war spirit's Long Lin. Looking at Long Fei who was still standing on the stage, he asked suspiciously, \"What did you say just now?\"Long Fei laughed: \"Long Zhanwu, didn't you just want to kill me?\"\"Come!\"\"There are still fourteen more, let them come!\"Long Zhanwu was still a little confused, he asked: \"Are you saying that you want to challenge all the remaining participants?\"Long Fei laughed: \"This will save the trouble!\"As soon as he finished speaking!The entire arena was shocked.\"Is he crazy?\"\"Aren't you being too arrogant?\"\"Young master, don't mess around.\"\"Hahaha... You are so arrogant after killing a mere Level 3 war spirit, do you really think you are a Dragon God Warrior? \"\u2026 \u2026.Shock!Long Fei was stupid?A challenger with a cultivation of war spirit of the first rank challenging fourteen people, he is courting death.Nangong Yan disdainfully said: \"He's so arrogant just by killing a dragon forest. If not, wouldn't he be called trash? In my opinion, he's not even trash.\"\"Dad, no matter what, I won't marry someone like him.\"Nangong Yan looked down on Long Fei with all his might.From her point of view, Long Fei's actions were simply courting death!Nangong Xiao laughed: \"Little Sister Yan, don't worry, he will die on the stage soon, he won't have a life to marry you!\"Arrogant.Too arrogant!However, Long Zhanwu began to laugh, and said: \"Alright, this is your own choice, so you can't blame me for it.\"As soon as the words left his mouth.\"Next, I'll do it!\"A silhouette suddenly moved and jumped onto the arena.But!Without waiting for him to land on the ground, Long Fei moved his Wind Shadow Step and kicked out.\"Bam!\"That person was kicked and sent flying more than ten meters away. He was hanging on the roof as blood spewed out of his mouth. His body twitched a few times before he died.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' \u2026\"The system beep sounded again.Long Fei's gaze did not move at all, \"Who's next?\"\"I'll do it!\"This time, the disciple was smarter. He didn't fly up onto the stage and instead walked step by step onto it.It was also at this time.\"Level 4 war spirit?\"Long Fei made a weird noise in his throat as he activated the power of the Toading Skill.Dragon Temple coldly snorted, \"Trash...\"Before he could even finish his second word, Long Fei suddenly appeared in front of him.\"Bam!\"It landed directly on the Dragon Temple's two ears.\"Bam!\"\"Pfft \u2026\"Blood spurted out from his mouth as his body slowly fell to the ground.Long Fei kicked him and sent him flying, yelling arrogantly, \"Continue!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then what's the difference between this and an idiot?After killing three people consecutively, Long Zhanwu was so angry that his beard and eyes were popping out, as he shouted solemnly: \"All of you go, kill him!\"Give the order.The eleven Long Clan disciples rushed to the arena together.Except for Long Fu, who was hiding in the crowd, he did not move.And Long Fei's gaze was also constantly watching him.whoosh whoosh whoosh \u2026 *The eleven disciples of the Long family quickly surrounded Long Fei, \"Brat, you asked for it.\"\"No shit, kill him.\"\"Let's go together, I really want to see just how strong he is, a waste of Negative Activation to Dragon Blood.\"\u2026 \u2026.In that instant.The 11 of them started to move, all of them were at least war spirit level 4, releasing their battle qi to form a pressure that could crush Xiang Longfei.The four disciples all took out their weapons and attacked Xiang Longfei.\"He's too arrogant. I've never seen such an arrogant person before.\"\"He's simply courting death.\"\"He doesn't know how to hide himself at all, but with this kind of personality, he won't be able to live for long.\"\u2026 \u2026.Nangong Xiao laughed coldly, \"I had thought that brat was smart, but it turns out he was just a fool.\"Li Chongtian also laughed: \"Your Highness is right, Long Fei is overestimating himself. A level one war spirit challenging eleven experts, he thought he was just playing around.\"Nangong Lei did not speak, but Nangong Yan laughed disdainfully: \"It's best if he dies, if he dies, then the marriage contract bestowed upon him by Imperial Uncle will become void of its own accord, and I don't have to bother with this piece of trash anymore.\"Zhuge Jianqiang clenched his swollen mouth and said fiercely: \"Go and die quickly.\"\u2026 \u2026.No one favored Long Fei.Because \u2026Long Fei was really too arrogant.Even some of the elders of the Long family shook their heads and sighed. Long Shan and the others could only bitterly smile. This young master was too impulsive.A pleased sneer surfaced on Long Zhanwu's face, \"Long Fei, you're too arrogant. This is perfect, I don't need to use killers to deal with you.\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"A wild and complacent laugh came out from Long Zhanwu's mouth.In the arena.Long Fei was forced to retreat, unable to withstand the waves of attacks.The moment the disciples of the Long family attacked, they immediately retreated, and the attacks from behind went to the street, not giving Long Fei any time to catch his breath.The application of the war of attrition was extremely thorough.Long Fei had already been forced to the edge of the stage. He frowned and sneered: \"I've really underestimated you underlings of Long Zhanwu.\"Suddenly.A figure was sent flying.\"Long Fei, go and die!\"The blade came slashing down.At the same time, the eight people facing Long Fei made their moves at the same time, sealing off all of Long Fei's escape routes.At this moment.Long Fei was unable to defend against the attacks of the eight people even if he blocked the attacks from the top of his head. The other two people continued to use their battle qi to crush Long Fei, causing his mind to be in a state of chaos.Dead!He was in dire straits.\"Hahaha... Long Fei, you're dead for sure. \"\"There's no retreat.\"\"He's too arrogant. He's dead for sure.\"\u2026 \u2026.Nangong Yan was even more so happy and started laughing, \"It's good that you're dead, it's good that you're dead, hehehe \u2026\"Nangong Lei slightly said: \"There's no way to defend!\"\"Defense?!\"The corner of Long Fei's mouth drew back, revealing a cold smile, \"An attack is the best defense!\"As soon as he finished.\"Top quality Sword Teeth Tiger Spell Note, go!\"A talisman shot out, straight towards the disciple in the air.In the midst of the lightning.\"dragon salyer technique!\"A new set of Large Power King Kong Ape's ribs appeared in Long Fei's hand.

It was directly released, the blade qi shot out in the shape of a half moon.\"Roar...\" A furious voice of a Large Power King Kong Ape sounded.Eight moves in a single strike!The eight of them were directly sent flying.The might of a Divine Rank martial skill was extraordinary.Adding on the powerful strength of the Large Power King Kong Ape, it was extremely brutal within the blade energy.The eight of them were overturned.\"Tiny Rippling Steps!\"Activating true breath, his speed was raised to the limit.He put away the blade.\"Open the skin!\"\"Crack!\"\"Ahh \u2026\"A person's body was split in half, and he died instantly.\"Ding!\"The system sounded out!\"Tendon Break!\"\"Crunch.\"\"Ding!\"Instant kill!\"Break the bones.\"\"Crack!\"\u2026 \u2026.One slash, one kill, almost in a second.

What just happened?What had happened?An illusion, this was definitely an illusion!\"This is impossible!\"Those people who had mocked that Long Fei would die, especially Nangong Yan, who looked as if he had been ruthlessly slapped twice by someone, all turned green and flushed red; his expression was exceptionally unsightly.It was the same for the people from the Three Heavens Pillars.Long Zhanwu had an even more foolish expression on his face. Seeing his own disciple being killed by Long Fei in an instant like how a radish cabbage was killed by a single slash from Long Fei, he could not believe the reality in front of his eyes.No matter how strong a level one war spirit was, it couldn't be this strong.What was going on?What kind of saber technique was he training in?Too powerful.What had happened in the short span of half a year?Long Zhanwu's heart was in a mess, this was the first time he was in a panic!From the beginning till the end, he had never placed Long Fei in his eyes, but now, he looked at Long Fei with contempt. He felt a chill in his heart.After killing the eight people, Long Fei's entire body was already drenched in blood. Staring at the remaining two, the corners of his mouth drew back, revealing his bloody teeth as he laughed sinisterly.\"Plop!\"\"Plop!\"The two of them knelt down immediately, trembling in fear, and said immediately: \"Long Fei, don't, don't, don't kill me.\"\"Long Zhanwu is an old dog.\"\"Long Zhanwu will die a horrible death.\"\"Long Zhanwu is being suppressed.\"\"Long Fei, I've said it, I've scolded Long Zhanwu, I beg you to spare my life \u2026 \u2026\"Not waiting for them to finish.Long Fei hacked down with his blade, and said with a deep voice: \"This old one hates people who use pressure to crush me the most, do you think that your realm is amazing? \"F * ck!\"One hit two, instant kill!\"Ding!\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing \u2026\"Two notifications sounded.Long Fei pointed his bone blade straight at Long Zhanwu's face, his entire body releasing his Spirit Qi, he bellowed: Damn it, who else is there?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So what if the Pubes is broken? So what if your tendons and veins are in a state of depression? \"\"Mocking that your father is trash?\"\"You two are worthy of that?!\"\"Huh?\"Once again, he roared out in rage, venting the anger in his heart.He was displeased from the moment he tested Long Fei's Dragon Blood Activation, and suppressed a ball of fury in his heart. Facing the mockery of the three pillars and the Imperial Family, and facing the disappointment of the Long Family members, he was even more displeased.At that time, he had hidden his strength, precisely because he wanted to tell the Long Family's disciples that Dragon Blood Activation could not represent everything.Pubes cannot represent everything.It was impossible for his tendons to be blocked!He wanted to tell everyone that the Long family would never give in to any difficulties!The entire hall was silent.Everyone was staring at Long Fei who was on the stage. At this moment, the Long family's unity once again gathered together, with Long Fei as the core.At this moment.Nearly everyone in the Long family recognized Young Master Long Fei's position, and everyone started to worship him.Because \u2026He had created a miracle!Because his name was Long Fei, the young master of the Long family!Suddenly.Long Zhanwu said coldly: \"Long Fei, don't get cocky too early!\"As soon as he finished.Long Zhanwu bellowed, \"Long Fu, kill him, kill him!\"In the blink of an eye.A demonic shadow rushed out from the crowd and released the Conical Shadow Technique from his palms.At this moment.Long Fei laughed coldly in a complacent manner, \"I've been waiting for you for such a long time, you've finally made your move!\"He had been paying attention to Long Fu from the beginning.From the moment of his examination, Long Fei had already guessed that he was the assassin hidden amongst the Long family disciples. After killing the fourteen Long family disciples, Long Fei was even more certain in his heart.At the same time.He also believed what the female assassin said.I didn't lie to him!The ball of black shadows trembled. It was obviously him who had ambushed Long Fei, but he was still \u2026 An ominous feeling rose in his heart, as if he had fallen into Long Fei's trap.He was a killer.A killer with a keen sense of smell.His years of killing experience had taught him that only by saving his life could he complete the mission!The machine broke down.He suddenly turned around and charged in another direction.However...Long Fei laughed coldly: \"Too late!\"The blade aura accumulated from the seven moves of the dragon salyer technique suddenly moved. From the moment he attacked, he had been accumulating blade aura, with the aim of dealing with Long Fu!\"dragon chop!\"\"Ding!\"\"Triggering the Spatial Ring's Luck attribute will increase the damage of the dragon chop by 100%.\"\"Huh?\"\"Then your fate is really bad.\" Long Fei was secretly shocked, he did not expect to trigger the luck attribute, clenching his teeth, he roared fiercely.\"One hundred and fifty slashes!\"\"Boom!\"Long Fei held onto the blade with both of his hands as the true breath surged.

Immediately following that, the 149 layers of blade energy slashed down in an instant.whoosh whoosh whoosh \u2026 *whoosh whoosh whoosh \u2026 *The saber Qi slashed crazily on Long Fu's body like a knife cutting through butter. In a split-second, Long Fu's body was completely shattered. A torrential rain of blood spurted out from his body.The surrounding people looked up at the sky.He could feel the destructive power of the saber.Each one of them was completely crushed by this saber energy and could not move at all.\"Bam!\"The assassin's body split apart.It was chopped into pieces.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing 'Long Fu' for obtaining 150,000 experience, 1000 true breath and 10 Energy Values.\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for obtaining 'twenty million' silver notes.\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for obtaining 'hells magic'.

This was a thick defensive Qi, and the Battle Dragon Armor was too cool.The two dragons were coiled on his back, like wings.He was a complete mess.Of course.Only Long Fei himself could see.At this moment.Long Shan shouted hysterically, \"Young Lord, mighty Young Lord, domineering Young Lord, long live the Young Lord!\"\"The Young Lord is mighty, the Young Lord is domineering, Long live the Young Lord!\"At the same time.The entire Long family's disciples roared.\"The Young Lord is mighty, the Young Lord is domineering, Long live the Young Lord!\"Too cool!He was so handsome that he dropped to the ground.Who still mocked Long Fei as a trash?Who else would dare?At the same time, the doors to the two secret chambers of the Long family opened.\u2026 \u2026.Long Fei stared coldly at Long Zhanwu, and said: \"You spent 50 million to hire a killer to kill me. In Fire Wolf Valley, the Long Fu that died just now, you are truly vicious, I am your nephew, yet you hired a killer to assassinate me, how did I offend you?\"\"Did I fuck your wife or your daughter? You want to do this to me? \"Long Zhanwu was so angry that his entire body was trembling, his teeth chattered loudly, and he roared loudly, \"Long Fei!\"\"Why are you calling me daddy?\" Long Fei heaved a heavy sigh, and said word by word, \"Since...\"\"You want to kill me!\"\"Alright then!\"\"Long Zhanwu, today, right now, I, Long Fei, will challenge you!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

To challenge the war chief \u2026 It's simply impossible. \"\"Young master, don't be rash, don't be rash.\"\u2026 \u2026.It exploded in the entire martial-arts arena.Who would have thought that Long Fei would actually want to challenge Long Zhanwu!\"Hahaha... \"Hahaha...\" Long Zhanwu laughed, and laughed sinisterly, \"Challenge me? Long Fei, you're the one who is courting death, so don't blame me for this. \"He was just worrying that he could not find a chance to get rid of Long Fei, he did not expect to actually challenge him without knowing his own capabilities, this is simply asking the heavens to help me.Moreover.This was a challenge that Long Fei had initiated, so he could only blame himself for killing it.\"No way!\"Long Shan immediately rushed to the arena and said, \"Great Elder, what Young Lord said just now was a joke, it doesn't count!\"And then \u2026Long Shan pulled Long Fei and was about to leave the stage, saying in a low voice: \"Young Master, Long Zhanwu's cultivation is too terrifying, you cannot be his opponent.\"Not waiting for him to finish.\"Weng \u2026\"A burst of Qi burst out from Long Zhanwu's body, forming a powerful battle qi attack, directly smashing onto Long Shan's back, he coldly snorted and said: \"Who do you think you are? Get out of my way. \"\"Bam!\"Long Shan could not defend against the impact of the war chief realm at all and was sent flying. After flying for more than ten meters, he heavily crashed into the ground and spat out a mouthful of blood. His face immediately turned pale white.\"What a powerful battle qi.\"\"Long Zhanwu is a strong warrior at the peak of the Long family.\"\"The war chief realm is extremely powerful, especially the control of battle qi which is not something that the war spirit can withstand.\"\"This time, Long Fei is going to suffer.\"\u2026 \u2026.With one move, Long Zhanwu sent Long Shan flying. The strong battle qi made people feel fear.Long Fei's heart sank, and thought to himself: What a powerful strength, looks like I've underestimated Long Zhanwu.Long Fei's figure moved.He landed beside Long Shan and asked him to consume a Highest Grade Medicine Powder, then looked at Long Zhanwu who was already standing on the stage.Long Shan pulled on Long Fei's clothes and said, \"Young Master, don't fight with him. Please don't.\"\"Long Fei, come up and die.\" Long Zhanwu said arrogantly, \"The challenge was made by you. If I don't teach this bastard a lesson today, I, Long Zhanwu, will write backwards.\"He had to kill Long Fei.Today, Long Fei had greatly damaged his power. If he did not get rid of Long Fei, it would become a huge problem in the future.Moreover.Long Fei was very popular now, once he had won over the hearts of the Long family's disciples, he would definitely be trapped in the Long family.If Long Fei didn't die, then he wouldn't be able to become the Long family's patriarch.In any case.Even Long Fei had to die!His potential was too great. If he had more time, he might not even be able to suppress him.Long Shan did his best to pull Long Fei back, and said: \"Young Master, you can't go ah.\"The other disciples of the Long family did the same, \"Young master, you can't fight with him.\"\"Young master, don't be rash.\"\"Young master, please listen to us.\"\u2026 \u2026.Long Zhanwu's strength was too terrifying.How could the realm of war spirit be a match for the war chief realm?It was also at this moment.Nangong Yan suddenly sneered, and said disdainfully: \"You don't keep your words, so what kind of man are you acting like? Long Fei, you really make me look down on you. \"Zhuge Jianqiang mocked: \"Princess, I never thought that your fiance would be this kind of trash, it really broadens my horizons.\"Nangong Xiao also laughed: \"You are afraid of death, this is the nature of humans, the people from the Long family are the same.\"Li Chongtian said: \"I thought he was different, but he's actually such a cowardly person. It's just that everyone in the Fire Glass City knows what we said just now, and even if we don't keep our promises, the young master of the Long family has his principles. Hahaha \u2026\"The power Long Fei released was too strong!Even his Negative Activation to Dragon Blood made them feel that he was a threat, even more so than that genius Long Fei.They all felt fear in their hearts.At the same time.They couldn't wait for Long Fei to die.Especially Nangong Yan, she had been very clear about what she had done this past year. She definitely could not turn back, and since she could not, she would ruthlessly trample Long Fei to death.Stepping on Long Fei, her sense of superiority was even more obvious, and even more so, her nobility!\"What a great method of provocation.\" Long Fei slowly walked out from the crowd, his gaze fixed on three pillars and the rest as he sneered: \"Didn't you guys just want to see me die?\"Nangong Yan slightly said: \"The challenge was made by you. I don't want my future husband to be someone who goes back on his words.\"\"If you have the guts to say it, then you have the ability to do it.\"Long Fei looked at Nangong Yan.Indeed.Nangong Yan was very beautiful, no matter if it was her appearance, body, or even her voice, she could not help but be intoxicated by it.However \u2026Her heart was even more venomous than snakes and scorpions.The corners of Long Fei's mouth turned cold as he smiled: \"Don't worry, I will definitely do as I say. Little Yan, our wedding will be in three years. At that time, I will definitely cherish you well.\"revealed an evil and cold smile when he said the word 'cherish'. Everyone knew what the two words' cherish 'meant.Nangong Yan's eyes tensed up, her fists clenched, her face filled with anger, but she could not release it, and roared out in her heart: \"Long Fei, you are just a waste with Negative Activation to Dragon Blood, how could you possibly have me? Dream on, it's impossible to do it in this lifetime. \"\"I want to end the engagement, I want to end it!\"As the wedding day got closer and closer, she longed for Long Fei to die as soon as possible.Nangong Lei lightly coughed, and said with a low voice: \"Yan'er, restrain yourself!\"He couldn't explode in front of so many people.And then \u2026Nangong Lei smiled faintly, and said. \"Long Fei, there's still three years of time, you can do it.\"\"Right!\"\"Don't tell me you want to avoid Clan Elder Long Zhanwu's challenge? If you want to avoid it, I, Nangong Lei, will definitely do everything I can to protect you. \"\"But... Yan'er has always liked strong people since she was young. I'm afraid she would hate you if you were to act like this. \"His words still angered Long Fei.In their eyes, Long Fei was just a sixteen year old youngster. He was hot-blooded, young, and arrogant.Long Fei laughed: \"Father, don't worry. I said that I will definitely challenge Long Zhanwu, so I hope that your three pillars and the royal family can take a good look. I, Long Fei, have returned, from today onwards, if anyone in the Fire Glass Dynasty dares to harm the Long family, hehe \u2026\" Suddenly, Long Fei roared fiercely, \"I, Long Fei, will definitely tear him into ten thousand pieces and destroy the clan he belongs to!\"While they were talking \u2026Long Fei's body released a dense killing intent.It was also at this time, Long Fei leaped fiercely, and landed heavily on the stage. He stared at Long Zhanwu, and said: \"It's exactly because the Long family has people like to fight amongst themselves that they became like this, and is why they were looked down upon. Is it possible that you, the Patriarch of the Long family, are also worthy to be the Marquis of God Dragon?\"The muscles at the corner of Long Zhanwu's eyes trembled, the killing intent in his eyes was extremely strong. He suddenly released the war chief's battle energy, his fists shook, and he punched Xiang Longfei.Long Fei was in no hurry, as a talisman landed between his fingers, \"Flood Dragon Long Fei's Heavenly Talisman, go \u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

'Flood Dragon Long Fei's Heavenly Talisman.Instant kill of all experts below the fifth stage of war chief.There was no suspense.But Long Zhanwu was at the seventh level of war chief, not one that he could instantly kill.However!Even if the Flood Dragon Long Fei's Heavenly Talisman could not kill him instantly, it would still be able to harm him.A talisman exploded in mid air, and immediately, the roar of a Flood Dragon sounded. A Flood Dragon rushed out of the talisman, and directly wrapped itself around Long Zhanwu, biting down with its bloody mouth wide open.\"Dragon?\"\"Is that the same sound as last time's Dragon Roar?\"\"No, that's not a dragon. It's a flood dragon.\"\"This talisman \u2026.\" \"The power is simply too great.\"\"How could he have such a powerful talisman?\"\u2026 \u2026.The crowd was shocked.The three sisters of the Heaven Sect who were at the corner of the training grounds all this time became extremely excited, Xiao Tiantian fiercely shouted: \"Kill him, hmph!\"Ye Ziyan also followed: \"These people are looking forward to Long Fei's death, it's too hateful, especially that Nangong Yan, he looks like he deserves a beating, it makes me unhappy.\"Liu Luoxi, on the other hand, looked at the Flood Dragon's Talisman, and was incomparably shocked in his heart.Not all demon beasts' blood essence could be assimilated into talismans.Not to mention being able to refine top-grade talismans.To Liu Luoxi, Long Fei was just too strong.\u2026 \u2026.In the arena.Long Zhanwu was also caught off guard, he never thought that Long Fei would actually have such a powerful talisman, however... After all, he was an expert of the war chief realm.A few seconds later.Long Zhanwu bellowed: \"Dragon Break!\"\"Hah!\"With a leap, he flew into the air and punched towards the dragon. He sneered: \"Long Fei, have you forgotten that our ancestor of the Long family was able to kill the Dragon God? Our Long family's blood contains Dragon Blood Essence, what can a mere dragon do to me?\"\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"\"Awoooo \u2026\"The dragon let out a blood-curdling screech. The shadow slowly dissipated, until it completely disappeared.The Long family was a dragon-slaying family.After so many years, the blood essence within his body hadn't changed at all.The Dragon Break was a martial skill that had been developed by even Giant Dragons, it could be broken with a single move.Long Fei did not expect this.The instant the Flood Dragon's Talisman was broken, Long Zhanwu didn't stop at all. His figure was like lightning, his two fists charged, and with a heavy roar, he shouted, \"Dragon Break!\"\"Second move, Descending Dragon for Life!\"whoosh whoosh \u2026 *The battle qi wreaked havoc, the wind of his fists were like thunder, and Long Zhanwu's aura seemed to be able to suppress Xiang Longfei like mountains and overturn seas.It was too fast!The difference in levels was simply too great.Long Fei kept locking onto Long Zhanwu's position, but... He was completely unable to keep up with Long Zhanwu's speed, and Long Zhanwu's speed had completely exceeded what he could endure.Level!Level!This was the difference in levels!At this moment.Liu Luoxi was about to rush out.Xiao Tiantian shouted loudly, \"Long Fei, be careful!\"Ye Ziyan's heart clenched, her eyes tightly shut, not daring to look any further.\"Break!\"Long Zhanwu roared angrily as both his fists moved like thunder, heavily smashing onto Long Fei's chest.Long Fei moved, \"King Kong Shield!\"\"Buzz!\"\"Rumble \u2026\"The battle dragon aura on the Battle Dragon Armor released a dense defense, while the King Kong Shield s blocked half of Long Zhanwu's attacks. Even so, Long Fei was still sent flying.\"Bam!\"After smashing onto the ground, Long Fei spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, and then, with another heavy smack, he stood up with a leap.Long Zhanwu trembled slightly, \"He actually didn't die?\"\"You have an armor-type spiritual treasure on you?\"\"That must be it!\"Long Zhanwu believed in his own strength. Anyone in the war spirit realm would not be able to withstand it, and not only was Long Fei able to withstand it, he also could only spit out a mouthful of blood.Then there was only one reason: he had a treasure armor on him.As soon as the voice fell, everyone was shocked. Armor Spirit Treasures were extremely difficult to come by. Even yellow-rank Armor Spirit Treasures were priced at over ten million.\"Huff \u2026\"Long Fei heaved a sigh of relief, controlled his aura, and raised his head to swallow a healing pellet. At the same time, he also swallowed a true pill.At the same time.He checked the properties.\"I only have one thousand five hundred true breath left.\" Long Fei raised his eyes, stared at Long Zhanwu, his mouth twitched, and sneered: \"Fifteen seconds!\"\"Huh?\"Long Zhanwu was startled, and said: \"What fifteen seconds?\"Long Fei laughed coldly: \"You still have fifteen seconds to live.\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"Long Fei, there must be a limit to your arrogance. Long Zhanwu laughed out loud, \"Even if you have the Armoured Spirit Treasure, so what?\"Dragon Break!\"\"Third move, Dragon Subduing Soul Annihilation!\"He took a step forward.The battle energy on Long Zhanwu's body released a heavy rumbling sound, and like a dragon's roar, his body moved like lightning, with one step rushing towards Xiang Longfei.It was too fast!It was better to look at the source!However \u2026Long Fei grinned: \"Wushuang!\"\"Open!\"\"Weng \u2026\"The resonance of energy within his body sounded out, and soon, his body was on the verge of collapsing as he released his attribute power.Unrivaled open \u2026The true breath consumed 100 points per second.At this moment.The aura around Long Fei's body abruptly changed. Clenching both of his fists tightly, his strength seemed to have substance as he was firmly grasped within his hands.At this moment.Long Fei was completely different.Strength, agility, attack, all attributes were doubled.At first, he could not see Long Zhanwu's movement trajectory clearly, but now, all of their gazes were fixated on him.\"Boom!\" The sound of strength clashing resounded. Long Fei laughed out wildly, \"Awesome!\"Immediately.His right arm moved as he gathered his strength, \"Mountain-hit Fist!\"\"Bam!\"With a leap, he collided head-on with Long Zhanwu.Punch against punch!\"Rumble \u2026\"Energy shot in all directions, causing Long Zhanwu to be sent flying.Long Fei was the same.Long Zhanwu's eyes turned sinister as he roared in anger, \"Dragon Break, fourth move!\"Long Fei was also displeased, as he shouted in a low voice: \"Mountain-hit Fist, again!\"\"Bam!\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for triggering 'Large Power King Kong Ape's power', your strength has increased by 200%!\"This was the attribute of luck.The veins on Long Fei's right fist bulged, his fist sliced through the air, and once again smashed forward.\"Bam!\"\"Rumble \u2026\"\"Crack!\"The joints of Long Zhanwu's fist had completely shattered, and his entire arm was going numb. This time, he was sent flying backwards, with shock in both his eyes, \"Impossible, absolutely impossible \u2026\"\"You're not Long Fei, so you wouldn't have such a powerful strength.\"At this moment.\"Tiny Rippling Steps!\"\"Shua!\"Long Fei glided forward, and before Long Zhanwu could fall, both his fists punched out once again.\"Bang, bang!\"Long Zhanwu was struck and blown into the air. Long Fei leapt high into the air, arrived at the point where he was about to land, bent his knees, and smashed down with a heavy blow.\"Bam!\"Their auras were like a rainbow.The heavy blow directly caused the enormous arena to collapse.Long Zhanwu was on the verge of death in the ruins.At this moment.\"Ding!\"\"The true breath is insufficient. The peerless attribute has disappeared.\"Long Fei's body regained his normal aura, and he stepped on Long Zhanwu's head, \"framing laozi again.\"\"You dare be so arrogant for laozi!\"Long Zhanwu laughed madly, and said: \"Long Fei, your aura has recovered, do you think you can kill this daddy just by relying on your current state?\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"Trash from the Negative Activation to Dragon Blood, how could you possibly kill me?\"\"Your father wasn't worthy of that year!\"At this moment.Long Fei clenched his teeth, opened his right hand, and sneered: \"Indeed, I cannot kill you in my current state, but...

Long Zhanwu's eyes nearly bulged out as he said, \"Impossible, impossible, absolutely impossible. The dragon salyer disappeared for several thousand years, you can't find it, no, no, absolutely impossible \u2026\"Unbelievable.What did dragon salyer mean?The Long family's Supreme Elder!It was above the Grand Elder.Once the dragon salyer appeared, who dared to disobey?It was the supreme existence of the Long family, a supreme faith, and also the spiritual refuge of the Long family.At this moment.Everyone in the Long family fell silent.three pillars and Nangong Xiao stood up abruptly. Their eyes were filled with shock, jealousy, and hatred that could not be hidden.Long Fei clenched both his hands, the dragon salyer raised above his head, and growled: \"Did he kill you?\"\"No!\"Long Fei, you can't kill me! I'm your uncle, I'm the Great Clan Elder, you can't kill me, you don't have the qualifications to kill me \u2026 Long Zhanwu's voice trembled, he had never been as afraid as he was now. Under the dragon salyer, even his soul was trembling.At this moment.Long Fei hacked down with his blade, \"I'll let you know what qualifications are, die!\"\"Hua!\"With a slash of his blade, the dragon salyer let out a dragon slaying roar.\"Roar \u2026\"\"Ahh \u2026\"Long Zhanwu's body was split into two, his entire being was instantly killed, not even a trace of blood could be seen on the dragon salyer.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing 'Long Zhanwu' for obtaining 250,000 experience, 3,000 true breath and 10 Energy Values.\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for obtaining 'Dragon Break'.

With great force, he carried the dragon salyer on his shoulders and asked solemnly: \"Who else?\"\"Who still refuses to accept this?\"\"Come on up!\"Overbearing and matchless!His eyes were like torches, the tyrannical aura on his body combined with the dragon salyer on his shoulders, his entire being was extremely eye-catching.It crushed the entire martial arts training field.It was also at this time.Long Zhanye suddenly shouted, \"Where is the Law Enforcement Hall!\"\"Hah!\"Long Zhanye's eyes were bloodshot as he stared at Long Fei who was on the stage, and shouted: \"Killing the disciples of the Long family and killing the great clan elder of the Long family, Long Fei, you are a homicidal maniac, you are not worthy of being a member of the Long family, go all out and take your place!\"The Law Enforcement Hall was Long Zhanye's power.They all obeyed his orders. Although they were a little hesitant in their hearts, they still all rushed up and quickly surrounded the arena.The long spear moved, shouting in unison, \"KILL!\"\"Kill!\"At the same time.Long Shan raised his arms and asked, \"Where are the Long family's imperial guards?\"\"Hah!\"Half of the Long Family's martial-arts arena s all shouted in unison.Long Shan shouted, \"Protect the Young Lord!\"Next.The disciples of the Long family quickly surrounded the Law Enforcement Hall. There were at least three times more people than Law Enforcement Hall.At this moment.Zhuge Tianlong laughed coldly, then said: \"General Li, Prince Nan Gong, Prince of Nan Gong, this is a good opportunity, they will fight later, and once they do \u2026.\"Li Chongtian sneered: \"Brother Zhuge is thinking the same thing as me, it all depends on Prince Nan Gong now.\"Nangong Lei did not speak. Nangong Yan said coldly: \"Kill!\"Nangong Xiao smiled slightly and said: \"This prince will not participate, but the things that have happened today will definitely not be spread out. Those outside will only know that Long Fei has been killed by the Law Enforcement Hall.\"\"Hehehe \u2026\"Zhuge Tianlong laughed: \"Although this child does not have the Dragon God's blood essence, the speed at which he grows up is too fast. He actually found the supreme artifact of the Long family.\"This kid must not be allowed to live!\"Killing intent rose in his heart!They understood Long Fei's threat very well.Compared to the Dragon God Warriors of the past, it was even more dangerous.The most crucial point was that once Long Zhanwu died, Long Fei would have full control of the Long family. With the dragon salyer at his command, he would be able to control the Long family's army, and the Long family would definitely unite under his lead.They all understood in their hearts!Long Fei cannot stay!Right now, as long as this battle royale had begun, they would immediately use their full power to kill Long Fei, so as to eliminate any future troubles.All of a sudden.The atmosphere in the martial-arts arena was tense and no one dared to act rashly.In the corner.Xiao Tiantian could not hold it in and immediately rushed out. His body moved, landing on the ruined stage, and shouted: \"If anyone dares to touch this bastard, I, Xiao Tiantian, will be the first one to not let him go.\"\"Senior Sister?\"Ye Ziyan didn't care that much, she also landed beside Long Fei and shouted: \"If anyone dares to touch Long Fei, I won't let him go either.\"At this moment.Liu Luoxi struck out with his sword, his figure descending like a fairy, and said: \"Sky Sect's Liu Luoxi, no one can touch him.\"The appearance of the three sisters from the Heaven Sect shocked the entire audience.The Heaven Sect was like a giant.Their appearance caused the hearts of Long Zhanye and the people from the three pillars to tremble, and the space between their eyebrows knitted tightly.It was at this moment.Fu Xishan walked out from the crowd and said solemnly: \"Fu Xishan from the Fengyuan Merchant Union, no one can touch him!\"As soon as his voice faded \u2026Another heavyweight bomb exploded.Long Zhanye's forehead was drenched in cold sweat, the people from the three pillars were even more so apprehensive.The people of the Heaven Sect were actually helping Long Fei?Moreover.Even the Fengyuan Merchant Union, which never interfered with the family's competition, protected Long Fei. Furthermore, it was Fu Xishan who personally appeared, she was the daughter of the Fengyuan Merchant Union's leader.She would represent the entire Fengyuan Merchant Union.The crowd automatically opened up a path, allowing Fu Xishan to pass through with his veil on.Long Fei was grateful in his heart as he said, \"Thank you!\"At this moment.Things had already gone beyond their expectations.Long Zhanye looked at Zhuge Tianlong.Zhuge Tianlong said in a deep voice, \"Long Fei committed an offense while being a disciple of the Long family. He ruthlessly killed his fellow clansmen and even killed the Great Clan Elder on the spot. He has already violated the rules of the Long family and the laws of the Fire Glass Dynasty.Li Chongtian said slightly: \"Long Fei, are you just going to surrender? Or do you want us to do it ourselves? \"Nangong Yan's face was extremely ugly, because none of the four women around Long Fei were beneath her, so she was very unhappy and immediately replied: \"Why are you wasting words with him, just kill him!\"Extremely vicious!The atmosphere immediately became tense.Many people were sweating profusely.Long Zhanye shouted, \"Men, give me \u2026\"Not waiting for him to finish.A deep voice came crashing down from the sky, \"Who wants to bully my obedient grandson?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He could not help but say: \"Grandfather!\"If there was anyone in this world who was good to him other than jojo, then that person would be the Grand Elder of the Long family, Long Sanfeng.and also Long Fei's grandfather.Long Sanfeng looked at the dragon salyer on Long Fei's shoulder, then looked at him with tears in his eyes, and emotionally said: \"Good, good, good, Xiao Fei has grown up.\"The excitement in his heart could not be put into words.\"Greetings, Grand Elder.\"\"Greetings, Patriarch!\"All the disciples of the Long family knelt down in worship.Long Zhanye also knelt down, and said: \"Grand Elder, Patriarch, Long Fei, he \u2026.\"Not waiting for him to finish.Long Sanfeng's gaze wavered as he suddenly took action. His figure moved like lightning and landed beside Long Zhanye, sending him flying with a palm strike.\"Bam!\"Long Zhanye didn't have the power to retaliate.Zhuge Tianlong frowned, \"war chief!\"Long Sanfeng said slightly: \"Get up.\"And then \u2026Long Sanfeng looked at Zhuge Tianlong, and said with a smile. \"Little Tianlong, is it you who wants to bully my good grandson?\"As soon as his voice faded \u2026\"Boom, boom, boom \u2026\"His body trembled non-stop, and his legs bent slightly. In the end, he directly knelt down, and said with a pale face: \"I beg that Lord Dragon is merciful. I did not want to bully Young Master Long, please observe clearly.\"\"Oh?\"\"It's not you?\"\"So that's what Little Rushing Heaven is?\"The moment Long Sanfeng's words fell, another wave of pressure pressed down.Li Chongtian's face was pale white, unable to resist at all. She instantly knelt on the ground and begged for mercy: \"Grand Elder, please spare my life, I am only here to observe the competition, I did not do anything to the Long family. Please take a look.\"\"Oh?\"\"It wasn't you?\"\"Is that my grandson's wife?\" Long Sanfeng looked at Nangong Lei and her, and in almost an instant, another pressure came crushing down.\"Bam!\"\"Bam!\"Nangong Lei and Nangong Yan instantly knelt down as well.Nangong Yan wanted to curse wildly, but he was stopped by Nangong Lei, \"Grand Elder, why would I do anything to my own son-in-law? I definitely won't.\"Nangong Yan roared angrily in his heart: \"Long Fei, I definitely won't let you go.\"\"Definitely not!\"\"If you want me to marry you, then you, as a waste of Negative Activation to Dragon Blood, will never be able to do so.\"Then.Long Sanfeng's gaze landed on Nangong Xiao's body.Nangong Xiao was so scared that his face turned pale and he immediately kneeled down, \"Please spare me, Grand Elder. Long Fei is my brother, I never thought of killing him.\"So what if he was a prince?In front of experts, they were nothing more than bullsh * t.The war master ream were considered the pinnacle of experts in the Fire Glass Dynasty, they could not withstand the pressure at all with regards to their cultivation. As long as Long Sanfeng used a little more strength, their sea of consciousness would be crushed.This was a powerful expert.\"A being that disdains all existence.\"Zhuge Tianlong, Li Chongtian, Nangong Lei, Nangong Yan and the other five people kneeled on the ground as they continuously trembled, because Long Sanfeng's might was continuously increasing.They could only kneel on the ground, not daring to resist at all.Madman Long could do anything to kill them. Even the current emperor wouldn't dare to punish him, let alone the fact that this was the Long family.Long Sanfeng picked his ears and said indifferently: \"I seemed to have heard someone just now saying that my obedient grandson broke the laws of the Fire Glass Dynasty and deserved to be killed for his crimes.\"Li Chongtian immediately said: \"Grand master, Zhuge Tianlong said this, he is in charge of the Ministry of Justice, he knows the laws best, it has nothing to do with me.\"Zhuge Tianlong scolded the eighteen generations of Li Chongtian's ancestors in his heart, then immediately kowtowed and said, \"Grand Elder, I didn't say anything just now. Young Master Long has punished us all thoroughly, and helped us all get rid of this tumor.\"Oh!\"\"So I heard wrong? My obedient grandson is fine. \" Long Sanfeng's face was filled with satisfaction, but his pressure had not weakened in the slightest.Nangong Xiao immediately said with an awe-inspiring righteousness, \"If anyone dares to touch my Brother Long Fei, this prince will be the first to take his life.\"\"If that's the case...\"Long Sanfeng said: \"Then I have misunderstood you.\"He withdrew his aura.The five of them laid flat on the ground, looking as bedraggled as possible.He quickly got up.Long Sanfeng's pressure suddenly came over again.\"Bang, bang, bang \u2026\"The five of them instantly knelt on the ground. The kneecap was about to break.Long Sanfeng said with a deranged look, \"Why have you people come to my Long family? Are you saying that you have a worthy goal for plotting against my Long family? \"Long Fei almost laughed out loud.Zhuge Tianlong's group of five looked bitter, and said: \"Grand Elder, we were really just here to observe the competition and watch Young Master Long Fei's heroic figure. How would we dare to have anything to do with the Long family?\"\"So it's like that.\"\"It seems that I was indeed mistaken in blaming you all.\"While they were talking \u2026Long Sanfeng once again retracted his war master's imposing aura, and laughed: \"The three pillars and the imperial family are here, it's been a long time since the Long family was so lively.\"Zhuge Tianlong and the other four climbed up with much difficulty.At this moment.Long Sanfeng's imposing aura came crushing down.\"Bang, bang, bang \u2026\"\"Crack!\"This time, one of the kneecap shattered.Gritting her teeth, she stared straight at Long Fei. She placed all of this onto Long Fei and said viciously in her heart: \"This princess will definitely not let you have a good time, Long Fei, just you wait and see.\"\"Aiya!\"\"I'm getting old and can't control my strength anymore.\" Long Sanfeng acted dumb: \"I'm really sorry for the pressure just now.\"\"Wifey Sun, are you alright?\"\"Do you want me to find someone to show you?\"\"Last year, that pig's knee was broken by me. Do you want me to treat it for you? You can rest assured that it will definitely be cured. \"\"Zhan Hai, was that pig from last year still alive?\" Long Sanfeng asked seriously: \"If you're still here, pull it out and let her see my medical skills.\"Long Zhanhai reminded: \"Grand Elder, that pig was eaten by you after you cooked it into a roasted suckling pig on the second day.\"\"Aiya.\"\"Look at my memory.\" Long Sanfeng laughed and said: \"Grandson's wife, I can really treat you.\"\"Huh?\"\"No?\"\"Forget about it, remember to come often and play with me. My good grandson will deepen our relationship. There are still three years until you two get married. I'm still waiting to carry my great-grandson.\"\"Hey, don't be in such a hurry to leave.\"Nangong Yan even had the heart to kill.Nangong Lei carried her, bowed to the Grand Elder, and left the Long family in a hurry. If he didn't treat Nangong Yan now, he would really become a cripple.Zhuge Tianlong also quickly left, afraid that Dragon Madman would use his pressure to crush them again. That kind of feeling was too uncomfortable.three pillars and the Nangong Imperial Family had lost a lot of face today.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What awaited them was a series of punishments, but it wouldn't be too heavy because the Long family needed elite disciples.Long Fei's danger was also gone.Liu Luoxi said: \"Long Fei, it's time for us to leave as well. We need to go into closed door cultivation during this period of time.Xiao Tiantian giggled: \"Bastard, you better not be bullied again, we can't follow you around everyday.\"Ye Ziyan quipped, \"Little junior sister apprentice, you might as well come live in the Long family.\"Xiao Tiantian was startled, \"Eh, this is a good idea, I \u2026\"Seeing Ye Ziyan's teasing expression, he immediately said angrily, \"Senior sister, you don't care about her, she always bullies me.\"Fu Xishan also slightly said. \"I should go as well.\"She was a little impulsive just now, but she did not regret it. Waiting for her would be the punishment from the top executives of Fengyuan Merchant Union, even if she was the daughter of the alliance master.From the moment she took the first step, she was ready.Long Fei thanked the four of them in his heart.If they hadn't suddenly appeared to support him, the chaos in the Long family would have been inevitable. At that time, the Long family wouldn't be the Long family anymore.Long Sanfeng laughed: \"My four grandsons, where are you going? Isn't the Long family your home?Wife Sun!He was short of just three words.Xiao Tiantian's face flushed red, she suddenly liked the crazy old man, he played with the corner of her clothes, and occasionally looked at Long Fei.Waiting for Long Fei to speak.The four girls felt sweet in their hearts.However \u2026Only Xiao Tiantian showed it, the other three did not show any expression.Liu Luoxi said respectfully: \"Master Dragon, your grandson is Nangong Yan. We are only friends with Long Fei. We won't disturb you any longer and will be leaving first.\"Xiao Tiantian muttered to herself, and said: \"That Nangong Yan is too evil, I can't wait to tear her mouth to shreds \u2026 \u2026\"Without waiting for her to finish, she was pulled away by Liu Luoxi, and said in a low voice: \"Don't say so much. Nangong Yan is Long Fei's fiancee after all.Fu Xishan also smiled faintly and bowed before taking his leave.Long Fei secretly clenched both his fists and muttered to himself: \"Nangong Yan!\"The people of martial-arts arena all dispersed.To the Long family, this was a day worth being excited about. It was a day that every Long family disciple could see hope in.Many people had the thought that the Long family was about to rise again!\u2026 \u2026.Long Sanfeng's courtyard.After returning from the martial-arts arena, the moment he stepped foot inside the courtyard, Long Sanfeng's body sank down, his legs became unsteady, and he directly fell onto the ground, spitting out a mouthful of black blood.Cold sweat broke out all over his body.His body was trembling.Long Fei was shocked, and immediately supported her: \"Grandfather, what's wrong?\"Hu hu hu hu \u2026. Long Sanfeng stood up with difficulty, his face was as pale as paper, as though he had suddenly aged several tens of years, and said with great difficulty: \"I'm fine, I'm fine.\"At this moment.Long Zhanhai also quickly entered the courtyard and closed the door. He supported Long Sanfeng and said: \"Forcefully release the pressure of the war master, and it continuously crushed five people. Father, you still dare to say that it's alright, you almost couldn't hold on a few times, why are you suffering?\"Long Fei shook, and immediately asked: \"Uncle, what is forcefully releasing the pressure of the war master? Has grandpa not broken through the war master ream? \"Long Sanfeng laughed bitterly: \"For the past year, I have always been stuck at the peak of the ninth level of war elder, unable to break through no matter what.\"Long Zhanhai said: \"Father, you are more clear than me that sudden change in fate requires luck, for you to forcefully release your life force like this \u2026\"\"Cough, cough!\"Long Sanfeng immediately coughed, and said: \"My old bones still won't die that easily.\"Long Fei never thought that the war master pressure his grandfather had released was actually forcibly released after crossing ranks.The pressure he had released from the war master was just an illusion. It caused Zhuge Tianlong, the Li Martial Arts Sect, Nangong Lei and the royal family to feel fear.He was an existence at the peak of the war master ream in the Fire Glass City.As long as there were war master Warriors in charge, the three pillars family would not dare to act rashly.However...Forcefully releasing this kind of fake pressure required an extremely heavy price, and Long Sanfeng clearly suffered a heavy injury. His cultivation would probably only be able to stay here for the rest of his life.More importantly, he had lost several decades of his lifespan.And then again.His current cultivation had regressed to the sixth or seventh level of the war elder. Any expert of the eighth level of the war elder could easily defeat him.The consequences of forcefully releasing a pressure that was above his level were too severe.\"Grandfather \u2026\" Long Fei felt his heart ache, and was unable to say a single word. This was the person he was the closest to in this world.If he was just a little bit stronger.If he could suppress everything.Grandpa doesn't need to be like this.Thus, he would not be injured!\"Become strong, become strong. I must become even stronger.\" Long Fei swore secretly. He clenched his fists, and fresh blood dripped out of the nail and into the trap.Long Sanfeng smiled and said: \"Don't worry about Grandfather, I'm fine. Besides, you've grown up. You don't know how happy Grandfather is to see you here at the Martial Arts Practice Grounds.\"\"Your blood essence has been drawn out, the Pubes has been broken, and your veins are in disarray. However, you did not give up, use your strength to suppress Long Zhanwu, and make a large portion of the Long family's disciples howl for you, and make the Long family's might once again resound throughout the Fire Glass City. Seeing this scene, even if I had to die, I would feel gratified, hahaha \u2026\"Then he couldn't help but laugh excitedly.\"Cough, cough, cough...\"\"Cough, cough, cough...\" The smile was too hurried yet it kept on coughing; it was really just like an old man, causing Long Fei's heart to once again ache.\"And your dragon salyer!\"\"Our Long family hasn't been able to find it for thousands of years, but you found it in the end. This is all part of the will of the heavens, and it's all set in stone. Hahaha \u2026\" While they were talking, Long Sanfeng began to laugh loudly.I'm glad.He had never been so happy in all these years.\"Xiao Fei, where did you find the dragon salyer?\" Long Zhanhai asked with doubt.Long Fei scratched his head, and said: \"Grandfather, Uncle, I also obtained it through a fortuitous encounter within the Fire Glass Mountain Range, so from then on, I can start cultivating anew.\"Naturally, the matter of the system could not be revealed to anyone.As for the matter of the dragon salyer being blown off the body of the Flood Dragon, it was even more unspeakable.Even if they did, they wouldn't understand.Long Fei couldn't explain it either, he couldn't possibly say that he was a Transcender, right?Long Sanfeng laughed, \"Hahaha... Heaven has blessed my Long family, but this dragon salyer seems to be incomplete, my ancestor was blessed by the heavens to be able to find the other half. \"\"Only then can I become a supreme artifact.\"\"The Long family can last forever.\"Long Fei secretly clenched both his fists, and said: \"Grandfather, don't worry, I will definitely find the other half, moreover I already know where it is.\"The Nangong Imperial Family!This was the clue given by the mission, without a doubt.The other half were definitely in the Nangong Imperial Clan.Moreover.Back then, the Dragon Clan's Ancestor and the Evil Demon had both died. This was something the Nangong Imperial Clan had said. Was it true?Probably only the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan knew.Long Sanfeng held Long Fei's hand tightly and said: \"Good, good, good, this is the descendant of the Long family.\"\"Zhan Hai!\"Suddenly.Long Sanfeng's expression became serious.Long Zhanhai thought about what it was and immediately replied, \"I'm here.\"Long Sanfeng said in a serious tone, \"From today onwards, I want you to use all the resources of the Long family to support him, protect him, and make him a Divine Dragon Marquis.\"\"The new head of the Long family!\"Long Zhanhai immediately replied: \"Yes, child!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay### Chapter 64 - From now on you are my shadowLong Sanfeng understood his own situation.In this lifetime, it would be difficult for him to step into the war master ream, and after releasing the pressure of the war master, he did not have much lifespan left.Before he died, he had to nurture Long Fei up.Because \u2026Long Zhanhai's potential had also reached its limit, his cultivation could only stay at the war chief.This world was the world of the strong.The Long family needed to have a strong Ranker, and Long Fei needed to quickly rise in power. The current Long family was no longer the Long family from the past.The Long family didn't have much time left.\u2026 \u2026.Coming out from Long Sanfeng's courtyard, Long Fei felt depressed in his heart, and asked softly: \"Uncle, I do not wish to become some Divine Dragon Marquis, with my character, I am not suitable to be the Patriarch of the Long family.\"He didn't want to be tied down.He likes to live his own life.Once he became the Long family's head, he would have to focus on the Long family.Long Zhanhai frowned, and bellowed: \"Long Fei, are you afraid?\"Long Fei immediately said: \"I, Long Fei, have never known what fear is, I am just \u2026\"Without waiting for him to finish speaking, Long Zhanhai interrupted him and said, \"I'm not afraid of what you're worried about. From the moment you were born, you were the future master of the Long family. You were born for the Long family. \"\"Don't worry, as long as the Grand Preceptor and I are here, the two of us will do everything we can to protect you.\"\"However... \"You don't have much time left, I'm afraid that Grand Elder \u2026\"Long Zhanhai frowned, his fists clenched secretly as he sighed: \"It's all my fault that my aptitude is dull, and I am unable to comprehend the concept of the war elder, otherwise you would have been able to help Grand Elder out a bit.\"Hate yourself.If he could become a little stronger and become an expert of the war elder Realm, he would also be able to cause the three pillars and the imperial family to feel a little more fear.\"Long Fei, you must remember this.\"\"You are surnamed Long, you are a descendant of the Long family, and you shoulder the burden of the Long family's rise. No matter what happens, you must continue, resist it, even if the Grand Elder and I are no longer here, you must continue, because the descendants of the Long family will never lose, much less give up, do you understand?\" Long Zhanhai said in a serious tone.It was the Long family's spirit to never admit defeat.Long Fei nodded heavily, and said: \"Uncle, I understand!\"\"Very good!\"\"In the next few days, I will plan out your training plan. Go back and prepare for it.\" Long Zhanhai said.Long Fei asked: \"Uncle, my cultivation method is different from others. I don't need to give all my cultivation resources to me.\"Cultivation resources were very important to any martial artist.However \u2026To Long Fei, the cultivation resources of the god's martial continent were not helpful to him in breaking through to the next realm.Long Zhanhai said: \"You don't have to worry about these things, just follow my plan.\"Actually.He had not come up with a good plan yet.Moreover.He was also wondering in his heart, without the Dragon Blood Inherent skill, how could he break through when the Pubes was broken?This was a very troublesome matter for Long Zhanhai.Long Fei argued but he did not ask any further questions. He recalled his grandfather's painful expression and could not help but ask, \"Uncle, is there really no way to treat Grandfather's injuries? And how can he break through the war elder realm? \"Long Zhanhai exhaled a breath of air and said, \"I'm afraid that the Grand Elder's injuries will be difficult to cure completely. A healing breakthrough \u2026.\" He smiled bitterly and continued, \"Unless I can find the dragon's blood essence and raise the Grand Elder's Dragon Blood Activation, perhaps you will be able to break through.\"He himself was the same.His Dragon Blood Activation had reached 67%, but this was far from sufficient. If he was unable to raise his Dragon Blood Activation, it would be difficult for him to break through in his entire life.To raise one's Dragon Blood Activation, the only way would be to use dragon blood essence!However \u2026This dragon was the supreme being, how could he find it?Even if they did, with the current strength of the Long family, they wouldn't be able to kill a dragon.Long Fei muttered: \"Dragon blood essence?\"He made a mental note!He thought to himself: \"If I can find the dragon's blood essence, uncle will be able to break through, grandfather will also be able to recover his breakthrough, and the strength of the Long family disciples will also increase. At that time, Fire Glass City will no longer dare to touch the Long family, and I will no longer need to be the Long family's master, and will be able to live freely.\"Long Fei made up his mind that he must find the dragon's blood essence.\u2026 \u2026.Returning to the thatched courtyard.jojo welcomed him with a radiant smile, and said happily: \"Young Master, you're so handsome today, hehe \u2026\"\"Everyone is talking about you.\"Although she did not go to the Martial Arts Practice Grounds, she had heard a lot of discussions about Long Fei. The current Long Fei was already the center of the Long family.Long Fei smiled faintly and said: \"When was this young master not handsome?\"\"Right!\"\"What about her?\"jojo smiled mischievously, and said: \"Shadow Sis is inside the house.\"\"Her name is Shadow?\" Long Fei was slightly taken aback, then said: \"This name isn't bad after all.\"Following that \u2026Long Fei walked into the room, looked at the veiled silhouette on the bed, and said: \"The Highest Grade Medicine Powder I refined should have long healed the injuries on your body, right?\"\"Stop pretending in front of me and get up.\"Long Fei was clearer than anyone else about the effects of the Highest Grade Medicine Powder.The figure was startled and immediately stood up. Looking at Long Fei, she said, \"I'm not lying to you, right?\"Long Fei looked at her. Because of her tight clothing, her figure was completely exposed, her long legs, small waist, and the twin peaks on her chest had all bulged, it was just that \u2026 There was a veil covering her face, but under the veil, there was definitely a peerless beauty.Long Fei was also interested, and said: \"Take off your veil.\"\"Huh?\"The figure was startled and hesitated to answer Long Fei.Long Fei sneered, and said: \"What? You don't even listen to this command? How am I going to make you do things in the future? \"\"Forget it!\"\"I won't force you. Your master has already been killed by me, and you are free to go.\" After Long Fei finished speaking, he turned around and was about to leave the room.\"Wait!\"Her right hand was trembling a little as she gently took off her veil, while her eyes looked at Long Fei with a strange gaze.\"As expected!\"Long Fei's face revealed great shock, \"She is indeed a peerless beauty, but just that \u2026 Your expression is a little cold. \"With such a hot body coupled with such a peerless beauty, it was breathtakingly beautiful. Moreover, it was ice-cold and beautiful, as if it was an iceberg.Long Fei said: \"Let me see you smile.\"The shadow's fists were tightly clenched. In the end, the corners of his mouth curled up and he lightly smiled. Just like that, he shut his mouth and said: \"The veil has been removed and he is smiling. Is that okay now?\"Although it was just for a moment, her smile was extremely beautiful, as if she had the beauty of eternity.Long Fei said indifferently: \"From today onwards, you will be my shadow. Your veil can only be removed for me, and your smile can only be worn for me.\"Finished.Long Fei took out a cultivation technique from his bosom and threw it into the shadow's hands.And then \u2026Long Fei turned and left.The silhouette was startled by the technique in his hand, \"hells magic?\"Looking at Long Fei's back figure, the shadow was moved. The hells magic had always been a cultivation technique that she wanted to cultivate, but Long Fei gave it to her without even blinking his eyes.This master was a little different from his previous master.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even the ferocious dragon seemed to be somewhat fearful.The remaining half of the dragon salyer!Nangong Huo knelt on the ground and said softly, \"Grand Ancestor, the other half of the dragon salyer has already been found by the Long Family.\"Not far away.A hundred year old man was sitting cross-legged. Upon hearing the word 'dragon salyer', he suddenly opened his eyes, and his figure rushed over like a ghost.He instantly appeared in front of Nangong Huo, and asked with an excited expression: \"Has he appeared?\"As they spoke, the aura of the war master spread out from his body, causing Nangong Huo to be unable to endure it any longer. His figure started to tremble, and he said: \"It appeared, and was found by the Long family's younger generation, Long Fei.\"\"Ahh, ha, ha \u2026\"\"He's finally here. I knew he would appear.\" With a mad laugh, the ancestor's figure blurred, appearing in front of the half of the dragon salyer. His right hand moved.\"Weng \u2026\"The other half of the dragon salyer released an arrogant and overbearing blade aura. The blade aura was like a bloody light as it crazily unleashed.\"I have been waiting for so many years for the dragon salyer to hide a shocking secret that not many great ancestors have comprehended after thousands of years. As long as we can find the remaining half, we will know.\" \"This secret could very well be the Dragon God's secret. It might very well be the greatest secret of the Ascendant stage.\"Taizu was starting to go insane.He was extremely excited.The Great Ancestor landed beside Nangong Huo and said: \"Back then, the Dragon Slayer God held the dragon salyer and fought a great battle with the Evil Demon Sovereign for three days and three nights, and just by relying on this dragon salyer, he killed the Evil Demon Sovereign. The dragon salyer is too strong, and it has already threatened the position of our Nan Gong Family. Never would we have thought that the Dragon Slayer God would use all of its Dragon God blood essence as the primer to shatter the dragon salyer. threw one into the depths of the Fire Glass Mountain Range, but we only managed to get half of it.Towards these secrets, Nangong Huo's heart was greatly shocked.He only knew that the Dragon Slayer God was killed by the inescapable snare tactical method technique, but he never thought that the dragon salyer could actually have such a strong power.The inescapable snare tactical method Art was the foundation of the Nangong Family and was an Ancient Vicious Formation.The Dragon Slayer God was actually able to fight for seven days and seven nights. One could imagine how powerful this dragon salyer was.Moreover.After that battle, the inescapable snare tactical method had been lost. For thousands of years, they had been trying to recover, but not even half of their energy had been recovered.Nangong Huo calmed down and said: \"Great Ancestor, what do you want me to do?\"The dragon salyer was a supreme artifact.It could threaten the foundation of the Nangong Imperial Clan.This thing was either under his control or he wanted it to disappear forever.The ancestor's eyes narrowed.Nangong Huo continued: \"Yesterday, Lunatic Long had already come out from seclusion, his cultivation had already broken through the war master ream, it will probably be difficult for us to deal with the Long family.\"\"war master ream?\"\"Long Sanfeng?\"The expression in the ancestor's eyes flickered, and he said: \"His Dragon Blood Activation is only at 75%, breaking through the war master ream is probably \u2026.\"Nangong Huo was startled, then said: \"Great Ancestor, you said that he forcefully released the pressure of the war master?\"\"According to my understanding of the Long family, if one wants to break through the war master ream, their Dragon Blood Activation must reach 80%. Lunatic Long doesn't have this kind of potential at all. There are exceptions too, and we cannot be completely sure. \" The ancestor didn't dare to be sure either.The Long family was too strong.The dragon blood also contained too many uncertainties.Over the past ten thousand years.There were too many experts in the Long family, and there were also some special cases.To the Long family, he had always been the person that the Nangong Imperial Clan feared the most.Nangong Huo was slightly taken aback, then said: \"Then...\"Tai Zu was silent for a few seconds, then said: \"Didn't Nangong Lei get married to the Long family? He should be more interested to know whether Lunatic Long is really a war master ream or not than me, right? \"\"In the past, his ancestors were also a participant.\"\"If not for our Nangong Clan, there would not be a Prince Nangong family in this world.\"Nangong Lei was not from the Nan Gong Royal Family.It was also a family that was given the surname of the Nangong Imperial Clan.Following that \u2026Tai Zu slightly said: \"Pass my order to Nangong Lie, didn't he break through the war master ream last year? Let's let him try out the cultivation level of Lunatic Long. \"Nangong Huo immediately replied: \"Understood.\"\"Right.\"\"You said that the dragon salyer is currently in the hands of a younger generation member of the Long family?\" Taizu asked.Nangong Huo answered, \"It's in the hands of the current Young Master of the Long family, Long Fei. It's the brat whose blood essence of the Dragon God has been drawn out.\"\"Young master Long?\"The grand elder's eyes became sinister as his lips curled into a sneer. \"There's no need to act against him. Isn't there a banquet for him at the end of the year?\"Nangong Huo immediately understood Tai Zu's meaning, and said: \"I got it!\"\"dragon salyer, I have to have it!\" The Great Ancestor secretly clenched his fists as he looked at the half of the dragon salyer, revealing a ghastly coldness. \"What exactly are you hiding?\"\u2026 \u2026.For a few days.Long Fei kept on using his skills.Especially the dragon salyer technique.Without the addition of luck, his saber Qi had already risen to the 155th level, each level more violent than the last.And then there was the fatal blow on his right fist.Long Fei was also crazily cultivating, just that... It took him three minutes to circulate his strength. This was a bit of a pain in the ass.\"Ding!\"\"proficiency + 1\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to the player 'Long Fei' for cultivating the divine technique 'Toading Skill' Level Increase.

The level four Toading Skill s require 50,000 points. I have to keep training myself until I become a toad.\" Long Fei muttered.The system's downside.Without experience, it was impossible to level up. If one wanted to level up, they had to kill monsters. If they were to rely on refining top-grade pills to gain just a little bit of experience, who knew how long it would take to level up.Long Fei muttered in his heart, \"Should I make another trip to Fire Glass Mountain Range?\"At this moment.The figure suddenly appeared behind Long Fei, \"Intense battle qi!\"She was a killer.Her ability to sense battle qi was far stronger than ordinary people. This was her special ability.At this moment.\"Rumble!\"A huge sound exploded in the sky above Long Sanfeng's courtyard.\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"Lunatic Long, I heard that you broke through the war master ream, you came out to play.\"Nangong Lie is here!\"This is bad!\"Long Fei secretly shouted and quickly rushed to his grandfather's residence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It just so happens that I was worried about not being able to find a person at the war elder Realm to spar with.\"\"Why?\"\"Play? Madman Long, you were a battle maniac before, you wouldn't have refused my request right? \"Just the fact that Long Sanfeng was flying through the air was not enough to prove that he was a war elder realm cultivator.You have to fight to know.Without waiting for Long Sanfeng to speak, Nangong Lie smiled and said: \"Don't worry, I will at most beat your shit out of you. I won't take your life.\"Long Sanfeng's eyes became angry, and the war elder aura from his body became endless, as he bellowed: \"Nangong Lie, since you want to play, then let's play big time.\"The arrow was already on the bow, so he had no choice but to fire!When he was forcefully releasing the war elder's Qi in the martial-arts arena, he had already guessed that someone would test his cultivation level.This person was either someone from the Nangong Imperial Clan or Prince Nangong.However...Long Sanfeng never thought that Nangong Lie would arrive so quickly!Long Zhanhai rushed into the courtyard and leaped with all his might onto the roof, then shouted loudly: \"Senior, since you want to play, I'll play with you.\"Nangong Lie didn't even look at him, and said with a sneer: \"Seeing that you're calling me senior, I'll spare your life, a trash like you doesn't even have the qualifications to make me attack.\"As soon as his voice faded \u2026The aura of the war elder on Nangong Lie's body had also been released to its peak. His two fists moved, and dense battle qi roared out, charging towards Long Sanfeng, saying: \"Do you think I can't play?\"In that instant.Long Sanfeng moved, his true breath surging as his body continuously released the sounds of energy colliding with each other. The power of the dragon blood within his body also began to boil.\"Heavenly Dragon Palm!\"His right palm moved.A dragon's roar sounded out, the true breath activated, and a palm shot out like a heavenly dragon.Nangong Lie snorted, \"Just this little bit of strength?\"\"Hah!\"Nangong Lie clenched both of his fists tightly, aimed at the roaring dragon that was charging up, and punched fiercely downwards, \"Raging Sea Fist!\"\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"The sea of anger roared, and like an avalanche, it smashed into the dragon with a fist. The dragon let out a scream of rage.Nangong Lie pulled on his dragon head fiercely.\"Crack!\"\"The Long family's Heaven Ranked Level 8 cultivation technique is only mediocre.\" Nangong Lie disdainfully snorted, his arm loosened and the heavenly dragon simulacrum slowly dissipated. Even though his mouth was filled with disdain, both his arms were numb. He thought to himself, \"As expected of the Heavenly Dragon Palm, the one who will lose another bit of power will be me.\"In the blink of an eye.Nangong Lie's figure blurred and instantly appeared in front of Long Sanfeng. He sinisterly sneered, \"Lunatic Long, get down!\"\"Boom!\"\"Rage Sea Rushing to the Sky!\"\"Rumble!\"The sky darkened, and like an enormous wave that descended from the skies, it directly smashed into Long Sanfeng's head.Long Sanfeng's forehead turned sinister as he roared, \"Dragon Elephant Break!\"His palms blurred.The power of the dragon blood was released, aimed at that massive wave and launched an attack.\"Bam!\"\"Rumble \u2026\"\"Rumble \u2026\"His voice was shaking the sky, and even Long Zhanhai, who was on the roof, was unable to withstand the pressure of this battle qi, and tumbled down from the roof.At this time.Long Sanfeng's body also sunk, unable to resist.His cultivation was only at the eighth stage of the war elder, and he was not a match for it. Furthermore, he was injured, so forcefully releasing the war master's aura had already exceeded the limits of his body. If not for the anger in his heart, he would not have been able to hold on at all. After two consecutive attacks, his true breath had been completely exhausted and the power of his dragon blood had been greatly reduced.\"Bang, bang, bang \u2026\"Nangong Lie's power surged as he crazily struck down, coldly laughing, \"Lunatic Long, is this all you have?\"\"Too weak, hahaha \u2026\"\"Everyone says that you, Lunatic Long, are a martial cultivation genius that only appears once in a hundred years. It looks like you're not up to much, hahaha \u2026\"\"Boom!\" BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! \"Boom!\"He continued to strike and crush.Long Sanfeng's blood was boiling in his chest, and he almost vomited blood a few times.\"Boom!\"After the punch, Long Sanfeng heavily fell to the ground.\"Father!\"Long Zhanhai sprinted forward.The instant Long Sanfeng landed, he clapped his right hand and jumped up with force. He raised his head to look at the proud Nangong Lie in the sky and thought to himself, \"I want to hold on, I want to hold on to the pillar, I absolutely cannot let him see any flaws.\"Although he was at a disadvantage.However, his body was still releasing the aura of the war master ream, so even Nangong Lie could not find any clues.\"Don't come over!\" Long Sanfeng shouted, and then laughed out wildly: \"Nangong Lie, I didn't think that your comprehension of the war master ream's power would be so profound.\"\"I've only broken through for less than a month. If you give me another year of time, the one who lost would be you.\"His voice was like a great bell.There was no sign of injury.Nangong Lie laughed disdainfully: \"What? Lunatic Long, you're admitting defeat and not playing? \"\"I am in a good mood, come... \"Take another palm from me!\"Just as Long Sanfeng had said, he was still unable to confirm Long Sanfeng's cultivation level.He had yet to achieve his goal for coming here.He couldn't give up just like that.In the blink of an eye, Nangong Lie's palm fell from the sky and gathered all of his power. If Long Sanfeng was able to block it, it would prove that he was a war master ream and that he had to be more careful in the future. But if he could not take it, it would mean that his cultivation was not war master ream and that he would die under his hands, which would remove a hidden danger for the Nan Gong Family.Regardless of the outcome.The Nangong Family was the winner.Long Sanfeng's gaze tensed up, the pressure of the surging war master pressed down. He knew he could not hold on, but... He decided to operate the best part of the dragon blood Profound Qi in his body.Once this thread of dragon blood Profound Qi circulated, his life could only last for three days.For the sake of the Long family, in order to intimidate the families who were eyeing the Fire Glass City covetously, and in order to buy Long Fei more time, he decided to give it his all!\"You dare to touch my grandpa? I'll fight with you!\"\"Boom!\"\"Wushuang, explode!\"\"Weng \u2026\"A violent explosion sounded out from Long Fei's body, following that, all of the attributes in his body doubled, \"dragon salyer, give it to me!\"\"Boom \u2026\"A domineering shout.The Dragon Slaying Crippled Blade appeared in Long Fei's hands. \"Slicing the skin, breaking the tendons, breaking the bones \u2026 \u2026\"In a tenth of a second, seven moves of dragon salyer technique were released, the blade qi also accumulated in that instant, and at the same time, Long Fei leapt out heavily.\"Bam!\"With both hands gripping the dragon salyer, he suddenly roared out, \"dragon chop!\"\"Shua!\"A layer of saber Qi swept out.Nangong Lie frowned, his heart sinking when he saw the dragon salyer in Long Fei's hand. 'supreme artifact, dragon salyer?! No wonder... No wonder Grand Ancestor Nan Gong wanted me to test Long Sanfeng's cultivation. So the dragon salyer had appeared. \"It was also at this moment.Nangong Lie coldly snorted, and said: \"Even a lame duck like you dares to be so arrogant in front of me?\"\"Raging Angry Sea!\"\"Boom!\"Both palms formed into a fist, the berserk ocean came attacking from all directions, surging towards Xiang Longfei.\"Kill!\"whoosh whoosh whoosh \u2026 *All of the blade energies were released and clashed with Nangong Lie's' Raging Inferno '.The earth quaked and the mountains shook.Powerful energy continued to shoot out in all directions.\"Bam!\"The dragon chop's blade aura completely destroyed the boiling energy in the sea of anger, but it was still \u2026 The difference in cultivation between Long Fei and Nangong Lie was just too great, and could not even withstand the pressure of the battle qi on Nangong Lie's body, and his body immediately fell down.Nangong Lie was shocked in his heart, \"This guy is only at the war spirit Realm, but the power he is releasing is too terrifying.\"\"We can't let this child live!\"The aura of the dragon chop caused an indescribable pressure on his mind. If not for the fact that he had the advantage in cultivation, he would not have been able to endure it.Suddenly.Nangong Lie's figure blurred as ghost shadows appeared one after another, before he threw a palm attack towards Long Fei's head.Long Fei suddenly moved, threw the dragon salyer towards Long Sanfeng, and said: \"Grandfather!\"Long Sanfeng leaped up and caught the dragon salyer, releasing the last bit of Dragon Blood Essence and roared out: \"Nangong Lie, you dare to bully my grandson, I'll take your life!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He immediately gave up on killing Long Fei, flew to the side, and smiled apologetically: \"Lunatic Long, there's no need to be angry, I was just joking.\"\"Are you kidding?\"\"You must be joking with the dragon salyer.\"The last bit of dragon blood essence has been released. Do you think I can let you go just because you said that?That was impossible.If Long Sanfeng was a war master ream, he would have smashed Nangong Lie to the ground a long time ago, and would definitely step on his head while laughing maniacally.However \u2026His cultivation was currently only at the eighth level of war elder. To him, this kind of opportunity to crush Nangong Lie, was something he would never miss.Killing Nangong Lie would be able to severely injure Prince Nan Gong's family and would be a huge deterrence to the royal family, so the Long family would have even more time.Long Sanfeng risked his life for this blade strike, channeling all of his energy into his body.\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"\u2026 \u2026.Heavenly thunder billowed, and the dragon salyer cut down through the heavens and earth.Nangong Lie trembled in fear, the feeling of being crushed by the dragon salyer was even worse than death.However \u2026He wasn't the kind to obediently accept his fate.His body exploded!Nangong Lie roared, \"Lightning defense, break for me!\"Thunder rumbled in his body.Long Zhanhai's face changed, \"Thunder Clock? Heavenly Soul Treasure, Thunder Clock? \"Nangong Lie's body had an extra huge bell on it, its body was filled with purple lightning, the lightning formed a lightning web, it formed an extremely hard defense against the lightning.The Thunder Clock of Prince Nan Gong's house!It was also a peak level Heavenly Soul Treasure, and was extremely close to the existence of holy artifact s. Although its rank was not as high as the dragon salyer s, its defense was extremely powerful, and was obtained by their ancestors through a fortuitous encounter.\"Rumble \u2026\"The dragon salyer slashed down.It struck the purple thunder net.Immediately.The sky and the earth darkened. It was as if the end of the world had struck, and the entire Fire Glass City was trembling.The lightning web continued to break.The dragon salyer was unstoppable.Nangong Lie was struggling to hold on.But!Long Sanfeng's power was rapidly drying up. The power of the true breath and the dragon's blood were all withering, and there was nothing left to follow up. Even if the dragon salyer did not have the support of the true breath, it was still not able to unleash its powerful strength.Victory or defeat against a war master ream Ranker could be determined in a moment.Nangong Lie grabbed onto this moment.The Thunder Clock suddenly roared, its figure moving like lightning, it instantly shot towards the sky and started laughing maniacally, \"Hahaha \u2026 Lunatic Long, you aren't strong enough, right? \"\"This is the difference.\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"He had escaped death.Nangong Lie's back was drenched in cold sweat, he was still in a state of shock as he stared at Long Sanfeng who was in the courtyard, unable to confirm whether or not he was war master ream's cultivation.However \u2026He no longer dared to try again.This was because the dragon salyer's power was too strong. If he slashed again, he definitely would not be able to block it.Even Thunder Clock would probably be destroyed by this blade.Long Sanfeng held onto the blade with his right hand and suddenly pointed towards Nangong Lie who was in the air. He laughed arrogantly: \"Child Nangong Lie, if you have the guts, come down and fight with this old man for another 300 rounds.\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"While he was laughing maniacally, the aura of the war master ream was released endlessly.Nangong Lie did not dare to try again, and instead smiled: \"Lunatic Long, there's a lot of time to go, there's no need to be in such a rush. Today, I still have urgent matters to attend to, so I'll come back one day to experience your dragon salyer's power.\"Finished.He instantly flew away, worried that the Dragon Madman would carry the dragon salyer and chase after him, cursing in his heart: \"Nangong Huo, you two, father and son, are truly ruthless enough to want to frame me.\"\"If I didn't run fast today, I would have died under the dragon salyer.\"Nangong Lie was extremely angry in his heart.Nangong Huo's orders did not say that the Long family had already found the dragon salyer, otherwise he would not be acting this way.Naturally, he felt displeased in his heart.At the same time, Long Fei's figure was imprinted in his heart, \"For his war spirit to be able to withstand my attack, it is only one move, but he has too much potential, and is a great threat to my King Nan Gong Residence.\"\"We can't stay here any longer!\"\"The Long family has always had some crazy people. Now that the dragon salyer has been found, if the Long family rises up again, I'm afraid \u2026\"He could not help but feel uneasy as he thought about the secrets and memories his father had told him before he died.Back then, in order to unite the dragon salyer and the imperial family and use the inescapable snare tactical method to kill the Dragon Slayer God, who would have thought that he would actually split the dragon salyer into two.The Long family was not aware of this.If the Long family found out, perhaps \u2026The consequences would be unimaginable!And then \u2026Nangong Lie quickly returned to the King Nan Gong Palace.\u2026 \u2026.Long family, Long Sanfeng's courtyard.After confirming that Nangong Lie had left the Long family, Long Sanfeng's body suddenly sank and almost fell to the ground.It was also at this time.A group of Long Clan disciples rushed into the courtyard.\"Grand Elder, Grand Elder \u2026\"Long Zhanhai's brows tightened, and immediately shouted, \"Besides Long Fei, all of you get out!\"\"Hurry up!\"His voice shook the heavens, and no one dared to resist.Although the disciples of the Long family didn't understand, it was obvious that the Grand Tutor had won, so why did he chase them away?One of the disciples of the Long family glared at Long Sanfeng. Seeing him trembling non-stop, his face pale and without blood, as if he was an old man about to die, his heart trembled uncontrollably as the corners of his mouth unconsciously curled into a cold smile.\"Bam!\"The courtyard door closed.Long Zhanhai immediately rushed to Long Sanfeng's side to support him, \"Father!\"His heart felt like it was about to die!It was incomparably painful.Long Sanfeng looked at the Dragon Slaying Sabre with incomparable excitement, and said: \"I can still see the dragon salyer in my lifetime, and can still use it once, I'll be able to die in peace.\"\"Cough, cough, cough...\"\"Cough, cough, cough...\"Long Sanfeng violently coughed out, black blood unceasingly gushing out of his mouth and his body was trembling uncontrollably.Long Fei also stepped forward to support him. His heart was in extreme pain as he said: \"Grandfather, Grandfather, Uncle, what happened to Grandfather?\"Long Zhanhai said in a deep voice: \"Using the dragon's blood essence, forcefully releasing the war master's aura, and in the end forcing Nangong Huo back with the dragon salyer, he even used the last bit of the dragon's blood essence, now father is \u2026\"\"Cough cough \u2026\"Long Sanfeng coughed a few times, then looked at Long Fei in a benevolent manner: \"Xiao Fei, don't worry, your grandfather won't die yet.\"\"Father!\"Long Zhanhai could not hold it in any longer and said: \"Your true essence is currently exhausted, your dragon blood essence is exhausted, and you are also injured. We only have three days of our lives left. \"When he said that, Long Zhanhai was also crying.Seeing his father like this, he wished that he could bear everything on his behalf.Hearing these words, Long Fei was stunned!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Long Zhanhai's words were like a thunder from a clear sky, his two hands tightly grabbed onto Long Sanfeng, and he said: \"I won't, I won't. Grandfather, you told me, I won't \u2026\"Unwell!It was extremely uncomfortable.This was the first time Long Fei had felt such pain, such suffocating pain, all he could remember was his grandfather's doting and benevolence towards him, these scenes constantly flooded his mind, making him feel extremely uncomfortable, \"There must be a way, grandfather, you said, there must be a way right?\"\"dragon salyer, dragon salyer \u2026.\"And then \u2026As long as he had dragon blood, he would be able to save Grandfather. Long Fei immediately asked: \"Uncle, didn't you say that if you had dragon blood, you would be able to help Grandfather?\"\"I can use dragon salyer s to exchange for dragon blood, I can exchange for dragon blood.\"Long Fei didn't even know what his family members were in his previous life.From birth, he had never known who his parents were and never received any family love.Family was what he longed for the most.Although he was just a Transcender, the images in his mind made him feel what it meant to be family.As long as he could save Grandfather, he did not hesitate to exchange it with the dragon salyer!So what if it was a supreme artifact?In Long Fei's heart, his grandfather's life was more important than anything.The supreme artifact could explode again without it, if it died, would it be able to live again?\"Shut up!\"Long Sanfeng opened his eyes wide, staring straight at Long Fei, and shouted: \"The dragon salyer is a treasure passed down from the Great Ancestor, it is the supreme elder of the Long family, and you want to exchange my life for dragon blood? How do you want me to face the ancestors of the Long family in a hundred years? \"\"Xiao Fei, as long as the dragon salyer exists, the Long family will not perish.\"He didn't want to be a sinner.He also didn't want to lose face to the ancestors of the Long family after death.The dragon salyer was the Long family's hope, and Long Fei was the Long family's hope.Long Zhanhai said in a pained voice: \"Even if I can get dragon blood, it's useless. A portion of dragon blood is simply insufficient, unless I can kill a huge dragon and use its blood essence to rebuild my body. Where is the giant dragon in god's martial continent? No one knows. Even if they did, killing a colossal dragon would be impossible. \"The dragon was the strongest being in the god's martial continent.Even if it was the war emperor, the War God, this kind of supreme realm, didn't dare to say it was easy to kill.Not to mention.You can't even find it!\"After killing the gigantic dragon, the dragon's blood essence will be remade into its body \u2026\" Long Fei muttered to himself.Long Sanfeng said weakly: \"Xiao Fei, don't listen to your uncle's nonsense. Life and death, the cycle of reincarnation, these are the laws of nature. Don't be sad for me, I will watch over you from the sky.\"\"But... Grandfather won't be able to see you get married and have children, and won't be able to carry a grandson in your arms anymore, hahaha \u2026 \"\"That Nangong Yan, if you don't like her, you can annul the marriage. The three young ladies of the Heaven Sect are not bad, and jojo is not bad either. You are even better than your father's woman, I do not need to worry.\"\"Speaking of your father \u2026\"Long Sanfeng's expression trembled, and said guiltily: \"It's all my fault for being too strict at the time, if I had promised your father, he wouldn't have left home, and he definitely wouldn't have not returned home after so many years.\"His eyes were full of remorse.Long Zhanhai said: \"Father, so much time has passed, Old Third will definitely not resent you anymore.\"Long Sanfeng looked at Long Fei and said, \"Xiao Fei, your father is my fault. If you can find him in your lifetime, then take me to apologize to him.Long Sanfeng had never told him about his father before.In his memories, he asked countless of times but Long Sanfeng never answered.Moreover.What Long Fei didn't understand was that he didn't know who his mother was, and he didn't dare to ask her now either.Long Sanfeng acted as if he was going to do something later, causing Long Fei's heart to ache. \"Grandfather, you have to apologize, go and apologize by yourself, don't ask me to pass this down.\"\"Don't worry, I'll definitely let you reform your body. I definitely will.\"Finished.Long Fei ran out anxiously.The moment he ran out of the courtyard, he couldn't hold back his tears any longer. They streamed down his face as he sobbed, as if his heart had been torn to shreds.He had never cried like this before.Never!\"It's really useless, I'm really useless. If I were a little stronger, Grandfather wouldn't be injured, and he wouldn't need to worry about me. Long Fei, you're really useless.\"Long Fei screamed in his heart, clenching his fists tightly, as though his teeth were going to shatter.\"Become stronger!\"\"Become strong. I must become strong. I want to become the strongest person in this world.\"\"Ahh \u2026\"Roaring furiously at the sky!Filled with powerlessness, when facing Nangong Lie who had war master ream, he did not have the slightest bit of strength to resist.Moreover.He knew clearly in his heart that Nangong Lie had only tested him once, and the person behind him had become even stronger. The cultivation of the royal family's Master was even stronger.How should he face it?In front of them, Long Fei felt that he was not even an ant.Long Fei ran out of the Long family residence like a madman.It would be a waste of his time to think of how to deal with Prince Nangong's family and the royal family. Right now, he had to think of how to save his grandfather.After teleporting with great difficulty and with his family members by his side, Long Fei would never allow himself to become an orphan again. That feeling was something he had endured for more than twenty years and he would never want to live that kind of life again.They ran to the Fengyuan Merchant Union.Zhao Er immediately went forward and said, \"Young Master Long, Elder Liu is waiting for you in the backyard.\"Long Fei did not linger, he directly ran to the backyard, and directly said to Liu Feng while looking at him: \"Elder Liu, I want to see your pavilion master.\"Liu Feng immediately said: \"I really want to tell you about this, but I heard that Nangong Lie went to the Long family today, and did not go over.\"\"Our Pavilion Master has been summoned back to the main alliance.\"\"Perhaps...\"Liu Feng's face became anxious.Long Fei's brows tightened, and said: \"What's possible?\"Liu Feng replied, \"I may never come to the Fire Glass City again.\"\"Is it because of me?\" Long Fei finally understood that the Fengyuan Merchant Union could not interfere with the battles between the local families these few days. This was the principle.There was no doubt that Fu Xishan stood out to protect him.The Fengyuan Merchant Union immediately sent people to escort her back to the headquarters to interrogate her.These few days, Long Fei did not come to the Fengyuan Merchant Union, so he did not know about it.Liu Feng nodded his head, and said: \"Miss has violated the rules of the Alliance for your sake, even if her father is the Alliance Master, he would still be unable to protect her, not to mention that the inside of the Fengyuan Merchant Union is much more complicated than you imagine.\"\"As expected!\"Long Fei blamed himself in his heart, he really wanted to slap himself.Liu Feng thought of something and immediately took out a small bottle, and said: \"Long Fei, this is the thing that Miss entrusted me to pass to you before she left.\"\"What is this?\" Long Fei asked.Liu Feng lowered his voice and said: \"Heaven Rank continued life pill!\"\"Eh?!\"Long Fei's expression was shocked as he received the pill. His heart was in extreme shock as he asked: \"How did she know that I need this thing?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They would definitely have this pill, even if they did not have it, they would still know the formula for it.So Long Fei came.What he did not expect was that Fu Xishan had actually prepared it for him in advance.His heart was filled with gratitude.At the same time, he was filled with doubts. \"How did she know I needed it?\"Liu Feng said: \"That day after returning from the Long family, Miss had been preparing. She used all her connections and also bought three continued life pill s with all of her savings.\"Actually.Liu Feng did not say everything.The reason why Fu Xishan was actually being escorted back to the main alliance was not because she wanted to protect Long Fei, but because of the continued life pill.One continued life pill was worth hundreds of spirit stones.This was not something that her savings could afford.Rather, it was Fu Xishan who used the connections and resources that the Fengyuan Merchant Union could not use.It was because of this that he was taken back.Moreover.This was a heinous crime, and the punishment Fu Xishan received was also the most serious!This was also something that Fu Xishan had specially instructed Liu Feng not to know.\"She knew that the other day?\" Long Fei was shocked in his heart, and did not think too much about it.Liu Feng said: \"The Fengyuan Merchant Union also has powerful warriors present in the Fire Glass City. Otherwise, do you think the Fengyuan Merchant Union would be able to stay in the Fire Glass City so safely?\"\"On that day, the experts of our Fengyuan Merchant Union saw that Master Long's body was severely injured from releasing the war master ream, Miss also guessed that some expert from the war master ream would come and test Master Long's cultivation level, and at that time, Master Long would definitely release it again on behalf of the Long family and you, and also use the Dragon Blood Essence, and at that time \u2026 He will be at the end of his tether. \"All of these were within Fu Xishan's expectations.After staying in Fire Glass City for so many years, she had long seen everything clearly.It was just that \u2026He had been doing his best for so many years, and did not participate in the Fire Glass City's internal conflict. This time, he did not know if he got the wrong nerve, but rather, he wanted to participate in it for Long Fei.Furthermore... She even threw herself in.Long Fei's heart was filled with gratitude, as he said in a heavy voice: \"Thank you, your Pavilion Master. Thank you, I, Long Fei, am unable to repay you in any way, as long as it is something Pavillion Master Fu can use, I, Long Fei, will not refuse it no matter what.\"He didn't know how to thank her.continued life pill s were too important to him.Liu Feng smiled faintly and said: \"As long as you don't forget our young miss.\"Liu Feng wanted to say something but held back in the end.Long Fei said in a heavy voice, \"Long Fei will remember this great kindness of Pavillion Master Fu's for the rest of his life. I will never forget it.\"\"Old Liu, grandpa is still waiting for me. I'll go back first.\"Liu Feng said: \"Hurry up and go. If you have anything to say, just keep looking for me.\"Long Fei did not dare delay any further, and quickly returned to the Long family residence.Liu Feng muttered: \"As long as I am still in the Fire Glass City \u2026 It's just that my days in Fire Glass City are not that long. \"\"Huff \u2026\"Liu Feng sighed heavily, he looked at the sky and muttered: \"Miss, is what you're doing really worth it?\"He was very clear what kind of punishment Fu Xishan would suffer. In his heart, he felt that Fu Xishan was not worth it, but as long as Fu Xishan made a choice, he would fully support him.Looking at the direction in which Long Fei disappeared in, Liu Feng said in a low voice, \"Long Fei, I hope you understand the painstaking effort Miss has put in, and \u2026 \"Love!\"\u2026 \u2026.continued life pill.One would last for three months.This kind of pill was considered heaven defying. Once there was no continuation of the continued life pill, it would immediately die.Other than that.continued life pill has another drawback, that during the time you consume the pill, your cultivation would only be half of its normal level.Three continued life pill would also mean nine months.Simply put, Long Sanfeng only had nine months, and his cultivation was only at war chief realm.After consuming it, Long Sanfeng's vital energy and blood improved greatly. He looked at Long Fei and said, \"Xiao Fei, why would you waste this kind of medicinal pellet on me?\"The price of continued life pill s was heaven-defying.One pill was worth billions of silver.Long Zhanhai was also puzzled: \"Xiao Fei, how did you get a continued life pill? Three of them at the same time. This kind of pellet can only be refined by the Alchemy masters of a few powerful sects. \"Since Grandfather's life was temporarily saved, Long Fei was relieved and said with a smile: \"You don't have to worry about that. Within nine months, I will definitely kill a huge dragon and use its blood essence to reconstruct Grandfather's body.\"He spoke firmly.Long Fei would never let Death take his grandfather's life from his hands!Long Sanfeng and Long Zhanhai's minds tightened because Long Fei's expression was exactly the same as his father's back then. They were both shocked in their hearts.\"Grandfather, you take a good rest. I'll be leaving first.\"Long Fei left.Only Long Zhanhai and Long Sanfeng were left in the room.Long Sanfeng sighed heavily, \"It's all my fault, I was useless. I even had my grandson to help me, this old man. Sigh \u2026\"\"Dad, don't say that.\"As you can see, Long Fei is different from before. He can take charge of himself now, and his calm, unyielding, and unyielding spirit is even stronger than third brother's. I'm starting to believe in him a little now. \" Long Zhanhai slightly said.\"Believe what?\"\"I believe that he will be able to kill a gigantic dragon and use its dragon blood to rebuild your body within nine months.\"\"You are also stunned? Where is the dragon? You said that you could kill a huge dragon just by killing it? \"\"Father, I know that it will be extremely difficult, but I still believe in him, just like how none of us thought he would know about the dragon salyer.\"There is no justification for such trust.They just believed him!Long Sanfeng thought for a while, then asked: \"Have you made any plans for Xiao Fei's training?\"Long Zhanhai immediately said: \"I really want to discuss this with you, I want to bring Long Fei into the Long family's army.\"\"Huh?\"Long Sanfeng's expression changed.He had thought of all the cultivation arrangements for Long Fei, but he didn't think that Long Zhanhai would actually want to throw Long Fei into the Long family's army, \"Long Fei is only in the war spirit Realm now, he wouldn't even be able to live in that kind of environment.\"As his grandfather, the first thing he was worried about was Long Fei's safety.Long Zhanhai knew that the old man would object, and said immediately, \"Father, Long Fei's potential is much greater than what we imagined, and \u2026 I really can't find a suitable place for Xiao Fei to cultivate, and the hundreds of thousands of barren mountains that the Long family's army is stationed at is the best place, and I want him to be acknowledged by the Long family's army. I want him to completely take over the Long family's army, not because of his identity as a Dragon God warrior, nor because of the deterrence of the dragon salyer, and not even as the Long family's patriarch, but because of his own strength to make the Long family's army acknowledge him.That was what he was thinking.Long Sanfeng went silent. This arrangement was indeed good, but the test was too heavy.\"Can't we wait for him to grow a little longer?\" Long Sanfeng was still very worried. He was just a grandson, and he felt that he owed Long Fei's father, but he didn't want to owe this grandson of his anymore.Long Zhanhai slightly said: \"Our Long family doesn't have much time left.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After consuming a few high grade pellets, his eyes slightly opened, \"The supreme artifact's strength is too strong, even a half of a dragon salyer would be incomparably strong.\"\"Nangong Huo this dog of a father and son, using me as your cannon fodder, this debt will be settled sooner or later.\" Nangong Lie said in anger.Nangong Lei walked over and asked: \"Father, are you alright?\"Nangong Lie stood up and said: \"I'm fine. I was injured by the dragon salyer's Qi and will be able to recover in half a year's time. Why didn't you tell me about the dragon salyer beforehand?\"\"Err \u2026\"Nangong Huo's expression slightly changed as he said, \"This child didn't know that father was going to the Long family, so I didn't have the time to tell you.\"\"Forget it!\"\"Nangong Huo is being too hasty, I don't have time to tell you.\" Nangong Lie exhaled, then he thought of Long Fei and asked: \"When did the Long family produce a genius in martial arts? He can actually block a move of mine that would cause the sea of fury to boil! \"He was at the war master ream realm, not to mention the realm of the war spirit, even if he was an expert at the peak of the war chief, he would be able to kill him in one move.However \u2026Long Fei actually managed to neutralize his attack.This was not something that could be done on a normal day.Nangong Lei immediately thought of Long Fei and said: \"He is that Long Fei whose dragon blood was drawn out and whose Pubes was shattered. I don't know what fortuitous encounter he had in the past half year, but his cultivation has advanced by leaps and bounds, training in all kinds of powerful and mysterious techniques, this child guesses, could it be that the secret of the dragon salyer was discovered by him?\"\"Impossible!\"Nangong Lie immediately denied it and said: \"Half of the dragon salyer is simply unable to solve the secret within, the other half \u2026\" After a moment of silence, Nangong Lie said: \"The other half is in the hands of that old bastard Nangong Wudi.\"Huh?\" Nangong Lei's heart skipped a beat, he did not know that the half of the dragon salyer was in the hands of the Nan Gong Family.Nangong Lie slightly said: \"To be honest, I have yet to test it out. If he isn't war master ream, then he must be a super madman.\"Forcefully releasing the war master ream's Qi all this time consumed a lot of his life force.Moreover.In the last move, he had released all of his dragon blood essence. If not for the war master ream, he would not have lived for more than three days.And then \u2026Nangong Lie slightly said: \"Even if Lunatic Long is a war master ream, his injuries are still heavier than mine and he won't be able to recover in one or two years.\"\"Right!\"\"If Nangong Huo asks, you can tell him that Lunatic Long is a war master ream cultivator, and must make that old fellow, Nangong Wudi, nervous.\" Nangong Lie's eyes slightly narrowed as he muttered, \"Nangong Wudi, you have been at peace for so many years, it's time for you to get nervous.\"\"As you command.\"\u2026 \u2026.When Nangong Lei left the secret room, his mind was still thinking about the dragon salyer and Long Fei.Does this son-in-law want it or not?The half of a dragon salyer was actually taken away by the Nangong Imperial Family, concealing a secret that had been hidden for thousands of years.If they were to let the Nan Gong Family snatch the dragon salyer from Long Fei's hands and merge them, then the secret of the dragon salyer would definitely be found out by Nangong Wudi.As the Patriarch of the Nangong Imperial Clan, he had to consider the future of the clan.Moreover.He had always wanted to restore his family's previous name!\"Father!\"Just as Nangong Lie was in a daze, Nangong Yan ran over.An excited smile hung on Nangong Yan's face as he said: \"Father, who are you looking for?\"There were two people standing behind Nangong Yan.One was a young genius while the other was an old man in a black robe. The old man's eyes gave off a terrifying aura.Nangong Lei immediately went up to welcome him, knelt on one knee, and said with a heavy tone: \"Greetings, Master!\"The black-robed old man gently raised his right hand and a wave of true breath pulled Nangong Lei's knee, and said: \"You are now Prince Nan Gong, so you don't have to be so courteous to me.\"The young talent politely said: \"Greetings Uncle Nangong.\"Nangong Lei was slightly taken aback, \"This is...\"Nangong Yan was overjoyed, \"Daddy, you don't even remember Big Brother Dongfang Jian?\"\"Aiya!\"\"It's a small sword. It's already grown so big.\" Nangong Lei was shocked, it had been a few years since they last met and he almost could not recognize it, but then again, what about Dongfang Jian's cultivation? Very strong. The battle qi on his body was the strongest existence among the younger generation that he had ever seen.Nangong Yan said: \"Big brother Jian is already a war chief, Daddy, is he powerful?\"Dongfang Jian smiled humbly and said: \"Break through the war elder realm within a year.\"\"Huh?\"Nangong Lei was even more shocked in his heart.It had to be known that he was the true descendant of a sect. His cultivation was completely different from an ordinary martial artist's. It was as if ordinary people were unorthodox, and he was the true descendant.In the same batch, no one was their match.This was also the reason why many people wanted to enter the sect.The Heaven Sect was the number one sect in Fire Glass Dynasty, an existence with a powerful force.Moreover.Dongfang Jian's father was even the vice sect master and could be said to be a favored son of heaven. Even the princes of the Nangong Imperial Family couldn't compare to him.\"Good, good, good!\"Nangong Lei kept praising her.And then \u2026The black-robed elder said slightly, \"I heard from Yan'er that Prince Nangong's estate has met with some trouble recently?\"Nangong Yan coldly snorted, and said disdainfully: \"Isn't it that arrogant Long Family, repeatedly forcing my father to marry that trash, Long Fei?\"\"If it wasn't for the Emperor giving me the right to marry, I wouldn't have agreed at all to the Long family's coercion.\"\"There isn't a single good thing in the Long family that can bully others with power. This time you even want me \u2026\" You want me to. \"Woo woo \u2026\"As he spoke \u2026Nangong Yan started to sob softly.His acting skills were even better than that of the Oscars.Dongfang Jian immediately took a step forward, and asked with concern: \"Little Sister Yan, what does he want from you? As long as I am here, if anyone in Fire Glass City dares to bully you, I will kill them all with a single sword. \"Nangong Yan was overjoyed in his heart. He immediately leaned into Dongfang Jian's embrace pitifully and said: \"Big Brother Jian, he wants me to accompany her \u2026 \"Woo woo \u2026\"In the end, she cried even harder.Dongfang Jian's battle qi suddenly surged, and she bellowed: \"You dog, I think he's tired of living, I'll go and kill him right now!\"He couldn't suppress his rage any longer.Nangong Yan was ecstatic, but on the surface, he still looked pitiful. \"He can even kill a level 7 expert of the war chief, I'm afraid Big Brother Jian \u2026\"\"Huh?\"\"The seventh level of the war chief is nothing.\"\"I can kill a seventh level war chief with one finger.\" Dongfang Jian became even more unhappy and shouted: \"Tell me where his house is located, I'll kill him right now.\"As he spoke, he raised his sword and charged forward.\"Jian'er, don't act recklessly.\" Looking at Nangong Lei, he said, \"Isn't the Long family the weakest family in the four pillars? \"How...?\"Nangong Lei laughed bitterly: \"The Long family has brought back the dragon salyer.\"\"Huh?\"\"Fire Glass City's number one holy artifact?\" The old man in black was slightly surprised, \"No wonder!\"Nangong Yan said in a spoiled manner, \"Father, I don't care, I don't want to marry that trash. Even if I die, I won't marry him.\"\"I want to end the engagement!\"With Dongfang Jian and the black-robed old man here, Nangong Yan felt that this was an excellent opportunity.Her talent and cultivation could not be considered to be outstanding. However, she knew how to use her advantage and power. This was her intelligence.If the Chao Tian Sect was going to back her up, then she would be fearless. So what if the Emperor bestowed her a marriage?Dongfang Jian was overjoyed, and immediately said: \"Little Sister Yan, I support you!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If we want to end the engagement, I'm afraid it won't be that simple.\"The black-robed old man looked at Dongfang Jian and said, \"What's a mere war master ream to you?\"Dongfang Jian said proudly: \"Uncle Chen, you can kill a low level war master expert in one move, you don't have to worry, Uncle Nan Gong.\"Nangong Yan once again said in a spoiled manner: \"Daddy, just let your daughter end the engagement, Big Brother Jian is ten thousand times better than him, if you want to marry me, you have to marry a man like Big Brother Jian, you don't need to marry a piece of trash.\"Dongfang Jian was even more agitated in his heart, to the point where he nearly hugged Nangong Yan tightly.He trained wholeheartedly, how could he be a match for Nangong Yan in terms of emotions?In terms of playing with emotions, Nangong Yan was as pure as fire. She was simply an expert amongst experts!From the very first moment Dongfang Jian saw her, he was infatuated with her.It was also at this time.The old butler hurried over and whispered, \"Your highness, there is an urgent report from the underworld.\"\"Huh?\"Nangong Lei slightly shouted: \"What urgent matter? Can't you see that I have an important guest here? \"The old steward replied, \"It's about the Dragon clan's great ancestor. It's very urgent, you see \u2026\"The old man in black said slightly: \"You should go take a look. We will stay in Fire Glass City for a while and arrange for a disciple recruitment event for the Heaven Sect at the beginning of next year.\"Hearing that, Nangong Yan was ecstatic, and said: \"Brother Jian, you will also stay, right?\"He thought to himself: \"Since the Heaven Sect is recruiting disciples, I must enter the Heaven Sect. As long as I enter the Heaven Sect, I can get rid of that trash, Long Fei.\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"His heart was abnormally excited.Dongfang Jian immediately nodded his head, and said: \"En, I will also be staying in Fire Glass City for a while. Little Sister Yan, are you coming with me to the Heaven Sect?\"Nangong Yan feebly said: \"Is that really possible? My cultivation is still lacking a little bit more to qualify for it. \"\"Hahaha \u2026\" Dongfang Jian had a complacent look on his face as he said: \"Others might need your qualifications, but you don't. As long as my father says it, you can immediately become an inner disciple. Don't worry.\"Nangong Yan was overjoyed as she asked weakly, \"Is it really possible?\"\"Of course!\"Dongfang Jian was very pleased with himself.It was also at this time.Nangong Lei walked over, his face carrying an excited smile, and said: \"Yan'er, didn't you say you want to end the marriage? This is a good opportunity. \"He already knew everything about Lunatic Long.He speculated that there was a high chance that Dragon Madman wasn't war elder realm, he was forcefully releasing it, and his body was already severely injured.This was a perfect opportunity.Moreover.The Long family didn't dare to refuse!Nangong Yan was overjoyed, and said: \"Father, is it true?\"\"Humph!\"\"Long Fei, I can finally get rid of you.\" Nangong Yan coldly snorted. Thinking back to what happened at martial-arts arena that day, she felt extremely unhappy in her heart.\"I've already sent someone to inform the Long family.\"Nangong Lei had his own plans.Originally, this marriage could have continued, after all, there was still a layer of alliance between this and the Long family.However \u2026After he heard about the matter with the dragon salyer, he felt extremely upset. Coincidentally, Dongfang Jian's appearance allowed him to see a trace of hope.Dongfang Jian was the only son of the Arching Sky Sect's Vice Sect Master. As long as he was firmly held in his hands, he did not have to fear anyone. As long as he made good use of them, he would be able to control everything. At that time, the ancestors' wishes might be fulfilled and he could change his surname!\u2026 \u2026.Long family, Scripture Pavilion.The Long family's Scripture Pavilion encompassed a myriad of mysterious cultivation techniques and martial skills. There were also some mysterious places on the continent, such as forbidden areas, dangerous areas, and even places outside the continent.\"So god's martial continent is divided into five regions.\"\"Fire Glass Dynasty resides in the South Horizon Region, and is the weakest of the five great plates.\" Long Fei muttered, he searched through the books for information on the dragon race, but could not find anything.Long Fei spent the next few days in the Scripture Pavilion.They were looking for a gathering place for the dragons.It was just that \u2026Except for the occasional dragon.Giants were always hidden in the gold mines. They loved things that glittered with golden light.What huge dragon? They were hiding in the depths of the sea? They were the overlords of the seas.Furthermore, some dragon clan was hidden in the Heavenly Palace and looked down at the entire god's martial continent.Some are even more outrageous, saying that the dragon race's illusions are hidden in the crowd and they are constantly staring at you.\u2026 \u2026.Long Fei saw all these and felt his head hurt.And then \u2026Long Fei took out another 'Heavenly Dragon's Will' book, casually flipped through a few pages, and discovered another bleak book. Just like some broken eggs in his previous life, he muttered in his heart, \"Could it be that there are people who write novels in this world?\"He skipped over some content and flipped to the last page.\"From Old Man Tianlong's travels.\"\"F * ck!\"\"It really is a novel written by a person who has nothing better to do.\" Long Fei cursed, and then was attracted by a few small words at the bottom of the book, \"The dragon race once dominated the sky, and after the birth of the human Rankers, they were gradually driven out of the Five Regions and disappeared into the continent, hiding in some mysterious corner. However, there were a few dragon races that did not leave, but because in the swamp mountains, there was the Dragon clan's ancestor that once massacred the dragon, and then in the Great Desolate Mountain, with a single thought, they killed all living beings \u2026\"\"Huh?\"Long Fei frowned, \"The Long family's ancestor should be Long Zhan Tian, could it be that the wild fire in the Great Desolate Mountain was spouted by a huge dragon?\"\"What kind of place is the Great Desolate Mountain?\"\"It feels so familiar.\"\"I feel like I've heard it somewhere.\" Long Fei kept thinking about it, but he couldn't think of anything, \"Grandfather only has nine months of life, I must kill a huge dragon and find a large amount of dragon blood to rebuild grandfather's body. I definitely won't let this relative leave me.\"\"Great Desolate Mountain, Great Desolate Mountain \u2026\" Just where is it? \"It was also at this time.Long Zhanhai walked into the Scripture Pavilion and saw that there were various types of books surrounding Long Fei. All of these books were unusual legends, invented by a few bored people, and could not help but say: \"Long Fei, the things recorded in these books are not to be trusted.\"\"Err \u2026\"\"Uncle.\" Long Fei came back to reality and asked: \"Looking for me?\"Long Zhanhai frowned and said: \"The King Nan Gong Residence has sent a message, they want us to go to the prince's mansion tomorrow morning.\"\"F * * k!?\"\"How arrogant. If there's anything to talk about, then come to the Long family's residence. Why should we go to his residence?\" Long Fei said in an unhappy tone, \"Before even settling the matter of Nangong Lie injuring Grandfather, he came to find us first.\"Indeed.Long Zhanhai was also dissatisfied in his heart, but the current Long Family simply did not have the strength to contend against Nangong Lei.Moreover.Just today, during the morning assembly, Nangong Lei had said that the Long Family Army had not contributed much in the past few years, just like raising a bunch of pigs.The Long family's army was stationed in hundreds of thousands of barren mountains to protect the Fire Glass Dynasty, and they were in the most dangerous position.It was all the fault of the Long family that they were still too weak. Otherwise, they wouldn't have ended up like this.Long Zhanhai said slightly: \"Rest early tonight, put on some clothes tomorrow, and come with me to the prince's mansion.\"After saying that, Long Zhanhai wanted to say something but hesitated. In the end, he did not say it out, as he faintly guessed that he had to go to the Nan Gong Residence this time \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The pavilion was a fake mountain, and the small bridge was flowing with water. It was extremely luxurious. It was enormous and imposing, as if a huge beast was occupying the courtyard. Furthermore, the courtyard was placed in an orderly manner with extreme care. It even gave him the feeling that there was a powerful formation hidden within it.Long Zhanhai reminded him in a low voice: \"Wait a moment, don't say anything.\"Long Fei nodded: \"Got it.\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"General Long, you're here. Hurry, come in.\" A housekeeper came out to welcome them and said, \"The prince has been waiting for you inside for a long time.\"The person who greeted him was only a butler.If it was at the peak of the Long family's power, Nangong Lei would definitely not dare to do so.This time, this time.Long Zhanhai laughed: \"I've made your highness wait a long time.\"In the main hall.Nangong Lei first looked at Long Fei, and then said to Long Zhanhai: \"I had originally wanted to go to holy dragon mansion to discuss this matter, but recently, my body has been feeling a little unwell, and I can only let General Long come to my residence, I am truly sorry.\"He said he was sorry, but he didn't have any intention of apologizing.His tone and eyes were filled with cold arrogance.Long Fei was unhappy.Long Zhanhai laughed: \"It's the same no matter where we go, it's also the same when we come to the prince's mansion. I just wonder, why does the Prince want us to come here to discuss something? \"Nangong Lei squinted his eyes as he forced a smile.At this moment.Two people walked out from the back room. The first to walk out was a woman.Wearing white clothes, a complacent smile appeared on his face. He was like a celestial fairy, devoid of worldly pleasures and beauty, but his eyes were filled with coldness.Nangong Yan, Fire Glass Dynasty's number one beauty.He had to say it.Nangong Yan was really beautiful.That pair of ice-cold eyes were filled with endless charm, and her figure was like a water snake. She was innately bewitching, and no man could resist her.Simply put, it was hard for others to stop. They all wanted to go all out.However \u2026Nangong Yan coldly glanced at Long Fei, and directly grabbed onto the arm of a young man. The contempt on his face grew even stronger, and he directly said: \"Father, if you can't say it, then I'll say it.\"Without waiting for her to finish speaking, Long Zhanhai frowned and suddenly stood up, then said with slight anger: \"My prince, what do you mean by this? Nangong Yan is Long Fei's fiancee, but now, she is holding onto the hand of another man.Nangong Yan held Dongfang Jian's hand with a face full of happiness and intimacy. When Long Zhanhai said this, she leaned her head into Dongfang Jian's embrace even more.Men and women weren't close with each other, and yet they had done such a thing. They had completely disregarded the Long family.Dongfang Jian's face was full of pride as he held Nangong Yan tightly.Nangong Yan sneered: \"General Long, my meaning is very simple. I want to cancel the engagement.\"\"Huh?\"Long Zhanhai frowned, unknowingly, he released the war chief's Profound Spirit Qi between his brows, staring at Nangong Lei, he said: \"Reject the marriage? The Emperor bestowed the marriage, and the Grand Elder nodded. You want to end the marriage? Your Highness, I can treat today's matter as a joke and it has never happened before. \"He had thought about the consequences.However, she never expected that Nangong Yan would actually dare to cancel the engagement, and even call them over to her own home to end the engagement. This was bullying, this was not putting the Long family in his eyes at all.Too arrogant.The cold expression on Nangong Yan's face and the complacent expression in his eyes were both extremely arrogant.Nangong Lei did not speak.Nangong Yan said: \"The reason I called you over this time is to let you go to the emperor to propose a marriage annulment, the emperor will definitely agree to it. As for the grand master of the Long family, that is a matter for your Long family, don't worry, after the marriage annulment, I will definitely give you a satisfactory compensation.\"\"You've gone too far!\"Long Zhanhai trembled violently, the aura of the peak war chief was released unscrupulously, forming a strong Qi, that swept out and directly destroyed all the chairs in the hall.More than that.He even wanted the Long family to tell the emperor.He was humiliating the Long family, simply going too far.\"Heh heh.\"\"Is the war chief realm amazing?\"At this moment.Dongfang Jian sneered, the battle qi on his body suddenly stirred, the fierce tiger roared, and blocked the attack from Long Zhanhai in an instant.And it was crushing.Long Zhanhai's brows tightened, \"Sect's orthodoxy?\"The battle qi cultivated by the sect disciples were different from the battle qi cultivated by them. In terms of aura, the orthodox power of the sect was much stronger, and it was difficult to be inferior to those of the same rank.Dongfang Jian laughed disdainfully, then said: \"I still have some experience, I don't care if you are some dog fart Long family, or some dog fart four pillars family. If my Yan Sis wants to end the engagement, you better obediently do as she says, otherwise \u2026 \"Heh heh \u2026\" Dongfang Jian sneered, his eyes filled with killing intent, and said: \"I will make you regret ever being born into this world.\"\"Boom!\"With that said, the battle qi on Dongfang Jian's body surged, and pounced towards Long Zhanhai.\"Bang, bang.\"Long Zhanhai staggered backwards, and only after taking a few steps did he stabilize himself. His face was pale, and his breathing was unstable.\"Great, great, big brother Jian is great.\"Nangong Yan acted like a little woman, and was extremely excited. He looked at Long Zhanhai with disdain: \"General Long, you have seen his cultivation, too.\"\"Only such an expert is worthy to be my, Nangong Yan's, husband. As for Long Fei \u2026\" Nangong Yan sneered, and said: \"A waste of Negative Activation to Dragon Blood simply doesn't have the qualifications to marry me, nor the qualifications to lick my shoes.\"\"Long Fei, you are just a toad, understand?\"\"In this life, I will never like you, much less marry you. Just give up on this thought. I only like brother Jian.\"Nangong Yan ruthlessly stepped on Long Fei to emphasize her superiority. After she finished speaking, she snuggled closer into Dongfang Jian's embrace.Dongfang Jian was the only son of the Vice Sect Master of the Heaven Sect.He could give himself too much to want.Moreover.He could directly bring him into the Heaven Sect, could Long Fei do that? No!Could Long Fei give him the sect's cultivation resources? No!Long Fei couldn't give her anything!His current strength was not bad, but his Negative Activation to Dragon Blood was his weak point. In addition, his Pubes had shattered and his veins were congealing, making it difficult for him to achieve much in the martial way. Thus, following him would only make him wait for this tiny Fire Glass City.She didn't want to spend the rest of her life with a good-for-nothing.Nangong Yan looked at the silent Long Fei, thinking that she had shocked him. He became even more pleased with himself and laughed: \"Big Brother Jian, see if he was shocked silly by your battle qi or not.\"Dongfang Jian also laughed complacently: \"With just a finger, I can kill this kind of trash.\"Long Zhanhai was furious.Long Fei could not hold it in any longer and asked, \"Uncle, can I talk?\"\"If you don't speak now, I'm going to suffocate to death!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With your looks? Your figure? I'm sick of it. \"\"Brother, do you think she's still as pure as ice and jade? Hahaha \u2026\"\"Then you're wrong.\"\"Her body has already been rotted by me. How could someone as idiotic as you be fooled by her? Look at her pretentious look, she's even more deadly in bed.\" Long Fei laughed and said, \"Aiya, big brother, could it be that you have such a good mouth? Then you must be careful, don't get infected by any strange diseases. \"\"Long Fei!\" Nangong Lei suddenly shouted.Nangong Yan seemed as if he was stepped on by a cat as he said flustered and exasperatedly: \"Long Fei, what nonsense are you spouting?\"At this time.Dongfang Jian released Nangong Yan, and his face turned ice-cold.Nangong Yan anxiously said: \"Big brother Jian, he is speaking nonsense, he is framing me, how can I possibly take a fancy to trash like him?\"Long Fei laughed, and said: \"Big brother, you don't believe me, right? \"If you don't believe me, you can look at her knees. I can guarantee that there are still bruises on her knees, and when she kneeled in front of me that day, she was so strong, what the hell. Normal people can't resist it.\"\"You know that posture, hehe.\"A few days ago, he was forced to kneel on the ground by the grand duke's oppressive aura.Even if she was cured, her kneecap must still be bruised.Nangong Yan was so angry that his hair almost stood up straight. He glared at Long Fei and wished that he could tear him into a thousand pieces. He screamed, \"Long Fei, I will kill you!\"Playing tricks?A feeling of superiority?Was Nangong Yan worthy to be Long Fei's opponent?Too weak!It was simply too weak.Long Fei had a look of fear on his face as he said, \"Big brother, did you see that? Being exposed her scars means that she is about to be silenced. Aren't you being too vicious? \"\"Ah... \"Ah \u2026\" Nangong Yan was so angry that he went berserk, he pulled Dongfang Jian's hand and said: \"It's not like that Big Brother Jian, it's not like that, I really have nothing to do with him.\"\"Sigh \u2026\"Long Fei sighed, put on a look of helplessness, and said: \"Little Sister Yan, please climb the high branch and tell me, I will let you go, in any case, you are not much different from those women from Yi Hong Yuan, I do not mean it, but you cannot lie to this big brother.\"\"Big brother, let me ask you, do you think that someone who had been engaged for several years wouldn't have anything to do with each other?\"\"Look at those alluring eyes of hers. If it were you, would you be able to bear it? I guess you can't stand it, so do you think I'd lie to you? \"\"If you really don't believe me, then check her knees. If there's no injury on her knees, then prove that what I said was false. If there's an injury \u2026\" \"Then you have to be more careful, maybe one day you'll have over a hundred green hats on your head, hahaha \u2026\"Long Zhanhai was stunned, he started to admire Long Fei a little, and praised in his heart: \"Awesome, this mouth of yours can actually kill people, and can even kill people's hearts, hahaha \u2026 Long Fei, good boy! \"Long Zhanhai became angrier: \"Nangong Lei, I never thought that your daughter would be such a person. No wonder she doesn't know how to discipline you, you must be used to it, right?\"\"You!\" Nangong Lei was so angry that he couldn't say a word.He did not expect that Long Fei's words would actually be so powerful.\"It's not like that, Big Brother Jian, it's really not like that.\" Nangong Yan anxiously tried to explain.Dongfang Jian's tone was not as intimate as before, and carried a hint of coldness as he asked, \"Little Sister Yan, if that's not true, then show me your knee.\"\"That will prove your innocence.\"\"And then I'll kill him.\"Long Fei also said, \"Little Sister Yan, let me show you to him. That is the mark of our love.\"\"You shut up!\"Nangong Yan was so angry that she couldn't take care of herself, and she knew very well that the injury on her knee had not healed yet.However \u2026She couldn't explain it either. The more she explained, the paler she became, and the more she couldn't explain it clearly.He hated Long Fei to the bones.Dongfang Jian urged her: \"Little Sister Yan, let me take a look.\"\"Big brother Jian, I really don't have one.\" Nangong Yan held onto her dress tightly.Long Fei laughed: \"If I don't, let him have a look.\"\"Ahh \u2026\"Nangong Yan was going crazy, he rushed towards Xiang Longfei with all his might, \"I want to kill you!\"Long Fei immediately pretended to be afraid, and said: \"Murdering my husband, Little Sister Yan, don't worry, I am indeed tired of playing with your body, but I will take responsibility towards you. If you don't want the child in your stomach, you can give it to me.\"\"Humph!\"Dongfang Jian could not bear it either. Swinging his sleeves, he turned and left with quick steps.Nangong Yan wanted to stop him, but he was pushed off and shouted, \"Nangong Yan, please behave yourself.\"With that, Dongfang Jian walked out of the hall, and quickly left the Duke Palace without looking back. His face was filled with anger.\"No \u2026.\"\"No!\"\"Big Brother Jian, it's really not like what he said.\" Nangong Yan burst into tears, gritting his teeth as he turned to look at Long Fei, screaming in pain, \"Long Fei, I want you dead!\"\"Humph!\"Long Fei's expression became ice-cold as he said: \"With just you?\"Without waiting for him to make a move, the aura of the peak war chief on Long Zhanhai's body suddenly shook, and directly bounced Nangong Yan away, and said coldly: \"Nangong Lei, please control this unscrupulous daughter of yours. If you can't control it, I don't mind teaching you on your behalf!\"The voice boomed.The aura of the peak war chief diffused into every corner of the hall, and was abnormally thick.The anger in Nangong Lei's heart raged, but \u2026 He stood up and stared at Long Fei: \"Since you don't want to break the engagement, then please go back.\"\"No!\"Long Fei smiled slightly and said: \"My prince, I can agree to break off the engagement, but only if \u2026\"Nangong Lei frowned and asked: \"What is it?\"Long Fei revealed an evil smile as he looked at Nangong Yan, and said: \"Let Nangong Yan accompany me for three days and three nights. After you finish accompanying me, I will immediately rescind the engagement.\"He was very clear that Nangong Yan was only a lowly person.Moreover.The natural seductive character that Nangong Yan possessed made it impossible for anyone to reject him.What Long Fei wanted was not love, but flesh!Isn't Nangong Yan noble?[I will turn you into a piece of trash. Let's see if you can remain cold and arrogant.]Treat the enemy.Long Fei would never be merciful, even if it was a woman!\"Long Fei!\"Nangong Lei was furious.Nangong Yan said in a weak voice, \"Father, kill him, kill him...\"Long Fei laughed complacently: \"If you don't agree, then don't, why are you so angry, in three years, she will still be mine, at that time, if I want to play with her for a few days, it's not illegal to play with my own wife, hahaha \u2026\"\"Uncle!\"\"Let's go!\"Long Zhanhai was so impressed that he kneeled down, \"Invincible, too awesome!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Today, he had used his mouth to suppress Nangong Lei, but the Long family's situation would only get worse and worse.To change, it required power!The two of them left the prince's mansion and walked on the main street.Long Zhanhai asked indifferently: \"What do you think?\"Long Fei replied, \"I don't have any ideas.\"\"What?\" Long Zhanhai was startled, then laughed: \"Being bullied like this, how can you not have thoughts? This is not like the arrogant Young Lord of the Long family. \"Long Zhanhai naturally did not believe it.Everything that had happened in the great hall seemed as if they had won, but in reality, the Long family had suffered a crushing defeat.They want to end the engagement, not by coming to your house, but by making you come to his house. Is this called breaking off the engagement?Is there really such an arrogant marriage annulment?Furthermore, Nangong Yan had criticized Long Fei so much in front of him, if she did not have a strong backing, would she dare to do it?The most crucial point.In Long Zhanhai's heart, he had a feeling that Nangong Lei already knew about his Grand Elder's injuries. That was to say that the Long family had Nangong Lei's undercover spy.Long Fei laughed and asked back: \"What do you think?\"Long Zhanhai also laughed: \"My fiancee isn't mine, what thoughts can I have? If it's my fiancee, I'll definitely snatch it, even if I don't like it, I have to snatch it, because I'm a member of the Long family, when has my Long family ever been bullied before?\"\"Are you trying to provoke me?\"Long Fei said: \"Uncle, I am not a three year old child, but I feel that you are right, when have the people of the Long family ever been bullied before? \"Daring to break off your father's engagement is even worse!\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"Long Zhanhai laughed loudly, and said: \"This is the seed of the Long family.\"That's right.Long Zhanhai's expression became solemn, and said: \"I've been thinking about how I can help you during this period, and it was decided just now.\"\"What decision?\" Long Fei was startled.Long Zhanhai grinned excitedly: \"I'm preparing to throw you into the Long family's army.\"Before he left the prince's mansion, he and Long Sanfeng had a trace of apprehension in his heart and was worried for Long Fei's safety.But now.He made up his mind.The time left to the Long family was too little and to Long Fei, too, was too little. He had to let Long Fei quickly mature, and the Long family army stationed in the hundreds of thousands of barren mountains was the best choice.Moreover.Every head of the Long family would enter the Long family's army to train. Only by obtaining the Long family's army's approval would they be able to control the Long family's army and become a Divine Dragon Marquis.Supreme Dragon of the Long family!Long Fei was dumbfounded, \"Uncle, are you throwing me into hell?\"Long Fei knew very well what kind of existence the Long Family's army was. That place was definitely hell, and when the Long Family's army trained people, they would only be doing it in the face of death.\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"Are you scared?\"Long Zhanhai laughed out loud: \"This is a method that I thought of after breaking my brain. You won't disappoint your uncle, will you?\"\"Afraid?\"Long Fei said arrogantly: \"I don't have the word 'afraid' in my dictionary, isn't that the Long Family Army? I'll go. \"\"This is what the Long family is like, hahaha \u2026\" Long Zhanhai was very happy, he was even worried that Long Fei would reject him, from the looks of it, he was overthinking it.Actually.Long Fei himself knew that he needed a place to level up and break through.Nangong Lie's appearance made him realize that he had to quickly break through and level up, so that he could take charge of the Long family and make the families in Fire Glass City that were eyeing him covetously, behave themselves.Grandpa was old, and he couldn't bear any more pain.He had to carry the Long family's banner!Thinking about a very important problem, Long Fei could not help but ask, \"Uncle, where is the Long Family Army stationed at?\"Just by training, these could only strengthen his body. What he wanted was to hunt demon beasts and level up, and he could only hunt demon beasts!Long Zhanhai replied excitedly, \"Hell!\"\"Where is it?\" Long Fei asked.Long Zhanhai said: \"hundreds of thousands of barren mountains, an existence similar to hell.\"\"hundreds of thousands of barren mountains?\" Long Fei's heart tensed up, \"This name feels like I've heard it before, hundreds of thousands of barren mountains, Desolate Mountain \u2026 \"Great Desolate Mountain?\"Suddenly.Long Fei's mind trembled, \"The Great Desolate Mountain of the Wild Fire Prairie?\"\"If that's the case...\"Inexplicably, Long Fei clenched his fists tightly and asked anxiously: When are you going?Long Zhanhai was startled, and asked: \"When do you want to go?\"\"I'll go today!\"\u2026 \u2026.Prince Nangong's manor.Nangong Yan was so angry that he immediately became sick. If his cultivation was not good, he would have been angered to death by Long Fei.At this moment.Nangong Lei's face flushed red. He led Dongfang Jian and the black-robed old man into Nangong Yan's room and asked: \"Yan'er, who did you see to see you?\"Dongfang Jian immediately rushed forward, and blamed himself: \"Little Sister Yan, it's all my fault, it's all my fault, it's all my fault, I should have trusted you.\"The situation had completely changed.Of course.This was because the black robed elder behind him had told him that Nangong Yan was still a virgin.In his heart, he also hated Long Fei to the bones.Nangong Yan's expression changed as tears rolled down his face, \"What are you still doing here? I don't want to see you again.As he spoke, he burst into tears.In actuality, there was no need to mention how happy Nangong Yan was in his heart.But at this time, she had to pretend to be wronged, she had to make Dongfang Jian feel that he owed her.As expected, Dongfang Jian started to get anxious. He looked at Nangong Lei and said: \"Uncle Nan Gong, help me out, it's because I like Little Sister Yan that I'm provoked by Long Fei. I, I, next time I see Long Fei, I must skin him alive.\"The black-robed old man moved slightly, an order badge and an ancient book landed on Nangong Yan's bed, and said, \"These two things can be considered as compensation to you, don't pretend to be wronged in front of Young Master.\"Nangong Yan's expression was a little awkward. Looking at the order badge with the words' inner sect of the Chao Tian Sect 'carved on it, he was overjoyed. This was the order badge for the inner sect disciples of the Chao Tian Sect.With this medallion, he was like an inner disciple of the Heaven Sect.Then, he looked at another ancient book.Nangong Yan was ecstatic, \"Nine Heavens Sword Technique!\"She had heard her father talk about this sword technique before. It was one of the ten great sword techniques of the Heaven Sect, and was at the peak of the ninth level of the Heaven Stage.Nangong Lei was also greatly shocked in his heart. He coughed and said, \"Yan'er, don't be angry anymore. There are still two months until the date of the Purple Taboo Martial Meet. During this period of time, cultivate well, and then, cut off Long Fei's tendons in his limbs and wash away his shame.Nangong Yan immediately turned around and grabbed Dongfang Jian's arm with one hand, and said: \"Big brother Jian, you will teach me, right?\"It instantly became intimate.Dongfang Jian was even more lost in thought, he nodded his head like a chick pecking rice, \"Of course I will!\"Nangong Yan suddenly leaned on Dongfang Jian's shoulder, and a cold glint flashed past his eyes. He swore in his heart: \"Long Fei, I will definitely kill you during the forbidden purple banquet!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She did not dare to raise her head to look at Long Fei as she nodded and said, \"Young Master must take good care of yourself outside as well.\"\"Don't worry.\" Long Fei laughed all over.At this time, Long Shan and the others walked over and said, \"Young master, it's about time.\"Long Fei replied: \"Got it.\"Then.Long Fei said softly to the courtyard: \"Shadow, you have to protect jojo while I'm not around, and don't forget to cultivate as well. Your current cultivation is not qualified to be my shadow.\"He had fought with Shadow last night.Three moves of slay.And this was even under the premise that Long Fei did not use the Toading Skill and dragon salyer technique.There was no sound from the courtyard.Long Fei didn't say much. Seeing jojo lightly kiss her forehead, he said: \"Wait for my return properly!\"After he finished speaking, Long Fei walked out of the courtyard and shouted towards Long Shan and the others, \"Let's go!\"jojo fiddled with the corner of her clothes, her cheeks scarlet red, her body burning with passion. Seeing Long Fei walk far away, her heart immediately became empty as she muttered, \"Young Master, you have to take good care of yourself, okay?\"The shadow's low voice sounded in her ear. \"He's still in a daze. He's already gone far away.\"jojo's face flushed red again.\u2026 \u2026.hundreds of thousands of barren mountains, the border region of Fire Glass Dynasty.The Desolate Mountain was incomparably dangerous.This was also the main way for the Evil Demons to enter the Fire Glass Dynasty.Because of the Long family's protection, not a single Evil Demon had entered the Fire Glass Dynasty's territory in all these years.It could be said that without the Long Family's army, there would be no peace and prosperity for the Fire Glass Dynasty.The Long family's combat ability was extremely valiant.It was the strongest army in the Fire Glass Dynasty. This army was not ordered by the royal family, they were ordered by the Dragon God Warriors, or perhaps by the Supreme Dragon King.And the Dragon God Warriors or the Dragon Family's Supreme Being must obtain their recognition!This time, Long Fei was not the only one who entered the Long family's army. There were also Long Shan and the eight Long family disciples.Ten days later.In a small forest, a bonfire was lit and everyone was gathered in a circle.\"I heard that the hundreds of thousands of barren mountains where the Long Family Army is located in is hell, and ordinary people can't hold on for three days.\"\"It's more than just hell. It's ten thousand times more dangerous than hell.\"\"The Long family's army was trained by the Long family's grand ancestor. They have been standing here for less than ten thousand years because they had the will of their ancestors, the will of the Dragon Soul.\"\"In the past, the eighteen Dragon Cavalry of the Long family had slaughtered countless demons and demons over a hundred thousand miles, and they were so awe-inspiring and awe-inspiring.\"\"The invasion of the demons was blocked by the Long family's army. Without them, the world would not be as peaceful as it is now. I never would have thought that we would have to reduce the military expenditure. I really don't know what the Emperor is thinking.\"\"I heard that the matter of cutting the military expenditure was brought up by Nangong Lei.\"\"Motherf * cker, our Long family is helping the Nangong Family to protect the borders, but they are actually treating us like this. They are too f * cking unhappy.\"\u2026 \u2026.Along the way, the ten people were constantly discussing.They were not very old, the oldest was only twenty years old and they were all hot-blooded. They were very angry about the actions of the Nangong Imperial Clan.They felt indignant for the Long family's army.Long Fei had never thought of these, because these were simple truths, the Long Family was weak!If the Long family was strong, would Nangong Huo dare to reduce the military expenditure?Nangong Lei dared to raise such an objection? It was almost the same as courting death.The change was simple.Strong enough!That was why Long Fei did not participate in these discussions along the way. He took out the Heavenly Dragon Gaze and read it more than ten times, but did not record anything regarding the Great Desolate Mountain's prairie fire.Only the last words of the book.\"In the Great Desolate Mountain, with a single thought, I will kill all living things \u2026\"The person who wrote the book said it was a roaring fire dragon.Long Fei had also checked some records, the hundreds of thousands of barren mountains was called \"Great Desolate Mountain\" tens of thousands of years ago.\"If it really is a fire dragon \u2026 Tens of thousands of years have passed, is that fire dragon still alive? \" Long Fei asked himself, \"No matter if I am there or not, for my grandfather's sake, I have to find it.\"Even if there was the slightest bit of hope, Long Fei would not give up.In this world, the only thing that could save his grandfather was a large amount of dragon blood. He had to find it.Long Shan walked up and said, \"Young master, your mind is very heavy along the way. What are you thinking about? You're not worried about the Long Family's severity are you? \"Everyone gathered around him.They now had incomparable respect for Long Fei.Long Feng replied, \"Young Master, there's no need to worry. No matter what, you're still the young master of the Long family. The Long family's army must also think it over carefully.\"\"Young master, we will help you.\"\"Yes, we will all help you.\"\u2026 \u2026.Long Fei closed the book and laughed lightly: \"Thank you brothers for your kind intentions, but in the army, there will be no young master of the Long Family. We are all rookies, we have to listen to everything you say.\"\"Huh?\"\"You're the young master.\"\"Yeah.\"Long Fei replied, \"It's the same if I'm the Long Family's Patriarch. There's no exception to the Long Family Army. If there's an exception, then I won't be called Long Family Army.\"\"The Long family's army has stood for ten thousand years and is still the strongest army in the Fire Glass Dynasty. They didn't rely on the Long family's ancestors, they relied on their perseverance and will to never lose.\"\"Our entrance into the Long family's army is a trial, so no matter how unfair the situation is, we must endure it!\"He had planned everything before he came.Everyone looked at Long Fei and realised that Long Fei had really changed, becoming more mature than them. The admiration in their hearts grew even deeper.Long Fei stretched his back and said, \"Everyone should rest early. We'll arrive tomorrow.\"Long Shan also urged, \"Disperse, disperse!\"Everyone scattered and slept on the ground.Long Fei looked at the night sky, and thought about the current situation of the Long family. He thought to himself, \"three pillars, the Nangong Imperial Clan, they are all hard bones, and every single one of them is eyeing the Long family like a tiger eyeing its prey.\"\"Grandfather is also severely injured. Currently, uncle Long is the only one left in the Long family. Facing the four great powers that are crushing him, uncle will definitely have a hard time even moving.\"\"I wonder if we can withstand it.\"\"F * ck!\"\"I must become strong! I must let the Long family last for thousands and thousands of years!\"He clenched his fists.Slowly, Long Fei fell asleep in a daze. In his dreams, he saw jojo, he saw Liu Luoxi's smile, he saw Ye Ziyan's youthful and beautiful appearance, he saw Xiao Tiantian's cute and mischievous appearance, he saw Fu Xishan taking off her veil, and he saw his shadow \u2026In his dreams, Long Fei revealed a faint smile.While he was rolling on the bed with these women.Suddenly.He could feel a dangerous aura approaching.At this moment.Long Fei instantly sprung up and fiercely roared, \"Hurry and get up, there's an enemy attack!\"As soon as his voice faded \u2026\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 The sound of orderly footsteps could be heard in the forest.Danger!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He did not flee far away, but silently walked back.\u2026 \u2026.\"Humph!\"\"They're all trash.\" A masked man's eyes were filled with contempt.Long Shan was pushed to the ground by the two of them. He glared at the leader and shouted, \"Who are you? Do you know who we are? \"\"Rub!\"\"You still dare to look at me like that?\" The masked man kicked, \"Does your father care who you are? I am the lord here! \"At this time, a black-robed guard whispered into his ear.The masked man frowned, and laughed coldly: \"Long Fei, you think you can escape? Hahaha... I'll give you a choice. If you want to save your brother, I'll give you your life in exchange! \"\"I have no interest in the lives of these trash. What I want is your life!\"The sound was very loud, covering the entire small forest.There was no response.The masked man said, \"Since when did the Long family have such a cowardly trash? \"How boring!\"There was still no response from the forest!The man's eyes were filled with disdain as he said coldly, \"I'll give you three days to think about it. If you don't appear within these three days, then the nine of them will be beheaded. When that time comes, you can help them collect their corpses, hahaha \u2026\"\"Young master Long?\"\"Humph, he's just a timid junior!\"Finished.The man moved his spear and shouted, \"Tie them up, return to the village!\"\"Hah!\"The many black armored warriors quickly tied up the nine Dragon clan disciples.\u2026 \u2026.\"Who is it?\"\"Nangong Lei's people? A member of the royal family? Or Zhuge Tianlong, Li Chongtian's people? \"In the darkness.Long Fei's mind raced as he thought about it. He was sure that this was a premeditated ambush, and he knew the path they were going along from the beginning.The Long family absolutely kept the fact that they were going to the Long family's army a secret.Moreover.They had all quietly left the city, and the only people who knew about this were Long Zhanhai and a few of the elders from the Long family.If that was the case...Long Fei's heart tensed up, \"The current situation of the Long family is just too dangerous.\"\"To the Long family's army!\"Long Fei did not rush out in a hurry to save Long Shan and the others. He was very clear that he alone was not enough to fight against the black armored warriors.The masked man was even an expert of the war chief Realm.The only way was to find the Long Family's troops and have them send out their troops to crush these black-armored soldiers.And then \u2026Long Fei quickly rushed out.\"Long Shan, all of you must hold on!\"\u2026 \u2026.After a night of running, Long Fei did not rest for even a second.At daybreak.Long Fei walked to the entrance of a huge mountain stronghold. On top of the stronghold hung a flag with the word 'Dragon' written on it.Long Fei immediately shouted: \"Open up, open up!\"One of the Long family guards looked at Long Fei seriously and his expression immediately changed. He shouted angrily, \"Where did this little thief come from? Scram! \"Long Fei shouted: \"I am the disciple of the Long family, Long Fei, I want to meet your General!\"\"A Long Clan disciple?\"\"Long Fei?\"\"I've never heard of it. Do you have any proof?\" The guard asked.\"A certificate?\"Long Fei was dumbstruck.This time they didn't bring anything, the only tokens that the Long family disciples had, if one were to say that the proof was only from the Dragon Bloodline blood lineage in their bodies, however \u2026 The Negative Activation to Dragon Blood in his body basically did not have any proof of a blood lineage.Long Fei became anxious and said: \"I am really a member of the Long family. Please inform them that I was attacked on my way here, all nine of our brothers have been captured.\"\"What's your name without proof?\"\"In my opinion, you are an evil spy. Are you going or not? \"If you don't leave, I'll give the order to fire the arrows.\" The guard shouted, and the crossbow wielder suddenly appeared and pulled the bow and arrows, locking onto Long Fei who was below the mountain stronghold.This scene shocked Long Fei.He thought that since there weren't many people guarding this mountain village, who would have thought that there would be so many crossbows hidden? If he were to barge in, he would definitely be courting death.The Long family army was indeed extraordinary!It was also at this time.A man with the appearance of a deputy general walked out and coldly snorted, \"What are you arguing about? Can't you let me sleep now? \"\"Reporting to Vice General Chen, there is a person below who claims to be a disciple of the Long family. He said that he was ambushed in the mountains and wants us to send troops to help him.\" The guard said truthfully.Vice General Chen was shocked, and said loudly: \"Could it be those bandits from skyline camp?\"\"What?\"\"You need our help?\"\"Who does he think he is? Even the Emperor back then didn't have the qualifications to make us send out troops. You, a mere disciple of the Long family, want me to send out troops? Who are you? Long family's Zhi Zun? Vice General Chen disdainfully shouted, \"Brat, you better get the hell away from me. Otherwise, don't blame me for being rude.\"\"You can't even take out the proof, and you're still talking about the disciples of the Long family. Tsk!\"\"The disciples of the Long family have never seen their own brothers being captured and fleeing for their lives. One look at you and you tell them that you're not one, or that you're just a useless trash who's as timid as a mouse.\"Vice General Chen's eyes were filled with contempt.Long Fei was enraged, \"Fuck you, just you wait!\"\"One day, you will kneel before me!\"He didn't think that the Long family would have such an appearance.What Fire Glass City's number one legion, they were a proud and arrogant army, Long Fei did not even hold any hope for them anymore.Since they were not willing to send troops to help, Long Fei would definitely not lower himself to plead with them.He turned around and left!At the same time.He silently muttered in his heart: 'skyline camp right?\"\u2026 \u2026.Just as Long Fei was about to leave, Vice General Chen could not hold back his laughter, \"Kid, this is the first stage. If you are unable to pass this stage, you will never be able to enter the Long family's army!\"One of the guards asked, \"Boss, aren't you being a little too strict?

He really didn't like to think.Meng Yue stared at Hu Shan who was waving his fan: \"San Ye, what do you think?\"Hu Shan waved his fan, and said indifferently: \"We are following orders, we do not need to think about it. It doesn't matter if Long Fei runs away, or if he doesn't leave, it has nothing to do with us.\"Meng Yue said: \"Then what about General Yun's orders?\"Hu Shan said, \"There's no need for an explanation. General Yun is only giving Long Fei one chance, he can't fight for it is his own affair, if he gives up, it won't affect us at all, we would be happy and free.\"Meng Yue replied: \"A bit more direct.\"Hu Shan said with a smile, \"We'll just follow the orders from the higher-ups. Since the Patriarch has ordered it to be the highest difficulty, then so be it!\"\"Alright!\"\"I'll do it this way, double my military defense.

Staying here is really annoying.\" Meng Yue relaxed the center of his brows, leaned on the tiger head chair and fell into a deep sleep.\u2026 \u2026.'skyline camp!\"Long Fei stood on a tree with dense leaves and raised his head to look at the cliff that was towering amidst the clouds.In the Heaven's Danger mountain stronghold, it was easy to defend, but hard to attack.If the Long family wasn't willing to send out troops, then he could only rely on himself.He didn't run away. Give up on his brother? He couldn't do it!The reason was very simple. It was because they were their own brothers, the elites of the Long family. For their brothers, for the sake of the Long family, Long Fei would not give up on them.Long Fei spent the entire day familiarizing himself with the terrain of the place.There was only one road leading up to the mountain and it was patrolled by six lackeys. Moreover, there was a beacon next to the mountain gate. As long as one ignited it, they could see inside the village.If he wanted to avoid being discovered by the higher ups, he could only finish off six people in an instant.Besides these six.Within two hours, four patrolling teams would be coming to change shifts.If he wanted to save someone within two hours, he would be discovered!It would take them an hour to reach the top of the mountain. It would be too difficult to save Long Shan and the others within two hours.It was completely impossible!Furthermore, they did not know what the situation in the village was like.\"No way!\"Long Fei repeated calculated in his mind. No matter when, he couldn't do it in terms of time or other conditions.And then \u2026Long Fei continued to look at the terrain.He walked to the bottom of the cliff and discovered that he was in a huge lake.Long Fei dove head first into the lake, but the bottom of the lake could not be seen.The cliff was two thousand meters high. If he jumped down from here \u2026\"With the cultivation bases of Long Shan and the rest of them, they shouldn't fall to their deaths. However, the risk is too high.\" Long Fei lifted his head to look at the cliff once again, but he denied it in his heart.The lake was indeed big, but if the wind changed, then there would be a huge deviation. At that time, the result would be death!Long Fei could not take his brother's life as a joke.Following that \u2026Long Fei thought of a new method.Time passed bit by bit.In the blink of an eye, night came. The night patrol did not relax at all.One day passed.Long Fei still did not think of the best way.Moreover.In this case, there was no best way.\u2026 \u2026.skyline camp Meeting Room.\"The first day has passed.\"\"That kid didn't react at all, and our people didn't find any trace of him either. Clearly, that kid has escaped.\"\"I guess we scared him to death some night, hahaha...\"\"The three great generals are right. Negative Activation to Dragon Blood people are simply unworthy of being the Long family's patriarch, and even more unworthy of being the commander of the Long family's army.\"\"There are only two days left!\" Meng Yue muttered, \"Brat, admit defeat. Even if the skyline camp had thousands of troops, they still wouldn't be able to get close to it.The difficulty of the mission was too high.In the history of the Long family army, there had never been a person who had passed such a difficult test.Even if it was the Grand Preceptor, it would only be in the third level of difficulty.At that time, he was still in the war chief Realm and Long Fei was only at the second level of the war spirit;\u2026 \u2026.The next day.Long Fei was still observing.He noticed.There were only a few people patrolling outside the mountain gate, and it was just ten people patrolling around. Moreover \u2026 There must be a lounge halfway up the hill.Although it was just a small discovery, it had given Long Fei a pleasant surprise, and his confidence to enter the skyline camp increased by another level.\u2026 \u2026.At daybreak.Long Fei came to the lakeside again, and observed the wind here.The second day passed!Everything was still calm.In many people's hearts, Long Fei had already given up.At the Long Army's headquarters.Long Feng laughed, \"Junior sister Yun, don't hold any hope for him. Long Fei is not his father, and even his father would find it hard to pass the hardest exam to pass.\"Long Lei also laughed: \"The Patriarch is crazy, he actually gave the order to use the most difficult mission to test Long Fei.\"Long Lei replied, \"He definitely knows that we won't agree to it, so he did it this way. If it's the normal difficulty, then since that kid passed, wouldn't we have to listen to him?\" The Supreme Dragon Elder of Negative Activation to Dragon Blood, wouldn't he be laughed to death by others? \"A girl with red skin, wearing a suit of armor, looking valiant and formidable.Long Yun.She was also the only female out of the four generals of the Long family.Long Yun clenched his fists and said, \"I believe him!\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"junior sister apprentice, I believe it's useless. This world relies on strength to speak!\"The other three generals laughed.\u2026 \u2026.On the third day, everything was still very calm.Meng Yue laughed: \"Looks like that brat really escaped back to Fire Glass City. I will send someone to report to the headquarters tomorrow morning to the four generals!\"\"Yes sir!\"\u2026 \u2026.In the wee hours of the morning, when people were at their most tired!A black shadow forced its way into the mountain gate \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Let's go back and sleep.\"\u2026 \u2026.The six of them began to casually chat.They did not know that danger was approaching.\"Shua!\"Long Fei suddenly jumped out from three meters away from one of them, \"Mountain-hit Fist!\"\"Bam!\"A fist flew through the air and hit a tree, causing him to faint on the spot.Without waiting for the five to react, Long Fei took a step forward, and like a ghost, he neared the second person, and threw a punch downwards!\"Bam!\"The man's head was hit and he fainted on the ground.Kneel down, \"Toading Skill!\"\"Shua!\"He crashed into a guard, sending him flying!\"There are three more people!\"Long Fei did not stop there. Furthermore, he did not use the true breath either, so killing someone at this time was not a wise move, because if one could not kill the opponent, they would let out all kinds of screams.Coma was the best way.Therefore, every time he used his strength, it was just right.Moreover, it was to make these black armored warriors seriously unconscious.Everything happened too fast.After three consecutive days of patrolling, they didn't have much time to rest. On top of that, they also had one last night to rest.The remaining three people didn't even have the chance to resist before they were hit by Long Fei and fainted.Long Fei quickly changed into black armor and rushed up the mountain. He did not go directly to the skyline camp, but went to a resting hut halfway up the mountain.The four of them were snoring loudly.Long Fei's every punch, all of them knocked out!\"Huff \u2026\"\"The first mountain gate has been safely completed.\" Long Fei raised his head to look at the skyline camp not far away, and thought in his heart: \"Brothers, wait for me.\"And then \u2026Long Fei quickly fled into the darkness.\u2026 \u2026.skyline camp, everything was normal.Meng Yue walked into the dungeon, looked at the nine imprisoned Long Family disciples, and revealed a disdainful cold smile, as he said indifferently: \"It seems that your Young Master did not intend to save you.\"\"In his eyes, your lives aren't worth much.\"The expressions of the nine disciples of the Long family turned cold.Their hearts were in pain, but they knew very well who would come back from such a situation.Moreover.They also didn't want Long Fei to return either. If he returned, they would be sending him to his death!Long Shan rushed up and shouted, \"Young Master is smart. He won't fall into your trap. Just you wait. When the Long family arrives, all of you will die!\"\"Ouch!\"\"Using the Long family's army to scare me?\" Meng Yue laughed coldly: \"You think I'm scared? You won't be able to see the Long family's attacks, because \u2026 Tomorrow morning, all of you will die, hahaha \u2026 \"The faces of the nine sank.A person with a mental breakdown rushed out and directly knelt in front of Meng Yue, crying as he begged: \"I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I beg you, please spare my life, I'm not a disciple of the Long family, I have no relationship with the Long family, I'm begging you, let me go, I don't want to die.\"Long Shan shouted, \"Long Cheng, what are you doing?\"\"Long Cheng, are you crazy?\"\"What nonsense are you talking about?\"Anyone would be afraid of death.After Long Cheng, two more people rushed forward and knelt in front of Meng Yue, kowtowing and begging for mercy: \"I beg you, please spare my life, we aren't members of the Long family either.\"Meng Yue revealed a playful cold smile, and said: \"Very good, very good. \"As long as he's not a member of the Long family, I can spare his life. After all, my mission this time is only to target the disciples of the Long family. As long as you admit that you're not disciples of the Long family, I will spare your lives.\"\"I... I'm not from the Long family either. \"\"And me, I'm not either!\"The moment Meng Yue's voice fell, two more people kneeled up.Of the nine, only four remained.Long Shan kept saying, \"Are you all crazy? Have you all forgotten the Long Family's teachings? Long Cheng, Long Yue, you \u2026 \"All of you, come back quickly.\"Long Cheng gave a cold snort, \"Long Shan, why are you worried for the Long family? Your surname is also bestowed by the grand ancestor, and you're not a member of the Long family. Why would you sacrifice your life for the Long family?\"\"That's right, that trash, Long Fei, has already escaped. If he wanted to save us, we would have come back a long time ago.\"You're right, what young master? In my opinion, he's just a coward.\"\"Long Shan, a wise man knows his place. You should just follow us \u2026\"Without waiting for him to finish, Long Shan shouted: \"The Long family gave birth to me and raised me. I was born a member of the Long family and even if I died I would become a ghost of the Long family. The Long family's men never kneel to anyone, much less beg.\"Long Shan is right!\"\"I believe the Young Lord will come!\"The remaining four people said resolutely.These four were all disciples who had taken their lives from the Fire Wolf Valley, and they were extremely grateful to Long Fei. At the same time, they admired Long Fei in their hearts.I believe that Long Fei will definitely return!\"Hahaha... You all are really stupid, at this time, Long Fei is still coming back? \" Long Cheng sneered, \"He has already abandoned us.\"Meng Yue had a smile on his face as he stared at Long Shan and said: \"Why are you sacrificing yourself for a piece of trash? I'll give you one last chance. As long as you admit that you're not disciples of the Long family, I'll spare your lives and promise not to kill you. \"\"Pfft!\"Long Shan spat out a mouthful of phlegm and said: \"Stop talking nonsense. If you want to kill me, then kill me!\"The three people beside him did not move at all.Meng Yue wiped off the phlegm on his body and laughed coldly. He waved his hand and shouted: \"Come here, release these five people.\"Those four inside, serve me the punishment!\"Long Cheng looked at Long Shan and sneered, \"Long Shan, you're really courting death.\"Long Shan looked at Long Cheng with disdain, \"Traitor!\"Long Cheng laughed, \"I'm not a traitor, I'm sensible, my life is mine, not anyone's. Only fools like you would risk your lives for the Long family, hahaha \u2026\"The five of them were brought out of the prison.A few minutes later, screams of pain came from the dungeon.Long Cheng smiled proudly, \"What a fool!\"\u2026 \u2026.Hu Shan stood behind Meng Yue and asked softly: \"Battalion Commander, is it too much?\"Meng Yue's expression was firm as he replied: \"Not at all, this is the most difficult test. The assessment for Long Fei is also the same for the disciples of the Long family.\"\"The Long family doesn't need traitors with weak minds. The Long family is always loyal, even in the face of death!\"Meng Yue did not regret what he had done just now. On the contrary, he was rejoicing that he had eliminated five dangerous characters for the Long family. If he did not eliminate them today, they might betray the Long family out of fear of death one day.\"Fight!\"\"Hit them ruthlessly, we want to see how hard their bones are!\" Meng Yue shouted harshly, and at the same time, said loudly: \"I still have the same words. As long as you admit that you are not a member of the Long family, you will be able to eat and drink.Long Shan spat out a mouthful of blood and laughed maniacally. \"Stop dreaming. The Long family's male child would rather die than submit. Hahaha \u2026\"Meng Yue also laughed and shouted, \"Let's see how long you can hold out for.\"However, he thought to himself, \"I like this kid. I need to think of a way to keep him by my side, hehe \u2026\"Meng Yue was unusually fond of these four people.\"Is there anything abnormal at the foot of the mountain?\" Meng Yue asked.Hu Shan replied, \"Everything is normal.

Dawn was about to arrive in half an hour, and it was also the time when people were the most tired. The Black Dragon pioneer camp knew that Long Fei wouldn't come to rescue them, so their defenses were relaxed as well, and they slept and snored in the army camp.\"Whoosh!\"whoosh whoosh whoosh \u2026 *Long Fei carefully moved forward, trying to get a clear understanding of the terrain of the village, \"Prison? They should be locked up inside. \"There were two guards at the entrance to the dungeon.\"Tiny Rippling Steps!\"\"Shua!\"Long Fei took a stride forward, both fists drawing his bow, and then shot out at the same time, \"Mountain-hit Fist!\"Bang, bang!The two of them didn't even have time to react before they were knocked unconscious.Long Fei rushed into the dungeon.The prison guards had already been removed, they all thought that if Long Fei didn't return, there was no need to continue guarding the prison.\"Dragon Mountain!\"Seeing that Long Shan's body was covered with wounds, Long Fei's anger surged, \"Motherf * cker, touch this daddy's brother!\"Actually.Long Shan only suffered some superficial wounds. He wasn't unconscious, but had not slept for three days and three nights. He was too tired and fell asleep on the rack.Meng Yue liked him, even if they had to torture him, it would just be a superficial wound. If they had to torture him, Long Shan would definitely not be able to hold on!And then \u2026Long Fei immediately gave Long Shan a Highest Grade Medicine Powder.The moment Long Shan woke up and saw Long Fei, he had the urge to cry, \"Young Master, you, you, why are you here? You can't come, this is a trap. Hurry, let's go! \"He was just a person from the Long family with the surname 'Long'.His cultivation was ordinary, his talent was ordinary, but Long Fei actually came to save him, the gratitude in his heart surpassed everything else.The three people beside him did the same.He was extremely grateful.Long Fei looked at the surrounding cells, where there were no signs of the other five people. He whispered, \"Don't talk, I'll bring you guys to escape. Why is there only the four of you? \"Long Shan angrily said, \"They are traitors!\"\"A bunch of cowards!\"\"Ignore them!\"As they spoke of these five people, anger gushed out from the hearts of Long Shan's group.Long Fei's brows tightened, he could vaguely guess what happened and asked: \"Can you still walk?\"\"Sure, we're not severely injured, just a few superficial wounds.\"\"Fine, follow me now!\"The five of them walked out of the cell in silence.Long Fei pointed to a pine tree not far away, and said: \"Wait for me there, I'll look for them.\"Long Shan pulled Long Fei back and said, \"Young Master, they are traitors \u2026\"Long Fei said indifferently: \"I brought them out, I want to bring them back, this is my principle!\"People are afraid of death.If it was Long Fei, he himself would have chosen to live.Then again.They were Long Fei's brothers, they were once!For this little bit of brotherly affection, he had to bring them out of this place, and once they escaped, it would be up to them to decide.The more important reason.They were the elites of the Long family. If they could persuade them to stay, Long Fei hoped that they could stay.Long Shan clenched his fists. \"I will never betray a young master like him. Even if I were to fight against the sea of fire, I will never betray him.\"Long Fei's measurement made them feel admiration.\u2026 \u2026.\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"This rescuer is too awesome!\"\"Long Shan and those other brainless people are still suffering in the prison. They are really stubborn. They just admit that they are not the disciples of the Long family. We are not the descendants of the Long family.\"\"Yeah, they'll be dead in a few hours.\"\"Big brother Long Cheng, what should we do next?\"\"If these bandits let us go, where will we go? Is the Long Family army going to return to the Fire Glass City or to the Long Family? \"Long Cheng laughed complacently: \"I've already thought about it, let's go to the Long family's army, Long Fei will be running away, he doesn't even know what's going on here, at that time we'll dress up and say that we escaped by ourselves, going to the Long family's army trial, this is a rare chance to train here.\"\"Will Long Fei see through us?\"Long Cheng laughed, \"He's already scared himself to the point of pissing his pants, what right does he have to see through us? Furthermore, Long Shan and the other three have died. Who knows what is happening here? \"\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"Big brother Long Cheng is truly thoughtful.\"\"From now on, you're our boss.\"As they were talking, the door was pushed open and a gust of cool wind blew in.Long Fei stood at the door, his face a little ugly, his fists clenched tightly, but in the end he still said: \"I'm here to save you guys, quickly come with me and leave this place.\"He had heard all the conversation.Tell the truth.He felt extremely unhappy!Long Fei endured it and thought to give Long Cheng and the others a chance.Long Cheng was shocked for a moment, his face paled for a second before he recovered, \"Young Lord, you're finally here.\"After which, he walked up to Zhang Xuan excitedly.The four of them were also stunned, revealing a twisted expression, none of them thought that Long Fei would really come!Some people felt ashamed, some people felt guilty, and some people felt that Long Fei was a fool.Long Cheng's mind spun, and the moment he walked to Long Fei's side, he grabbed him and shouted loudly: \"Someone come quickly, someone come quickly, Long Fei is here, Long Fei is here!\"\"What are you all waiting for?\"\"Everyone, capture Long Fei!\"The other four's faces changed. Some hesitated, some didn't know what to do, but in the end, they still charged forward.\"Young master, don't blame us.\"\"We were forced to.\"\u2026 \u2026.Dragon City's shouts woke everyone up.Meng Yue's eyes opened, and instantly jumped off the bed, before he could even put on the armor, he rushed out of the room and shouted, \"Enemy attack!\"\"Boom, boom, boom!\"\"Boom, boom, boom!\"\"Boom, boom, boom!\"The black-armored warrior charged out with god-like speed.\"This is bad!\"\"That slut Long Cheng!\"Long Shan's eyes turned sinister. He didn't care that much as he shouted, \"Protect the Young Lord!\"The four of them rushed out.Long Cheng grabbed Long Fei and laughed complacently: \"Long Fei, this time you won't be able to escape, hahaha \u2026\"Long Fei's expression was ugly!It was pretty ugly!Long Fei stared at Long Cheng coldly, and said: \"Have you thought about the consequences of doing this?\"Long Cheng sneered, \"The result would be you getting killed, and we'll enter the Long family's army trial.

At that time, their lives would naturally go awry.Long Fei's voice grew even colder, and said: \"The moment I killed Long Zhanwu, I told myself that I would not kill any more members of the Long Family, because I knew that if a family wanted to become stronger, the first thing they had to do was to unite.\"\"But!\"\"I'm going back on my word today!\"As soon as he finished.The true breath in Long Fei's body shook, \"2,000 points!\"\"Buzz!\"Two thousand true breath s swarmed out, spreading to every inch of his body. With a violent shake of his arm, he directly repelled Long Cheng and the others.At the same time.Long Fei pushed his body and suddenly fell to the ground.\"Caw...\"A strange cry came out of his throat. Before Long Cheng could react, he had already charged out.\"Boom!\"Smashing into Long Cheng's abdomen, Long Fei shouted loudly, \"Strangle him!\"When the true breath entered Long Cheng's body, his internal organs began to twist rapidly, as if he was being strangled by a meat grinder.\"Ah... \"Ah \u2026\" Long Cheng clutched at his abdomen as he let out a painful scream, the blood in his mouth gushing out unceasingly. His internal organs had been completely destroyed.He wanted to grab Long Fei with one hand, and his body slowly fell down, \"Long Fei, you, you, you, can't escape either.\"\"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing 'Long Cheng' for gaining 1,500 experience points, 100 true breath and 10 Energy Values!\"Long Fei stood at the door and swept his eyes across the four of them, saying, \"This is the result!\"Then.Long Fei no longer paid any attention to them and quickly rushed out.He had given Long Cheng and the others a chance.Even if they still gave them a chance after hearing the words that made Long Fei angry, but... The moment Long Cheng grabbed onto his desire to sell the owner for honor, Long Fei's murderous intent rose.Once he was sure that this man was dead, Long Fei would definitely not show the slightest bit of mercy!As for the other four, they no longer had any relationship with the Long family, nor with him.\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"Brat, you're finally here!\"A deep voice rang out.At this moment, the black-armored warriors quickly surrounded them.Long Shan and the others also rushed to Long Fei's side, surrounding him in the middle, and said: \"Young Master, we'll help you block them.\"Boom!\"Meng Yue landed heavily on the ground with an excited smile on his face. He didn't know why, but he was inexplicably excited.He didn't even know why he was so excited.Actually.In Meng Yue's heart, he hoped that Long Fei would come, because Long Fei was someone the Grand Elder had chosen.However \u2026He knew that even if Long Fei came, he wouldn't be able to complete the mission.Only by saving the disciples of the Long family could this mission be considered completed, but now \u2026 Long Fei was already surrounded by the black armored warriors, it was impossible for him to escape even if he had wings!Long Fei shouted madly, \"Fight!\"\"Hah!\"The four people of Long Shan's group shouted together and ignited their battle qi.Meng Yue laughed out loud and said, \"Fight? Just the five of you want to fight me? Long Fei, the only choice you have right now is to kneel down and surrender! \"\"Hah!\"The black-armored warrior took a step forward, his spear piercing through the air and reducing the encirclement by half.There was no suspense!There was no way for him to escape, nor did he have the right to do so!The difference in strength was too great, as was the difference in numbers.A Long family disciple asked: \"Young master, what do we do now?\"Long Shan continued, \"Young master, we'll protect you as you break through the encirclement. It doesn't matter if we die. You have to survive. You have to survive.\"Finished.Long Shan rushed out.But, grabbed it back and shouted: \"I haven't let you die yet, but you can't die! Do you think your life is yours? Your life belongs to the Long family. \"\"You guys are the same as well. Whoever dares to rush out randomly will not be my, Long Fei's brother!\"I can't die!They were his brothers.Even if he died, Long Fei would die in front of them, furthermore, he was not at the absolute point of death yet.Long Fei smiled, stared at Meng Yue and said: \"You think I won't be able to escape?\"Meng Yue laughed: \"Haven't you seen the situation clearly? You think you can escape? \"Long Fei said: \"If I can escape, the next time we meet, I want you to kneel down!\"Meng Yue was shocked, and said: \"There's no next time, because you're about to die!\"\"Hehe \u2026\"Long Fei chuckled, then said to Long Shan in a low voice: \"Later on, I will break a hole in the south, you guys run towards that direction, remember, you must be fast!\"\"Where is the cliff?

His arms became numb, and he almost could not endure it anymore.This was only for ten seconds. If he was able to condense it for three minutes, Meng Yue would be killed instantly!\"Block him for me!\"Meng Yue landed and rubbed his right arm, then roared out, \"Long Fei, you won't be able to escape.\"\"Again!\"\"Shua!\"Another layer of blade aura was released, causing a group of black armored warriors to fly out, and Long Fei instantly rushed out of the encirclement of the black armored warriors.Meng Yue laughed out loud, \"That is the edge of the precipice.

It looked like a bottomless abyss.Long Fei looked into the distance and took a deep breath, he then picked up a handful of soil and scattered it towards the sky.Wait?Waiting for what?Long Shan was puzzled, but he didn't ask.They believed that Long Fei definitely had a way, and even if they fell into such a hopeless situation, they still blindly believed in Long Fei.\"Stop!\"As Meng Yue's voice fell, the hundreds of black armored warriors stopped in their tracks.\"Hah!\"The shield was set up and the spear was set up.

It wouldn't be a loss if we kill one, but we'll earn a lot if we kill an extra one.\" Long Shan also said. At this time, there was already no other choice.Retreat, his body was smashed to smithereens.It would be better to have a good fight!Long Fei continued: \"We should be there soon!\"Meng Yue curiously asked: \"Wait?

The most obvious is the black dragon shield in your hands, this is the Black Dragon Army's unique shield. \"At first it was only suspicion.Long Fei also knew that Meng Yue and the others were not ordinary bandits, nor were they Death Soldiers from Nangong Lei or the Zhuge family. This was because the auras they emitted was the kind of aura that came from battles on the battlefield, completely different from normal warriors.In the beginning, he had only suspected, but now, with the Long family's mocking and ridicule, it was just trying to infuriate him.The doubt in his heart deepened.Meng Yue was stunned. Looking at the shield in the black armored warrior's hand, he suddenly realized and said, \"I really underestimated you.Long Fei said: \"If I had not been careful, your Black Dragon Soldiers would have suffered heavy casualties. Those people guarding the mountain gate all fainted from the attacks, and killing them was just a blade attack, and that and the dragon chop just now, do you think I would not be able to kill your subordinates?\"Long Fei had been controlling his power the entire time.After entering the Tian Ya Village, his heart was even more sure.Long Fei looked at Meng Yue and said: \"If I'm not wrong, this should be an examination!\"Meng Yue was extremely shocked in his heart, but he endured it and laughed loudly, \"Since you know that this is an assessment, then I don't need to explain any further. You've lost, and you've failed the assessment!\"\"Long Fei, resign yourself to your fate!\"\"I wanted to tell you my identity when you were in dire straits, but I didn't expect you to have guessed everything. This way, I wouldn't have any trouble.\"Meng Yue laughed and ordered: \"Put away all your weapons.\"\"Wait!\"Long Fei shouted: \"The examination has not ended, I have not failed, the word 'fate' does not exist in my, Long Fei's, dictionary!\"\"The disciples of the Long family shall never be defeated!\"Meng Yue could not help but sneer, and said: \"Do you still have a way out? You simply cannot escape. Three days are almost up, whether it is the time or the way out, you do not have it.\"Huuuuuuuuuuuu \u2026.\"Wu \u2026 \"Huuuuuuu \u2026.\"The cool breeze became bigger.A new day had begun.\"It's finally here!\" Long Fei was slightly overjoyed as he looked at Meng Yue and said, \"Didn't you just ask me what I was waiting for?\"Meng Yue asked: What are you waiting for? He couldn't wait for anything! Just admit defeat. \"Long Fei felt the speed of the wind and said faintly, \"I'm waiting for the wind!\"\"Jump!\"Long Fei suddenly shouted.Long Shan was stunned and immediately jumped down.Next.The other three people also jumped down.They had complete trust in Long Fei, even if they found out that Meng Yue was the Long Family Army right now. This was because Long Fei was the Young Master, the one who had risked his life to save him.This alone was enough!Meng Yue took a step forward and shouted, \"Long Fei, don't!\"Long Fei grinned, \"Remember, the next time we meet, you have to kneel in front of me, hahaha \u2026\"Finished.Long Fei leaned back, and directly fell down. He shouted loudly: \"Tell your generals, I, Long Fei, am not that easy to defeat!\"\"Ah, oh...\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"Long Fei laughed wildly, and at the same time, shouted at Long Shan and the others, \"true breath Protection!\"The four of them did as they were told.\"Buzz buzz buzz \u2026\"The four of them released their true breath to protect their bodies.\"Boom, boom boom \u2026\"With a few successive sounds, they all fell into the lake.Meng Yue stood at the edge of the cliff, hearing the sound of the lake water splashing, the boulder in his heart fell. He immediately became as excited as a child, and said: \"Too cool, f * ck \u2026 Long Fei, you are too handsome, hahaha \u2026 \"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Do you still want to go?\"\"Yeah. They are too ruthless. \"Meng Yue's methods were indeed ruthless.They were forced to jump off a cliff. If they didn't wait for the wind to blow and deviate in some direction, they would be smashed to smithereens.Long Fei laughed: \"The more ruthless you are, the more you have to go, and let them know that we aren't weaklings who can be pinched just because you want to, don't you want to stomp over the Long family?\"\"Huh?\"\"Huh?\"\"To trample on the Long family's army \u2026\" Long Shan gulped and murmured, \"I feel so excited just thinking about it.\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"To trample on the Long family's army, this was what Long Fei wanted to do.Moreover, this would definitely be very exciting!If they wanted to subdue the high and mighty Long family army, they would have to trample on them. When facing soldiers, they could only crush them with force. Even if they crushed them to the point that they couldn't breathe, they wouldn't resent them. They would only admire them.This was the fastest way to gain recognition!\u2026 \u2026.Not long after Long Fei's group of five climbed onto the lake's surface, Meng Yue brought more than three hundred Black Dragon pioneer camp warriors with him and hurried back to Sleeping Dragon Valley, where the Long Family's army was stationed.He wanted to tell her what had just happened.Right now, he wished he could fly over, because Long Fei had made him too excited.It had been a long time since he had been this excited.To him, Long Fei's completion of the mission could be said to be perfect!Noon.Sleeping Dragon Valley, Long family's military headquarters.Meng Yue excitedly told everything that happened in the past three days, as if he was a teacher lecturing under a bridge.In the end, Meng Yue didn't forget to say: \"Young Master Long Fei is simply too handsome, everything is within his grasp. There are very few people that I, Meng Yue, admire, and now he can be considered one!\"The four generals were stunned.Long Yun revealed a smile, and said: \"Three senior fellow apprentice s, how do you feel? I said he could. \"A cultivation at the war spirit realm had actually completed the hardest trial possible. It had to be said that this was a huge blow to their hearts, it was an impossible mission.Shock was shock.Long Lei said slightly: \"Meng Yue, you said earlier that there were four more Long Family disciples with you?\"Meng Yue replied: \"They are traitors. They are simply unworthy of being members of the Long family, and even more unworthy of entering the Long family's army trial.\"Long Lei continued to ask: What is Long Fei's mission?\"Err \u2026\" Meng Yue was startled for a moment, then said: \"Save the captured disciples of the Long family.\"With that, Meng Yue immediately said: \"Great General, Long Fei did indeed go and save them, but they sold out Long Fei. If it were not for them selling out, our Black Dragon pioneer camp would not even know that Long Fei had entered the skyline camp, this mission \u2026 \u2026\"Without waiting for him to finish, Long Lei's voice trembled, and interrupted Meng Yue: \"Tell me, were those last four people saved by Long Fei? Just tell me the answer. \"\"No, no, no.\" Meng Yue's brows tightened, and said anxiously: \"But \u2026\"\"No buts!\"\"A mission is a mission. If it's an examination, then it's an examination. If he didn't complete the mission, then he didn't pass the examination. My evaluation of Long Fei is, unqualified!\" Long Lei said in a serious tone.Long Yun's face filled with anger. He walked forward and said, \"Great senior fellow apprentice, Meng Yue has already explained everything clearly, those four people are traitors of the Long family.Meng Yue then continued: \"Long Fei went to save them, and before he saved them, he knew that they had betrayed him, but he still went to save them. This means that even though Long Fei measured their abilities, he still wanted to save them. Great General, my personal evaluation of Long Fei is both wise and brave, and for him to be able to disregard life and death for his brother, I, Meng Yue, admire him! \"He had experienced it personally, so he admired Long Fei!How many people can do this?Isn't that young master being pampered in one of the big families in the Fire Glass City? Who could possibly risk their life with an ordinary disciple and call them brothers?No!Long Fei can!So he admired it!Long Lei said indifferently: \"Meng Yue, a mission is a mission. If it's not a mission that you admire personally, then you've completed it. Moreover, he actually chose to jump off a cliff. What if he fell to his death? This method is against the Long Family Army. As a result, if he fails, we can return him back to his original form, back to the Fire Glass City! \"Meng Yue was slightly agitated as he said: \"Great General, you're not at the scene, you don't even know the situation here. When we jumped down the cliff, Long Fei was extremely calm and accurate, even including the speed of the wind. This is the first time I, Meng Yue, have seen such an intelligent person!\"\"Great senior fellow apprentice, I know what you're thinking in your heart. Isn't it just because Long Fei's Dragon Blood Activation is zero? Long Yun's face grew excited as well.She was happy for Long Fei.Long Lei's brows sunk, revealing a sneer filled with contempt: \"Long Yun, since you pointed it out first, then please see it clearly. His Dragon Blood Activation is zero, what does that mean?\"\"This means that he's just a piece of trash!\"\"Useless, do you understand?\"\"I will absolutely not allow this kind of trash to take charge of the Long family's army. Anybody can, only Long Fei the trash cannot!\"Straight to the point.Lei Long did not try to hide it anymore, \"I just despise him! He does not have the qualifications to become the supreme Long family master, and does not have the qualifications to command the Long family army, just like his father back then did not have the qualifications! \"Of course.There were a few other factors behind looking down on Long Fei.Long Yun's brows also furrowed and his expression became cold. He shouted, \"Long Fei is Long Fei, and his father is his father. If he does not give up, he will be the supreme expert of the Long family. \"He could say anyone, but not Long Fei's father!Long Yun continued to be tough: \"And if he is willing to continue the assessment? I approve of his passing the first round of examination! \"Meng Yue also immediately stated his position, and said: \"I am the main examiner, Long Fei had perfectly completed the mission, and I approve of his passing.\"Long Lei glared at him and bellowed: You are not qualified to vote!Meng Yue scratched his head, laughed awkwardly, and said: \"I just want to express my views.\"Long Lei looked at his other two junior brothers, exhaled, and said: \"Since we disagree, then let us vote!\"\"I agree, Long Fei is not qualified, please raise your hand!\"Long Lei raised his hand.Long Lei also raised his hand.Long Lei slightly said: \"Those who agree with Long Fei's decision to continue with the assessment, please raise your hands.\"Long Yun raised his hand. Long Feng hesitated for a moment before raising it as well, \"I think we should give him a chance.\"Meng Yue playfully raised both his hands and said: \"I agree with it with both of my hands!\"Long Lei glared at him and Meng Yue immediately became impotent, as he laughed foolishly.Long Lei laughed complacently, and said: \"Half against half, Long Fei...\"Half-way through, the result was that Long Fei had failed the examination!They were going to be beaten back to the Fire Glass City!At this time, Long Yun clenched his teeth and knelt down on one knee, begging, \"Great senior fellow apprentice, please give him one more chance, I am willing to use Yun Long army as a guarantee. If he fails the second time, I will be late to become the general of Yun Long army!\"\"Eh?!\"\"Huh?\"\"Sister Yun \u2026\"Long Lei's heart burned with anger, he hated Long Fei's appearance from the bottom of his heart. Clenching his fists tightly, he then heaved a sigh of relief, suppressed his anger and shouted: \"Good! Long Yun, since you want to protect him, I'll give you one more chance. \"\"You don't need to waste your time on other exams.\"\"Immediately let him enter the final round of the ultimate trials!\"When Long Yun heard this, he became furious and said, \"Great senior fellow apprentice, do you want him to die inside?\"Long Lei sneered, and said: \"I just want him to die inside. Long Yun, I want to see if you can afford to gamble!\"Using the Yun Long army as a form of insurance made Long Lei even more furious, and the battle qi on his body instantly came crashing down.Battle qi filled the air.Using all his might to crush everything, Long Lei stared at Long Yun with fury.Long Yun clenched his fists and said, \"I bet!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I just heard that this mission is the most difficult, even the Grand Elder is only at the third level of difficulty. Hahaha \u2026\" Young master, you are too powerful. \"\"Hahaha \u2026\"\u2026 \u2026.This time, before Long Fei could call for him, Vice General Chen had already went out to welcome him.Moreover.She called out to the good wine and good dishes, afraid that she would neglect Long Fei.This made Long Fei a bit suspicious, \"Logically speaking, we should be allowed to meet the great general or continue with the next round of examinations, why is there no reaction at all? This is very abnormal.\"He did not know that Wolong Valley was quarreling uncontrollably for his examination results.Finally.The General of the Yun Long army, Long Yun, had actually used the entire Yun Long army as a guarantee, which was why he was able to keep Long Fei from continuing.Long Fei naturally did not know about any of this.Furthermore, they had not seen Meng Yue and the others ever since they had entered the Dragon Plains. Even Vice General Chen had disappeared.With just that one sentence, he had made them wait here!He waited for an entire afternoon, but no one came.Long Shan and the others were getting impatient. \"Isn't the Long family's speed a little too slow?\"\"What Long Army?\"\"What exactly do you want us to do after waiting for so long?\"\"Aren't you bullying me too much?\"\"No, I have to go out and ask that Vice General Chen.\" Long Shan walked out of the main hall, but before he could step out, he was blocked by two guards.\"Please wait in the hall.\"Long Shan yelled in annoyance, \"Wait your sister! We've already waited for an entire afternoon and you still want us to wait? What are you trying to do?\"The guard replied, \"Our order was to not let you leave the hall. As for what you're waiting for, we don't know. Please go back, and don't make things difficult for us.\"\"I'd like to see what you guys are up to.\"As he spoke, Long Shan wanted to force his way in.The guard shouted.\"Kacha kacha kacha \u2026\"In the blink of an eye, the entire hall was completely surrounded. The three floors, the three floors, the third floor, the crossbows, the long spear soldiers, they were all so surrounded that not even a drop of water could leak out.Long Shan was not scared, and shouted: \"You think we are scared? Do you know who it is? \"Long Fei said slightly: \"Long Shan, let's wait. We will just wait, then come back and continue drinking and eating.\"This situation was not like the situation in skyline camp.Long Fei could feel a murderous aura from these warriors. As long as Long Fei dared to barge in, they would dare to shoot arrows!The more he thought about it, the more he felt that something was amiss.In the evening.A sumptuous dinner was served in the main hall.In addition, a woman in general's armor, who looked to be around thirty years old, walked into the hall and immediately locked Long Fei up.In the instant she looked at Long Fei, her eyes trembled lightly. The corners of her eyes were a little moist, and her eyes still carried an endless amount of yearning. No, it was a very complicated look of longing.Long Fei was secretly startled, he had never seen the woman in front of him before, but why was she looking at him like that?The woman was Long Yun.The moment she saw Long Fei, her heart sank, \"It's really similar, too similar. It's exactly the same.\"And then \u2026Long Yun walked forward and ordered, \"Fill up their wine cups. I have something important to announce.\"Long Shan said in a low voice, \"Young master, she should be General Long Yun. I heard that she's the only female general in the Long family's army.\"\"Long Yun?\"Long Fei didn't have any impression of him in his heart.The five of them raised their wine cups, and Long Yun smiled: \"Congratulations on passing the assessment!\"Finished.She finished it in one gulp.\"Can the military drink?\" Long Fei asked in his heart. They were different, they were not the Long family's troops, drinking alcohol was normal, but Long Yun was a general.He did not think too deeply about it and downed the wine as well.Long Yun looked at Long Fei, his smile somewhat bitter as he said: \"You completed your mission very well, even better than your father. I'm happy for you.\"\"Long Fei!\"\"Come out with me for a bit.\"Long Yun couldn't control himself.That year.She, Long Lei, and Long Fei's father had all come here to participate in the Long Family Army's examination, but they had all \u2026 It was also the time when his father met Long Fei's mother.Later.Long Fei's father abandoned the exam and brought his mother back to the Fire Glass City.At that time.Long Yun's heart felt like it was being torn apart. In the end, she passed the examination with a perfect score and chose to stay. After sixteen years, she had never returned to Fire Glass City.She gave everything she had to the Long family.Becoming one of the Four Great Generals, the Yun Long army that was trained to be invincible and the existence with the strongest fighting strength \u2026He was putting so much effort just to forget Long Fei's father.However.The moment she saw Long Fei, the longing in her heart burst forth, and she couldn't control it anymore.Long Fei followed Long Yun silently.Only when Long Yun stopped did he stop, and Long Fei did not ask anything along the way.In his heart, he always felt that Long Yun was very friendly.\"All of you can leave now.\" Long Yun said to the guard standing guard.\"Yes, General!\" The guards retreated.Long Yun looked at the setting sun and said indifferently, \"Do you know why I called you out alone?\"Long Fei shook his head and said, \"I don't know.\"Long Yun looked at Long Fei and smiled, \"Tonight, you will enter the ultimate examination. In order to survive in the wilderness, you must kill one five level monster, ten four-rating monster and beasts, and a hundred three-rate monster and beast within a month. You must also find your way back to Wolong Valley.\"\"Huh?\"\"Kill demon beasts?\" Just thinking about it, Long Fei felt that this mission was tailor made for him, but \u2026. \"Is the five level monster a bit too cruel?\"Thinking about the Large Power King Kong Ape, his scalp felt numb.It was still very difficult for him to deal with the five level monster by himself.Long Yun exhaled, and said: \"These are all secondary. You, you, you will be sent to the depths of demon territory, which is to say, the depths of hundreds of thousands of barren mountains. \"The demons will catch you, other than killing demon beasts, you must also escape from them, it can be said that this mission has a slim chance of survival, based on your current cultivation, the probability of completing it is zero, you can give up \u2026\"\"Are all the Long Army soldiers this ruthless?\"\"This is a trial, this is complete suicide.\" Long Fei retorted, then said firmly: \"I won't give up, I don't want to disappoint my uncle, and also don't want to disappoint my grandfather.\"\"What's more \u2026\"Long Fei had his own plans.He had come here for the sake of levelling up and breaking through. He had to go deeper into the hundreds of thousands of barren mountains to find that fire dragon!I need to use dragon blood to treat the injuries on grandpa's body.Give up the quest?It was simply impossible!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only then, would no one dare to touch the Long family.This way, he would be able to carry the flag of the Long family!He had to do it too!Because he was a member of the Long family!Long Yun laughed softly, looked at Long Fei's resolute expression and muttered, \"It was just like what your father did all those years ago, but after your father \u2026\"At this moment.\"You know my father?\" Long Fei's vision became a little blurry as multiple illusions appeared in front of his eyes. He muttered, \"I'm so dizzy, what wine did you give us to drink?\"Long Yun supported Long Fei and said indifferently: \"Drunken Dragon Wine, get some sleep!\"If even dragons could get drunk on this kind of wine, how could humans do anything about it?Slowly, Long Fei closed his eyes.Long Yun let Long Fei lean against him as he watched the sunset. His eyes were filled with endless longing as he muttered to himself in a low voice: \"Brother Ting, are you alright?\"\"Your son is also going to enter the demon territory's Trial. Did I do the right thing, or did I do wrong?\"\"Back then you took away the Holy Maiden, and now Long Fei is going to participate in the trial as well, will he do the same?\"Long Yun laughed bitterly, let out a long breath, and continued: If that time we didn't choose the most difficult mission, you wouldn't have left the Long family, and I would have become your wife. Long Fei might have been our child, hehe \u2026 Brother Ting, I really missed you. \"As he spoke, Long Yun's tears began to flow uncontrollably.Tears streamed down his face.This was the second time in sixteen years that she had cried.The first time was when Long Zhanting left.\u2026 \u2026.Night fell.A squad of Long family cavalry quickly entered the hundreds of thousands of barren mountains.hundreds of thousands of barren mountains.Although it was called a desolate mountain, it was actually a dense forest inside. It was extremely dark during the day, and even the night was pitch black.There were countless beasts hidden in the mountains.Because of this special geographical location, the demon beasts here were even more ferocious than those in the other mountain ranges. In addition, many demon beasts also know how to use magic to attack from a distance.This type of ranged attack only had one attribute, the fire attribute!Legend.In the past, when the wild fire burned in the prairie, the hundreds of thousands of barren mountains had absorbed an endless amount of fire essence.Other than that.In the mountains, the most terrifying thing was the evil spirits.Some looked like humans, but there were also some that looked like Demonic Beasts, and their blood lineage belonged to the Demonic Clan.Innate strength.In addition, it was incomparably bloodthirsty, and its hatred for humans was especially strong.It could be said that he could kill anyone he met!\u2026 \u2026.The night passed quickly.Early morning.One of the mounted guards said, \"The demon territory is right in front of us, throw him into the Scarlet Flame Valley.\"\"Isn't that a bit too cruel?\"\"We will do as you say. This is General Long Lei's order.\"\"After entering the demon territory, who would be able to come back alive and kill demonic beasts? This is impossible, I really don't know why General Long Lei would want to test Long Fei like this, don't you want him to die?\"\"It wasn't General Long Lei who was going to take the test on Long Fei at all, but General Long Yun who didn't even hesitate to use the Yun Long army as a guarantee. If not for General Long Yun, Long Fei would have already been sent back to the Fire Glass City.\"\"I heard that the Long family is currently very unstable, and has been completely crushed by the three pillars and the royal family.\"\"So what? As long as our Long family's army is still here, who would dare touch a single hair on the Long family's head? \"\"That's true.\"\u2026 \u2026.After chatting for a while, they put Long Fei down.Actually.On the way, Long Fei had woken up. Listening to their conversation, he thought to himself, I actually used the Yun Long army as my guarantee!Long Fei felt very bad in his heart.Recalling the words he vaguely heard while he was unconscious, Long Fei muttered in his heart: \"Has father been here before? Is mother also a member of the Evil Demon Clan? \"\"Just what sort of past has General Long Yun had?\"Long Fei's brain wasn't strong enough.At this moment.The Iron Cavalry Guard spoke to Long Fei who was pretending to be unconscious: \"Brat, don't blame me if you die. This is the path that you have chosen, finish it yourself.\"After he finished speaking, he was about to throw Long Fei down the canyon.The canyon was unfathomably deep.If he were to throw it down like this, it would at least cost him half his life.Long Fei immediately struggled and crawled up from the ground, saying, \"I think it's better if I walk down myself!\"\"Huh?\"His voice startled everyone.Long Fei patted the dirt on her body and said: \"I'll have to trouble you to go back and tell General Long Yun that I won't let her down!\"\"At the same time.\"\"I will also tell your General Long Lei that I will step on his face, and make him kneel in front of me and sing 'Conquer'!\"Finished.Long Fei didn't even turn his head as he walked towards the canyon.The six Steel Cavalry were completely stunned.\"He stepped on General Long Lei's face, made him kneel down and sing 'Conquer', this brat \u2026 Isn't he too arrogant? \"\"What an arrogant tone.\"\"I don't even know how he died.\"\"Forget it, don't bother with a dead man. Let's go.\"\"He woke up early. Will he come back with us?\"\"Do you want to stay here for a few days?\"\"No need, going back with us is also a mission failure. You must know that he also wants to hunt five level monster. Let's go back, this place is too dangerous.\"\u2026 \u2026.Long Fei did not think about leaving.Step by step, his steps were incomparably firm. He wanted to find that fire dragon. If possible, he also wanted to find some information regarding his father.Because it would help him find his father.Grandfather's unhappiness made Long Fei feel that he greatly missed his father. If he could find his father, his grandfather would definitely be very happy.\"Huff \u2026\"\"I forgot to ask. I wonder what Long Shan's group is doing now, will they be thrown into the hundreds of thousands of barren mountains to cultivate as well?\" Long Fei was a little worried.After walking for about half an hour.The sky had already brightened, but the gorge was still shrouded in fog, making it very difficult to see.Suddenly.\"Help!\"A girl's cry for help came from the depths of the canyon.After the cry for help, a gigantic crimson stone that looked like a ball of fire was quickly moving.Long Fei's eyes moved, \"Human?\"Instantly.true breath moved, it immediately accelerated and rushed into the depths of the canyon.\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"\u2026 \u2026.Powerful collision sounds came from the canyon and the entire canyon was shaking. The cries for help became more and more urgent and more intense.\"Help! Help!\"A huge rock with sparks on it shot towards a wild girl who was wearing leopard stripe beast skin and holding a javelin.The girl had nowhere to run.He opened his eyes, but he was not afraid. He grinned and said, \"I'm going to die!\"So happy to die?\"Danger!\" A figure landed, picked up the girl and instantly leaped, dodging the huge boulder. At the same time, Long Fei saw it clearly \u2026 That demonic beast.\"Lava Titan!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her eyes were filled with curiosity as she muttered: \"Is he a human?\"The Lava Titan became even more furious after losing his prey. Holding onto the cliff with one hand, he used his two stone legs to support himself. His body curled and turned into a giant fireball, shooting towards Long Fei and the others.\"Holy sh * t!\"Long Fei's eyes turned cold, \"Is this Enlargement Stroke?\"The Lava Titan was exactly the same as the Stone Golems from a game in his previous life. He was made of extremely hard rocks. Red light shone from the cracks in the rocks, and his body was exuding a scorching aura that made it hard for people to breathe.He then looked at the leopard tattooed wild maiden in his arms.With a large ponytail, two large eyes, and a leopard print shirt covering three points, this \u2026. This was also the leopard girl from that game.Stone man against leopard girl?\"Oh my god \u2026\"Long Fei shook his head and said to himself, \"My poison is too strong, this is just a coincidence.\"It was also at this moment that the leopard tattooed girl warned in a soft voice, \"Dodge! If you don't dodge soon, you'll be hit by the big monster's head!\"\"Hee hee \u2026\"After saying that, he laughed excitedly.Long Fei really could not understand, how could he laugh in the face of death?He didn't have time to figure it out.Because \u2026The Lava Titan was truly Enlargement Stroke.It instantly attacked like a bolt of lightning.There was no way to dodge it!It was too fast, and had already exceeded twice Long Fei's speed. Hiding was definitely impossible, so Long Fei put the leopard tattooed girl down gently and said with a smile: \"Don't worry!\"The moment he turned around \u2026Long Fei's expression instantly changed, and he roared out fiercely in his heart, \"Wushuang!\"\"Buzz!\"Double attribute power exploded out, the true breath was burning, exploding.Long Fei's right fist sank.The muscles of his right arm tensed up, causing his clothes to burst apart, \"magic power of right hand!\"\"Bang, bang, bang!\"Energy resonated from his right arm for three seconds. Facing the gigantic Lava Titan, Long Fei punched his fist out.The panther-tattooed maiden said in astonishment, \"Is he an idiot?\"The Lava Titan was a peak rank 3 beast, and it also carried the power of fire. Ordinary meat fists would immediately burn if they hit it, and this kind of beast could only attack from afar, but Long Fei actually attacked it with his fist?At this moment.\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"\u2026 \u2026.The power shook the sky and sparks flew in all directions.Long Fei's arm was numb, his bones were cracking, and his fist was burnt, the pain was unbearable.The Lava Titan's body exploded into pieces and let out a miserable scream. The flames on his body became stronger as well, and in the instant that he was sent flying by Long Fei.\"Woo woo \u2026\"With a roar, he turned into a fireball and struck Long Fei.\"Holy sh * t!\"Long Fei cursed and swallowed a true pill, \"I don't believe it!\"\"Mountain-hit Fist!\"\"magic power of right hand!\"\"Ding!\"\"Trigger Critical Chance attribute, damage increased by 200%!\"Relying on the magic power of right hand alone was impossible. The release of the divine power required time to condense and it was impossible to release its strongest power in such a short period of time.It could only be integrated into the Mountain-hit Fist.These two powers both came from Large Power King Kong Ape s, and the compatibility between the two powers reached 90%, allowing the user to release the strength almost perfectly.Coupled with the critical hit triggered by the Luck attribute!Long Fei leaped into the air, and with a hug of his fists, he formed the form of a war axe. At this moment, an incomparably large Large Power King Kong Ape image superimposed on his body.\"Kacha \u2026.\"The power was like a bolt of lightning, striking down.It struck the head of the Lava Titan.\"Bam!\"\"Rumble \u2026\"One punch kill!The Lava Titan's body exploded as sparks filled the air, as if coal had been split into pieces.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for obtaining 15,000 EXP for defeating 'Lava Titan', 400 true breath and 1 Energy Values.\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for obtaining 'Lava Heart'. Do you wish to fuse it?\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for obtaining 'Essence of Fire'! 1 point, would you like to fuse it?!\"\u2026 \u2026.A few notifications sounded.Long Fei checked it.Item: Heart of LavaDescription: Enhancement of cultivation technique strength. Fusion success and receiving 10% increase in strength from the Lava Titan. Success rate 10%. Do you want to fuse them?\"Fuse!\"\"This is your fusion technique, please.\"Long Fei was silent for a moment, then said: \"Mountain-hit Fist!\"\"Ding!\"\"Begin fusion!\"A few seconds later, the system's voice rang out, \"Fusion failed!\"\"Damn!\" \"What a waste of my expression.\" Long Fei cursed in his heart as he looked at the other item, \"Fire Essence Qi, what is this?\"Item: Essence of fireDescription: A type of fire element that increases the success rate of forging artifacts and increases the fire attribute of weapons.Description 2: One hundred ignited Profound Qi can be fused together.\"This thing is pretty good!\"Long Fei was secretly delighted. Back in Fire Glass City, he was only thinking of when he could refine some exclusive weapons. With 'Fire Essence Spirit', his success rate would be even higher.It was the auxiliary power of refining, and was quite good!Ninety percent of all hundreds of thousands of barren mountains's demon beasts were fire-attributed demon beasts. As long as they were killed, they would be able to obtain fire essence, and obtaining 100% of the fire essence would not be too difficult.Just when Long Fei was thinking about when he could start the refining process, the leopard tattooed girl's voice came from behind him, \"You, you are, are you a human?\"He killed the Lava Titan with a single punch.The leopard tattooed girl was extremely shocked, looking at Long Fei's back with incomparable worship.\"Huh?\"Long Fei turned around and looked at the leopard tattooed girl with his eyes. He nodded and said, \"Aren't you a human?\"Suddenly.Long Fei realized a very important problem!This was the demon territory, was the leopard tattooed girl in front of him an evil demon?Was there such a beautiful demon?In the legends, weren't all demons hideous and hideous demons?The leopard tattooed girl's skin was white without a single blemish. There wasn't even a little bit of excess flesh on her body. She had a perfect and flawless cultivation. Moreover, the upper and lower regions of the body should be larger, while the upper regions should be larger.The twin peaks were covered in leopard stripes, and the veins could be vaguely seen. Between the two peaks, there was an unfathomable deep ravine.On her slender white legs, that little fart stuck out so much that it would make one's imagination run wild.Her figure was extremely hot. She was a perfect beauty.Was this an evil demon?Was there such a beautiful demon?Long Fei's mind was in a bit of a mess.Long Fei looked at her without blinking, completely unaffected. Her two big eyes were motionless as she giggled: \"I'm not a human, I'm a leopard girl!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I feel very annoyed. Sometimes, it's very hot. I don't even wear it.\"\"Since it's hot, then take it off.\" Long Fei's eyes flashed, and subconsciously said.The leopard tattooed lady said innocently, \"Daddy said that I can only show it to my future husband. Do you want to see it? I want to be my husband. \"\"Huh?\"Long Fei really wanted to see it, really wanted to see it.He had never seen a woman's body in his life except for a few island movies.However, when he saw her innocent eyes, he immediately felt that he was too evil. He put away his lecherous heart and laughed: \"Your father is right, the girl's body should be shown to his future husband, we must not let those evil and wicked people see it.\"Too naive.The big eyes were shining.It was truly a pain that no one could bear to hurt.\"Beast!\" Long Fei cursed in his heart, \"Such a naive girl, you think you can take her hand?\"\"Oh!\" The leopard tattooed girl was somewhat unhappy. She mumbled to herself, \"Don't you want to be my husband?\"\"Err \u2026\"\"Cough, cough, cough...\" Long Fei choked on her words and coughed, \"Isn't it too direct?\"The leopard tattooed lady continued, \"If you become my husband, I can show it to you. Furthermore, you saved me. Father said that I can repay you for saving my life. I can give my body to you.\"She had an innocent look on her face as she spoke.Very serious.He wasn't joking at all.As long as Long Fei agreed with a nod, she would immediately unbutton her clothes.Long Fei was really a little silly. He admitted that he was a little wretched, but when facing the leopard tattooed young lady, his wretched heart could not begin to leech.He really couldn't bear to do so.The leopard girl in front of him seemed to know nothing.It was as pure as a piece of white paper.He couldn't bear to hurt her, so he just wanted to take good care of her.Now, Long Fei believed that she was no longer a 'human'. Even if she was, she was still a Primordial Human. Long Fei looked at the leopard girl's wild and sexy body, trying hard to calm himself down, and said: \"It's not that I don't want to, but I can't.Long Fei thought about what Ye Ziyan had said in the Fire Glass Mountain Range's cave, and he sighed with emotion, \"In terms of people, why is there such a huge gap?\"If they were all like the leopard girl, how great that would be.The leopard girl muttered to herself for half a minute and then said, \"It's too complicated, I really can't figure it out. But now I understand one thing, humans are not bad people. \"\"Daddy told me since I was a kid that humans are the most sinister and vicious villains in this world. So it turns out that he had lied to me for so many years.\"\"Humph!\"\"You still want to trick me into marrying shao hu, hmph!\"\"Big liar!\"While they were talking \u2026The leopard girl had an angry look on her face.She looked very cute when she was angry, Long Fei laughed and asked: What are you doing here?The leopard girl giggled and said: \"I ran away from home. My father wanted me to marry shao hu, who was next door to the Feral Tiger Tribe. I didn't like him, so I ran away.\"\"Hee hee \u2026\"\"How is it? I must be very powerful! \"\"A young girl escaping from marriage?\" Long Fei heaved a sigh of relief, looked at the leopard girl's cute and playful appearance, and laughed bitterly: \"Awesome!\"Receiving Long Fei's praise, the leopard girl became even happier and said: \"That shao hu always wanted to see my body. Hmph, I don't want to show him, I hate him. \"However, for some reason, my father likes him a lot. He says that he is the most outstanding genius of the tribe, but I don't think so.\"Her small mouth slightly pouted. Her mischievous appearance was really too lovable.Seeing her, Long Fei's mood couldn't help but improve, and he started to laugh loudly, \"I don't think so too.\"The leopard girl giggled again and said: \"I think you are stronger than shao hu because you just killed the Rock Monster.\"\"Hehe \u2026\" Long Fei laughed and asked: \"Just now when you were in a desperate situation, you were about to die, why are you still laughing?\"He really didn't understand it.The leopard girl looked up at the sky and murmured, \"Mother said that happiness is only a day, and unhappiness is also a day. If I had to face everything with a smile, I would have to face it.\"\"Moreover... \"Father said that mother was in the sky, but I knew that mother would only go to the sky after death. I missed mother so much, so much \u2026\"He didn't know why.Long Fei was a little unable to control himself, and the corners of his eyes were slightly wet. Looking at the leopard girl's yearning filled eyes, his heart tightened, \"Where's my mother? Where are you? \"Every hint of kinship was incomparably precious to Long Fei.Even though his soul had transmigrated, he had truly taken everything in this body as his own.Grandfather, jojo, the parents who mysteriously disappeared.His heart was filled with worry.As the two of them walked, no one spoke.The leopard girl was like a shadow as she silently followed behind Long Fei.After walking for around an hour, he finally walked out of Scarlet Flame Valley. Facing the endless primal forest, Long Fei also did not know where he was going.Long Fei stopped.The leopard girl did not sense it. She knocked head on into Long Fei's body, rubbed her little head, and giggled.Long Fei looked at the leopard girl and asked: \"Where are you going?\"The leopard girl had a blank look in her eyes, and said: \"I don't know either, but I don't want to return to the tribe. Daddy will definitely force me to marry shao hu. \"Right, where are you going?\"Long Fei thought for a moment, then said: \"I am in the trial, and during this period of time, I will be hunting demon beasts to complete my mission.\"\"Hunting demon beasts?\"\"Hmm... Hearing this, I feel very excited. Then take me with you, I can hunt demon beasts too. \" The leopard girl's eyes carried a trace of begging, and her large eyes blinked as she looked at Long Fei.It was a look no one could refuse.Long Fei said: \"You can follow me, but you are not allowed to act carelessly, you have to listen to my commands.\"\"Yes, my lord!\" The leopard girl leaped up on the spot, as happy as a little girl who got her candy. \"Oh, oh, oh, hunting demon beasts.\"As he spoke, he rushed down.Long Fei smiled in his heart, and said: \"Slow down!\"\u2026 \u2026.A few hours after Long Fei and the leopard girl entered the primeval forest.Several Fierce Tiger Mask soldiers were searching for something in Scarlet Flame Valley.A warrior picked up a broken javelin and immediately leaped to the side of a burly, muscular youth. He said respectfully, \"Young Lord, she must have been here before.\"\"Keep searching!\"The burly youth's eyes were filled with rage as he shouted in a deep voice, \"Little wild cat, I want to see where you can escape to!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her two slender arms were hanging around Long Fei's neck, and with a scared look on her face, she said: \"Come, come, there are a lot of demon beasts coming, I'm scared!\"Beneath the leopard pattern barrier, there was a bottomless gully. The veins could be clearly seen, as well as the meatball that was about to burst out \u2026 Long Fei didn't care at all, and said bitterly, \"My little ancestor, can you not be like this?\"\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"\"Rumble!\"\u2026 \u2026.A large group of demon beasts madly rushed out like a bulldozer. The towering trees were uprooted, dust rolled up in the air, and thousands of soldiers and horses came rushing out.Long Fei didn't even think as he hugged the leopard girl and escaped crazily.If he didn't run now, he would die here.\"Hurry up, we're about to catch up.\"\"Big brother Long Fei, do your best! Big brother Long Fei, do your best!\"\"Beasts, you guys are too weak, hehe \u2026\"\"Big brother Long Fei is the most handsome!\"After a day of not killing a single demon beast, Long Fei was completely on the run as he was chased by group after group of demon beasts until he pissed his pants.Two hours later.Hu hu hu hu \u2026.Hu hu hu hu \u2026. Long Fei panted as he looked at the leopard girl, and said: \"Little Ancestor, can you not be like this? You want the demon beasts to kill me, right? \"The leopard girl giggled and said: \"Big Brother Long Fei, this is too fun. Let's play a bit more.\"\"Me!\"Long Fei almost vomited a mouthful of blood. There was really nothing he could do about it, the leopard girl was very wild and naive, adding on to that adorable pair of big eyes, it was simply a combination of a devil and an angel.Every time he wanted to get angry, Long Fei would not be able to.\"It's too exciting, I've never played with such a thrill before.\" The leopard girl was still immersed in the process of Long Fei fleeing for his life, extremely excited.\"You're too exciting, I almost lost my life.\" Long Fei consumed a true pill and recovered a lot of true breath s.\"If this goes on, let alone leveling up to break through, I won't even be able to keep my life.\" Long Fei muttered in his heart. Watching the night gradually darken, he said: \"Let's find a place to rest first.\"\"She'll always be sleepy at night. Do you want to sleep?\"\"At the very least, I can kill some Demonic Beasts at night to level up, right?\" Long Fei thought bitterly in his heart.He found a small cave.He set up a bonfire and roasted a hare.The leopard girl looked at the rabbit on the fire rack drooling like a little girl and kept swallowing her saliva.Long Fei tore off a rabbit leg and passed it to the leopard girl, \"Eat it!\"The leopard girl giggled, \"For me? Thank you, Big Brother Long Fei. \"After which, he took it and started wolfing it down.\"Slow down, it's hot!\" Long Fei said with a smile.In less than ten seconds, the leopard girl looked at Long Fei with her blinking eyes, and said with a fawning smile: \"Big Brother Long Fei, I want more.\"\"Why are all of them foodies?\" Long Fei then tore off another rabbit leg, and with an idea in his mind, he asked: \"Do you like barbecue?\"The leopard girl quickly nodded and said, \"I like it, I really like it. I've never eaten anything so delicious before.\"Long Fei said: \"Roasting demon beast meat is even better, if you want to eat it, you can come with me tomorrow to kill the demon beasts. But remember this, you must not attract a group of demon beasts, otherwise you won't have demon beast meat to eat!\"The leopard girl looked at Long Fei with her big eyes and said, \"Must we kill them?\"His eyes were like those of a pitiful little animal.The demon beasts were incomparably savage, but to her, they were like small animals.Long Fei's heart was about to melt, but he still said resolutely: \"They are all bad demon beasts, if we don't kill them, they will eat us, so if you want to kill them, you have to listen to me.\"\"Oh!\" The leopard girl's expression was somewhat downcast. She did not receive the barbecue as quickly as she did the first time. Looking at the barbecue in her hand, she hesitated for a long time.In the end, he did not eat it and put it aside!\"What kind of girl is she?\" Long Fei did not understand.The leopard girl was around fifteen years old.This was only her outer appearance. However, her mental age was only six or seven years that of a human. She was still in the naive and innocent stage of liking animals.They had no idea how savage the demon beasts were.Long Fei's heart trembled, \"I have to learn to grow up by myself...\"\u2026 \u2026.At night.The leopard girl's body shrunk into a ball as her brows tightly knitted together. She cried out in her sleep, \"Daddy, I don't want to marry him, I don't want to marry shao hu \u2026\"\"Mother, where are you? I really miss you. I really, really miss you \u2026\"Two tears rolled down from the corner of his eyes. Long Fei felt pain in his heart when he saw them.\"Huff \u2026\"\"Don't worry.

It could also be called a top-grade weapon.Long Fei was secretly delighted, \"I can still strengthen it, but when I reach 100% of the Refining Technics, every time I forge a top-grade weapon, it would be great!\"Early morning.Long Fei carried the two wild chickens back to the cave.The leopard girl was still sleeping soundly, but a faint smile hung on her face, revealing two shallow dimples. Her smile was very cute, as if she was in a beautiful dream.\"Big Brother Long Fei, you're really too handsome, heehee hee \u2026\"\"You're a good person.\"\"Be my husband and warm my bed, hehe \u2026\"\u2026 \u2026.He was talking in his sleep again.Long Fei smiled, \"Silly girl, at such a young age, you are already looking forward to your husband's warm bed, isn't it a little too early to be thinking about love?\"He picked up some branches and started to cook the chicken.Not long after, the fragrance spread in all directions.The leopard girl moved her nose, and her stomach started to growl. Her eyes slowly opened, and like a lazy cat, she stretched her body and rubbed her eyes, then walked out. When she saw Long Fei not too far away from her, she immediately pounced on him.Exhilarating as she pounced on Long Fei's back, her two slender jade hands wrapped around Long Fei's neck, her entire person hanging on Long Fei's body. She giggled: \"I want to eat, I want to eat.\"Long Fei's back was pressed down by two soft, bouncing lumps of flesh. That feeling \u2026 It was too wonderful.He had to say it.The leopard girl was completely unguarded against him.Long Fei carried her down from his body and said: \"Go wash your face first, then you can eat.\"\u2026 \u2026.After breakfast.Long Fei no longer brought the leopard girl to hunt the demon beasts like he did yesterday. He still wanted to live for a few more years.Moreover.He did not want to be too bloody in front of the leopard girl.\"Big brother Long Fei, I found a Fire Spirit Grass.\" The leopard girl jumped to Long Fei's side happily and held onto a Fire Spirit Grass. Her face was covered in mud and she laughed extremely happily.To her, being able to help Long Fei was the happiest thing in the world.\"Awesome!\" Long Fei praised as he took out the yet to take shape Fire Spirit Grass.The leopard girl became even happier, \"Hee hee...\"During the day, Long Fei and the female leopard harvested spiritual herbs.The spirit herbs and demon beasts of the hundreds of thousands of barren mountains had a common ground, their attributes were filled with fire element.In any case, the Void Spirit Ring was large enough, so he would definitely be able to use it later on.During the second half of the night, Long Fei mysteriously disappeared in order to hunt Demon Beasts crazily.Three days passed in a row.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for levelling up.

Only by killing high level beasts would it gain abundant experience.These three days.Long Fei's skill in proficiency had increased by a lot, and his comprehension in Toading Skill and dragon salyer technique had become deeper and deeper.Cultivating a Divine level skill to the Great Perfection Stage would definitely be very satisfying!Long Fei looked at the sky, \"It's almost dawn, prepare breakfast!\"Suddenly!\"Ahh \u2026\"A shrill scream pierced the night sky.Then, \"Big brother Long Fei, quickly save me!\"\"Crap!\"\"The leopard girl \u2026\" Long Fei's eyes darkened, his figure became as fast as lightning, and he quickly teleported out.Another scream came from the distance.\"Ahh \u2026\"\"Big Brother Long Fei...

The disappearance of the women made them feel like ants on a hot pan, afraid that the Fierce Tiger Tribe would make a move.devils leopard's eyes stared wide open as he gave a cold laugh, \"I'm not using your daughter to make a marriage alliance, so of course you guys agreed on it.\"\"I also want to use my daughter, but that shao hu doesn't like her.\"'shao hu is the most outstanding genius among all of demon territory. To be able to marry him is the dream of many girls.\"\"Exactly.\"\"Leader, let's make some preparations.\"\"That's right, it's still a joyous occasion for our tribe.\"They didn't pay attention to devils leopard's anger at all, but were instead overjoyed.To others, marrying the demon territory's most outstanding genius was something to be happy about, but he understood his own daughter very well.She would never marry a man she did not like.In that case.She would rather die!Furthermore... She had been looking forward to meeting her mother.devils leopard clenched his fists tightly, his heart was filled with helplessness. At this time, he hated himself for being weak, hated himself for not being able to protect even his daughter.Extreme hatred!\u2026 \u2026.\"The grand wedding of the young master of the Fierce Tiger Tribe is coming in three days.\"\"All the Ten Thousand Beast Tribes in demon territory must participate.\"\"Hahaha... This is a joyous occasion for demon territory, you must drink a few more cups when the time comes. \"'shao hu is the most outstanding genius of the demon territory. Naturally, he wants to participate in the marriage.\"\"It would be great if we could capture a few humans as gifts.\"\u2026 \u2026.All the tribes in demon territory received this invitation.The entire demon territory was talking about this matter, and many people were in the wild leopard tribe.The Feral Tiger Tribe was the strongest tribe in demon territory. Being able to catch the attention of the genius young master was definitely a blessing cultivated by that girl for eight lifetimes.However \u2026In a heavily guarded tent belonging to the Fierce Tiger Tribe.It was a mess.Clothes, bedding and some gold and silver jewelry were scattered all over the floor.The table was overturned.With a kick, she flipped the bed over and shouted: 'shao hu, let me out, let me out, I don't want to marry you, I don't want to, I don't want to \u2026 \u2026\"While they were talking \u2026The leopard girl lowered her body and rushed out towards the door with all the strength she could muster.\"Bam!\"Coincidentally, he bumped into shao hu who had walked into the tent.shao hu grabbed the leopard girl's hair and pulled her back. His eyes were like that of a fierce tiger staring at her, and he snorted coldly: \"Little Wild Cat, you better behave yourself, or else don't blame me for being impolite.\"\"Bah!\"The leopard girl spat on shao hu's face, \"Despicable, shameless!\"\"Pah!\"Ye Zichen slapped him.shao hu's gaze carried killing intent as he gloomily said, \"If it wasn't for the fact that I like you, I would've killed you with a single slash long ago.\"While they were talking \u2026He pushed hard, pushing the leopard girl onto the ground, and said condescendingly: \"Little Wild Cat, listen carefully, I have already distributed the wedding invitation to every tribe. Our wedding will be held three days later, either you be more obedient, or \u2026 I will make your father, your wild leopard tribe, disappear from the face of the demon territory forever! \"\"I, shao hu, will do what I say!\"\"I don't want to marry you, I don't want to \u2026\" The leopard girl crawled up from the ground. When she heard what shao hu said afterwards, she suddenly quietened down.shao hu laughed complacently: \"Very good, as long as you listen to me obediently, your father, your tribe will be very safe, hahaha \u2026\"\"Someone, come!\"\"Tidy up here and bring the bridal gown I prepared.\"After doing all that, shao hu walked out of the tent laughing loudly.One of the lackeys asked: \"Young Chieftain, you brought her back to the tribe, why are you still trying to reason with her? Go straight up, does wild leopard tribe dare to say anything?\"shao hu smiled slightly and said: \"Three Tigers, you don't know what love is. I want to save it until our wedding night. I can't hold it in anymore! \"Three Tigers, one of his lackeys, immediately giggled, \"Young master, I have prepared a few of the best quality goods for you.\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"Let's go, this young master will vent his anger properly, hahaha \u2026\" shao hu glanced at the leopard girl who was obediently sitting on the edge of the bed through the gaps of the tent, and smirked in his heart: \"On the wedding night, I'll let you know my strength, then you'll never be able to leave me again, hahaha \u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

On the head of the tiger were carvings of demonic symbols. The village was extremely huge, as if it was a small city.How could he get in at such a big age?\"Xiao Bai, can you sense the position of the leopard girl?\" Long Fei asked in a low voice.A few seconds later, he shook his head and said, \"There are too many people inside, the distance is too far and they are all part of the Demonic Clan, their auras are the same, I am unable to sense their location, if I were able to enter, I would be able to sense them.\"\"Master, I can enter.\"\"No way!\"Long Fei rejected him without even thinking.Xiao Bai was still a young beast. Even though he was a young beast of the Divine Beast level, he was still a young beast.Every single one of the Feral Tiger Tribe members were Hunters, if they found Xiao Bai, they would definitely go all out to kill him.Long Fei would not let Xiao Bai take the risk and said: \"Let's take a look first.\"A joyous occasion?\"\"Could it be...\"Long Fei's heart tensed, he immediately thought of what the leopard girl had said to him, \"Could it be that shao hu wants to force the marriage?\"\"That must be it!\"Long Fei started to become anxious, but he did not rashly rush into the tribe. Looking at the situation now, he knew that the wedding was still in preparation and there were no guests around, so there was definitely some time left.\"Xiao Bai!\"\"Here!\"\"You stay here and observe carefully. If you see a large number of guests enter the Feral Tiger Mountain Camp, inform me immediately.\"\"Master, where are you going?\"\"Phew \u2026\" I need to increase my strength a bit more. \" Long Fei's heart sank as he muttered: \"Since shao hu is preparing for his wedding, then the leopard girl is temporarily safe.\"\"Moreover, there must be a lot of guards by her side right now. Only on the day of the wedding will she relax. That would be the best time to save someone.\"\"Leopard girl, you must wait for me!\"Although everything was as Long Fei had analyzed it, he was still very worried in his heart. What if shao hu was someone who would not follow his principles \u2026 What if the leopard girl...Long Fei really wanted to rush in.But with his current cultivation, it was impossible!Saving someone was very simple. How was he supposed to get out?This was the key!If he was even the slightest bit careless, he would also be caught. If a human fell into the hands of a demon tribe, there would only be one outcome, being torn apart!Xiao Bai said resolutely, \"Master, don't worry, I will guard this place without any problems!\"\"Yes!\"Long Fei did not dawdle and slowly retreated into the dark forest.Following which, he swiftly teleported out.After sprinting for tens of km, they arrived at a valley that was emitting a dangerous aura.\"Bring it on!\"The aura on Long Fei's body was suddenly released, and his figure sunk. He immediately took out the Dragon Slaying Sabre, and with one person and one saber, he rushed into the valley.When the demonic beasts in the valley smelled the scent of humans, they immediately became furious.\"Roar!\"With a loud roar, the entire valley began to shake.Immediately after, demon beasts rushed out one after another. There were over a hundred of them.Standing at the entrance to the valley.Long Fei held the dragon salyer tightly, the Qi on his body resonating with the dragon salyer's blade energy, slowly merging with it.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for comprehending the 'One with the Saber' realm, the damage for all saber techniques has increased by 20%.\"\"Bam!\"Long Fei took a step forward, and the dragon salyer dragged itself on the ground as sparks flew in all directions. Facing such a huge herd of beasts, he was not even the least bit afraid.Don't worry about the consequences.At this moment.He only had one word, \"Kill!\"The dragon salyer moved, and a deep dragon's roar sounded. The blade aura raged, and directly shot out from the dragon salyer's body.\"Open the skin!\"\"Break the bones!\"\"Tendon Break \u2026\"The dragon salyer combined with the dragon salyer technique, against those level 1 and 2 beasts, it was as easy as cutting vegetables, one for each blade, one for each blade.After seven moves were released.With the accumulation of the blade aura, the blade aura released by the dragon salyer became even more brutal.\"dragon chop!\"Long Fei held his blade with both hands, poured the true breath into it and suddenly raised it up.\"Bang, bang, bang \u2026\" It shot out in a straight line like a gale.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations player 'Long Fei' for comprehending 'Gale Cut'! You have gained 1000 experience points, 100 true breath points, and 100 Points as a reward.\"Gale Chop.The first move of the dragon chop!\"Boom!\"The moment the Whirlwind Slash touched the beast, a grimace appeared between Long Fei's eyebrows, and the true breath that was infused with the blade energy suddenly changed under the control of the idea.\"Rumble \u2026\"It was like a hurricane as it exploded.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations player 'Long Fei' for comprehending 'Hurricane War'! You have gained 1000 experience points, 100 true breath points, and 100 Points as a reward.\"Hurricane Cut.dragon chop's second form was activated!The hurricane moved and swept the surrounding dozens of demon beasts into the air.At this moment.Long Fei's body moved, as he rushed into the hurricane with his blade, he bellowed: \"dragon chop!\"whoosh whoosh whoosh \u2026 *whoosh whoosh whoosh \u2026 *whoosh whoosh whoosh \u2026 *\u2026 \u2026.The saber Qi was as fast as lightning, dazzling. In just a few seconds, all 170 layers of saber Qi were released.The dozen demon beasts were chopped into pieces and turned into a rain of blood as they fell from the sky.\"Ding!\"\"Ding!\"\"Ding!\"\u2026 \u2026.The system beep kept on ringing.Long Fei heavily landed on the ground, and directly landed within the encirclement of the demon beasts. A cold smile appeared on his face, \"Not enough, not enough, this is far from enough \u2026\"He kept his dragon salyer and leaped into the air.He spread his limbs and landed on the ground with a loud bang. He let out a weird croak from his throat, and the dust around him rolled out in circles with him as the center.\"Roar!\"The beasts roared, and hundreds of beasts pounced towards Xiang Longfei.\"Toading Skill!\"\"A grand execution!\"\"Gudong!\"The true breath Slot was suddenly cut in half.Long Fei's figure moved, the vigorous true breath was released by the divine technique Toading Skill, forming a domain with tens of Spirit Beasts.Long Fei's heart sank.\"Extermination! Break!\"true breath was activated.The energy of the upgraded Toading Skill exploded outwards.The bodies of the Demonic Beasts inside the territory of the true breath suddenly sank. Their stomachs madly stirred, forming a vortex.\"Ding!\"\"Ding!\"\"Ding!\"\u2026 \u2026.Another series of notifications sounded.\"Not enough, not enough, still not enough \u2026\" Long Fei's voice sank, his right arm sank as he stretched it out behind him.\"Roar!\"A Large Power King Kong Ape's roar came out.A punch flew out.\"Boom!\"It was like a heavy cannon was fired, overturning a group of low-level demon beasts.At this moment.Those demon beasts were crazily running away. They were scared to the point of pissing their pants and screaming to the heavens and shouting to the earth.\"Mom, I want to go home \u2026\"\"You want to leave?\"\"All of you must die!\"Long Fei once again took out his dragon salyer and chased after it with full strength!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

During the time he spent with the leopard girl, he discovered that she was very special.It was different from all the girls he had ever met.Naive, kind, cute, and at the same time wild, playful, and a little silly ignorance.How could such a good girl waste her youth in such a primitive forest?This was such a waste!Save, he had to save!\u2026 \u2026.The entire valley had been cleared.Long Fei's body was also covered in blood. It was easy to deal with Level 1 or 2 demon beasts, but once he met the three-rate monster and beast, it was difficult.The few deep visible bone injuries on his body were all caused by three-rate monster and beast s.Hu hu hu hu \u2026.Long Fei panted as he simply bandaged the wound. After consuming a Highest Grade Medicine Powder, he said once more, \"Not enough, it's still not enough.\"\"Continue to kill!\"For the entire day, Long Fei did not rest at all.In the evening!\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for levelling up. Current Level: 4 war spirit!\"The instant of leveling up.Long Fei heaved a sigh of relief as he muttered: \"I have finally levelled up. If I don't level up now, I'll have to use the true pill.\"Under the release of various skills, Long Fei's true breath was completely insufficient.Night fell.The demon beast's time was up.The corner of Long Fei's mouth curved up as he said excitedly: \"The demon beast's time is up, and so is mine.\"At night, all the demonic beasts would come out to search for food.It could be said.The night was the time for the demonic beasts to control themselves.However \u2026To Long Fei, everything that happened now was all within his control.\"Kill!\"After refining the three-rate monster and beast's blood essence into a few top quality talismans.Long Fei jumped into the darkness.A few minutes later.\"Boom!\"\"Boom!\"The sound of impact rang out, along with the miserable shrieks of demon beasts.\"Die!\"\"dragon chop!\"\"Shua!\"\u2026 \u2026.For the entire night, Long Fei reaped the harvest crazily, and almost died several times. After escaping from death several times, he came back to kill.Everywhere he went, there were all corpses of demon beasts.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to the player 'Long Fei' for gathering 100 Fire Essence Qi, would you like to strengthen it?\"\"Strengthen!\"\"Ding!\"\"Strengthening failed!\"\"F * ck!\"Long Fei cursed, \"Fuck, this is the thirteenth time I have failed, could it be that I won't be able to raise the success rate of forging with the fire element to 70%?\"He had succeeded seven times.After that, he continued to fail nonstop again and again, again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again.However \u2026A success rate of 70% for fire attribute forging was already heaven-defying.\"Forget it!\"\"The upgrade is more important.\"Long Fei leaped into the darkness like a ghost.Noon of the second day.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for levelling up. Current Level: 5 war spirit.\"\"Huff \u2026\"Long Fei's entire body was paralyzed and he was riddled with scars again. Fortunately he had recovered from his levelling otherwise, he really would not be able to hold on.It was too hard.Every time was the limit.After resting for half a minute, Long Fei checked the experience required to level up. Looking at the long chain of zeros, Long Fei was dumbfounded.\"When will I be able to level up?\"\"What the heck!\"Long Fei cursed in his heart, \"Isn't it too powerful to have his Experience Points doubled?\"Upgrade is getting harder and harder.Furthermore, the experience of the Level 1 and Level 2 demon beasts was becoming lesser and lesser, completely unable to satisfy Long Fei's need to level up.\"If this goes on, breaking through the war chief realm will be too difficult.\" Long Fei frowned, \"I have to kill a higher level demon beast.\"\"But \u2026\"\"I'm not familiar with the hundreds of thousands of barren mountains, where is the place where high-level beasts gather?\"Long Fei was secretly annoyed.Moreover.What he was more worried about was the leopard girl. How was she now?Would Xiao Bai move recklessly?He was not worried that Xiao Bai would not be able to find him, but rather, he was worried that Xiao Bai would act recklessly.\"It's unlikely for him to level up any time soon.\"Five million experience points was too much, and it would take him at least three days to level up.\"The most important thing is to think of a way to escape the Fierce Tiger Tribe?\"\"It's not hard to find the leopard girl, but it's hard to figure out how to escape.\"Long Fei thought.At the same time, he checked the system.\"Refining Technics... Engraving Formation... Alchemy Arts... beastmastery... \"Suddenly.Long Fei's eyes flashed, \"beastmastery? If... If I can control a flying beast, I can easily escape from the Feral Tiger Tribe!! \"\"That's right!\"Long Fei shouted excitedly.The Feral Tiger Tribe did not have any crossbows in their hands. Furthermore, the Feral Tiger Tribe was the most ferocious tribe in the demon territory, so it was impossible for them to charge out. The only path they could take was through the sky.\"If I could fly, then everything would be much simpler!\"\"Flying bird!\"\"Birds...\" I'm afraid that in order to find avian demonic beasts, I'll have to look for those Fire Hawks on the cliffs. \" Long Fei had seen it a few times in the sky, but its wings were only about two meters long.The prerequisite now was how to catch the Fire Eagle!Combining his experience of Alchemy technique and talisman technique, Long Fei quickly knew that in order to increase the success rate of the beastmastery, he could only raise the Level Increase of the beastmastery.\"That's easy!\"Very quickly, Long Fei found a Level One Single Demon Beast.Immediately.The idea moved, releasing beastmastery.A string of electric net that only Long Fei could see enveloped the Goblin Beast's body.The electric net enveloped the demonic beast and entered its mind.\"Woo \u2026\"The demonic beast immediately became alert and escaped frantically.It was also at this time.\"Ding!\"\"Beast Master failed, proficiency + 1\"\"Trying to run?\"Long Fei took a step forward, and instantly blocked off the Goblin Beast's path, and shouted: \"Did I let you escape? \"Be a bit more honest with me, otherwise you will lose your life.\"He pressed the demonic beast to the ground.\"beastmastery!\"\"Ding!\"\"Beast Master Failed, proficiency + 1!\"\"beastmastery!\"\"Failure, proficiency + 1!\"\u2026 \u2026.Constant unleashing, continuous failures, a hundred consecutive failures.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for his beastmastery, currently at level one!\"\"It leveled up!\"\"Again!\"Another beastmastery was released.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing 'Flame Deer' for obtaining 130 experience, 10 true breath and 1 Energy Values.\"\"Holy sh * t!\"\"He was actually killed by Beast Master.\"Long Fei looked at the demonic beast that was spitting white foam, and muttered: \"Does the beastmastery have any killing power?\"If strong idea rush into your brain and try to control your mind, you will die from frothing at the mouth.However \u2026Just as Long Fei had said, the beastmastery had a certain probability of instant death, but this probability of instant death was extremely small!\"Get another demon beast to train with!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Current level: Level: 2!\"\"Huff \u2026\"\"The success rate is too low.\"In more than ten hours, he had only succeeded three times. It had to be said that the success rate of the beastmastery was outrageously low.It would be even more difficult to control a demon beast with a certain level of intelligence like the Fire Eagle. The level of the beastmastery had to be raised a bit more.At the same time.Long Fei had also done many different experiments.Every cultivation technique had its own unique characteristics. Whether it was offensive skills or auxiliary functions, they all had certain attributes. As long as one could feel through them, it would be much easier for one to cultivate.The nature of Alchemy Techniques to master spirit grass was like the time in a pill furnace.The talisman techniques, the mastery of the demonic beast's blood essence, the use of the true breath, and the mental foregone thought, these were all unique attributes.And the unique attribute of the beastmastery is.The idea s communicate!Forcefully crushing!As long as you were able to communicate with these two attributes well, and guide the thoughts of the demon beast in front of your brothers and friends, the idea would be much easier to deal with.And then again.Unless he met some cowardly and fearful demon beasts, he would let them be controlled. Otherwise, the personality of the demon beasts would be wild and unyielding. Under normal circumstances, they would not let him control their thoughts.The former was too difficult.The latter is equally difficult.As long as the weaknesses of the demon beasts were found, these two problems would be easily solved.If he wanted to control the demon beasts, he had to understand them first.In the past, Long Fei could slowly understand it, but now \u2026 He didn't have much time left.\"Ding!\"\"Ding!\"\"Ding!\"\u2026 \u2026.Long Fei did not try too hard. What he wanted now was the proficiency, to continuously release the profound energy, to dry up the true breath and to consume the true pill. In short, he wanted to raise the Level Increase of the beastmastery.Early morning.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for levelling up! Current Level: Level: 3!\"Long Fei looked at the properties of the beastmastery.Skill Path: beastmasteryLevel: 3proficiency: 0/5000 points\"Damn \u2026\" A five thousand point proficiency is too darned. \" Long Fei cursed, \"Seems like I have to go and fight, if I want to level up beastmastery now, it will be too late.\"In here.The true breath s were also a problem.Five thousand proficiency s was equivalent to fifty thousand true breath Points, he simply did not have that much, and true pill s did not have that much.Moreover.The true pill was a lifesaving true breath Pill and it could not be used carelessly unless it was at a critical moment.In an instant.Long Fei quickly moved and stood on top of a tree. He looked at the sky in search of traces of the Fire Eagle.\"Wow \u2026\"\"Caw \u2026\"A sharp cry of a fire eagle sounded out. Long Fei was overjoyed, \"We finally found it!\"At this moment.The Fire Hawk swooped down like a fighter plane, its claws flashing under the blazing sun as it grabbed onto its feet like three sharp blades.A few seconds later!\"Rumble \u2026\"A towering tree collapsed with a loud bang, and soon after, a huge Rhinoceros was caught.\"Holy sh * t!\"\"three-rate monster and beast, Raging Flames Rhino?\"Long Fei was stunned, \"Isn't that just too powerful?\"That Rhinoceros didn't have the slightest temper. In front of the Fire Hawk, it was like a dead dog, giving up even the least bit of struggle.\"Awesome!\"He grabbed the Rhinoceros and flew towards a cliff.Long Fei was also quickly chasing after it. No matter how strong the Fire Eagle was, he had to try because this was the only way he could think of to save the leopard girl.No matter what.The Long family would never give up.After chasing for half an hour.Long Fei was standing on top of the cliff. There was a cave about 4 to 5 meters under his feet.\"I have to think of a way down.\"beastmastery's cast range was the limit, two meters, and the closer they were, the better. If they wanted to catch the Fire Eagle, they would have to enter the cave, otherwise it would not be possible.\"Fire Eagle still has some time to return to the cave. I have to hurry.\"Long Fei glanced at the dried up wood at the entrance of the cave and said, \"I'll give it my all!\"He jumped down.With one hand grabbing onto the dead tree, it began to creak loudly. Long Fei was so scared that he almost peed his pants, and said: \"Teacher Bo Duo, bless me!\"At a height of a few thousand meters, even if Long Fei had the Battle Dragon Armor and King Kong Shield s, he would still fall to his death if he fell.Maybe it was a prayer.The dead tree did not break. Long Fei said gratefully in his heart, \"Bou Ye, I am your loyal fan. I have collected all of your movies. This is power. Thank you for your blessings. Hahaha \u2026\"He carefully climbed up, only to see a head popping out.\"Hiss, hiss \u2026\"\"Hiss, hiss \u2026\"A huge python as thick as a person's thigh spurted its lightning fast snakes as it rushed out. Long Fei was so scared that he almost fell off the cliff.\"Fire Rock Giant Snake!?\"\"Peak rank 3 beast!\"Furthermore... The Fire Rock Giant Snake and the Fire Hawk were enemies of the world, the kind that didn't give up until one side died.These were all none of Long Fei's business.He just wanted to catch a fire eagle.Right at this moment, the Fire Hawk let out a mournful cry, flapped its wings, and dove over.\"Holy sh * t!\"\"The heck, my luck is that good?\"Long Fei hung on the cliff. He couldn't go up, he couldn't go down. There were Fire Rock Giant Snake in front and a fire eagle behind him.The Fire Hawk was extremely anxious.So much so that it gave up on catching the Raging Flame Rhino. The rhinoceros fell down and directly smashed into a pile of meat paste.\"Another fight between deities!\"\"Who did I offend?\"Long Fei forced it. If he was on flat ground, he would not be afraid of these two beasts, but he was hanging on a cliff. If he were to go up, he would be swallowed by the giant python in one gulp. If that fiery eagle clawed at him, his life would be nothing more than a pile of meat paste like that of a Rhinoceros.\"Gugu...\"Suddenly.The cries of young eagles came from the cave.The Fire Rock Giant Snake turned around and suddenly rushed into the cave.\"No wonder the Fire Hawk was so anxious and didn't dare to attack. So it actually had a cub inside.\"Long Fei's heart trembled.\"Alright!\"\"I have to make a choice too.\"\"Fire Eagle, I hope your intelligence can let you know how to repay favors!\"The giant python at the mouth of the cave disappeared. Long Fei seized this chance and flipped his body, immediately standing at the mouth of the cave. The idea moved, and said without caring if the Fire Eagle understood or not: \"I will save your child, don't attack the cave!\"Finished.He immediately summoned his dragon salyer and rushed into the cave.He grabbed the Fire Rock Giant Snake's tail and fiercely pulled. The dragon salyer slashed and shouted: \"Die!\"The Fire Rock Giant Snake turned its body, and the snake's tongue was like lightning. Fear towards the dragon salyer appeared in its eyes, but... It did not give up.His throat was churning.\"Boom!\"A small fireball sprayed out.\"Holy sh * t!\"\"Magic snake?!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The instant the Fire Rock Giant Snake turned around, he rushed to the bottom of the cave and blocked in front of the Fire Eagle cubs.The two eyes of the Fire Rock Giant Snake were like lanterns, and when it saw Long Fei protecting its young, it became even angrier.Wu wu wu \u2026With a strange thought in his throat, a bigger fireball shot out.\"Gugu...\"The fiery rock cub began to cry out.Long Fei shouted, \"I know it's dangerous, stop bothering me.\"\"Ahh \u2026\"The dragon salyer moved, locking onto the fireball, slashing its blade out!\"Break!\"It cut the fireball into two.\"Gugu...\"The Fire Eagle started to shout happily again, as if it was cheering for Long Fei.The Fire Rock Giant Snake was burning with rage, it did not continue releasing fireballs, but swung its tail, trying to wrap Long Fei up.\"Humph!\"\"With just you?!\"Long Fei leaped out lightly and easily dodged the giant python's attack. However, the giant python's tail did not coil towards him, but instead attacked the cub behind him.\"Crap!\"Long Fei's heart tensed, he never thought that the Fire Rock Giant Snake would be so sinister.He immediately shouted, \"Be careful!\"Long Fei kicked the rock wall, and his body shot out explosively. Since he had chosen to help the Fire Eagle, then he must protect its young, otherwise everything would have been wasted.At this moment.Long Fei threw caution to the wind, \"If you have the guts, come at me!\"\"Hiss, hiss \u2026\"The snake's tongue was like lightning, as if it was laughing maniacally in a complacent manner.\"Woo woo \u2026\"A fireball burst out from its mouth, and at the same time, it aimed at the cub's tail.\"Too insidious!\"Unimaginable treachery.\"Bam!\"Long Fei's back was hit by the fireball and his Dragon Armor and King Kong Shield's defense were released at the same time.That was it.He felt a burning pain on his back. The giant tail wrapped around him and tightened its grip.\"Crack!\"\"Crack!\"Long Fei's joints were popping. If this continued, his body would fall apart.Incomparable pain!Long Fei roared out in his heart, \"Wushuang!\"\"Weng \u2026\"Thick, dual-attribute energy burst forth, a powerful force flowing through every corner of his body. \"Damn it, being played around by a snake, I don't believe I can't kill you!\"\"Ahh \u2026\"With a furious roar, Long Fei's right arm broke free from its bindings, and the Large Power King Kong Ape on his right arm roared as he smashed it with his fist!\"Boom!\"\"Woo woo \u2026\" The python cried out in pain, but it did not loosen its body. Instead, it tightened its grip.\"Boom!\"Another punch landed.\"Let's see how many punches you can take!\"\"Boom!\"\"Boom!\"After a few continuous punches, the Fire Rock Giant Snake could not take it any longer, and immediately pulled its tail out, and in the blink of an eye, the Fire Rock Giant Snake flew into the air, opening its mouth wide, wanting to swallow Long Fei whole.\"You want to eat your father?\"\"dragon salyer technique!\"whoosh whoosh whoosh \u2026 *After seven moves were completed in one go, Long Fei's blade aura moved, \"Gale Chop!\"\"Break!\"The blade was like a gust of wind, directly rushing into the Fire Rock Giant Snake's mouth, Long Fei took the chance and leaped up, the blade qi wreaked havoc and slashed down heavily.\"Boom!\"The Fire Rock Giant Snake could not take it anymore.Killed!\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing 'Fire Rock Giant Snake' for obtaining 5000 experience, 500 true breath and 1 Energy Values.\"\"Congratulations to the player 'Long Fei' for obtaining 'Heart of Fire'.

The skin, tendons, bones, blood, spirit, soul and slay will all be released at the same time.

A single activation, that is truly dazzling, cool, and fierce existence.\"No doubt about it.The blade aura was like flames, and the last move of the 'dragon chop' was a wild fire slashing. The scene would definitely flash before a blind person's eyes.\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"Too cool!\"Long Fei became excited.Just as he killed the Fire Rock Giant Snake, the three cubs hopped over to Long Fei's side, extremely happy.At this moment.Fire Hawk was incredibly anxious when he heard the violent explosion sounds coming from the cave, and could no longer resist charging in. Seeing his own child being so intimate with Long Fei, and seeing the flame python die on the ground, he knew what had happened, and the wound on Long Fei's back made him even more touched.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' and 'Fire Eagle' for their intimacy reaching 100 points. You can now communicate with the Fire Eagle.\"\"Huh?\"\"His intimacy has reached 100 points, but he can actually communicate with demon beasts?\" Long Fei was overjoyed.At this time.The idea moved slightly and said to Long Fei gratefully: \"Thank you. You are the savior of my child, I can do anything for you.\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"Long Fei became excited, and said: \"I really need your help with something, can you accept my idea's control? \"I promise that as long as you help me complete this task, I will release you from my control.\"\"I'm willing!\"Fire Hawk didn't have any hesitation.This was the benefit of having one hundred intimacy s!The Fire Eagle will agree to any condition.Long Fei was also extremely grateful as she said, \"Thank you!\"And then \u2026A ray of beastmastery was released.\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for successfully summoning it. Would you like to obtain 'Fire Eagle' as a mount?\"\"No!\"Long Fei rejected it. He said that he would let the Fire Eagle leave, and he would definitely let it go. Moreover, it still had three children to take care of.Immediately.The Fire Eagle let out a cry.Long Fei jumped up and landed on the back of the Fire Eagle, following that, he rushed out of the cave like a fighter plane and dove down. Long Fei felt the ecstasy of flying, and in his heart he thought: \"Leopard girl, I'm coming!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Congratulations, Young Lord. \"\"The wedding of the young master of the Feral Tiger Tribe is a grand occasion for our demon territory. Congratulations!\"\u2026 \u2026.At the entrance of the village, people from other tribes continuously walked in.The chief steward of the Fierce Tiger Tribe, Three-eyed Tiger, welcomed him personally.shao hu was very, very happy today. From the moment he saw the leopard girl, he knew that he had to get this little wild cat.The wildness of her body and her flawless figure filled him with possessiveness.However \u2026He did not treat the other girls the same way. He wanted to truly obtain the leopard girl's body in all aspects, and also her heart.For this reason, he had always worked hard.But at last he lost patience.He felt that if he wanted to obtain a young girl's heart, he could use the most efficient and simplest method to enter her body.Once he entered her body, he would be able to obtain her heart.Looking at the leopard girl with a phoenix crown on her head and her ice-cold eyes, he smiled lightly and said: \"Little Wild Cat, please be happy. Today is our wedding day, so even if it's for your wild leopard tribe, you should smile.\"The leopard girl looked at herself in the mirror. This wasn't the wedding she wanted at all, not the man she wanted at all. She hated him!But there was nothing she could do.Just like shao hu had said, they were not thinking for himself or for the tribe.The tribe was where she was born and raised. There were too many relatives in the tribe. If they all died because of her, then the leopard girl would feel incomparably guilty.Moreover.Hadn't his father always wanted her to marry shao hu?Since her mother was no longer around, she had to help her father a bit. This was the only thing she could do.In just a few short days.The leopard girl suddenly looked like she had grown up. However, deep in her heart, she was still hoping that there would be a prince capable of taking her away and leaving this place.Seeing that the leopard girl did not speak, shao hu's tone was ice-cold. \"You're not thinking of your Big Brother Long Fei coming to save you, are you?\"\"I'm really looking forward to his arrival.\"\"The Fierce Tiger Warriors of the third floor and the third floor are all looking forward to his arrival. With him here, my wedding will be even more exciting.\" shao hu looked at the leopard girl and said: \"Little Wild Cat, if that human dares to come here, he will die here. However... If he had come back, he would have come a long time ago. Do you think he would still come? Hahaha... Humans are the most selfish, most despicable and most insidious race in the world. \"The leopard girl felt a chill in her heart.\"Yeah, if Big Brother Long Fei wanted to come, he would have already arrived.\" The leopard girl laughed bitterly in her heart. At the same time, her expression changed once again as she muttered, \"Big Brother Long Fei, please don't come. Please don't appear.\"He felt slightly disappointed.However \u2026She hoped even more that Long Fei would not appear because the Feral Tiger Tribe was truly strong. The strongest tribe in demon territory, if they were caught, they would definitely be dismembered.Seeing the leopard girl's expression, shao hu felt very unhappy.Extremely displeased.The rage in his heart raged as he swung his sleeve and shouted in a deep voice, \"Put on her clothes. It's almost time for the wedding ceremony.\"Finished.shao hu walked out of the tent and said to the subordinate beside him: \"Watch this well. If you find any humans sneaking in, kill them!\"\"You dare to fight with me, shao hu, for a woman?\"\"As long as you dare to appear, I will make you regret ever being born into this world.\"\u2026 \u2026.At the entrance of the village.Long Fei disguised himself, and learnt the etiquette of the other Spirit Demon beings from far away, and said: \"Congratulations, congratulations, congratulations!\"Three-eyed Tiger looked at Long Fei and asked: Where's the invitation?Long Fei took out the invitation, and said: \"Come and drink the Young Master's wedding wine, how can you not bring the invitation along?As he spoke, he took out the prepared gift.These were all intercepted by him along the way.The invitations were naturally stolen.Three-eye Tiger smiled and said, \"Welcome, welcome. The wedding is about to start.\"Long Fei politely laughed, and quickly entered the village, thinking to himself: \"I wonder how Xiao Bai's preparations are going.\"\"I hope everything will go smoothly!\"Long Fei safely entered the Fierce Tiger Camp and discovered that the training guards were wave after wave. Furthermore, their cultivation levels were not low, all of them were in the Peak Realm, and there were even some that were in the war chief realm.In addition, they were of the Demonic Beast race.Tianshan already had strength and a high defense. Humans of the same generation as them were no match for them.This was also the reason why the Long family's troops had been stationed here all these years.Long Fei slowly moved through the crowd, memorizing the surrounding topography and the training of the guards by heart.At this moment.The entrance of the village was in an uproar.\"Hahaha \u2026\"\"The Lord of All Fiends has arrived.\" Three-eyed Tiger smiled and said to one of his guards, \"Go get the Young Lord.\"This was his father-in-law.shao hu naturally had to personally greet them.devils leopard smiled faintly, a bad taste in his heart.The few tribal elders beside him were all smiling like flowers. They respectfully said, \"We still need the Head Supervisor to personally welcome us. It's truly an honor.\"Not long later.shao hu then walked over and bowed towards devils leopard and said: \"Your son-in-law greets Master Yuanyu.\"devils leopard slightly asked: \"Where is my daughter?\"The corner of shao hu's mouth drew back as he laughed, \"Master Yue Shan is currently resting right now, and the wedding is about to begin. You will be able to see your daughter soon.\"Obviously.shao hu did not want devils leopard to see the leopard girl, so he was worried that things would change again.He couldn't wait any longer!devils leopard frowned, he secretly clenched his fists under his sleeves and was pulled into the Feral Tiger Tribe by a few clan elders.shao hu looked at their backs and sneered, then said: \"Even your daughter has a bitter face at such a wedding, if you really make this daddy unhappy, this daddy will immediately destroy your wild leopard tribe.\"Three-eyes smiled and said, \"Young master, today is your wedding day, don't say such ominous words.\"Just as shao hu was talking to devils leopard.Long Fei had already found the tent that the leopard girl was in.This place was relatively quiet and not many people passed by.\"You are not allowed to enter here, please leave \u2026\"Not waiting for him to finish.Long Fei immediately threw out two punches, knocking the two of them down and quickly entering the tent.It just so happened that there was only Leopard Lady in the tent., who had rushed into the tent, was stunned by the beauty of the phoenix coronet and gown. It was truly very beautiful, as if she was a completely different person.However, there were traces of tears in the corners of his eyes, and his expression was frosty.The leopard woman was shocked. She was overjoyed the moment she saw Long Fei, but then she instantly became anxious and said: \"Big Brother Long Fei, why are you here? This place is too dangerous. If shao hu were to find out, you will definitely not be able to escape. \"\"Hurry up!\"\"Hurry up and leave!\"Long Fei grabbed the leopard girl's small hand and said: \"I'll bring you out of here!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If I leave, shao hu will kill all of my wild leopard clansmen.\"\"My father will die as well.\"\"I can't leave!\"She wanted it right away.Even.She truly wished that Long Fei could take her away, but... She couldn't!He was very clear about shao hu's personality. When she left after her wedding, she would cause him to lose all his face.Long Fei's heart tensed up. Looking at the leopard girl's expression, he said: \"Everything is mine!\"\"No way!\"The leopard girl shook her head and said: \"You are a human, if you were to participate, all the tribes in demon territory would come to suppress the wild leopard tribe, and that would be even more miserable.\"\"Big Brother Long Fei, thank you for coming.\"\"Meeting you is the happiest thing in my life, thank you.\" The leopard girl giggled. It was that kind of mischievous and cute smile again.But!She could not help it, and two streams of tears fell from her eyes.Pain!It was very painful!Looking at her two streams of tears, Long Fei's heart inexplicably hurt, as if it was about to be torn apart. This was the first time he had experienced such a feeling.He really wanted to help the leopard girl wipe the tears off her face, but when he took a step forward, the leopard girl took a step back.Suddenly.He didn't know what to do!He hated this feeling.At this moment.The sound of intense footsteps came from outside the door.Discovered!The leopard girl immediately said: \"Big Brother Long Fei, run quickly. I'm fine, I'm fine.Finished.The leopard girl strode out.\"What for?\"\"It's already time for the wedding, what are you all doing?\" The leopard girl sternly rebuked, \"Why aren't you protecting me when I go to the altar?\"The guards trembled, not daring to be disrespectful to the future young master's wife.In any case, the leopard girl was still here, so they did not fail their duty. The commander shouted, \"Protect the young lady and bring her to the altar.\"The leopard girl turned around and glanced at the tent, and muttered in her heart: \"Big Brother Long Fei, thank you. You gave me so many happy times, if I could only do it, I would really want you to be my husband.\"\"Hee hee \u2026\"The most beautiful smile.The smile that was forever left on Long Fei's face.\u2026 \u2026.Within the tent.Long Fei was stunned in place, his mind a mess.He did not know what to do!Very irritable.An inexplicable sense of irritation arose.\"What am I doing here?\"\"Why am I here?\"Long Fei muttered to himself, \"Is the leopard girl happy? Is that man really the man she married? \"\"F * ck!\"\"I came here to steal the marriage.\"\"She's not happy. That big brute is not worthy of her.\"Soon.Long Fei gave himself the answer, clenched his fists tightly, lowered his gaze, and said: \"I want to take her away, I must bring her away from here, I want her to forever emit that kind of cute and innocent smile!\"I'm going for broke.Long Fei rushed out of the tent and shouted, \"Leopard girl, follow me!\"However...There was no one outside the tent. There was also no one around. It was quiet.At this moment.The central square of the Fierce Tiger Tribe resounded with the howls of the Fierce Tiger Tribe.The Rites of Heavenly Worship began!This was a rule passed down through the demon territory.The tribe must sacrifice themselves to the heavens and ask the gods for their opinion.Actually.In other words, he would slaughter a few cows and sheep, sprinkle some blood, and then use a Divine Staff to jump up and down for a period of time. Finally, he would ask the heavens about a series of things.\"Uh-huh!\"\"Heh heh heh!\"\"Uh-huh \u2026.\"A group of people wearing beast skin clothing and ferocious tiger masks jumped around the altar.After jumping for ten minutes.\"Please!\"\"Roar!\"The leader of the High Priest shouted fiercely, following that, two servants brought the leopard girl to the altar. shao hu also walked out and with one step, he jumped to the top of the altar!\"Good skill!\"\"So powerful!\"\"A fierce tiger leaping and landing steadily on the ground. It looks ordinary, but it conceals endless power!\"\"As expected of the number one genius of the demon territory!\"\u2026 \u2026.shao hu stood on the altar, smeared the blood on his face and looked up to the sky.It was also at this time.The High Priest roared at the leopard girl.shao hu's gaze darkened as he swept his gaze across the entire audience and asked loudly, \"Who is the young master of the Feral Tiger Tribe?!\"\"Hah!\"'shao hu, shao hu...\"The people of the Fierce Tiger Tribe read his name aloud.\"Who will be the commander of the demons?\"'shao hu, shao hu...\"\"Who will lead the evil demon clan out of hundreds of thousands of barren mountains and slaughter all of humanity?\"'shao hu, shao hu...\"\u2026 \u2026.His voice shook the heavens!This was not like a big wedding, but more like a personal show for shao hu, with a large number of ass-kissing girls.Amongst the crowd.Long Fei looked at the trembling leopard girls on the altar, waiting to take action.\"Ahh, ha, ha \u2026\" shao hu laughed wildly, and shouted loudly: \"Who dares to oppose my, shao hu's, wedding?\"The entire arena instantly fell silent.Who dared to object?Forget about shao hu's cultivation, just the influence of the Feral Tiger Tribe was not enough to oppose him!\"Who would dare to object?\" shao hu enjoyed this quiet moment very much, his face had a pleased smile, \"Does anyone dare to object?\"At this moment.Long Fei's voice sunk, \"I object!\"The sound was like a thunderclap.With Long Fei at the center, the crowd quickly dispersed.Everyone stared at him.\"Who is this person?\"\"Which tribe?\"\"Are you looking to die?\"\"Does he not want his life? To dare oppose shao hu's wedding, he must be tired of living. \"\u2026 \u2026.All sorts of discussions broke out amongst the crowd.In the distance.The leopard girl couldn't help but cry. She covered her mouth with one hand and tried hard not to cry out loud, \"Big Brother Long Fei, Big Brother Long Fei...\"shao hu's gaze darkened, he stared straight at Long Fei and said in a daze: \"Human boy, you've finally appeared!\"\"Human?\"\"He's human?\"\"Why would a human infiltrate the demon territory?\"\"This kind of scene happened about ten years ago, and it seems like a human had suddenly appeared with the help of a witch. The human in front of me looks somewhat similar to that human, could it be \u2026?\"A few of the older people looked at Long Fei as if they thought of something.They had experienced that kind of scene before, so they had a deep memory of it.Long Fei didn't even look at shao hu, but walked towards the leopard girl step by step and said: \"I'll bring you out of here.\"\"Come with me!\"The leopard girl cried and shook her head, unable to say a word.shao hu was ignored.His voice was like a tiger's as he roared, \"Kid, she's my woman. If you dare touch her even once, I'll make you die without a burial ground.\"Long Fei raised both his eyes and laughed coldly: \"That's right, I am here to steal the marriage!\"\"Idiot.\"\"Didn't you want me to be your husband?\"\"Alright!\"\"From this second onwards, I, Long Fei, will be your husband.

Looking at Long Fei, she was moved to tears after hearing what he had said.It was also at this time.The people of the Fierce Tiger Tribe did not come out, one of the clan elders from wild leopard tribe suddenly rushed out and slashed at the back of Xiang Longfei's head.\"Big Brother Long Fei, be careful!\" The leopard girl screamed.Long Fei didn't mind. He stretched out his hand to look at the leopard girl and said seriously: \"Follow me, I'll fly you!\"\"Ahh \u2026\"\"Kid, prepare to die!\"The Mountain Spliting Knief slashed down, the force of its strike was so strong that it could split open a mountain.If this saber struck, he would die without a doubt!Long Fei looked at the leopard girl without moving, and extended his hand in front of the leopard girl, saying: \"Come with me!\"\"Kid!\"\"Go to hell!\"With an angry roar, the blade was not even half a meter away from Long Fei.Everyone looked at Long Fei with sneers of contempt.\"I thought it was just a powerful human, but it turns out it's just a piece of trash.\"\"We're going to be dismembered soon, and we don't know anything.\"\"Kill him! He dares to come to the Fierce Tiger Tribe to steal the marriage!

He lost his balance and fell to the ground with a pale face.The entire audience went silent!All of them were stunned by the dense Qi around Long Fei's body.The broken blade from his punch had dislocated the arm of the war spirit Elder. This power was too strong!Long Fei turned around and looked at the leopard girl, wiping the tears off her face and smiled: \"I will not make you cry anymore. You are an angel, a happy angel.\"The leopard girl giggled and said: \"Big Brother Long Fei, are you really willing to be my husband?\"Long Fei nodded his head, and said: \"Of course, I swore earlier that I, Long Fei, will protect you for the rest of your life.\"\"Ahh \u2026\"\"Boom!\"With a roar, shao hu jumped down from the altar, causing the ground to crack.

The powerful claws of the Beast King tore through the air and pierced into devils leopard's body.\"Shua!\"All of a sudden, he pulled devils leopard's heart out, and blood started dripping all over.shao hu sneered sinisterly, holding the still beating heart, he looked at the leopard girl and said: \"Do you see, this is your father's heart.\"\"This is the result of choosing a human, hahaha \u2026\"The leopard girl cried out in pain, \"Dad \u2026\"Too strong!Not waiting to say it.shao hu was too strong, with just one move, he was able to kill devils leopard in an instant.

You can't even protect her father's life, you can't even protect her tribe, what right do you have to protect her for the rest of your life? Are you worthy? \"\"Hahaha \u2026\"They watched as devils leopard died in front of them.Long Fei couldn't do anything.In his heart, he also asked himself, \"Long Fei, are you worthy?!\"\"Are they worthy?\"shao hu looked at Long Fei's stupefied expression, laughed arrogantly, and said: \"Only I can protect her, what a pity \u2026 She made the wrong choice. \"\"However!\"\"It doesn't matter, she won't die, I will use iron chains to tie her up, I want her to live like a dog, I want her to become my sex slave, wuhaha \u2026\"\"Little Wildcat, this is your choice!\"The leopard girl started to tremble.Not daring to look at shao hu again, he trembled from head to toe.\"Huff \u2026\"Long Fei let out a deep breath, and said: \"I will let you know whether or not I'm worthy!\"In that instant.Long Fei's idea sunk and ordered: \"Fire Eagle!\"\"Caw \u2026\"A sharp eagle cry sounded and a huge shadow swooped down. Its wings flapped and the dust on the ground was lifted into the air \u2026At this moment.Long Fei ordered, and said: Take her away!\"What about you?\" \"I can take you two away!\"Long Fei's lips curled up, revealing a cold smile filled with killing intent, and said: \"I want to let him know whether or not I'm worthy!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Who would have thought that there would be another one today.\"\"Damn human!\"\"Kill them all!\"shao hu suddenly took a step forward and shouted: \"All of you stop!\"\"He's mine!\"Before he finished speaking, shao hu's body had already rushed out, pouncing towards Xiang Longfei, his five fingers forming a claw, grabbing onto Xiang Longfei's heart, he shouted: \"Fierce Tiger Steals Heart!\"\"Roar \u2026\"The tiger's roar resounded in mid air, a powerful aura rolled out, it was the cruel aura of a primal beast.Long Fei's eyes turned sinister, and he bellowed: \"dragon salyer technique!\"\"Open the skin!\"\"Broken tendons, cracked bones \u2026\"In 10% of a second, he unleashed 7 blades.shao hu sneered, and said: \"He only had a flimsy appearance, and didn't even hit me once.\"\"Trash!\"\"Is that so?\" The corner of Long Fei's mouth drew back, and said: \"Then look at this move!\"\"Shua!\"\"Gale Chop!\"Long Fei held onto the blade with both of his hands, and fiercely slashed upwards. The first layer of blade Qi was released, and like a flame, it exploded outwards.\"Rumble \u2026\"Flaming Saber Qi!shao hu turned around and fiercely changed his direction, and explosively retreated a few steps, looking at the flaming blade qi, both fists striking out heavily, \"Breaking your fart blade qi!\"\"Rumble!\"Both fists landed heavily on the saber Qi.The Flaming Knife's anger sank.\"Hurricane Cut!\"The second release of the blade aura was even more intense, carrying with it the power of the hurricane and slay. Furthermore, the hurricane contained the power of flames, just like a flaming tornado.The blade aura swept shao hu up into the air.In the blink of an eye.Long Fei's body leaped, and with a \"whoosh\", he charged into the hurricane, locked onto shao hu's body, and roared furiously: \"This old man will let you know what qualifications are!\"Word for word.The saber Qi was released like thunder.The third slash!The fourth slash!Fifth, sixth, seventh \u2026 The hundredth slash!The 101st slash, the 102nd \u2026 One hundred seventy-fifth slash!\"Rumble!\"A layer of saber Qi slashed out. Each slash carried with it damage from fire.It was as if the air was filled with dancing flames. It was incomparably shocking and cool, shocking everyone in the surrounding area.\"What is this?\"\"What level is this human at?\"\"Oh my god!\"\u2026 \u2026.Everyone was shocked by Long Fei's Dragon Slaying Flame.One hundred and seventy slashes.shao hu's body fell from midair and heavily crashed into the ground. His entire body was dripping with fresh blood and he didn't have an inch of good skin.Blood kept gushing out of his mouth.One of his eyes was cut open, one eye was filled with blood veins as it stared at Long Fei, its killing intent was extremely dense.He had to say it.shao hu's defense exceeded Long Fei's expectations.Not even one hundred and seventy-five slashes were enough to kill him.This was the advantage of an evil demon, just based on the defense of the body it was simply heaven defying.However \u2026No matter how strong his defense was, there was only a tenth of a gash left on his head.Moreover.shao hu had already lost the ability to resist.Long Fei descended, stepped on his head, and coldly said while lowering his body: \"Do you know what qualifications are now?\"Looking at shao hu's vicious eyes, Long Fei laughed arrogantly: \"You don't accept it, right?\"The sound suddenly changed!\"If you don't accept it, then go and die!\"The dragon salyer slashed down heavily.\"Father!\"shao hu suddenly roared.swish *A sonic boom could be heard.\"Boom!\"With a loud sound, Long Fei didn't even have time to react before his chest felt as if it was being ripped apart, and his entire body flew out.\"Boom!\"On the altar, a thick crack had appeared on the bluestone. Long Fei's body caved in, the blood and energy in his throat tumbled, and he could not help but spew out a mouthful of blood.His internal organs were all tumbling about.Within his sea of consciousness, his mind was trembling. This was too unbearable.It was worse than death!His opponent was too strong.Long Fei simply could not react in time, and did not even see the shadow of a person.The Dragon Armor and King Kong Shield on his body didn't even have enough time to defend before they were sent flying.A Black Robe Man appeared beside shao hu, and upon seeing the injuries on his body, his forehead turned sinister.It was also at this time.All the members of the Fierce Tiger Tribe kneeled on the ground. \"Greetings, leader!\"The leader of the Fierce Tiger Tribe, shao wudi!A black tiger!shao wudi gave shao hu a black pill, he stood up and stared at Long Fei with gloomy eyes: \"You are a member of the Long family?\"Long Fei swallowed a Highest Grade Medicine Powder and suppressed the injuries in his body. He stared at shao wudi without any fear, but instead, he was excited!Because!Because \u2026 shao wudi was a BOSS that was shining with a golden light!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She grabbed one of his legs and fiercely smashed it down.The ground shook and cracked.Long Fei's body looked like it was about to fall apart.\"Bam!\"A kick exploded out, sending Long Fei flying once again, smashing him heavily onto the altar. His body sank inwards, and hung him within the crack in the stone.Blood dripped from the corner of his mouth.\"So powerful!\"\"This is our Young Lord.\"\"demon territory's number one martial genius, what are you called?\"\u2026 \u2026.The members of the other tribes were all shocked as well. The power that shao hu had unleashed was too terrifying.Long Fei was completely not a match for him.\"Our young master is an expert of the war chief, how can a trash of the war spirit realm like him be a match for him?\"\"Exactly!\"\"You want to fight over a woman with our Young Lord? Is he even worthy?\"\u2026 \u2026.shao hu slowly walked towards Xiang Longfei, his face full of contempt as he said: \"Weren't you very arrogant just now? Aren't you going to kill me? \"You lowly human, in front of me, you can only accept your death!\"\"Hehehe \u2026\"\"Hahaha \u2026\"Long Fei laughed sinisterly, he raised his eyes and looked at shao hu, full of playfulness as he said: \"Really?\"shao hu looked at Long Fei's gloomy eyes and his heart trembled. He didn't know why, but fear suddenly rose in his heart, \"Could it be that it's not true?\"Finished.shao hu moved!Suddenly, he increased his speed and kicked Xiang Longfei fiercely.\"Humph!\"Long Fei's neck lightly swayed, and with some difficulty, he walked down from the crevice in the cyan stone. He felt a strong current of air rush at him.\"Wushuang!\"\"Boom!\"A loud sound echoed out.Double attribute strength increased explosively.At this moment.\"Ding!\"\"Strength gathering complete!\"Long Fei's mouth curved into a death god's smile. In his eyes, shao hu's speed had already slowed down by a few fold.The power of the 'Unparalleled' attribute allowed him to become stronger!\"Trash, go to hell.\" As soon as shao hu finished speaking, he kicked Xiang Longfei's face with all his might.With a kick, Long Fei's head would fall off.Long Fei's right arm moved.\"Roar \u2026\"The Large Power King Kong Ape's angry roars rang out, and in the midst of it was a dense amount of godly power.\"magic power of right hand!\"\"Explode for me!\"His right arm moved, his fist aimed at shao hu's foot, and smashed upwards.\"Boom \u2026\"The Strength Stripes exploded out.\"Crack!\"shao hu's kneecap exploded.Kcha! *A white bone on his thigh broke through his body, and fresh blood spurted out. At the same time, Long Fei also leaped up heavily with both of his fists punching out, grabbing onto magic power of right hand.His two fists formed a battle axe.\"Mountain-hit Fist!\"The gigantic illusion of the Large Power King Kong Ape superimposed onto Long Fei's body and aimed at the top of his head with both of his fists and hammered.shao hu was in extreme pain, on the brink of death, his reaction speed was not slow either.\"Too late!\"\"Rumble!\"magic power of right hand, left fist rumbling the mountain, two fists combining.Kill!shao hu's face contorted, sometimes he wore a black tiger face, sometimes he had a human face, and eventually, his head exploded under the constant changes.\"Rumble!\"Headshot!\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for killing 'shao hu' for obtaining 100,000 experience, 1000 true breath points, and 10 Energy Values.\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for obtaining 'Black Tiger Physique'! Do you wish to fuse it?\"\u2026 \u2026.Two simple prompts rang out.Long Fei took a quick look at the attributes of the 'Black Tiger Physique'.Item: Black Tiger PhysiqueDescription: There are three stages. The first stage is Manifestation, the second stage is Body Blast, and the third stage is Rage!Description 2: The higher the player's level, the stronger the ability to transform into a black tiger.\"Huh?\"Long Fei was secretly shocked, \"Isn't this the same as giving me a demon fruit?\"He thought again of the pigeon man.That kind of defense, that kind of strength and speed was simply abnormal.He immediately became excited.The idea moved and said: \"Merge!\"\"Ding!\"\"Congratulations to player 'Long Fei' for successfully fusing with 'Black Tiger Physique' for 1000 experience points, true breath 100 points, and the reward is 100 points.\"The system had an additional skill 'Black Tiger Physique'!\"Ahh \u2026\"\"Ahh \u2026\"\"Ahh \u2026\"shao wudi roared out in fury. Looking at his son's broken body, the rage in his heart soared to the skies. \"Long Fei, I want you dead!\"Battle qi soared to the sky.All of the Fierce Tiger Warriors around him were forced back.\"Dead!\"'shao hu was actually killed.\"\"Really, really, really killed, how is this possible?\"Everyone was dumbfounded.shao hu, who had originally held the upper hand, was killed in one move, moreover, it was in the beast body stage. How strong was the human in front of him?Shock!It was an incomparable shock!However \u2026In addition to the great shock, more Tigers surrounded him.At that moment, even if Long Fei tried to escape, he wouldn't be able to.shao wudi took a step forward, and his heart felt as if it had been sliced by knives. He was only a son, yet he actually died in front of him, and at that moment, he simply wasn't able to save him.Long Fei continued to show weakness.He had been gathering his energy.That was why he was blasted around by shao hu.The magic power of right hand required three minutes to condense, and could only instantly kill powerhouses below the sixth level of the war chief.Moreover.Long Fei's final move, the power of both his fists, was even more powerful!Evil?This was just a reason the weak were finding for themselves.shao wudi walked in front of Long Fei, and said while gnashing his teeth: \"You're about to die, I'll chop off your head and give it to the Long Family Army. I'll use your skin as a chair, and I'll make sure your soul will never reincarnate!\"The voice grew colder and colder.The dense battle qi formed a strong pressure, pressing on Long Fei's sea of consciousness and causing it to churn, making him feel extremely uncomfortable.Long Fei stared at shao wudi who was glowing gold and said: \"My goal is very simple, kill you!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In this real world, once one died, it would disappear forever.There was no chance for a revival.\u2026 \u2026.Long Fei stared at shao wudi, his heart extremely excited, and thought to himself: \"I've already prepared the berserk energy, and it's waiting for your BOSS to appear.\"And then \u2026Long Fei shouted in his heart, \"Wushuang!\"\"Weng \u2026\"Once again, he released the double attribute power, making the pressure towards shao wudi slightly improve.His right arm sank.His left hand moved two fingers inside his sleeve, and a Glyph fell down.shao wudi felt the change in's aura, and his eyes stared blankly, \"You're courting death!\"While they were talking \u2026He had already arrived beside Long Fei.\"So fast!\"Even if Long Fei activated Wushuang, he would not be able to see shao wudi's movement trajectory, it was too fast.\"Bam!\"His five fingers moved, and a dense Ferocious Tiger Palm Force struck Long Fei's chest.\"Boom!\"Long Fei flew out.\"The difference in realms is too great, he's not a match at all!\" Long Fei spat out a mouthful of blood, and shouted in his heart, \"Damn it!\"His left hand moved.\"Large Power King Kong Ape Talisman, go!\"\"Shua!\"\"Rumble \u2026\"The talisman exploded in mid air as a huge Large Power King Kong Ape rushed out and hugged onto it, \"Mountain-hit Fist!\"He aimed at the top of shao wudi's head and smashed downwards.shao wudi raised his eyes and remained motionless.When the Mountain-hit Fist descended, his head suddenly changed, directly transforming into the head of a black tiger.\"MISS!\"It didn't do any damage at all.The Large Power King Kong Ape Talisman was a top quality Talisman, it did not cause any damage at all, what realm did shao wudi's defense reach?This was too unbelievable!shao wudi glared at him, his five fingers forming a fist, and he punched out, \"Scram!\"The punch was real, like an illusion. It cut through the air, and it was a heavy blow.\"Boom!\"The illusion of the Large Power King Kong Ape was directly hit, blasted away, and then slowly dissipated.The power of this punch was extraordinary!\"Level one transformation?\"\"Is this the power of the Level 1 Change in the Fierce Tiger Hunt? \"Too terrifying.\"\"He can even kill a phantom. The profound meaning of this power has already reached an extremely high level.\"\u2026 \u2026.Indeed.The demons had a much higher level of comprehension towards power than humans.shao wudi was also a martial arts genius. His comprehension of strength had exceeded a certain level, and he had entered into a realm where lifting heavy was as light as lifting light, as if he was fake or real.Even if it was an illusion without a real body, it could still punch the slay.This was his strength.\"Human Talisman?\"\"Humph!\"\"He can't even withstand a single blow!\"shao wudi recovered his human head and took a light step forward.A cloud of dust beneath his feet flew up, his figure had already disappeared, and in the next second, he appeared in front of Long Fei.\"Ahh \u2026\"Long Fei bellowed, \"magic power of right hand!\"The two fists collided!\"Boom!\"The moment the two fists clashed, the Strength Stripes shot out.\"Crack!\"The joint on Long Fei's right arm cracked with a burst of sound.He was in so much pain that he broke out in a cold sweat and staggered backwards.

He roared at Long Fei's forehead, \"Die!\"\"Buzz!\"\"Buzz!\"Two voices sounded consecutively.The Dragon Battle Armor's defense was activated.The King Kong Shield's defense was activated.\"Bang \u2026\"Long Fei was unable to resist, his fist was punched out, and the back of his head was about to split, blood flowing out, trickling from his forehead into his eyes.All of a sudden.His eyes, which had always been blood-red, now looked extremely ferocious.Long Fei crawled up from the ground, and stared at shao wudi sinisterly: \"I will definitely kill you, I definitely will!\"shao wudi was slightly stunned. He was very clear just now how strong he was, to think that he did not kill Long Fei. Looking at the creepy look in Long Fei's eyes, his heart trembled and he became even more certain.\"Kill me?\"\"You think you're worthy?!\"shao wudi sneered, \"You're just an ant in front of me, pinching you to death is an easy task!\"\"Yes sir!\"\"Your realm is higher than mine and your cultivation is stronger than mine.

No matter how flashy their positioning or skills were, they didn't take any damage. If the opponent hit you, it would be a critical hit and you wouldn't be able to withstand it.shao wudi laughed coldly, and said: \"What is it? Do you think you can escape? \"\"Hah!\"All the warriors of the Feral Tiger Tribe yelled out together, narrowing the encirclement by a big step.Escape?It was impossible.The corner of Long Fei's mouth lifted as he laughed sinisterly: 'shao wudi, just you wait, I'll definitely come back!\"At this moment.\"Xiao Bai!\"\"Awoooo \u2026\"A wolf's howl sounded.Next.A white shadow flashed and landed beside Long Fei. idea sent a sound transmission to Long Fei, \"Master, are you alright?\"Long Fei shook his head and said: \"I won't die yet.\"shao wudi laughed coldly and said: \"Just with a little mongrel dog? You just want to escape? \"Long Fei laughed, looked at Xiao Bai who was beside him and said, \"Xiao Bai, he's scolding you as a bastard dog.\"\"Wuuuuuu \u2026.\"Xiao Bai was angry!No one had dared to scold him for so long.So what if he scolded.However... shao wudi actually compared him to a dog, a bastard dog at that.He was beyond angry!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The aura on his body was changing, an extremely intense change.What is Xiao Bai?He was a divine beast.He's the Wolf God!If he got angry, it would be half an attack that would destroy the world.Long Fei looked at shao wudi and laughed: \"You don't need to wait for a few days, you're going to die soon. You've offended someone you shouldn't have provoked, hahaha \u2026\"He could already see shao wudi lying on the ground.He had already sounded the System's berserk image.

The longer the time, the greater the power, I must buy Xiao Bai some time.\"Then.Long Fei gave Xiao Bai a determined look, stared at him and sneered: \"Those of you who are not scared, you will know later. shao wudi, I've said that I'm going to kill you, so I'll definitely kill you.\"\"If you don't believe me, then just wait and see.\"shao wudi disdainfully said: \"Lowly human being, this place is my demon territory, it is the domain of my Evil Demon.

I will make her kneel in front of my son's tombstone forever.\"Hahaha \u2026\"His voice was filled with rage.The laughter faded.shao wudi lifted his right leg slightly.Long Fei's heart tensed up, he immediately asked: \"Xiao Bai, are you fully recovered?\"Xiao Bai was still brewing!Long Fei wanted to die.What big move would take so long to prepare?Suddenly!A gust of strong wind blew over, Long Fei couldn't care about it anymore as he hugged Xiao Bai and dodged fiercely.\"Hu!\"\"Boom!\"The wind from the punch pierced through his shoulder, but...

Back then, my father did not take your dog life because of my mother.\"Ahh \u2026\"\"Ahh \u2026\"shao wudi raged, and immediately entered the first stage of transformation, staring straight at Long Fei, he roared continuously in anger.His true identity had been exposed?It was indeed just as Long Fei had said. If not for his mother's plea for mercy, shao wudi would have died under Long Zhanting's sword.But, how did Long Fei know?How did the TV series in his previous life play out?An old story.Long Fei could imagine it with just his toes, but when he saw shao wudi's angry expression, he was stunned in his heart, \"Hahaha \u2026 I guessed right. \"You were defeated by my father, and your son was killed by me.'shao wudi, if I were you, I would just kill myself.
