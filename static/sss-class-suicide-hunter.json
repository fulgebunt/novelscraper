    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1The Greatest EnvyTranslator: NeriaFormatter: Geass606Editor: NyamhBreaking news!The Black Dragon Guild attempts to conquer the 40th floor of the Tower. Didn\u2019t they confidently declare that they were going to finally show the might of the greatest guild? Unfortunately, they have returned empty-handed.The Rank 1 Hunter! The Flame Emperor (\u708e\u5e1d) has single-handedly subjugated a Boss once again!I envied him.While blankly staring at the TV, I thought to myself:\u00a0\u2018I envy him. I envy him so much\u2014it\u2019s driving me crazy.\u2019Hello Flame Emperor-nim!Ah, right. Hello\u2026The Flame Emperor furrowed his eyebrows. For some reason, even his scrunched brows looked handsome.You have set a new record once again! You are the only person who can single-handedly subjugate a boss monster. May I ask you to share your impressions?First of all, I would like you to change that shitty title.Excuse me?I\u2019m talking about the Flame Emperor. Call me by my name instead of using that shitty title. Like, what is the Flame Emperor supposed to mean? It\u2019s embarrassing. I would rather be called the Plague than the Flame Emperor. [1] Someday, I\u2019ll definitely find the bastard who gave me this title and beat the living shit out of him.U-Uhhh.The surprised reporter stuttered. He could only stammer, unable to respond. Because the formidable man in front of him was widely known as the protagonist of this era. The subject of countless legends being written.In comparison, I was just an extra who couldn\u2019t even take on a minor role.\u201cAaah,\u201d I mumbled. \u201cI really envy him.\u201d How nice would it be to live a life like him? A life where you can say anything in front of a camera. I touched my smartphone and entered a random Internet community bulletin board for Hunters. I wanted to see how others reacted to the interview.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then, it naturally appeared.One day, I suddenly heard a voice from God!Magic? I was able to use it soon after entering the Tower.Hunters with good personalities and strong willpower struggled to climb to higher heights because they lacked skills. In contrast, there were Hunters with dog shit personalities living good lives thanks to their skills. The Flame Emperor, who represented Rank 1, was the latter.If we compared life to a game, wouldn\u2019t the Flame Emperor be playing a game where luck was a skill? He could get anything he wanted with his luck skill.In contrast\u2026 my life was comparable to a typical shitty RNG game.I grumbled and heaved as I stumbled along who knew where. I\u2019d left the bar after getting shit-wasted, but I couldn\u2019t remember when that was. I entered an alley and more sludge spewed from my mouth. I swayed, my eyes focusing on my vomit: I recognized some of the food I\u2019d eaten before.\u201cYou are unlucky\u201d is what my vomit seemed to be telling me.\u201cShit\u2026\u201d I slurred. \u201cIf I am supposed to be unlucky, then don\u2019t give me any luck at all. This false hope has killed me.\u201dWhen you play a game, when do you feel despair?Those who have played gacha games on their phones would understand. It is not when you can\u2019t get a single 5-Star unit after multiple pulls\u2014It\u2019s when you get that 5-Star that just happens to be utter garbage. A 5-Star that\u2019s worse than a 3-Star.Hell, my 5-Star was worse than a 1-Star.I hurled again but nothing came out except a sob. \u201cFuck!\u201dYeah. My life was truly a shitty RNG game.Normally after awakening a skill, you had to report it to the Hunter Bureau. But I didn\u2019t report it. Like hell I would. This shit was too depressing. Too embarrassing. Why the hell should I show them such a trash skill? Like, what would I say or how would it go:\u201cHello, Hunter-nim,\u201d they would say. \u201c How did you awaken your skill?\u201dWhat could I say? \u201cUh\u2014I was envious of the Rank 1.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Their faces would distort in confusion.So, just to make it all better, I\u2019d expound further. \u201cI thought I would go insane because of my envy and jealousy. Then the Tower\u00a0tossed\u00a0me a skill like it was telling me to eat this and get lost.\u201d Here was where I\u2019d flourish my hand as if I was discussing a fine reward I casually got. \u201cIt even told me that I\u2019m an ugly person with the greatest envy,\u201d I\u2019d say with a laugh. Haha. Right.It\u2019s not like I could say that! As if there was any way to tell anyone about this. I alone would laugh and be miserable at my unlucky, shitty life.So I drank to my heart\u2019s content and ended up wobbling around in a remote alley.Though, nothing had changed\u2014I was still failing. I couldn\u2019t even wobble properly. Without realizing, I\u2019d staggered into an unknown alley. I couldn\u2019t remember how or when I got here. Where the fuck I was, that was anyone\u2019s guess.Could I just fall asleep on the floor like this? \u2018Ah. This is sad.\u2019 So unlucky. I held back my tears.A faint scream rose on the night\u2019s air. It came from the other side of the alley.The pained voice begged, \u201c\u2026please, ugh! Why are you\u2026\u201dInstantly, my drowsiness disappeared.That voice was too real to be mistaken as a drunken hallucination. While I could not know who it was, I understood that what was happening was life threatening.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 I wondered, treading silently. Instinctively, I held my breath. One step at a time, I quietly stepped towards the alley where the scream originated.As I approached, the voices became clearer.This was\u2014\u201cF-Flame Emperor-nim. Why are you suddenly\u2014\u201d a female voice said.\u201c\u2014No use. No one is nearby to\u2014\u201d a male voice said.\u2014This was\u2014the second stupid mistake I made today.The first mistake\u2014drinking until my mind fuse broke. Throughout my entire life, I never got dead drunk. However, today was an exception. I was extremely furious to find out that my first S-Rank skill was shit, so I ended up drinking makgeolli like water. [1]My second mistake\u2014not running away as soon as I heard the scream.\u201cI\u2019ve poisoned your drinking cup in advance,\u201d the male voice said. I couldn\u2019t figure out why he sounded so familiar.\u201cP-poison? Flame Emperor-nim, I can\u2019t understand what you are saying.\u201d Even the woman\u2019s voice. She sounded altruistic.\u201cHey, your acting is pretty good. If someone else saw you, they would be fooled.\u201dA dead end.In the dark alley without any street lights, there was indeed a man and a woman. Perhaps it was weird to describe them as\u00a0simply\u00a0being\u00a0there. The man was threatening the woman and the woman was being threatened.\u201cBasilisk\u2019s stomach acid,\u201d the man said. \u201cOriginally, you would have poisoned my drinking cup with this. Wow. If it wasn\u2019t for my skill, I would have been in deep trouble. Hm? What\u2019s wrong? You look pale, Miss Saintess.\u201d\u201cIs it the Ten Thousand Poison Immunity (\u842c\u6bd2\uf967\u4fb5)\u2026? I-impossible! You shouldn\u2019t have such a skill.\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d The man laughed, the up and down of it echoing softly. \u201cBut I have a skill that\u2019s slightly better than the Ten Thousand Poison Immunity.\u201dFinally, I realized who this man was. No matter how dark the alley was, I could see the man\u2019s back\u2014I couldn\u2019t possibly miss that ponytail. I\u2019d seen him and his feats surround me in my room every single day for the last ten years. And I\u2019d seen him from TV just last night. I\u2019d always wished to be just like him.\u2018It is actually the real Flame Emperor!\u2019 I goggled.The Rank 1 Hunter. The protagonist of this era. An idol who tens of thousands of people looked up to. And because of that, he was the hero who received all the attention and envy\u2026 especially my envy.Additionally, \u2018Isn\u2019t she the Saintess!?\u2019I covered my mouth to hold my breath. The Saintess. A Rank 9 Hunter who was selected by the Bureau. She is rumored to be dating the Flame Emperor. It was her recent behavior that sparked the entire scandal. The greatest beauty, who I\u2019ve only seen from Internet photos and videos, was right there.\u201cBut playtime is over,\u201d the Flame Emperor said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to pay the price for going against me.\u201dAnd she wasn\u2019t just standing\u00a0there. She was being threatened. \u201cW-wait a moment, Flame Emperor-nim,\u201d she begged. \u201cYou must have misunderstood\u2026 I only wish to clear the Tower with you as a team!\u201d\u201cI thought so too, but that wasn\u2019t the case,\u201d the Flame Emperor said.\u201cPlease wait a moment! Think about it. If we team up, we can easily clear up to the 40th floor! We might even clear up to the 50th floor in a year! That\u2019s right! It\u2019s the place that humanity has not reached yet, but if it\u2019s the two of us\u2014\u201d\u201cI thought so too, but that wasn\u2019t the case,\u201d he said again.Dumbfounded, I thought, \u2018Weren\u2019t those two\u2026 dating?\u2019 The Internet said so. Even broadcasters discussed the two heroes\u2019 passionate love. But the scene in front of me had no elements of romance whatsoever. It was difficult to even joke about it being a lover\u2019s quarrel.Murderous intent (\u6bba\u610f).I only saw a man who wanted to murder and a woman who clung on for dear life.\u201cPlease! Let\u2019s just talk to clear up the misunderstanding,\u201d she cried.\u201cTalk? Ah, talk. Alright. It\u2019s the courteous thing to do.\u201d The Flame Emperor seized the Saintess\u2019 neck.Her voice let out a loud choking noise before her air was completely cut off. After that, only small groans sounded.\u201cBut, I\u2019ll decide the rules and who gets to talk,\u201d he growled.The Saintess struggled as she suffocated. I watched her struggle and I also felt like suffocating. Unbelievable. Oh my God. Something that shouldn\u2019t be happening was happening in front of me.\u201cI\u2019ll ask the questions. Just answer me. Ah, you don\u2019t need to talk. Simply nod your head to answer. Okay?\u201dShe strove to nod, whimpering. I gulped in fear and sympathy.\u201cIf you answer sincerely, I\u2019ll let you live. I\u2019ll even give you the antidote. But if you ignore my personal consideration\u2026 Well, do I need to explain further? I heard you graduated from Oxford. Use your smart head.\u201dThe Saintess desperately attacked the Flame Emperor\u2019s arm latched onto her neck.The sound of her scrambling made its way to my ears but nothing happened. It was impossible for the the Saintess, who was well known as one of the best healers, to physically win against the Flame Emperor.\u201cTruthfully speaking, I only have one question for you.\u201dThe Saintess fought for air.\u201cWho commanded you to kill me. Just answer me that. Was it the Black Dragon\u2019s Witch?\u201dThe Saintess flinched and stopped struggling.\u201cThink carefully before you answer,\u201d the Flame Emperor said. \u201cI might not have Ten Thousand Poison Immunity, but I do have a Lie Detection skill. If you lie to me and I find it out, I\u2019ll burn even your bones into ashes.\u201dThe Saintess didn\u2019t answer right away. In the dark alley, it was difficult to see her face. However, you could feel her silence. While the Flame Emperor was watching, the Saintess slowly nodded her head.\u201cI knew it.\u201d His small laughter rose in the air between them. \u201cGoodbye, Saintess Isabelle.\u201dFlames erupted.The fire swallowed the entire alley. It spread from the Flame Emperor\u2019s grasp to the Saintess\u2019 neck and then her entire body was engulfed in flames. She started to desperately struggle. It was her last resort to live. But no matter how hard she floundered against him, she could not escape the Flame Emperor\u2019s grasp.The Flame Emperor merely gazed at the burning Saintess. Untouched by his own affairs.In front of the scorching flames, the Flame Emperor was calm. Being perfectly calm, he held onto the Saintess\u2019 neck until the very end. The Saintess swung both of her arms. She dug her nails into the Flame Emperor\u2019s arm and tried to scratch it. In the end, she reached towards the sky\u2026 and stopped soon after.She went limp.And she did not move anymore.Emotions roiled in my stomach and smashed into my chest. \u2018That crazy bastard!\u2019A hero of humanity died\u00a0right\u00a0in front of me. It was wrong to even say she simply\u00a0died.\u00a0That\u2019s right-\u2014her death was not normal.She was murdered. Murdered by another hero of humanity, the Flame Emperor.\u2018A\u00a0madman.\u2019The Saintess was now just a burnt corpse. Even so, the flames did not stop. The Flame Emperor did not stop there. He burned everything until her flesh and bones melted. He did so with an emotionless face from beginning to end.\u2018He is not sane.\u2019 I took a step back. \u2018I need to leave immediately.\u2019And thus, I made the third mistake of today. My final mistake\u2014Crunch\u2014It was a small sound. I didn\u2019t step on a can. Instead, it was a small glass shard.Perhaps it was a glass shard from a shattered soju bottle. [2] Maybe it was carried by the wind from another place\u2026 I didn\u2019t fucking know how it got there. Rather, there was no need to know.Instead, there two things I really needed to understand:First, I\u2019d made a retarded mistake.\u201c\u2026Hoh,\u201d the Flame Emperor\u2019s voice turned towards where I was hiding.And second, the Flame Emperor was not a predator who would miss out on another person\u2019s mistake.\u201cI thought I took care of all the rats nearby. I guess one slipped.\u201d His eyes found mine.I ran.I ran without looking back. Those were the eyes of a murderer. Not someone who killed one or two but someone who killed tens. Perhaps even more. His eyes were like a fucking demon.And that demon was trying to kill me.\u201cHa? How cute.\u201d As soon as the Flame Emperor sneered, a hot sensation pierced near my ankle, and in the next moment, I rolled along the ground. At first, I couldn\u2019t understand how I tripped.At least not until I saw my legs on the floor.\u201cH-hiik\u2026!?\u201d A screech escaped my lips.My legs were severed. My legs. Both of them were chopped. Left and right. They were still wearing shoes, too.I could even see the famous brand logo drawn on the side of the sneakers.\u201cP-please let me live! Please!\u201d I begged. Just like the Saintess.\u201cThen why did you run? You fucking scared me,\u201d the Flame Emperor said, bending over. He picked up one of my legs. Then he started playing catch with it like it was a baseball. \u201cHey. Did you see?\u201d he asked.My eyes followed the up and down of my leg in the air. To his hands. And then back in the air. \u201cI d-didn\u2019t see anything!\u201dThe Flame Emperor approached closer. \u201cWhat did you not see?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know anything! Ugh. Please. I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you not know?\u201d\u201cPlease\u2026 Flame Emperor-nim. Please\u2026 let me live. I won\u2019t say anything. I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201dI felt his presence above my head.He was bending his knees to look down on me. \u201cWow. So you\u2019re telling me that you saw me and even recognized me? You might as well have seen it all. You probably know everything, too.\u201d\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d\u201cHyung-ssi, you\u2019re disappointing me. [3] Why are you acting like you know nothing?\u201d The Flame Emperor probed my leg. \u201cTell me. Who sent you? Is it the Black Dragon again?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 really don\u2019t know\u2026 anything\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still telling me that you don\u2019t know anything but happened to watch over me and the Saintess from there? Silently, like a fucking rat? Hey, now. Hyung-ssi, your story is so reliable. If I was a bit more retarded, I would have probably believed you.\u201dThe Flame Emperor grinned. \u201cBut you see, I\u2019m not a retard. Are you fucking mocking me?\u201dSparks of fire erupted in front of me. Flames erupted from the Flame Emperor\u2019s palm and it spread onto my legs. The burst of fire eating my legs sounded like a barbecue, the wafting smell of roasting meat reached my overwhelmed senses.He burned everything, leaving nothing behind. Not even the famous brand logo. Not even the shoes I\u2019d worn for so long. Not even my legs, which were part of me for even longer.All of it disappeared.\u201cNext will be your head. Answer me straight.\u201dMy mind became all white.This demon\u2026 was insane.He was a madman. There was no point in talking to a madman. He didn\u2019t care about what others thought, and he firmly believed he was always right. He was a fucking psychopath who would kill innocent people for no reason.As someone who represented Rank 1. As a person, how could he do this?You\u2019re telling me that I was obsessed over someone like him?Many people\u2014including me\u2014believed he was a hero. We liked him for being upfront and honest. We praised him as someone with a refreshing personality. This fucking lunatic?\u201cL-lie\u2026\u201d I stumbled.\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.\u201cLie Detection skill\u2026 I heard you have a Lie Detection skill.\u201d I desperately continued talking. \u201cYou told the Saintess that you can tell when someone lies. And that she should answer sincerely.\u201dWhen the Flame Emperor didn\u2019t react, I continued, \u201cSo test me with that skill. Test me to see if my words are a lie or not. Flame Emperor-nim\u2026 I just happen to, really coincidentally, pass by. Please believe in me!\u201dThe Flame Emperor\u2019s expression became strange. \u201cI made that up,\u201d he said.[T/N][1] Makgeolli is a popular Korean rice wine.[2] Soju is a popular Korean alcohol. It\u2019s a distilled spirit that comes in a variety of flavors.[3] Hyung-ssi is a Korean honorification used by younger males when they speak to older males. Hyung directly translates to \u2018older brother,\u2019 which doesn\u2019t sound as cool. -ssi is added at the end when the person is a stranger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a bluff to trick the Saintess. Wow, the two of you are really naive. Did you really believe me?\u201d\u201cT-then\u2026\u201d My lips quivered. I was shocked. \u201cDid you kill the Saintess without any concrete proof?\u201dA Rank 9 Hunter, the Saintess. Unlike the psychopath in front of me, she was an upright Hunter who donated most of her hard-earned money to orphanages. That\u2019s how she earned her title as the Saintess. But you\u2019re telling me that this man killed her based on a suspicion?\u2018If that\u2019s true, then\u2026\u2019\u00a0He\u2019s not the greatest Hunter. He\u2019s the greatest psychopath.\u201cHey,\u201d the Flame Emperor said. \u201cThose were some harsh words. How can you judge a person like that? Of course, I checked. The Saintess really tried to kill me. If I didn\u2019t kill her first, she would have poisoned me to death by tomorrow.\u201dThe Flame Emperor spat on the floor. \u201cFucking plague! Just remembering it ruins my mood.\u201d\u201cH-how do you know\u2014\u201d\u201cI know everything,\u201d the Flame Emperor said, sounding as if what he said was obvious. \u201cI just know everything. I have a secret trick.\u201dI gaped at him.\u201cBut you don\u2019t need to know about that,\u201d he said.I was at a loss for words. It wasn\u2019t only because\u2026 the Flame Emperor was absurdly self-confident. There was a certain conviction reflected in his eyes. Confidence that there was a good reason to kill the Saintess. At the very least, that\u2019s how it appeared to me.\u201cWell, you must be truly innocent since you heard me talk about the Lie Detection skill.\u201d The Flame Emperor\u2019s voice dripped with sarcasm.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d I couldn\u2019t close my mouth.\u201cTo be fair, it is my first time seeing your face. I memorized the faces of all the rats hiding in this area. All 18 of them. I even counted their heads to make sure I didn\u2019t miss a single fucker\u2026 Hmm. Anyway, you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t recognize seeing your innocent face amongst them.\u201dThe Flame Emperor touched my head. Pat. He was smiling. Did he finally believe in my innocence?\u201cT-thank you\u2014\u201d\u201cBut you know who I am,\u201d he said. \u201cYou even saw me kill the Saintess.\u201dPat.\u201cThat\u2019s why you have to die for me.\u201d His fingers on my head stretched outward, extended into flames, and clasped my skull. Burning.\u201cMy name is Yoo Sooha. Good bye.\u201dHeat seared my head. The inside became hot. Burning. Boiling. My skull churned like an oil container.I couldn\u2019t speak. I couldn\u2019t scream. Under the intense pain, all circuits were cut off\u2014impossible to make any noise at all.\u2018To a madman like him\u2026 I guess I\u2019m going to die like this. I\u2019m\u2026\u2019Kim Gongja (\u91d1\u5b54\u5b50).It was a name given to me by the caregiver of the orphanage. He wanted me to become a great person like Confucius. But I lived a life nothing like Confucius and died pitifully like an emaciated street dog.Sorrow filled me. Overflowed from me and burned into the ground with the rest of me. If you compared this to a game, it would be a bad end. In plain words, a ruined life. A life where you die broken.With only sorrow remaining.I hated it.| Skill conditions were met as a result of death.Why did I have to die like this? Rather, why did I have to live like this? It was unfair. Fury engulfed me.\u00a0Everything\u00a0was unfair. I could have lived a better life. I had the right to live a better life.But, I also made three mistakes: Died by mistake. Lived making mistakes. Born by mistake. Was everything a mistake since birth?| Randomly copying Hunter Yoo Sooha\u2019s skills.| Creating skill cards.I couldn\u2019t hear anything. I couldn\u2019t even see. But, a dim light flickered. It was like there were fireflies dancing in front of me. Some fireflies were brown. Others were silver. And some fireflies were\u2026 gold.Fast.The golden fireflies flew quickly. They were so fast, it was near impossible to catch them. There were many brown fireflies. They appeared easy to catch. There were also many silver fireflies. As expected, it was also possible to catch them. Then there was the sun. The only golden firefly that flickered so fast I could barely follow it with my eyes. It shone as brightly as the sun, difficult to focus on. That one.| Please select a skill card.I reached out for the one and only golden sunfire.| Selected.And I caught it.| Copying the skill.And then I died.* * *| Activating skill.* * *Do you know what Hell looks like?I\u2019ll tell you firsthand. First, there was no hellfire. In fact, I couldn\u2019t find any fire. There was a gas stove, but it lacked the firepower to start a hellfire. Ah. Contrary to my expectations, Hell had a small fridge. It also had a small bed\u2026 and even an old TV.\u201cHuh?\u201dIn other words, it looked exactly like my rented room. Rather,\u00a0it was my rented room.No matter how I looked at it, this was not Hell. It was my lovely 125 square-foot room that I rented for a cheap price.\u201cH-huh\u2026 Huh?\u201d I felt my head with one hand.It was perfectly fine. Just to make sure, I looked at my smartphone screen\u2019s reflection. I saw a face that looked like an unfinished Apollo statue. It wasn\u2019t handsome, but it wasn\u2019t bad either.I couldn\u2019t find any burn marks.\u201c\u2026Huh? What is going on?\u201d Really, what was going on? \u2018Did the Flame Emperor treat me and carry me back home?\u2019As if.However\u2026 it was the only explanation I could think of at that very moment. Perhaps he was kinder than I thought. He was crazy, but maybe he wasn\u2019t a psychopathic murderer. He could have pretended to kill me and instead saved me at the last moment.Breaking news.Then did he leave the TV on before he left?The Black Dragon Guild attempts to conquer the 40th floor of the Tower. Didn\u2019t they confidently declare that they were going to finally show the might of the greatest guild?Unfortunately, they have returned empty handed.No, that wasn\u2019t the case. The Flame Emperor wasn\u2019t present in this 125 square-foot room. He didn\u2019t leave the TV on before he left either.Instead\u2014The Rank 1 Hunter! The Flame Emperor has single-handedly subjugated a Boss once again!Instead, he was on the TV screen with furrowed brows. I found myself blankly staring at the TV.Hello Flame Emperor-nim!Ah. Right. Hello\u2026You have set a new record once again. You and the Sword Saint are the only people who can single-handedly subjugate a boss monster. With the disappearance of the Sword Saint, it can be said that you are the only person capable of such feat. May I ask you to share your impressions?At the top right corner of the broadcast, there were large bold letters that read: LIVE.I continued to gape at the TV.First of all, I would like you to change that shitty title.Excuse me?I\u2019m talking about the Flame Emperor. Call me by my name instead of using that shitty title.Yoo Sooha\u2014The World\u2019s Rank 1 Hunter. The protagonist of this era. The hero I envied was right there. That\u2019s right. Perhaps, it was inappropriate to say he was\u00a0there, since he just killed me, and I died to him a moment ago.\u201cNo way.\u201d Even as I said, \u201cNo way,\u201d my hands had already grabbed my smartphone. I checked the date. It was yesterday. My hands shook. I checked the Internet communities:Hey, the Flame Emperor is screwing around again!2 minutes ago \u00a0| ReportReply \u23f7Here.Can\u2019t he hold his tongue when the entire world is watching him?1 minute ago \u00a0| ReportReplies 5 \u23f6There, too.The Flame Emperor got a girlfriend! Apparently, it is the Saintess!1 minute ago \u00a0| ReportReplies 4 \u23f6This site, too. That community, too. All over social media.Everything was the same.All the texts I\u2019d seen yesterday were being posted in real time. I\u2019d certainly seen these exact posts yesterday, but people were responding to it as if it were their first time seeing the TV interview.Despite that, there was something different.\u3134I want to become just like the Flame Emperor.1 second ago \u00a0| EditI could not find the comments I\u2019d written.It was obvious. Normally, I would be passionately leaving comments by now. But my soul left my body a long time ago.I\u2019d returned to yesterday.I\u2019d really returned to yesterday.\u201c\u2026Open skill card.\u201dFlash!A golden card emerged in front of me like flames.[I Want To Become Just Like You (S+)]I\u2019d already memorized this skill after reading it multiple times since yesterday. Despite being S-Rank, it was a skill that was unusable. The price of using it was my death. It was a rare garbage skill. But, that wasn\u2019t all of it.\u201cOh, my God,\u201d I exclaimed.Two.There were\u00a0two\u00a0burning flames in front of me.[I Want To Become Just Like You (S+)][Returner\u2019s Clockwork Watch (EX)]Two golden cards floated before me.\u2018How?\u2019\u00a0My heart pounded against my chest, loud in my ears.Returner\u2019s Clockwork Watch. This was a new skill I\u2019d never seen before. It wasn\u2019t there when I checked it yesterday, and it wasn\u2019t there right before I died to the Flame Emperor. I only had a garbage skill that was totally unusable; I never had any other skill with that name\u2026 I\u00a0definitely\u00a0did not have another golden skill. I would have absolutely noticed something crazy like that.\u2018How?\u2019 So, of course, I couldn\u2019t understand.How the hell had I obtained this skill? How had it become\u00a0mine? I couldn\u2019t understand. I didn\u2019t understand it.But.\u2018It\u2019s mine.\u2019I knew it. This card was mine.\u2018All mine.\u2019I also knew: it could be the skill card that changed my life.I reached for the card and grabbed it.I flipped it.Return. It said \u201creturn.\u201dUpon death, you\u00a0return to\u00a024 hours prior.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dAs if my head got struck by lightning, I trembled. My heart pounded so hard that it might as well have been a sledge hammer.I finally fucking realized it.\u201cThis was the Flame Emperor\u2019s secret move\u2026\u201d I muttered at my news-filled walls.How did the Flame Emperor become the World\u2019s Rank 1 Hunter?How did he defeat the impregnable 10th-floor boss all by himself?And lastly, why was he so certain that the Saintess tried to kill him?I finally understood everything.\u201cThe Saintess really tried to kill me.\u201d\u201cIf I didn\u2019t kill her first, she would have poisoned me to death by tomorrow.\u201dThese were his words.\u201cI know everything.\u201d\u201cI just know everything. I have a secret trick.\u201d\u201cBut you don\u2019t need to know about that.\u201dHe\u2019d died to the Saintess once.Just like he said, he was poisoned to death. That\u2019s why he returned to 24 hours prior, gritting his teeth to pay back what he suffered. For revenge.\u2018And because of that, even I died.\u2019 I clenched my fists. \u2018He killed an innocent person like me! Just because I was in his way!\u2019He severed my legs. He burned my head. And he killed me. He played with me like an insect.The interview progressed:Before you leave, please tell our viewers one last thing!Hah?From the reporter\u2019s question, the Flame Emperor scratched the back of his head.Yesterday, I looked up to him as a hero. Today, I only saw a psychopath. It didn\u2019t matter if he was the World\u2019s Rank 1. It didn\u2019t matter if countless people praised him as a hero.He was my enemy.The Flame Emperor glowered directly into the camera.Those who will succeed will succeed.I glared back.But, don\u2019t get in my way even if you succeed.I clenched my golden card. It was the same card that man possessed, and it was a skill I copied from him. The Flame Emperor was Rank 1, and I was the weakest Hunter that didn\u2019t even have a rank. But right now, I was at the same starting line as him.Or I\u2019ll kill you.This time, it was going to be my revenge.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The feeling of it surged through me. I put my mind to work because I already knew.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s impossible to win against the Flame Emperor using normal methods.\u2019My heart pounded against my chest and reverberated in my ears. I needed to calm down. Though I was hot with emotions, my mind needed to stay as cool as water.It was difficult, though. Because, really\u2014I\u2019d just died. And not only did I just die, I\u2019d died in the most excruciating way possible. Flames had scorched layer after layer of my flesh, searing the dermis and destroying my nerve endings with bursts of overwhelming, full-body pain. My screams no longer registered after the fire had eaten my inner ears. From there, I was a man-made barbecue. I imagined my muscles wafted a beef-like scent, making me twistedly glad I couldn\u2019t smell or salivate at my own spit-roasted self. Like that, I died.A horrifying, disgusting death.\u201cShit, that fucking bastard.\u201d I glared at the scraps of paper glued all over the walls that surrounded me. This was the Flame Emperor\u2019s history. There were numerous interviews and articles pasted on the wall. They recorded his journey from his rookie years to becoming the World\u2019s Rank 1.Obviously, there were many photos of him, too. Disgust filled me. I wanted to tear them all apart. \u201cTsk. Even if I killed him, won\u2019t he just return to 24 hours prior to his death?\u201dI couldn\u2019t kill him even if I wanted to. That was a big problem.\u00a0\u2018Truthfully, isn\u2019t that an invincible cheat?\u2019Not only was our skill difference like comparing the sun to a small firefly, but the Flame Emperor was also the World\u2019s Rank 1. I was not even ranked. While the Tower acknowledged me for having the greatest envy\u2026 strong envy did not mean I had talent.Even if a miracle or a fluke happened, it was difficult for me to kill the Flame Emperor.\u00a0\u2018And even if I manage to kill him, there is a bigger problem to deal with.\u2019What would happen if I killed the Flame Emperor?He would simply return to 24 hours before his death and that would be the end of me. The Flame Emperor would use everything at his disposal to kill me. When he realizes he can\u2019t kill me, he would just confine me for eternity. Perhaps he would make an underground jail to imprison me.With the Flame Emperor\u2019s physical strength and skills, it would be an easy task for him to subdue me. And then, I would live the rest of my life confined in a prison cell.Kim Gongja\u2019s Bad Ending #2: Flashy Imprisonment Denouement.\u201cFuck\u2026\u201d Killing him was a problem. Dying to him was also a problem. How was I going to act out my revenge on this psychopath?\u2018What should I do? How can I beat the Rank 1?\u2019***A day passed by.I\u2019d spent 24 hours shut inside my apartment, exploring my possibilities. I\u2019d expended all of my energy and thought into my plan for revenge, but I couldn\u2019t come up with a single, worthy thread that I could grasp. Just one thread from the Flame Emperor\u2019s tapestry would be enough for me to unravel him and his entire life. But nothing came to mind.I stared at the newspaper and articles glued on the wall, still brainstorming. I would not give up.Every bit of information pertaining to the Flame Emperor was right there. Perhaps examining it would give me some sort of hint.\u300eThe Flame Emperor single-handedly subjugates the 39th floor!\u300f\u300eThe Flame Emperor solo clears the 38th floor! Another legendary feat!\u300f\u300eHunter Yoo Sooha crowned as the World\u2019s Rank 1. The first Korean to achieve it!\u300f\u318d\u318d\u318d\u300eDisappearance of the Sword Saint & the empty Rank 1. Who will take the throne? \u00a0Expert foreigners believe \u201cYoo Sooha from Korea is the best candidate.\u201d\u300f\u300eThe impregnable 10th floor cleared! Who is the mysterious hero?\u300f\u300e22 days since the Sword Saint\u2019s disappearance. Will the Hunter Association face its worst crisis?\u300fAt that moment\u2014\u201cHuh?\u201dA shocking discovery.\u201cWait a minute\u2014Look at this!\u201d I mumbled to myself while touching a single scrap of newspaper. It was an interview I found online. I\u2019d printed out the original article and put it up on the wall:<table>Q: Yoo Sooha-nim, when did you experience your first awakening?</tbody></table><table>YOO SOOHA: During summer when I was 21. So it\u2019s been 11 years.</tbody></table><table>Q: You must have good memory to be able to accurately remember even the season.</tbody></table><table>YSH: I don\u2019t think my memory is particularly good. It just happens to be the case that I awakened on my birthday, 11 years ago on June 7th.</tbody></table><table>Q: So you awakened on your birthday. Did something happen that day?</tbody></table><table>YSH: I was on the 1st floor of the Tower. I can\u2019t tell you anything else. It\u2019s my privacy.</tbody></table>When you looked at it, it was just a normal interview.But for me\u2014that was the important hint I was looking for. \u201cWow, really?\u201d I stared at it, shocked. \u201cWait a minute. This might work!\u201dShit. I did it. I\u2019d found a way.A strategy to kill the World\u2019s Rank 1 Hunter.It was definitely not an easy task and others would ridicule me for being crazy. But at the same time, it was the only method of killing the Flame Emperor. It was something even someone like me, an F-Class Hunter, could accomplish.I fully realized.\u00a0\u2018I can really take my revenge!\u2019At that moment, loud yells floated in from outside.\u201cIt\u2019s a fire!\u201d someone yelled.To see what was going on, I opened the window. On the other side of the town, red smoke billowed into the sky. Residents screamed and rushed to the streets.\u201cOh, no! What should we do?\u201d someone panicked.\u201cInstead of just standing here, let us try to extinguish the fire!\u201d another person ordered.\u201cAlright!\u201d the panicked person said.Many residents swarmed the place and started helping douse the fire.We, Hunters, lived somewhere different from the\u00a0outside world.\u00a0To become Hunters, we\u2019d all stepped into the Tower, and a city was made within the 1st floor of the Tower.There were many names for this city. Some called it Babylon and others called it Naraka. While there were Hunters who just simply called it the 1st floor city, there were others who gave it an old-fashioned name like City of Ascension (\u767b\u5929\u90fd\u5e02).People from all over the world lived in the Tower so it made sense that the 1st floor city had many names.Most people who lived in the Tower were Hunters. Whether they liked it or not, they experienced life-threatening events on a regular basis. So, unlike those from the outside world, Hunters were used to quickly reacting to danger.I left my room and headed down to help the residents.\u2018That madman.\u2019\u00a0Running down the stairs, I checked the time with my smartphone. It had been 24 hours since I\u2019d returned from death. It was the exact time the Flame Emperor killed the Saintess.Meaning\u2014\u2018That Plague! He started the fire to hide all of the evidence!\u2019The Flame Emperor, Yoo Sooha.He was truly a contemptible scumbag.***As soon as I arrived, the Vigilante Guard had already arrived on the scene. Hunters from big guilds arrived one after another. Normally, they would be growling and unsheathing their claws at each other, but instead everyone cooperated to subdue the demonic flames (\u706b\u9b54). [1]\u201cDon\u2019t use your water abilities independently!\u201d a guild member shouted. \u201cThat\u2019s right. We need to time our abilities together! Just like this.\u201d\u201cThe Black Dragon guild will be temporarily managing this area,\u201d another guild member yelled. \u201cPlease follow our instructions for a moment, everyone!\u201dHunters who were hard to find, unless you saw their faces on the newspaper, all gathered there. Even two or three top rankers were present. While helping the residents, I stole few glances at those top rankers.\u201cF-For the time being,\u201d a female alchemist said, \u201cwe have finished isolating the surrounding area. The problem is whether or not there are any survivors inside\u2026 I think we will need to send a rescue team at once.\u201d I recognized her\u2014She was #5 in the Rankings: A Master Alchemist (\uf99b\uf90a\u7701\u4e3b) and leader of a guild filled with doctors and pharmacists.\u201cThat\u2019s fine. This place was originally a slum. No one\u2019s lived here for five years, so it became an off-limits area,\u201d another female said. \u201cIt\u2019s fortunate that a fire broke out in a place like this.\u201d She was the Paladin, #10 in the Rankings: Leader of the Vigilante Guard, which was responsible for the city\u2019s public order.These two Hunters were famously known for helping others in need. Among the top rankers, they were not lone wolves who stood idly. They arrived at the scene faster than anyone else and took command.With these two female powerhouses, it was clear something or someone\u00a0was missing.\u00a0\u2018Normally, the Saintess would be standing in between them, but\u2026\u2019She was nowhere to be found.Which was obvious\u2014Since she was murdered by not your typical lone wolf, but the greatest shithead loner of them all.The only people who knew this fact was probably only the Flame Emperor and me. Not even the other top rankers knew this truth yet\u2026 No, perhaps they\u2019ll never know the truth.The Master Alchemist looked around. \u201cThat\u2019s weird. Why isn\u2019t Miss Saintess here yet?\u201d\u201cI heard she had to do something tonight,\u201d the Paladin said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the details. Could be a date?\u201d She chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s been with the Flame Emperor lately.\u201dThe Master Alchemist hunched her shoulders. \u201cI dislike the man known as the Flame Emperor,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile it might be impolite of me to talk behind his back in such a place, he displeases me. I think Miss Saintess should meet a better person.\u201d\u201cYour standards are too high. Just what kind of man would be better than the Rank 1? This is why you\u2019re still single,\u201d the Paladin lightly teased.\u201cI-I can find a partner whenever I want\u2026\u201d the Master Alchemist blushed. \u201cI\u2019m just not interested right now\u2026\u201d Her voice trailed away.Speaking of the devil, of course he would appear.\u201cIt\u2019s the Flame Emperor!\u201d someone shouted.The people who were working to put out the fires all stopped for a moment. Even the top rankers turned their heads.Dressed in a hoodie and sweatpants, the Flame Emperor, or rather, the Plague casually strolled toward them. The Plague seemed greatly annoyed. \u201cAh, fuck. Who played with fire without my permission?\u201d he said.This crazy psychopathic bastard.The Paladin immediately became more professional and welcomed him. \u201cGreetings, Flame Emperor, sir.\u201d\u201cMhm. I have arrived.\u201d His tone was particularly kingly.\u201cAs you can see, someone committed arson in the old slums district,\u201d the Paladin said. \u201cWould you please lend us a hand?\u201d she asked politely.But the Flame Emperor remained aloof. \u201cIf I help you, then what are you going to give me?\u201d he asked.\u201cYou would gain great satisfaction by generously assisting residents,\u201d the Paladin said.\u201cEnough with the bullcrap. Tell me what you\u2019ll give me.\u201d\u201cTomorrow, all media across the world will write in big bold letters: \u300eThe Flame Emperor subdues the fire, a charitable act of goodwill\u300f. You can improve your image while grabbing the attention of all the people around the world,\u201d she said.The Flame Emperor guffawed. He stuffed his hands in his pockets and smirked at her words. \u201cDo you think I give a fuck about those trash journalists?\u201dHe was truly a psychopath. It was clear the Flame Emperor was well on the path of insanity with no return.Residents were already recording the Flame Emperor with their phones. In real time, the Flame Emperor\u2019s every word and action was being transmitted throughout the world. The Internet became heated as the two sides\u2014the ones who sided with the Flame Emperor and the ones who criticized him\u2014battled it out.I wonder, what would the defenders say?Yeah. You should fiercely protect your self-interests.Helping someone for free only makes you a pushover.It\u2019s nice to see a hero who is this honest. [2]I was dizzy with the contradictions. The weight of who the Flame Emperor really was pushed against me in the form of a headache.\u00a0\u2018No one knows.\u2019\u00a0Dread sent chills down my spine.\u00a0\u2018They are all completely mistaken. He isn\u2019t upfront\u2014That bastard\u2019s insane.\u2019Even though flames danced right in front of me, my heart ran cold. Those flames. That arson. This disaster. All of it was caused by the Flame Emperor himself. Nevertheless, he returned with a perfectly fine face and asked, \u201cWhat are you going to give me?\u201dAnd so, I was finally convinced:\u00a0\u2018I need to get rid of him!\u2019A monster.It wasn\u2019t just for my revenge. It was for all of humanity. For the sake of the Hunters, that monster deserved to be eradicated. Monsters were simply monsters. It\u2019s the Hunter\u2019s mission and duty to kill them!\u2018By all means\u2026 I must kill him.\u2019In this Tower, there lived a single monster that played with fire. Literally shot fire with its hands. A real monster. Yes. It was so. But it was inappropriate to say that it was simply\u00a0there. It was quite inappropriate.Because, that monster was my prey.\u2018Even if I die.\u2019\u00a0I stepped forward.Each intentional step brought me closer.I moved past the heroes who were concerned about the follow-up measures. I strolled past the ordinary people who were doing their best to control the fire. Towards the ever-rising flames, towards the fire that was as fierce as Hell, I walked closer.\u201cHuh? Wait a moment. Where are you going?\u201d A guild member said.I walked.\u201cHyung-ssi! You shouldn\u2019t get too close to the flames!\u201d said someone else.I strode toward my goal.\u201cOh no! That person must be crazy!\u201d a female voice said.\u201cSomeone please, stop him!\u201d a male voice said.\u201cFuck, what\u2019s that crazy bastard doing!?\u201d another male voice resounded.And then I burst forward.Behind me, people were making a fuss. There were those who jumped up and down. Others who stopped working and yelled at me. I bypassed them all. Ignoring them, I simply raced toward my goal.It was hot. No different than Hell. With a roar, the blaze of fire surrounded me in one fell swoop. The flames licked me with red tongues.It hurt like crazy.With each step, my flesh melted. My eyes burned to crisps within its sockets. But still\u2026\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s better than dying to the Flame Emperor!\u2019This was the only method of killing the Flame Emperor with absolute certainty.How long had I been running? It felt like I ran for quite some time, but it also felt like only a minute. The smoke clogged up what was left of my throat. I wheezed and coughed. And then I stopped coughing. I stopped all together, and then I heard a voice.That\u2019s right.| You\u2019ll be returning 24 hours prior.That was my second death.***When people saw me jump into the fire, they made a huge commotion saying I was crazy.Of course, I wasn\u2019t crazy.It was the complete opposite. I had an awfully cold understanding of the current situation. \u201c\u2026I\u2019m back,\u201d I said out loud. My voice sounded perfectly fine and didn\u2019t hold any of the raspy traces I had, what felt like, mere moments ago. Here I was.Back to my Hell. My 125 square-foot, single room apartment. The walls were plastered with interview articles, and a live broadcast streamed on the TV. That was already the third time that I\u2019d heard this live broadcast.Breaking news!The Black Dragon Guild attempts to conquer the 40th floor of the Tower\u2026Once again, I\u2019d returned to yesterday.\u2018Good. The skill is working properly.\u2019\u00a0Unlike the last time, I didn\u2019t pay any attention to the television. There was no need. The skill that allowed me to go back to 24 hours prior worked. All I had to do was make sure this was certain. With this, I could kill the Flame Emperor.| You are currently an F-Class Hunter.| Due to your low Class, you will not be penalized.\u201cAs expected,\u201d I mumbled to myself.\u00a0\u2018Returner\u2019s Clockwork Watch\u2026 it said that the penalty will increase with the Hunter\u2019s Class, right?\u2019\u00a0On the contrary, it meant that no penalty was given to Hunters with the lowest Class. If you\u2019re an F-Class like me, you didn\u2019t even get a penalty.\u2018This is my chance.\u2019 \u00a0While I was still an F-Class, this was the very moment. The one and only golden opportunity to hunt the Flame Emperor.\u2018My last chance.\u2019I took the knife out of my backpack.It was an old knife. A knife that I\u2019d been keeping ever since I started working as a Hunter. While it was not usable for killing monsters\u2026 it was sufficient enough to kill a person.\u2018How can I kill the Flame Emperor?\u2019I\u2019d thought about it.\u00a0\u2018Should I cooperate with the Saintess before she dies? Should I report to the Black Dragon Guild about my skill and devise a plan to imprison the Flame Emperor forever? Or should I try to record the moment the Saintess dies?\u2019Any method was fine. But they were just\u00a0simply\u00a0fine. It didn\u2019t ensure the Flame Emperor would certainly die.\u2018I don\u2019t have the qualifications to gain the Saintess\u2019 trust.\u2019I lacked the skills.\u2018I don\u2019t have the authority to move an entire guild into action.\u2019I lacked the strength.\u2018I don\u2019t think I can successfully record the Flame Emperor killing the Saintess.\u2019I lacked the confidence.\u2018But\u2026\u2019Even so, I had something.\u2018If I die, I\u2019ll return to 24 hours prior.\u2019A skill.The Returner\u2019s Clockwork Watch that was copied from the Flame Emperor.\u2018Yeah. I have a skill.\u2019My heart pounded in my ears, my breathing rough.\u2018Don\u2019t worry Kim Gongja, you can do this!\u2019I tried to gulp, but my mouth was dry. Taking a deep breath, I looked at the wall one last time. A magazine interview with the Flame Emperor was affixed there, untouched.<table>Q: Yoo Sooha-nim, when did you experience your first awakening?</tbody></table><table>YOO SOOHA: During summer when I was 21. So it\u2019s been 11 years.</tbody></table><table>Q: You must have good memory to be able to accurately remember even the season.</tbody></table><table>YSH: I don\u2019t think my memory is particularly good. It just happens to be the case that I awakened on my birthday, 11 years ago on June 7th.</tbody></table>\u201911 years ago.\u201911 years ago, on June 7th. It was still summer.If you counted the days backward\u2026\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s 4,050 days.\u2019That\u2019s right.\u2018I just need to die 4,050 times.\u2019This was the only method of killing the Flame Emperor with absolute certainty.\u2018Yoo Sooha\u2014If you are a monster that can\u2019t die\u2014\u2019I raised the knife.\u2018I\u2019ll kill you before you become that monster!\u2019And then, I stabbed my neck.To return back in time.Back 11 years in the past to June 7th. Back before the Flame Emperor awakened his first skill. Back before he could return 24 hours before his death, to those summer days.Back to the time the Flame Emperor could still die!A groan escaped my gritted teeth.The pain seared me, hot and cutting. My heart thumped hard and deep, about to burst. \u00a0I sliced through my nerve endings as they screeched at me to stop. Until, like a light, my sight flickered off. And like a thread, my sense of touch was cut off.But then, I still heard a voice.| You have died.| You\u2019ll be returning 24 hours prior.I returned to the day before.The day before, I was lying in bed. The TV was off. However, the walls remained unchanged, plastered with scraps of newspapers. One day was not sufficient to erase the Flame Emperor\u2019s history, or rather, that psychopath\u2019s history.I glared at Yoo Sooha\u2019s photo.\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019\u00a0If a day was not enough, then a week. If a week was lacking, then a month. If a month was not sufficient, then a year. If one year was inadequate, then\u2026\u201cNow.\u201d I pulled out my dagger once again. \u201cI just need to die 4,049 times more.\u201dAnd I stabbed myself to death.[T/N][1] Demonic flames [\ud654\ub9c8(\u706b\u9b54)] is a special type of fire that cannot be easily extinguished.

A legend that would surely have been engraved on the Tower for all eternity\u2014I will erase it. Just as Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day, the legend of the Flame Emperor was not made in merely a few days. Obviously, it was difficult to erase all of it.But, it wasn\u2019t impossible.\u201cFuck!\u201d It hurt.I pushed myself. To kill myself, I pushed past my limits, giving more than I had. I used malice to kill myself. All of the resentment and spite that filled me, I used it to slice away my life.When I wanted to give up, I remembered all of it. The agony of being burned alive by the Flame Emperor. The injustice. The rage. He had the nerve to come back after setting fire to the town. And with that shameless face he said, \u201cWhat are you going to give me?\u201d That condescending look as if all others were insects. As if\u00a0I\u00a0was an insect.Venomous fury rushed through me.\u2018You fucker\u2014I\u2019ll kill you!\u2019Tightly clenching my teeth and strengthening my grip on the knife, I thrust the blade into my neck.\u2018I\u2019ll kill you, Yoo Sooha!\u2019The act of stabbing was done to kill me.But even more, it was done to kill the Flame Emperor. To demolish him and his legacy.| You have died.| You\u2019ll be returning 24 hours prior.***For how long had I been killing myself? How many times had my breath stuttered to a stop?Like a never-decreasing hourglass, my work seemed endless. The Flame Emperor\u2019s achievements seemed to be as formidable as a pyramid that would always stand tall through the ages. As if it would never collapse. But look, cracks started surfacing on that pyramid. Finally, it was starting to crack.Countless scraps of newspapers plastered on the apartment walls surrounded me: testimonials showing the history of the Flame Emperor. With each death, they faded away. One by one.\u300eThe Flame Emperor single-handedly subjugates the 39th floor!\u300f\u300eThe Flame Emperor solo clears the 38th floor!

Just like how an old man\u2019s teeth fall out one by one, leaving a gaping maw exposed. So, too, as the newspaper clippings disappeared one by one, they left the walls exposed and open.\u300eThe Flame Emperor solo clears the 38th floor!

But there was still a long way to go. So, I would endure. The Flame Emperor had practically been eternally immortal. Until me. That psychopath was no longer eternal nor was he immortal. As long as I knew that truth, I would hold out as long it took.\u2018It\u2019s not impossible!\u2019I swung my knife and made sure it gouged heavy and deep.With the bloody swing, I killed the time when the Flame Emperor subjugated the 37th floor.\u300eSubjugation of the 37th floor successful!\u300f\u300eHunter Yoo Sooha crowned as the World\u2019s Rank 1.

Who is the mysterious hero?\u300f\u300e22 days since the Sword Saint\u2019s disappearance. Will the Hunter Association face its worst crisis?\u300fUntil, finally\u2014I looked at the one thing that had stuck with me through it all. My battered knife. It had become lustrous, as if it was new. Less wrinkles crossed my hands. As I went back in time, my rented room had become smaller and smaller, more impoverished. I\u2019d forgotten how poor I\u2019d been.I went to the bathroom to splash water on my face and caught my young self staring \u00a0back at me in the mirror. And then, I swiveled my head to look around the room. There was nothing.There wasn\u2019t a myriad of newspaper articles. No magazine interviews. Not a single scrap of paper stuck on the apartment walls.White and empty. A pure, blank space (\u7a7a\u767d).I\u2019d successfully erased the history of the man known as the \u201cFlame Emperor.\u201d\u201cI did it.\u201d I mumbled, slack-jawed. \u201cI came back.\u201d To 11 years ago. May 6th. A whole month before the Flame Emperor, Yoo Sooha, was due to awaken.I\u2019d returned.\u00a0\u2018There\u2019s no need to hesitate. I don\u2019t need to wait.\u2019Cheap hoodie and sweatpants. A new knife. It was all I had in my early twenties. So, I threw my jacket on over my hoodie and went out, wearing all I owned like a suit of armor. The thrill of returning to the past\u2026there was none.\u2018Yoo Sooha.\u2019\u00a0Until I killed that bastard.\u00a0\u2018I have no room for shit like carelessness.\u20194090 times\u2014the number of times I\u2019d died to return to today.40 more deaths than my initial calculations. This included the time it took to commit suicide thousands of times and for short breaks, as well.Not only that.I\u2019d collected all the information concerning Yoo Sooha, every single thing. I did this by repeating today, May 6th, ten times.\u201811:00 AM,\u2019\u00a0I reminded myself. Yoo Sooha almost always woke up at 11:00 AM. May 6th. He woke up at 11:00 AM on this day, as well. Last night, he had washed down four bottles of beer, so a scowl had been permanently engraved on his face all morning.\u20182:00 PM.\u2019\u00a0Yoo Sooha left his monthly rented studio apartment and headed toward the hunting ground. The type of studio apartment that the F-Class Hunters often stayed in. Knowing that the weak Hunters frequently died while hunting, the landlord of the studio apartment would impose a hefty security deposit in return for putting up a cheap monthly rent. He had a good mind for business.\u20183:00 PM.\u2019\u00a0Yoo Sooha killed a weak slime from the Tower\u2019s 2nd floor hunting ground. However, killing a slime wasn\u2019t good enough for a day\u2019s earnings.At 3:11 PM, Yoo Sooha grumbled to himself. \u201cAh. Fucking plague. I wonder when I\u2019ll become like the Sword Saint and live a king\u2019s life.\u201dAt 3:15 PM, 4 minutes later. \u201cWow, slime hunting is really boring,\u201d he griped.An average F-Class Hunter. A life of waiting to strike it rich someday. That was the 21-year-old Yoo Sooha. Not the 32-year-old Flame Emperor.\u201cIf only I had won the lottery,\u201d he muttered.Before long, the 21-year-old would have been able to realize his wish. Because, as soon as Yoo Sooha obtained the Return Skill, he used it to win the lottery.MA, short for Merchant Association (\u5546\u806f), issued weekly lottery tickets. The Merchant Association was the only guild inside the Tower that could print lottery tickets. And all the Hunters who won the lottery were all on record. In the winning records, there remained a young man who would later be called the Flame Emperor. A \u201clucky\u201d bastard who won first place, not once, but twice in a row.\u2018That\u2019s three weeks and four weeks from today, respectively.\u2019\u00a0However. Such a future will not come to the 21-year-old Yoo Sooha who I was looking at right now.\u00a0\u2018You die here today.\u2019May 6th. 5:31 PM.Yoo Sooha moved on from the 2nd floor hunting ground. No doubt thinking that it was pointless to spend the rest of his life killing only slimes. He headed for a more challenging area, the kind of place novice Hunters would rarely visit.A little more secluded and dangerous. A place that nobody besides Yoo Sooha would enter for the next 36 minutes.\u2018\u2026He\u2019s here.\u2019\u00a0I had been waiting.\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s him.\u2019A man yawning while traipsing about\u2014Yoo Sooha. Even though he was 11 years younger, I could recognize that bastard at once. It wasn\u2019t because my perception was particularly great. Just that the present Yoo Sooha looked similar to that damn guy from 11 years later.\u2018In the future, you\u2019d probably find that fucking bastard pigging out on a some elixir for eternal youth.\u2019\u00a0Thank you. For being such a goddamned greedy little pig!\u2018Come.\u2019\u00a0My heart was pounding out of my chest. I fought back the tension and opened my mouth. \u201cO-over here, Hunter-nim! Please, save me\u2026!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Yoo Sooha turned his head in my direction.\u201cI was ambushed by wolves,\u201d I cried and sniffled. \u201cI beg of you, please help me. Some potion\u2026\u201dI\u2019d coated my entire body with blood. I was covered in it. Drenched. Of course, it wasn\u2019t my blood but the blood of some monsters I had hunted in advance. But to other people, I must look like a novice Hunter on the verge of death.\u201cAh, shit. What the fuck?\u201d Yoo Sooha exclaimed.Naturally, I would look like that in Yoo Sooha\u2019s eyes too. Was counting on it.\u201cMister, did you provoke the monsters here already? Damn. Then today\u2019s hunt is fucked.\u201dFucking asshole.\u201cP-potion\u2026\u201d I begged.\u201cPotion, my ass. I can\u2019t even feed myself properly.\u201d Yoo Sooha sighed and came closer. \u201cHow much you got?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d I asked.\u201cHow much you got for the potion? Mister, you think I\u2019m running a charity here? Don\u2019t tell me that you thought I\u2019d hand this expensive potion over for free now, right? To a man that I\u2019ve never met before? You gotta be fucking with me.\u201d Yoo Sooha took out a plastic bottle.Then he shook it right in front of my eyes. Splash. A blood-red liquid sloshed inside a bottle engraved with the Ministry of Alchemy\u2019s emblem. Twenty gold from the Ministry of Alchemy. It was a recovery potion that was sold for nineteen gold each when bought in a 5-pack.\u201cI-I\u2019ll give you\u2026twenty gold. So, please, hurry\u2026\u201d\u201cWow. Just look at this guy. Your greed is no joke.\u201d Yoo Sooha kneeled so he could look at me on even ground. \u201cMister, can\u2019t you tell what\u2019s going on? You\u2019re about to die.\u00a0Die.\u00a0This potion is something that could save your life. And you want to buy your life with just twenty gold? Is your life worth only twenty gold?\u201d\u201cRight\u2026\u201d I lay there in a pool of \u201cmy own\u201d blood.\u201cWhat if I just leave you here? You would simply die. If you don\u2019t want to die, you gotta pay the right price for your life.\u201dYeah. I knew. \u201cF-forty gold,\u201d I said.\u201cEnough. Hand over everything you have right now.\u201dI knew that he was this kind of guy.\u201cAh, that\u2019s right. You couldn\u2019t give me anything even if you wanted to. You can\u2019t even move your hands, right? Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll get it for you. I could do at least that much service.\u201d Yoo Sooha reached out, rummaged and groped through everything I had: my jacket pocket; the inside of my hoodie; even my pant pockets.The jerk finally found my leather wallet and smirked. \u201cLet\u2019s see. One gold, two gold, three gold\u2026Hmm. About sixty gold? You\u2019re so poor, mister. Carry some more around, man.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all I have\u2026\u201d All I fucking had to my name.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll spend it well on your behalf.\u201d Yoo Sooha took my wallet and patted my head.4050 days ago, no. He was just like when he burned me alive 4050 days later.\u201cThat\u2019s just life, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d He took out something from his chest with a heave, after putting away the potion he\u2019d promised to give me. Instead, he pulled out a blade. A sword (\u528d).It wasn\u2019t an item meant to save lives. On the contrary, it was a tool used to take lives.\u2018Ha.\u2019\u00a0I looked up at Yoo Sooha. Rather than looking angry, I just looked at him as if he was ridiculous.However, Yoo Sooha interpreted my gaze differently and shrugged. \u201cHey, don\u2019t look at me like that. I was thinking about giving you the potion, mister\u2026but if I let you live here, you might want to get back at me later, right? I can\u2019t let that happen. A man should live without worry, and since you\u2019ve seen my face\u2026\u201d Yoo Sooha smiled. \u201cYou have to die for me.\u201dThe Hunter who I could only ever admire on television. The hero I\u2019d worshipped for 10 years. The man I\u2019d always envied, always wanted to become. That hero\u2019s face was hideous.More hideous than I could ever have imagined.\u2018Alright.\u2019\u00a0I quietly looked at Yoo Sooha as he held the knife.\u00a0\u2018I\u2019ll live without worry in your stead.\u2019He slowly raised the knife.Then.I kicked my right foot up into his crotch.\u201cGgk!?\u201d Yoo Sooha staggered while he swung the knife. But that was more than enough time for me. After barely dodging Yoo Sooha\u2019s swing, I stabbed my knife through his neck.I was different from him. I wouldn\u2019t leave my prey that I had to kill in front of my eyes and\u2014fucking run my mouth pointlessly. I stabbed his throat then twisted the knife and dragged it up to his chin.Blood sprayed out. It soaked my hands. Yoo Sooha gagged. He gurgled and choked on the blood and fell to the ground. He let loose a scream, spattering the blood that had been clogging his throat.Hard and shrill, railing out against the pain.But only for a moment. Blood curdled out of his neck, painting his throat.I watched it all.Yoo Sooha inched closer to death with each passing second. Instinctively, he must have realized that he was dying. Yoo Sooha writhed on the ground, then curled up. He pressed down on the wound on his neck with both hands. But the blood didn\u2019t stop. It only trickled out between his fingers, even thicker than before.\u201cRight.\u201d Must not doddle. I pressed my foot down on Yoo Sooha\u2019s neck.His eyes grew wide. Why? For what reason? His eyes were loaded with such questions and resentment. It wouldn\u2019t be long before those eyes would be extinguished. There was no need for me to give any sort of explanation.\u201cI\u2019ll think of this as valuable experience.\u201d I grabbed the knife. The knife that killed me 4090 times.Then, I swung.To kill a monster.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Translator: SevenEditor: Ana_Banana(T/N: Hi guys, I\u2019m just making this little note to say a few things before we start. This novel is really interesting and the previous translation group did a really good job with it. Especially with their skill cards and forum comments and stuff. But I won\u2019t do that(read can\u2019t) and so I will just put it the way I know-how(i.e. using just punctuation marks). Maybe if I encounter someone who is able to/willing to do it I will try, but no promises. So please excuse the differences. Alright that\u2019s enough of me, hope you enjoy this novel.)\u201cKuk\u2026uk\u2026ugh!\u201dPeople always believed that there was a higher chance of awakening while in a life and death situation. In fact such a myth had been passed down in the hunter industry since its inception.But maybe it wasn\u2019t a myth, maybe it was real. Even I had awakened a skill simply for having an excessive amount of jealousy.Therefore I remained vigilant and shook my knife.\u201cHik!\u201dI wouldn\u2019t give this psychopath a chance.\u201cKuk!\u201dHe would die.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dBut what angered me the most, rather than the fact that this psychopath burned me to death so casually, it was something which caused anger to burn in me more intensely than even the pain and the desperation.\u2018He told me his name.\u2019Before returning me to the past, before holding onto my head and lighting it on fire. The Flame Emperor told me something with a smile.\u2018But you know who I am, and you saw me kill the Saintess so you have to die. My name is Yoo Soo-ha. Goodbye.\u2019The thing that crazy guy had said last. One weird part that I just couldn\u2019t stand. It was extremely disgusting.\u2018He told me his name.\u2019Why did he tell me his name before he killed me. Did he think that I didn\u2019t know what the name of the Flame Emperor was?\u2018He must\u2019ve thought it was cool.\u2019The Flame Emperor.That bastard probably thought that the scene looked cool. As if in a sacred duel where the warriors learned their opponents name. This is what the Flame Emperor must have thought as he killed me.\u2018Whoever I kill, I do it in fairness. So at least I\u2019m not being too imposing.\u2019How dare-.\u201cLike that-.\u201dHow dare a psychopath like you.\u201cThink something like that.\u201dA man who killed a witness just because he stumbled across the scene. A person who pretended to be blameless as he came back to inspect the fire he created. A person like that could no longer be called human. He was a beast. A devil, even worse than a beast. Who acted cool as if it made him more noble.\u201cDon\u2019t mess with me!\u201dPuk!My knife stabbed into Yoo Soo-ha\u2019s neck again.\u201c\u2026\u201dThere was no sound. No scream, no moan. The hunting ground was hidden, far away from where anyone would be active.I looked up to the sky, but my eyes weren\u2019t in focus and my body was swaying like a weed in the breeze.He was dead.\u201cHaha\u2026\u201dMaybe it wasn\u2019t appropriate to say \u2018dead\u2019. Yoo Soo-ha was more than just an ordinary hunter, and it wasn\u2019t simply that he was dead.The man who would\u2019ve become the Flame Emperor someday. A legend who had reached the top of the world\u2019s rankings. The one who managed to single-handedly defeat 10 floors in the tower that no one had been able to reach even after trying for years. He was killed by me\u201cHooo\u2026\u201dI sighed.\u201cNow I can be a little sane again.\u201dAs I turned to head back, I heard something arrive, probably drawn by the smell of blood.A pack of wolves were crouched among the trees.Great\u2026These weren\u2019t ordinary wolves. They were engraved by what appeared to be tattoos which could be seen even through their thick hair. These were Meadow Wolves and the more complex the patterns on their bodies, the stronger they were.Though these Meadow Wolves only had the simplest patterns on their bodies, an F-class hunter like me couldn\u2019t possibly fight them.\u201c\u2026\u201dFirst I carefully retrieved the wallet that was stolen by Yoo Soo-ha and stepped back.\u201cYou guys want to eat this guy right?\u201dI pointed at the body.\u201cI don\u2019t need it. You can have it.\u201dI took another step back.\u2018Come on.\u2019The wolves cautiously approached the body.Crack!One of the wolves took a bite, and that seemed to be a signal for the rest of them.Crack! Crack!Soon the body couldn\u2019t be seen as it was completely covered by wolves.\u201cEat well.\u201dI hurried away.\u2018Is it over now?\u2019I buried the clothes that had been splattered with Yoo Soo-ha\u2019s blood in a deep pit I\u2019d prepared before the fight. As I washed my whole body with water from a plastic bottle and changed into a new set of clothes from my backpack, it still hadn\u2019t sunk in yet.\u2018Is it really over?\u2019If my clothes were too clean, people might be suspicious of me. So I deliberately rolled on the ground for a bit before heading back to Babylon, the city on the first floor of the tower.As I walked up to the gates, a guard watched me closely for a moment before yawning and turning away.\u2018Ah.\u2019No one had realised.\u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019Even when I went to a bar and ordered a beer. Even when I emptied the beer and ordered another one, no one cared about me. No one knew what I\u2019d done.Old news played on the tavern\u2019s television.-Today, the strategy which was guaranteed to clear the 10th floor failed.-Hunters ranked 2nd and 7th in the world intend to challenge and defeat the 10th floor together\u2026-Voices of protest against the world\u2019s number one hunter continually grow stronger. This is due to the fact that the Sword Saint still refuses to work with anyone else.No matter how long I waited, there was no breaking news like, \u2018A hunter has disappeared on the second Floor of the tower.\u2019 But I should\u2019ve expected that.Novice hunters lost their lives every day. No one really cared about the disappearance of a lone novice, no one cared about me.In other words.\u2018It\u2019s over!\u2019\u201cHey.\u201dI lifted my empty glass high.\u201cPour another draft for me!\u201d\u201cYou sure are drinking a lot. Was your hunt good today?\u201d\u201cYeah it was good. Very good!\u201dEven as I said this, my heart wasn\u2019t settled.I took two or three hours calming my heart with beer.It wasn\u2019t until sunset that I gradually began to accept the reality.\u2018What should I do now?\u2019There was a lot to do.\u2018I could win the lottery. I would get the money and no one would suspect a thing. Hey, my life is about to get better!\u2019I opened my status window which could only be viewed by myself.[Name: Kim Gongja}Rank: F-ClassSkills (2/4) :I want to Become Just Like You (S+) : PassiveReturner\u2019s Clockwork Watch (EX) : PassiveNoneNone\u201cKya. Now I\u2019m not even hungry anymore.\u201dMy status window was like the most delicious meal in the world. One S+ class skill and an EX class skill that I\u2019d never even heard about. When it came to meals, this was like having caviar on top of my steak.\u2018If there is someone with better skills than this then they are truly broken.\u2019But I couldn\u2019t stop the warm smile from spreading across my face.\u2018\u2026But i have no combat skill.\u2019Ah\u2026Why was the human mind like this? The thing I didn\u2019t have was the thing that I noticed the most.\u201cNo matter how easy it is to make money, a hunter must be a hunter\u2026 even with all the money in the world, without power then it would eventually be robbed .\u201dThe society in the tower was much more bloody than the outside world. To put it nicely, the strong ate well, and the weak were the meat. It didn\u2019t matter even if you wanted to escape the tower and live lavishly in the outside world.\u2018Those who stepped foot in the tower could never leave.\u2019Those were the rules. Not even a hunter with an S class teleportation ability could go out of the tower. It was simply impossible.Only one being in all of Babylon could interact with the outside world. The Guildmaster of the Shanglian Guild. The only hunter with the title \u2018Count.\u2019\u2018Even then, they could only send and receive things from the outside world, they couldn\u2019t directly leave.\u2019Anyone could enter, but no one could exit.This meant that those who had entered had abandoned their wealth, their relationships, their nationality, their identity. Maybe\u2026even their humanity.\u201cIndeed.\u201dOf course, I was one of those people.\u201cEat or be eaten, that was the law in the tower.\u201dThe alcohol made me a little drunk and I couldn\u2019t help but mutter. I wanted to succeed so badly it drove me crazy. There was a reason why I idolized the Flame Emperor so much. Was it because of his personality? Did that guy even have something that could be called a personality?No, the reason was much simpler. I was envious of his success. His achievements had been dazzling, awe-inspiring.\u201cLet\u2019s succeed Kim Gong-ja. Okay? What can\u2019t a man who died 4090 times do? It\u2019s time to be successful\u2026\u201dThen.Jallang!The bell on the tavern\u2019s front door rang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Translator: SevenEditor: Ana_BananaI searched for information about the Sword Saint on my phone.-Originally, it was said that he was an elder from a wealthy old Northern European Conglomerate-His real name is Marcus Calenberry. It was rather regretful, but it was said that he gave up his family, connections and fortune and entered the tower all by himself.-No one knows exactly what skills he has.-It is rumoured that he has a habit of muttering to himself.I clicked my tongue.\u201cThere\u2019s no helpful information.\u201dI even looked for any interview videos but couldn\u2019t find a single one. Apparently, this elder was the complete opposite of the Flame Emperor. Although he was reputed for his bad personality, information of him could be found all over the internet.On the other hand, the Sword Saint was a mystery.The information on the internet about the Sword Saint was very vague. He was\u00a0apparently\u00a0from a large wealthy family,\u00a0supposedly\u00a0entered the tower on his own and it was rumoured that he mumbled to himself. All the information was speculative.\u2018What?\u2019I turned my head to a table in the corner. There, the Sword Saint sat alone, drinking his milk vodka.\u2018At least the information that he talks to himself is correct.\u2019The old man with an odd sense of fashion. Sat at the table with his odd drink and seemed to be mumbling to himself between sips.\u201cShut up. Don\u2019t be so noisy. In the first place, you are\u2026\u201dMumbleI couldn\u2019t hear exactly what the old man was saying, but he seemed to spit with every word he said. It was a horrible scene and I couldn\u2019t help but be a bit frightened.\u2018Does he suffer from psychosis?\u2019The number one hunter was psychotic. That was scary in itself. It was like having a nuclear bomb and not knowing when it might explode.\u2018\u2026No, if you think about it, Yoo Soo-ha had also been a psychopath.\u2019Perhaps one of the conditions to become number one was to be mentally ill.\u2018Almost all the top rankers are psycho.\u2019I shook my head and kept browsing the internet for information. However, most of them were purely speculative. But as I kept looking, a post in a forum caught my eye.-[Caution!] NG1\u00a0Words you should never say in front of the Sword Saint!]\u2018Hmm?\u2019It was an interesting title. The thread was posted in the Hunter Specialty Community website. A place to play, chat and share information that could only be accessed by those who had a Bureau issued Hunter Certificate. The post was done anonymously.-I saw it for myself. There are NG words that you should never say in front of the Sword Saint unless you want to die!\u2514 What are they?\u2514 Anything about his family. A few days ago, a few top-ranking hunters were fighting with the Sword Saint, and one of them said\u2018Looking at the way you are now, your grandchildren outside must have suffered.\u2019\u2018I bet you like to be alone because they don\u2019t dare keep you around.\u2019\u2018How embarrassed would they be if they saw you behaving like this.\u2019-Then he died!\u2514 What? Died?!\u2514 Yes. He was killed. In fact, he only managed to say,\u00a0\u2018How embarrassed would your grandchildren be\u2026\u2019\u00a0before his throat was cut. His head had been separated from his body in an instant.The comments after that ran wild.-Don\u2019t be insane.-This is probably a rumour created by those large guilds!-He\u2019s doing well so people are trying to trample him back down.Most of the people who responded didn\u2019t believe nevertheless the anonymous writer was persistent.-Believe it or not, I don\u2019t care! I just felt like telling you, so I told you.-Of course, I\u2019m not saying the Sword Saint was wrong. It was that guy\u2019s fault for mentioning his family. However, it\u2019s certain that those few top powers are ganging up on him because of this incident. You can see it with the constant abuse directed at him in the media these days.-Anyway, if you ever meet the Sword Saint. You should try it.\u201c\u2026-re too loud. I\u2019ll take care of it myself, so leave me alone.\u201dThe old man had been muttering to himself since he sat at the table. It really seemed like he had a mental illness. However, even if he suffered from psychosis, he still stood at the top of the world. The fact that this crazy old man had great skills beyond imagination remained unchanged.\u2018Good.\u2019And that was good enough for me.\u2018It was worth giving a shot.\u201cGood drink.\u201d\u201cAh, have a safe trip!\u201dThe Sword Saint emptied his goblet.As soon as he left the tavern, all the customers collectively let out the breaths they had been holding.\u201cHe\u2019s finally gone.\u201d\u201cHe must have dementia. Why did he keep muttering like that?\u201d\u201cI know right. Anyway, the alcohol doesn\u2019t taste good anymore\u2026\u201dAll the customers were probably waiting for the Sword Saint to leave, as they all rose to their feet to leave at the same time as I did.However, our intentions were probably the opposite.\u201cThis is my payment for the beer.\u201dI got up quickly and settled my bill with the owner. I had no time to waste\u201cAh, yes. Thank you. Come again!\u201d\u201cThe beer was delicious. I will.\u201dDaling!The bell on the door rang as I opened it and stepped out.It was late at night and darkness covered the street.\u2018Where did you go\u2026?\u2019I looked around, there were many crowds of people coming out of the numerous pubs on the street. Dozens of people laughing and staggering as they enjoyed the effects of the alcohol under the night sky.\u201cWhere are you, Mr First place?\u201dFortunately, after looking around for a while, I found the back I wanted.\u2018Found you!\u2019It was all thanks to his unusual outfit. He was probably the only man in all of Babylon who wore a suit and carried a sword. I quickly gathered myself and started following the old man.\u2018What skills do you have?\u2019My heart was pounding.\u2018The Flame Emperor had a ridiculous regression skill which was an Ex-rank skill. So what skills would the Sword Saint who was the previous generation\u2019s strongest have? Wouldn\u2019t he have skills that were even more broken?\u2019That skill would soon become mine. If I was lucky. (TL: Our MC is a pretty greedy guy lol, got on EX skill and now he wants more)\u2026How long had I been chasing this old man\u2019s back?We\u2019d long since left the heart of the city and had started walking through the backstreets. As I kept following him, we left the alleys and backstreets and entered the outskirts of the town. Here, there was a field that had no buildings or any signs of construction.The Sword Saint walked through this empty field.\u201cHmm.\u201dI walked a bit more before I stopped behind a tree.\u201cThis place should be appropriate enough.\u201dThe Sword Saint turned around, with starlight bathing his old body.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come out here young man.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNo one would know what happened in this place.\u201dHe was staring right at the tree that I hid behind. And I sighed in my heart.\u2018He caught me.\u2019I should\u2019ve expected it. From the very beginning, it was unreasonable to think that the strongest hunter wouldn\u2019t know that he was being followed by a low-class hunter like me.I could only blame my own incompetence as I walked out from behind the tree.\u201cAh. Excuse me. There is something I wanted to ask you Sword Saint-nim.\u201d (TL: Leaving in \u2018nim\u2019 just to further emphasize just how polite KGJ is being)I tried to speak as politely as I could. But for some reason, the Sword Saint laughed.\u201cHuh. Weren\u2019t you following me this whole time already? I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re getting so scared to ask this old man a question.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHuh?\u201cFor some reason. It seemed like the Sword Saint believed I was intentionally pretending to be afraid. In addition, since he\u2019d turned around, the Sword Saint had not let go of the hilt of his sword, even though I hadn\u2019t done anything. It seemed that he was ready to attack at any moment.\u2018Uh. Why?\u2019Of course, this was the best outcome for me, since my purpose was to have him kill me anyway.\u2018But I haven\u2019t done anything other than followed him\u2026\u2019Whether he knew my intentions or not, the Sword Saint seemed as though he was ready to end my life. As if in his eyes, I was already dead and he was just humouring me.\u201c\u2026Your acting is amazing. Indeed, you must be an amazing assassin.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?2\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to pretend you know. Other hunters might fall for it, but you cannot fool my eyes. I know you are an assassin sent by the Black Dragon GuildUh\u2026Old man, you\u2019re really misunderstanding something.\u2018Should I like this or not?\u2019Anyway, this way worked too. I didn\u2019t have to talk about his grandchildren for him to kill me. Though I didn\u2019t understand how he mistook an F-class hunter like me for an assassin. Honestly, I couldn\u2019t understand.\u201cUh-huh! You\u2019re really abominable. Come here and act to my face!\u201dThe Sword Saint looked at me with his mouth twisted as if staring at a monster he had to get rid of. It was a very odd expression that I couldn\u2019t understand.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you before? You can\u2019t deceive my eyes.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026Sir. There is something I truly want to ask you\u2026\u201dEventually, I just asked what I wanted to know.\u201cWhat makes you so convinced that I\u2019m an assassin? I don\u2019t do anything that would make you think that.\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201dShing!The Sword Saint drew the sword at his side.\u201cI have many skills. Among them is a skill that tells me how many people a person has killed. Thanks to this, I\u2019ve been able to avoid many crises.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat? I still didn\u2019t understand.\u2018Ah.\u2019Then, a few seconds after, I realized.\u2018I killed Yoo Soo-ha.\u2019That\u2019s right.I murdered Yoo Soo-ha today because I knew he was going to become a monster, but the people in this era didn\u2019t know that. So now I am a murderer.Unlike the outside world, murders happened pretty frequently inside the tower.\u2018But murder was still murder.\u2019In other words, in the eyes of the Sword Saint, there was probably a number [1] hanging above my head. The number [1] would be a prominent indicator of murder, so it was natural that the Sword Saint was on guard against me.\u201cYes, I understand Mr Sword Saint.\u201d\u201cHmmm.\u201d\u201cEven if you\u2019re on guard against me and I have nothing to say to that. You can take it as an excuse but listen. I followed you because of an important reason, I can\u2019t tell you what it is exactly but it is an extremely important reason. I can swear to the heavens.\u201dIt was a heartfelt statement. But the situation became strange instead of getting better. As he listened to my small speech, the Sword Saint\u2019s expression got worse and worse.\u201cDisgusting.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cA devil who has murdered as many people as you have dares to act in such a way. I haven\u2019t lived a clean life, but\u2026I never committed a reckless massacre as you have!\u201dHis words made me confused and embarrassed at the same time.\u201cNo. Wait a second. Massacre? I\u2019ve only killed one person in my entire life.\u201d\u201cYou really are shameless to say such a blatant lie!\u201dChik!The Sword Saint pointed the tip of his sword toward me and said,\u201cI can see the number [4091] hanging above your head.\u201dI was dumbfounded.\u201cWhat\u2026the fuc\u2026\u201dI tried to ask \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d but my words got cut short as I came to the realization of where the number 4091 came from.\u2018Ah.\u2019It was from my one time killing Yoo Soo-haAnd.\u2018It\u2019s the number of times I committed suicide.\u20194090 times.The exact amount of times I killed myself.\u201cBe prepared Devil!\u201dIf so.\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was that Black Dragon Witch who sent you or someone else, but I will do my best to kill you!\u201dIt meant that in the eyes of that old man, I was nothing but a murderer who slaughtered 4091 human beings. A cold shiver went down my spine.\u2018No.\u2019This was a serious problem.\u2018It was no longer just a matter of copying the Sword Saints skills or not.\u201dThat\u2019s right.\u2018Anytime in the future\u2026if the Sword Saint sees me, he will try to kill me.\u2019Because in his eyes, I was an abominable murderer who, like a deadly virus, should not be allowed to survive in this world.\u201cWa-, wait!\u201dI reached out my hand.\u201cPlease wait a minu\u2026\u201dAt that moment.The Sword Saint\u2019s sword flew toward me at an unstoppable speed.T/N:1: NG(written in English characters) meaning \u2018not good\u2019 or \u2018no good\u2019 is a type of forum shorthand(abbreviation).2: It can be found sometimes in Asian speech, that they will sometimes use words in place of others.

    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 \u2013 The Monologuing Identity(2)Translator: SevenEditor: Ana_BananaLuck.It was pure luck that helped me evade the old man\u2019s attack.\u201cHmm?!\u201dThe Sword Saint\u2019s eyes widened slightly. Perhaps, in his eyes, I was a tremendous master. So after I dodged his attack, he immediately jumped away, expecting a counterattack. What he probably didn\u2019t expect was that I would be fiercely rolling on the ground.\u201cSwo-, Sword Saint-nim. Wait. Please listen to me for a moment.\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter if I died. I wanted to die after all. No, what mattered was if I could fix the misconception that the Sword Saint had, then die. That way, I could avoid useless confrontations in the future.\u201cI\u2019m an F-class hunter\u2026\u201d\u201cYou dodged my sword. You must be a high-end assassin huh?\u201d\u201cAh! Is this old geezer deaf?!\u201dThis was horrible. Instead of clearing up the misunderstanding, it was just getting worse.Again, avoiding the sword had been pure luck. I couldn\u2019t even follow the blade with my eyes. The old man\u2019s skills far exceeded my cognitive abilities.\u2018If he attacks again, I wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid it.\u2019After all this, it seemed like I could only give up on convincing him. I watched the death approach in the form of a sword.\u201c\u2026\u201dHe stopped.The Sword Saint suddenly stopped, just a step away and at first, I thought this was my chance.\u2018Oh? Are you ready to listen to me now?\u2019But the Sword Saint didn\u2019t look at me. Instead, the old man frowned at the air. Curious, I also turned my head to look but found nothing there.\u201c\u2026Didn\u2019t I tell you I\u2019d take care of it?\u201dThe old man spoke to the open air.\u201c\u2026So noisy. Catch and interrogate. So I should keep this demon alive?\u201dHe was talking to himself.\u2018What the?\u201dThe Sword Saint, who had just been about to cut me down, stopped. Instead, he began to mutter to himself. The immediate crisis was delayed a bit.I furrowed my brow.\u2018Is he\u2026is that a self-talk skill?\u2019Maybe. Maybe it was.At the bar, I\u2019d thought, \u2018This old man is mentally ill.\u2019 But now that I was witnessing it up close it seemed a bit different. Shall I say a bit more elaborate and sophisticated? The man truly seemed to be talking to someone.\u2018Is it telepathy?\u2019Suddenly a thought came to me. Telepathy or Sound Transmission(\u50b3\u97f3). The ability to freely communicate from a distance. Such a skill did exist.\u2018Then\u2026was he talking about me to someone else?\u2019A shiver went down my spine again.\u2018He intends to capture the man who slaughtered 4091 people.\u2019Wanted Criminal.The Hunter Bureau rarely released bounties. And when they did, the targets didn\u2019t last very long. The Wanted person would be hunted by top players and would need to hide for life. If they were caught, they would be executed publicly in Babylon Square in the middle of the city.\u2018This is not good.\u2019I clenched my teeth.\u2018I have to die right now.\u2019So that everything I could go back 24 hours and let everything be reset, I had to die immediately. I stared at the Sword Saint.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s too late. I\u2019ve already made up my mind. Even if you\u2019re the master\u2026\u201dThe old man was still muttering to himself. I wasn\u2019t 100% sure if he suffered from psychosis or was really talking to someone, but even if I wasn\u2019t sure I still opened my mouth.\u201cHow are your grandchildren doing?\u201dThe old man stopped talking to himself. Then he slowly turned and looked at me.\u201cI heard that the outside world is really ugly these days. If they\u2019re the grandchildren of the great Sword Saint then they must be quite pretty. You must be very worried.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDark blue eyes, and pupils that were as still as the ocean\u2019s depths stared into my eyes.\u201cIt is said that you\u2019re originally from Northern Europe. I heard that terrorists there are really rampant. I don\u2019t know, maybe without your knowledge, your grandchildren have already suffered many injustices.\u201dSuguk.\u2018Huh.\u2019The sound of an apple being cut in half rang out in the clearing.\u2018Huh\u2026\u2019At first, I couldn\u2019t tell what had happened. I\u2019d been watching the old man this entire time and I hadn\u2019t seen him move. Not even his lips moved.So where did that sound come from?The strangeness didn\u2019t end there though. Originally, the Sword Saint was standing on the ground right in front of me. But does it feel as though the ground was slowly turning over.The horizon tilted and the moon in the sky flipped over. High in the night sky, the first quarter moon(Sanghyun) tilted and became the last quarter moon(Hahyun). The only thing on the horizon was an upside-down old man.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe old man\u2019s blue eyes just stared at me and I couldn\u2019t help but think that they truly resembled the starry sky. I could see why he was called the sword saint.Then I realized.\u2018Ah.\u2019The ground was not upside down.My head had been cut off and it was slowly falling.One Hit KO(\u4e00\u64ca)\u2018Beautiful.\u2019My eyes couldn\u2019t follow the attack of the old man, but as I saw the world after my head was cut off, I couldn\u2019t help but think it was beautiful.After a while, my head hit something. My mind was blank and I couldn\u2019t hear anything, but I finally realized that my head had landed on the ground.By the time I realized that there was no longer any life in my eyes.[You have died.]What kind of skills did he have? How long did he have to practice before he could get skills at that level?[The skill condition has been achieved due to death.]I was filled with emotions that were much different from when I had been killed by the Flame Emperor. I felt betrayed by the Flame Emperor and I\u2019d wanted revenge for my wrongful death.However, it wasn\u2019t the same with the Sword Saint.\u2018I want to be like that.\u2019\u2018I want to have a one-hit attack too.\u2019This was similar to the feeling I had toward Yoo Soo-ha before I learned what he truly was like.Jealousy. Covetousness. Adoration.Flames of desire burned within my heart.And there was something that responded to those flames.[A skill of Hunter Marcus Calenbury will be randomly copied.]Cards began to appear in the darkness around me.[Creating Skill Cards.]Swish!The cards had their backs toward me so I couldn\u2019t see their information.\u2018Still, the colors were more pronounced than when I was killed by Yoo Soo-ha.\u2019Perhaps it was because I\u2019ve already adapted to death.4090 times. As the Sword saint had confirmed with his [Kill Counter] skill, I\u2019d already experienced death thousands of times. No hunter was more familiar with death than me.\u2018It\u2019s not something to be proud of.\u2019I couldn\u2019t help but make a bitter smile.\u2018Please select a skill card.\u2019The cards floating before me all started to fly around quickly.\u2018Whoa!\u2019At first, I was surprised. But it didn\u2019t take long for me to regain my focus and begin to concentrate on the cards.\u2018I mustn\u2019t get anything else. Golden yellow! I can only get a golden yellow card!\u2019But they were fast. It seemed impossible to chase after them.\u2018Oh my God.\u2019Did I grab a golden card from these fast-moving cards when I was killed by the Flame Emperor? Me? How did I do that? I was new, but I was really lucky at that time.\u2018There is nothing to say, I can\u2019t get lucky again this time! Golden Yellow, where are you golden yellow?\u2019But I realized something strange.\u2018Huh?\u2019No matter how hard I looked, I couldn\u2019t find one.\u2018I don\u2019t think there are any golden cards.\u2019Among the cards flying around in front of me, there were blue cards and silver cards. However, none of them were golden. Believing I was wrong, I focused and searched even harder to look for anyone that I missed, but found nothing.This meant there was only one possibility.\u2018Re-, really?\u2019I was shocked.\u2018Is there really no..?\u2019From the start\u2026the Sword Saint did not have any S-rank skills.\u2018This doesn\u2019t make sense!\u2019I wanted to scream.\u2018He is the number one hunter! The most legendary character before the Flame Emperor arrived and he didn\u2019t have any S-rank skills?!\u2019It was very hard to believe, but it was true. My skill proved it.Marcus Calenbury, the great Sword Saint, reigned above the world without a single S-rank skill.I was shocked and a bit fearful.\u2018No, no! This cannot be!\u2019My reaction of shock and fear were completely genuine.\u2018I\u2019m sure that there are at least a few strong skills among the silver cards.\u2019I didn\u2019t know where to curse my situation or laugh at the odds. Nevertheless, I was eager to try my luck.With a very earnest heart, I stared at the cards.\u2018Three blue cards and four silver cards.\u2019Seven cards in totally flew around dizzyingly.\u2018I can completely ignore the shit cards.\u2019It was a reasonable choice of course.Now the question was which silver card to choose.The [Kill Counter] skill was probably included in the silver cards. And he probably had an unidentified cheat skill as well.Of course, the technique I wanted should not be as subtle as the kill counter skill and it would be better if it was a cheat skill like the resurrection skill.\u2018The probability is 1 out of 4.\u2019In other words, I could only rely on pure luck.\u2018Please be something good.\u2019I reached out my hand.\u2018Please, please be the one I want. The Sword Saint\u2019s cheat skill!\u2019Then I caught one of the silver cards.[Selection Complete. A skill has been copied.][Returning to 24 hours ago.]\u2026\u201c-Huk!\u201dI woke up, swallowing a groan.Side room.A 2 pyung1\u00a0large lodge welcomed me, the familiar sight enriching my heart a bit. The futon gave off a bad smell as it hadn\u2019t been washed in a long time.Unfortunately, this single bedroom apartment was all I could afford at the time.\u201cWha-, what did I get?!\u201dI immediately opened my stat window, wondering if I\u2019d succeeded or failed in my 25% gamble.[Kim Gong-ja]Class: FSkills(3/4):\u2192I Want to Be Like You2(S+): Passive\u2192Returners Clockwork Watch(EX): Passive\u2192Sword Constellation(A+): PassiveNone(TL: Of all passives\u2026rip\u2026)\u201cAh\u2026\u201dI sighed, feeling both happy and sad.\u201cI\u2019m glad I got an A+-rank skill\u2026\u201dFirst I felt glad. Even though it wasn\u2019t an S-rank skill, I still believed this was the best one he had. I was also lucky to not get a skill like Kill Counter.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s another passive skill.\u201dThen there was my sadness. What I\u2019d initially aimed for was a combat skill. Some kind of rare martial art. Like fencing. Or maybe a skill that awakens an aura. Most of those were active abilities.In other words, I failed to get the best combat skill.\u201cHaa.\u201dI sighed again.\u201cNo, if I think about it, it\u2019s not so bad\u2026\u201dIn fact, if other hunters were to hear my lamentation now, they\u2019d go crazy.Where could you find A+-rank skills without having to work hard for it.I decided to look at the bright side instead.First, I had to focus on checking the skill out first.Shak!Of course, the skill cards were only visible to the hunter themself.\u2192I Want to Be Like You(S+): Passive\u2192Returners Clockwork Watch(EX): Passive\u2192Sword Constellation(A+): PassiveSword Constellation.Just by looking at the name, it was really hard to determine what the skill did.\u201cBut even \u2018I Want to Be Like You\u2019 had a strange name.\u201dIt was difficult to judge whether a skill was a scam or a prize from the name alone.Maybe it would turn out to be an amazing skill. It was a little comfort I gave myself since I was the one who grabbed the silver card.-Ah. What\u2019s so noisy?A voice sounded out from somewhere.-Grandfather. This Master told you. If you want to have practice in the middle of the night, at least be quiet.\u201c\u2026\u201d-When you move, there\u2019s no need to disturb me. I don\u2019t have to wake up. Let\u2019s treat each with manners yeah?Slowly.I slowly turned to look in the direction of the voice.On a futon in a single room. I was crammed into space where I could barely lie down alone. Yet I could see something behind, though blurry. Someone was laying there, with his back to me.\u201cExcuse me.\u201dI felt goosebumps.\u201cWho are you?\u201d-Huh?And then my eyes met with someone I didn\u2019t know.Spirit. Ghost.Something that was clearly not a living human.-Eh?The ghost was large. If it wasn\u2019t for his clothes, he might\u2019ve been mistaken for a gorilla. His physique was rather wide, even down to his eyebrows. And he stared at me with a shocked expression.-Hey. Who are you?\u201c\u2026I want to ask the same thing. Who are you?\u201d-Can you see me?I nodded evenly.\u201cYes.\u201d-Can you hear my voice?\u201cUm. If we\u2019re communicating right now\u2026maybe that is obvious\u201dWhat the hell. Am I really talking to a ghost right now?You would think that an ordinary ghost would be like a monster, picking on everyone because of its grudges in life.But this guy was different. He spoke and acted like a human, only with a blurry body.-Huh, isn\u2019t that weird? I don\u2019t know what to do.The ghost shook his head. It seemed that I wasn\u2019t the only one who couldn\u2019t understand the current situation.-Where are we? It\u2019s as small as a doghouse. Where has that old man Marcus gone and why is there a boy like you in front of me?Only then did I finally understand something that the ghost had said.\u201cUh. By Marcus\u2026do you mean Marcus Calenbury? The Sword Saint?\u201d-Tch-tch. Even a beginner like him can be called a Sword Saint? It\u2019s undeserved.The ghost clicked his tongue as if he heard something unbelievable.-Anyway, the name you called was right. Where is he? He should be around here.I was dumbfounded.\u2018The Sword Saint is a beginner?\u2019The hunter who was currently ranked number one in the world. And since I intended to murder Yoo Soo-ha, maybe he would continue to reign at the very top in the far future.What exactly was this ghost in front of me that called such a big shot, a beginner? And why was I able to suddenly see ghosts?\u201c\u2026\u201dTo answer my questions, I brought up the skill card and read the information.[Sword Constellation]\u2192Rank: A+\u2192Effect:\u2192A ghost from another world.

Seek advice from his rich experience and amazing skills!\u2192However, no one can see the ghost except for the owner.\u2192This skill was copied from Hunter Marcus Calenbury.I was lost for words.-Hey. I said where\u2019s the old man. Are you ignoring me? Tsk. Hey. Hey! I\u2019ve been doing well this past year. It\u2019s rare to find warriors like him, even if he\u2019s only so-so.Oh my God.It seems I copied the Sword Saint\u2019s ghost.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 \u2013 The Monologuing Identity(2)Translator: SevenEditor: Ana_Banana-Can\u2019t you return me to the old man now?Bae Hu-ryeong was raging. It was inhumane for more than a single person to be in the cramped room, though he was a ghost, so he was a blind spot in human rights. Could you take it if you had a 3-meter mosquito buzzing?\u201cAh, really! Even if I wanted to do it, I can\u2019t!\u201d-You copied me with your skill. Then you should be able to cancel it. Don\u2019t you know how to give a refund? Refund! What kind of world is it these days with no refund!\u201cI can\u2019t cancel it!\u201dI\u2019d explained how the skill was copied. But even after hearing the explanation, the ghost still bothered me in vain. Wanting me to send it back to the Sword Saint.-Ugh. Old man Marcus! Disciple! Master Lee has been kidnapped! Your one and only teacher has been kidnapped by a child!Even then, this ghost turned in the air and began to shout.-Geez, you ugly student. This all happened because you ignored your precious Master! I was afraid of this happening, that\u2019s why I told you to treat your teacher like the heavens.\u201cExcuse me\u2026\u201dHe was giving me a hard time. I\u2019d lost the fear of seeing a ghost in real life for the first time. Fear? That was something. No matter how scary it was, it would give anyone a headache if this was how it acted.\u201cLet\u2019s just live quietly, please. Okay?\u201d-What do you mean live? I\u2019m already dead.\u201cAh, then please die quietly.\u201d-No. Do I look like a fucking dog? You\u2019re scolding a ghost that\u2019s already dead and afraid to die another time. Everyone in the neighborhood, look at this bastard! From the beginning, there\u2019s nothing I couldn\u2019t say!\u201cWow.\u201dI opened my mouth in shock. What the?This was my first time seeing a ghost in real life but it talked too much\u2026no it\u2019s the first time seeing someone talk too fucking much.And then I realized. I could understand why the Sword Saint was talking to himself at the bar. That\u2026 Come to think of it, the Sword Saint kept mumbling, but the content that he talked about was pretty monotonous.\u2018Shut up.\u2019\u2018Don\u2019t be so noisy.\u2019\u2018You\u2019re too loud. I\u2019ll take care of it so leave it alone.\u201999% of what he said was about noise.He\u2019d been babbling at the side like he had a mental illness.\u201cThat constant muttering. If it was a ghost-like this\u2026\u201d-Huh? What the. Did you just talk to me? At your age. You dare to speak up to me?\u201cDamn it.\u201dMy shoulders sagged subconsciously. My future looked bleak.\u201cI\u2019ll have to avoid the Sword Saint for the rest of my life. No matter what skill I got, I didn\u2019t expect a ghost to come out.\u201d-Huh? I have to live away from that old man. What kind of bullshit is that?Bae Hu-ryeong shook his head.-Where\u2019s a hunter as good as old man Marcus? He\u2019s my disciple, but he\u2019s still a good old man. Oh, but never talk about his grandkids. He\u2019s usually pretty nice, but when it comes to his grandkids, he gets crazy.\u201cI already know that.\u201dI sighed.\u201cThere is a skill that the Sword Saint has. What is it called? The one that tells the number of people a person has killed.\u201d-Ah. Detective\u2019s Insight? It\u2019s a fucking crap skill.Bae Hu-ryeong responded quite quickly indeed. So that was the name of the kill counting skill? [Detective\u2019s Insight]? The ghost seemed to know all of the Sword Saint\u2019s skills.-What about it? It\u2019s only useful to find out if someone is an assassin or not. Besides, there\u2019s no guarantee that someone is an assassin simply because they killed a lot of people.\u201cThe number is 4091.\u201d-Huh?\u201cThe kill count floating above my head. The number is 4091.\u201dBae Hu-ryeong looked dumbfounded. He frowned. Somehow, the facial expressions of this ghost was better than many living people.-What. This guy. Are you crazy?\u201cI think I will really be crazy if I have to spend one more day with you. You\u2019re so noisy.\u201d-No\u2026you\u2019re a complete beginner.Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s facial expression became serious.-A beginner among beginners. Looking at you, I don\u2019t get it. How does a guy like you kill 4091 people? I couldn\u2019t have done that even while reaching the 99th floor in my lifetime.\u201cThat\u2019s because I didn\u2019t kill 4091 people.\u201d-Ha?I shrugged and began to explain.\u201cThis is what happened. The only person I really murdered was a really bad guy who would later be known as the Flame Emperor\u2026\u201dThat I was murdered by the Flame Emperor. That luck allowed me to copy his regression skill. That if I stayed there, there would be no hope for revenge. That I made a decision to go back over 4000 days.-\u2026What?Bae Hu-ryeong who was listening, had his mouth wide open.-You committed suicide more than 4000 times? Just to get revenge on the Flame Emperor?\u201cYes.\u201d-\u2026\u2026Bae Hu-ryeong became silent. He had looked dumbfounded at first, but now his expression changed. He looked straight at my face with eyes that seemed to be struggling with something. He was so serious that I wondered if he was the same ghost that was just making a fuss in my 2 pyung room.-Hey.After a long period of silence, Bae Hu-ryeong opened his mouth.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d-What is your name?\u201cI\u2019m Kim Gong-ja.\u201dBae Hu-ryeong let out a groan.-Why did you choose the old man?\u201cYes?\u201d-After you got revenge on that Flame Emperor guy, why did you decide to copy a skill from the old man?\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201dI felt uneasy. I couldn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d asked that question.\u201cHe is the hunter ranked 1st in this era. He\u2019s the strongest so he must have strong skills.\u201d-That way, you\u2019ll get stronger faster?\u201cYes.\u201d-\u2026You can honestly answer my questions as there is no fear of the information leaking anyway. It says on the skill card that no one else but you can see me. It\u2019s totally safe, is it not?\u201cWhat? Absolutely.\u201dSilence fell in the room once again.-Hmmm.Floating, Bae Hu-ryeong wandered through the air around me. He came to the left and stared at my face, then to my right and measured my height. All of it with a serious expression.I frowned, it felt like he wanted to do something weird.-Let\u2019s see. Um. The physique wouldn\u2019t be too bad once it\u2019s refined. The willpower is amazing. Sense of improvement is moderate. Knows how to keep his sanity but is still unpredictable\u2026 Ahem, indeed. Um. If it\u2019s this much\u2026Bae Hu-ryeong kept muttering to himself.\u2018What is he talking about now?\u2019From what I\u2019d heard, this ghost seemed to be the Sword Saint\u2019s master. And now this master was talking to himself while moving side to side.-Hey, Kim Gong-ja.Suddenly Bae Hu-ryeong flew to my face and called my name.\u201cYes?\u201d-Show me how you hunt monsters.So I hunted a few mobs.\u201cAre you satisfied?\u201dI didn\u2019t have anything to do in my room anyway. As soon as dawn came, I headed to the hunting ground. Actually, since I\u2019d died to the Sword Saint and returned to the day before, it meant I had to kill Yoo Soo-ha one more time. So it was necessary to go out anyway.-As expected\u2026Bae Hu-ryeong nodded.-My expectations were indeed correct.\u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d-Well. In my past life, I was called Sword Emperor(\u528d\u5e1d).As dawn broke, Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s voice seemed to echo across the hunting ground.-My hometown is not here. You can think of it as a different world. Anyway, just like it did here, the tower appeared in my hometown, and I conquered faster than any other hunter there.\u201cI was wondering what you were doing, turns out you were bragging about yourself.\u201d-Well.Bae Hu-ryeong snickered.-So what. Eventually, our world failed to clear the 100th floor. This was written on your skill card right?[Sword Constellation]-Rank: A+-Effect:>A ghost from another world. Cleared the 99th floor but failed the 100th floor and died. The resentment remained, causing him to become a ghost. He cannot interfere with the physical world, but it is possible to tamper with the owner\u2019s mind. Seek advice from his rich experience and amazing skills!>However no one can see the ghost except for the owner.>This skill was copied from Hunter Marcus Calenbury.Come to think of it, it was pretty amazing.Before I\u2019d returned, the Flame Emperor had only broken through the 40th floor and was considered a legend. What about the 99th floor? The ghost before me was truly incredible.-I can tell if you\u2019re good or not. How talented a hunter is. I can tell immediately. That\u2019s why I asked you, Kim Gong-ja to show me how you hunt monsters.\u201cAha.\u201dI laughed bitterly.\u201cAre you trying to see if I have talent for swordsmanship?\u201dWhy. There are many stories like this. A story where the main character lives without realizing their talent then they suddenly fall down a cliff or meet a great master and awaken their true power. A meeting of fate(\u5947\u7de3).\u201cTut. You worked in vain.\u201d (TL: Tut is like the sound made by clicking your tongue.)Unfortunately, such luck didn\u2019t come to me.\u201cI don\u2019t have any talent for combat. It\u2019s all luck of the draw. But now when I die, I can at least copy the skills of other hunters. If I had talent I would\u2019ve been out of the F class long ago. Why would I want to live like that?\u201dBae Hu-ryeong frowned.-What are you talking about? You\u2019re talented.\u201cYeah?\u201d-Tremendously so.Huh. That wasn\u2019t the response I\u2019d expected.\u201cHey, jokes too. Are you making fun of me?\u201d-I\u2019m not joking.Bae Hu-ryeong quietly shook his head.-Of course, you have no martial arts talent. Your coordination is poor. Your physique is lackluster and it would take a long time to learn to use aura. But regardless of that, you have a very rare talent.\u00a0(TL: This was so harsh, I cringed, poor Gong-ja)Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s eyes became serious.-You\u2019re not afraid of death.\u201c\u2026\u201d-You just don\u2019t have it. Surprisingly, nothing at all.Bae Hu-ryeong stroked his chin.-Probably, after dying over 4000 times, the fear of death disappeared without you knowing. This is also what I expected. You don\u2019t realise it, but you\u2019re completely reckless when you face monsters. People usually hesitate a little because they\u2019re afraid of dying or getting hurt, but you don\u2019t have that.\u201cUh. Is that a talent?\u201d-Of course.I got an immediate answer.-Innate talents are not the only type of talent. People can awaken talents one by one in their lives. The most difficult of these, is the talent to overcome the fear of death. But you have already learned the most difficult thing.\u201c\u2026\u201d-It\u2019s awesome.I was a bit embarrassed.So far, no one had ever talked to me like this. (TL: Awwww Gong-ja is getting shy) I had never thought of myself in this way either. It was just because I\u2019d been treated like a worm by the Flame Emperor so\u2026I was so angry that I surpassed 4000 deaths. (TL: I think he should get to 5000 deaths, it\u2019s a whole number after all, who agrees?)Dying.That was my talent.-I just have one question.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d-When old man Marcus killed you. What were you thinking then?I recalled what had happened in my last death. Only a few hours had passed, so I was able to vividly recall the memories and my emotions. (TL:I can\u2019t even remember how I felt 10 minutes ago\u2026\u3160\u3160)The night sky, the moon and the wind that was blowing so quietly that no sound could be heard.\u201c\u2026I thought it was beautiful.\u201dIt was then.-Hahahahaha!Bae Hu-ryeong raised his head and laughed heartily. The sound of the laughter was magnificent and it spread through the empty plains.-That was funny.Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s eyes twinkled as he looked toward me.-You don\u2019t rob skills, you just copy them. In other words [Another Me] is still attached to old man Marcus. The old man and you. I wonder which of you will be the greater hunter? I\u2019m a bit curious.\u201c\u2026\u201d-I\u2019ll help you.Sword Constellation. The ghost that once conquered 99 floors in the tower and was known by the name Sword Emperor, looked directly at me.-To the extent that you can get rid of old man Marcus. No, to be much stronger than that old man!Then he reached out his hand.-Let\u2019s conquer the tower.It was the moment my partner was born.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Wake up quickly!\u201cAh, for christ\u2019s sake, a little mo\u2026\u201d-If you don\u2019t wake up right now, I\u2019ll start singing a song I love from my hometown. Did you know that I learned music all my life? When I sang a song, over thirty people broke down in tears!Not at all. The worst situation was when there was a ghost fluttering around your home.-Look at the time and you\u2019re still in bed!\u201cWhat time is it?\u201dI cracked my eyes open and looked at my smartphone.On the lock screen, 4:01am was written in a nice font.\u201cIt\u2019s only 4 o\u2019clock in the morning you crazy bastard!\u201d-Uh huh. Four o\u2019clock in the morning is when the worms wake up and begin to move. You\u2019re weaker than a worm so you should wake up earlier.\u201cI guess you were just bored because you can\u2019t sleep.\u201d-I don\u2019t know what you mean.Bae Hu-ryeong looked away as if he\u2019d been caught.\u201cWow. I always wondered why the Sword Saint woke up at 4am to practice. It wasn\u2019t because he was hardworking, it was because you were too noisy!\u201d-Fine. I was bored alone and woke you up. Better? Thanks to that, if you get up and practice now, it\u2019s for your benefit. Come on, bow down and thank me.\u201cKi-, I want to kill\u2026\u201d-Huhu. I\u2019m already dead so you can\u2019t kill me.

Your name should be Kim Zom-bie not Kim Gong-ja.\u201cDamn it.\u201dI came out of the apartment dressed in sportswear. In the 2 pyung room, the ghost chattered without rest and I really couldn\u2019t take it anymore. For the sake of my mental health, I left my home and started jogging under the dark morning sky.\u201cHuk, huk\u2026\u201d-Zombie Kim. I\u2019ll repeat, you really don\u2019t have any talent outside of your willpower.Bae Hu-ryeong floated and caught up to me.-I usually prefer to teach from the bottom up. But you don\u2019t even have a bottom. Should I say you\u2019re the bottom of the bottom?It has been three days since I copied the skill [Sword Constellation] from the Sword Saint. In that time I killed Yoo Soo-ha once more, and avoided meeting the Sword Saint. Now, I was training according to a schedule that Bae Hu-ryeong had made himself.-In terms of talent, you have what we should call the abyss talent. Kuh. So cool! I\u2019m jealous!\u201cHuk\u2026when people are running, you shouldn\u2019t interrupt them\u2026hoo. Let\u2019s go..!\u201d (TL: the \u2018huk\u2019s and \u2018hoo\u2019s are basically him panting)-What? The bottom line is, you need special tutoring. And in order to receive special tutoring, you have to pay an expensive tuition.Bae Hu-ryeong laughed.-You\u2019re going to get a lottery ticket, Zombie.\u2026There is a guild called Sangryun.The common name for it was the Merchant\u2019s Union. The leader was the third ranked hunter who was commonly known as \u2018Count\u2019.As mentioned before, Count is the only player who could send and receive things from the outside world. He was like a one-man company. Thanks to this ability, the Sangryun Guild basically controlled the economy in the tower.What that meant was.\u201cExcuse me.\u201d\u201cYes, guest. How may I help you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to receive my winnings for the lottery.\u201dOn the first floor, the Sangryun Guild in the city of Babylon was the only one who issued lottery tickets.\u201cAh. Your lottery ticket won?!\u201d\u201cYes that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cCongratulations!\u201dThe clerk who was wearing cat ears bowed toward him, a sunny smile across their face being a bonus.-Hey, whenever I see this clerk I get curious about why they\u2019re wearing cat ears.\u2018The head of Sangryun likes cats.\u2019-No matter how good a cat is, do you need to make a normal person wear cat ears? He\u2019s just a perverted bastard. I can guarantee it.\u2018Is that even important right now?\u2019Of course the clerk didn\u2019t wear the cat ears because they wanted to. They simply didn\u2019t have a choice. Be it cat ears or a cockroach\u2019s antennae, if the guildmaster told them to wear it, they had to do so.Oh, for reference, this clerk was a man. The uniform was just unisex\u2026\u201cExcuse me guest but have you confirmed the date? I\u2019m sorry but you can\u2019t win the prize if the ticket was purchased long before.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine. It\u2019s a ticket from last week.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201dIt was a lottery ticket that I\u2019d bought right after my discussion with Bae Hu-ryeong. It was because I intended to win the lottery once anyway, and Bae Hu-ryeong had passionately shouted, \u2018You need the capital!\u2019.\u201cThen we will begin the identification and verification process. Ah, if I may ask, what place did you win?\u201d\u201cFirst place.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dThe clerk asked reflexively.\u201cI got first place.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHere, please check the number.\u201dAbove the head of the clerk hung a billboard. On the billboard the words [The 1st Prize for the Sangryun Happiness Lottery.] was written, followed by the amount of money that was displayed on slots like a slot machine in a casino.53,000 gold. If I was to use the currency from my hometown, it would be 5.5 billion won.-Hey, it\u2019s so easy to make money isn\u2019t it?The humming voice of Bae Hu-ryeong filled the suddenly quiet hall area.Wearing an embarrassed look, the clerk suddenly said.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve checked the number. No-, now please wait a minute customer while I call for my manager to take over.\u201d\u201cYeah, take your time.\u201dThe clerk hurried away into the main area of the building. I could feel people peeking at me and gossiping. Talking about my win of the first prize and expressing their envy.-Will you be okay Zombie? Won\u2019t you get stabbed in a dark alley?\u201cI have an idea.\u201dI shrugged my shoulders.\u201cHiding it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019ll be hidden.\u201dAll the hunters who won the lottery were recorded. The same was true even for the Flame Emperor. So everyone could see that he won the first place twice in a row.\u2018If it\u2019s going to be known anyway, it was better to do it openly.\u2019When I won the lottery I was immediately assassinated.\u00a0If such a rumor was to spread the one who would be affected more would be the ones who organized the lottery in the first place. (TL: I think the person who got assassinated would be the most affected\u2026but those are just my thoughts)After a while.\u201cYou\u2019ve been waiting for a long time Mr. Kim Gong-ja. My name is Arthur Taylor.\u201dA man who was dressed more professionally than the previous receptionist appeared and bowed slightly to me. His greeting was very polite. However something that didn\u2019t change was the fact that he also wore cat ears on his head.\u201cCall me \u2018Vault Keeper\u2019 and I would appreciate it if you spoke to me comfortably.\u201d (TL: In Korean there are different levels of politeness depending on your standing and familiarity with the person you\u2019re speaking to, he\u2019s basically saying \u2018you don\u2019t need to be too polite\u2019)\u201cI\u2019m Kim Gong-ja and that\u2019s a pretty interesting name.\u201d\u201cHaha! I often hear those words. Then let\u2019s go upstairs.\u201dThe Vault Keeper smiled brightly.No matter how you looked at him, this man was a hunter who was at least in the top 300. But although I was only an F class hunter who could only look up to him, the Vault Keeper remained very polite to me.-That\u2019s how 50,000 gold customers are treated of course.The ghost made himself known once again.-Hey Zombie, do you know what I\u2019ve been thinking about? I think you\u2019re too easily flattered because you\u2019ve never been treated well before. A few days ago when I complimented your talent for dying, you looked so moved. I feel so sorry for you.\u00a0(TL: Oof so savage\u2026)\u2018Ah. Shut up, please, just a bit.\u2019-Men shouldn\u2019t be that easy, man. Be like me. You gotta believe that everything in the world is simply for your benefit.No matter how I thought about it, Yoo Soo-ha and Bae Hu-ryeong were very similar. They even had similar nicknames. One was the Flame Emperor and the other was the Sword Emperor. Perhaps all the people who were called \u2018Emperor\u2019 were psychopaths.\u201cAh, Mr. Kim Gong-ja. I\u2019m sorry, is there something wrong..?\u201dThe Vault Keeper asked while guiding me up the stairs. He seemed to be afraid that he\u2019d done something wrong.I hurriedly replied so that I didn\u2019t look crazy.\u201cAh, no. I was thinking about something.\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m glad.\u201dThe Vault Keeper sighed in relief.\u201cYour expression wasn\u2019t too good so I thought I\u2019d been rude without my knowledge. Haha. When you said no, I felt so relieved\u2026\u201dWhat the. This person\u2026is he an angel?-Tch. So easy, it\u2019s so easy.I ignored the nagging psychotic ghost behind me. We entered a VIP reception room.The gold coins were already piled upon the table of the reception room and it seemed that a clerk had come and prepared it in advance.The Vault Keeper smiled again.\u201cThis is all the coins that customer Kim Gong-ja has won.\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s amazing.\u201dOver 50,000 coins!The room was bright and it illuminated all the coins at once. Just looking at them made my heart swell. A feeling was overflowing within me, though I couldn\u2019t really describe what it was. (TL: is\u2026is this love?)\u201cYou can take all of these gold coins, or you can purchase a personal vault from us for safekeeping. What would you like to do?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dI tried to gather my thoughts.\u2018As expected, the magical power of money was great.\u2019Frankly speaking, my mouth was watering. But my goal was to stand on top. To be a handsome hunter who was the envy of everyone. Money was just a means to reach that goal. (TL: that\u2019s right gong-ja! ganbatte!)\u2018To be a man who controlled money, not a man controlled by money Kim Gong-ja.\u2019Regaining my calm, I nodded slowly.\u201cI\u2019ll keep it in a deposit box.\u201d\u201cAh. That\u2019s a very wise choice customer!\u201dThe Vault Keeper was delighted.\u201cI always personally suggest this for the winners. I understand wanting to hold all your wealth in your hands, but I always strongly recommend getting a safety deposit box. After all there are many people who have bad intentions\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd.\u201dI opened my mouth again.\u201cI would like to purchase the status of an honorary member of the Sangryun Guild.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThe cost of purchasing an honorary membership is 10,000 gold coins, isn\u2019t it?\u201dI approached the table and rested my hand on the stacks of gold coins.Gold. The color that dazzled the eyes of man. But I already knew a gold that would be even more enchanting, my future. For that future, I\u2019d have to invest these gold coins without restraint.\u201cI\u2019ll buy it in a one time payment.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe Vault Keeper studied my face for a moment.\u201cCustomer Kim Gong-ja\u2026you haven\u2019t joined any other guild right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dGuild.A hunter guild wasn\u2019t simply for socializing. The greatest significance was instead the [Protection] given by the guild.Even if it was the Hunter Bureau or a vigilante\u2026\u2018I might get attacked before I could even say anything.\u2019I could tell from the way the Flame Emperor and the Sword Saint had killed me.Lawlessness. Compared to the world outside, this place was much more brutal.\u2018I shouldn\u2019t foolishly follow the footsteps of the Flame Emperor.\u2019The Flame Emperor had preferred to move alone. After winning the lottery twice, he wouldn\u2019t have had any protection. It must\u2019ve been a hard and exciting life because many people were after that money.\u2018That\u2019s why he was poisoned and assassinated later on.\u2019It was very pathetic. Why was there a need to compete with the big guilds?\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dThe Vault Keeper took out a notebook and began to scribble something.\u201cAnyone can become an honorary member of our guild for a fixed price. I\u2019ll have an employee immediately come and issue you a second-class honorary membership card.\u201d\u201cAh. Oh yeah, and.\u201dI added a bit more.\u201cI live in a small, cheap apartment right now. I would be really grateful if Sangryun could recommend a place for me to stay. Of course, I\u2019m willing to pay the necessary price.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIn addition, you\u2019ll probably announce the first place winner in the newspaper. At that time, even if you reveal my name, please ensure that they also report my status as an honorary member of the Sangryun Guild.\u201dThe Vault Keeper wrote all the things I requested in his notebook with a blank expression on his face.(TL: I bet he\u2019s regretting being so polite now hehe)\u201cYou are quite thorough, customer.\u201d\u201cUgh. With the world as it is nowadays? I need to be prepared for anything.\u201d\u201c\u2026you\u2019re absolutely right.\u201dBehind the Vault Keeper, Bae Hu-ryeong was holding his stomach and laughing boisterously.-Hey. This expression of his as he\u2019s being treated like this by a pushover. It\u2019s so sweet. This is why I love making fun of the elite.\u2018No. You were the one who said I was easy. What\u2019s the big deal?\u2019-I did? I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t quite remember so maybe it didn\u2019t happen.Oh my God. Even if he had to be disgusting, he didn\u2019t need to be this disgusting.-Anyway, you\u2019re doing a good job on your own.Bae Hu-ryeong kept laughing.-I was worried that I\u2019d have to clean your diaper and wipe your ass like a baby. But from seeing this, I think you\u2019ll be fine.\u2018If you don\u2019t talk, no one would hate you.\u2019-Boy, you seem to be in a good mood.That was right. My mouth was grumbling but my heart was happy.\u2018Absolutely. It starts from now on.\u20194000 deaths to return 4000 days. This was an ability of the regression skill that the Flame Emperor didn\u2019t take advantage of.Now, it was my time to enjoy it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 \u2013 Solo Start (2)Translator: HHHey, Zombie. Do you know what\u2019s most important when being tutored?\u201cI\u2019d like you to first stop calling me Zombie.\u201d-It\u2019s the tutoring fee.We finished our business in the Sangryun headquarters and left. It was right in the middle of the day, and the streets were bustling. Retired hunters were busily serving customers in restaurants and cafes.There were a lot of completely empty stores among them as well. The owners of the stores were sitting blankly with their mouths gaped open. People who succeeded would succeed, and those who didn\u2019t would not. It was cruel, but it was the unchangeable fact of both Babylon and the outside world.\u2013And you just got the tutoring fee. Let\u2019s see, so what\u2019s next?\u201cMm. A good tutor?\u201d\u2013Nope. There\u2019s already one in front of you.Bae Hu-ryeong spoke shamelessly. Without even the slightest change in his expression.\u2013A good reference book! You need a textbook that\u2019ll help you grow faster.\u201cA textbook\u2026\u201d\u2013Yeah. Like a skill tome or an elixir. But there\u2019s no way you\u2019ll understand a skill tome even if you get one, k? So the only answer is to get those fucking expensive elixirs.This guy said the right things in such a rude way.\u2013Also, I don\u2019t deal with cheapo elixirs. Why, was it the Alchemy Castle? There was a guild that doctors and pharmacists were registered in. Get the elixirs made only by their skilled masters.\u201cEk.\u201d\u2013I know where the store is, so don\u2019t worry. There\u2019s something that grandpops Marcus used to go. If we get all the elixirs there\u2026\u201cW, Wait a minute.\u201d\u2013Hm? Why?I lowered my voice because some people were walking by me.\u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t those elixirs ridiculously expensive?\u2013Of course they\u2019re ridiculously expensive. If you hear the price, your jaw will drop.Bae Hu-ryeong snickered.\u2013Should I tell you how much it is?\u201cLet\u2019s hear it.\u201dHe whispered in my ear. My eyes widened after hearing the price. It was an astronomical amount.\u201cEven if I pour everything I have, I only get 4?!\u201d\u2013Heehee. If we buy it in bulk we can get a discount and get 5. They know how to run a business. This is why doctors who know the taste of money are the scariest.\u201cI, It\u2019s too expensive\u2026\u201dGoodness. I would become poor again. I thought I would be able to live comfortably since I got the 1st place lottery ticket.\u2013Well. What can you do about it? It\u2019s because you lack skills. Just think of it all as your fate\u2026humph!Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s face hardened.\u2013Gong-ja. Hide.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u2013Quickly.His voice turned serious. I found myself behind a trash can at his words. It was a trash can that a restaurant used to throw away food waste. I crinkled my nose.\u201cWhy are you telling me to hide suddenly?\u201d\u2013Be careful. It\u2019s grandpops Marcus.\u201c\u2026\u201dI held my breath. Carefully, I peeked above the trashcan to see the street. An old man with tied back white hair, the current world Rank 1 with the Detective\u2019s Insight, Sword Saint, was walking far away.\u2018If I get caught it\u2019ll suck.\u2019My heart pounded. Was it because my nervousness was delivered. Too much talker Bae Hu-ryeong shut his mouth for a while. Both of us hid behind the trash can holding our breaths, looking at Sword Saint.\u201c\u2026Again\u2026shut up\u2026\u201dThankfully, he didn\u2019t seem to have noticed us. He muttered to himself like always and headed somewhere.\u2013Sheesh.Bae Hu-ryeong grimaced seeing Sword Saint enter some building.\u2013Tsk! That\u2019s the best shop.\u201cThe best shop?\u201d\u2013Elixirs, I\u2019m talking about elixirs. The best creator set up their shop there. Ugh, seriously! Everyone else is just a drug dealer. We have to buy it there\u2026!Bae Hu-ryeong tapped his feet. This was the first time I saw this ghost actually mad. I was lost in thought next to him.\u2018Using the same store as Sword Saint is too dangerous. But, a good store for elixirs\u2026\u2019I searched for the top rankers on my phone. There was a list starting from first place.+Rank 1. Sword Saint / Affiliation: NoneRank 2. Black Dragon Witch / Affiliation: Black Dragon (Guild Master)Rank 3. Count / Affiliation: Merchant\u2019s Union (Guild Master)Rank 4. Heretic Questioner / Affiliation: Ten Thousand Temple (Guild Master)Rank 5. Venomous Snake / Affiliation: Chen Mu-mun (Guild Master)Rank 6. Babel\u2019s Linguist / Affiliation: Manhak (Vice Guild Master)Rank 7. Kwangyeok Messenger / Affiliation: Golden Newspaper (Vice Guild Master)Rank 8. Crusader / Affiliation: Civil Militia (Vice Guild Master)...+\u201cIt\u2019s not here.\u201dI muttered to myself. Bae Hu-reyong reacted to my words.\u2013Hm? What\u2019s not here? Your luck?\u201cNo. The opposite, actually.\u201dI was overflowing with luck.\u201cIt might not cost as much as I thought.\u201d\u2013What?\u201cWe\u2019ll only have to spend a penny to get the best elixir.\u201dI grinned.\u201cCause I know a really good pharmacist.\u201dWe entered a dark alley.It was a poor neighborhood. People here had to live here because they couldn\u2019t earn money. It was a harlem neighborhood. The hunters looking our way had abnormal gazes in their eyes.\u2013\u2026There\u2019s a skilled pharmacist here?Bae Hu-ryeong complained, like he didn\u2019t believe it.\u201cIt\u2019s not a skilled pharmacist, but the best pharmacist in history.\u201d\u2013Take it easy with your lies. Why would someone like that stay here?\u201cAh, don\u2019t believe me if you don\u2019t want to.\u201dI heard someone clicking their tongue from some corner. It seemed like the hunters looking our way had turned away. They probably thought I was a psycho seeing me talk to myself. Even though people in this harlem were the worst, they didn\u2019t touch mental patients. I smirked to myself.\u2018What\u2019s gonna happen if they know my wallet\u2019s filled with gold coins?\u2019It was obvious. They would run at me like wolves.Of course, I didn\u2019t plan on telling my wallet\u2019s business to others. Smelling the scent of rotting corpses, I entered deeper into the alley. It was then that I heard the sound of something ripping.\u201cP, Please, just don\u2019t touch my experiment materials!\u201dA young voice.After that, someone spoke in a rough tone.\u201cYou\u2019ve done this more than once now? What kind of bullshit are you spitting out!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already half a year since the due date. You have to pay the price now.\u201dI headed towards where I heard the voices. In the middle of the twisted streets, there was a empty store set up. It was where the people were fighting.\u201cUt. I, If you take all the tools\u2026I really can\u2019t make a living\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, there\u2019s nothing to see anymore. Take everything!\u201dGangsters with good bodies got machines onto their rearcars. A young woman looking to be in her mid 20s grabbed onto them to plead.\u201cOne week! Please just give me one more week. No, 5 more days\u2026\u201d\u201cThat one week became one month and that month became half a year now!\u201dAs the gangsters drove away, the store owner collapsed to the floor without being able to protest. She held her hand out to the rearcars even when her knees were being scratched.\u201cThere\u2019s\u2026there\u2019s still incomplete liquid medicine\u2026!\u201d\u201cUgh. Why did we get caught by this crazy pharmacist. Lady! I\u2019m advising you, but don\u2019t ever make medicines again!\u201dThe rearacars creaked and disappeared into the streets. Only the despairing woman on her knees was left.Including me, all the other neighborhood people had come out to watch. They whispered amongst themselves.\u201cTsk tsk. I thought that store would fail.\u201d\u201cThe medicine is too expensive. Why is a single health potion 40 Gold?\u201d\u201cShe thought business was easy because she\u2019s young\u2026\u201dPerhaps she had heard the whispers of the onlookers. The despairing store owner whipped her head towards them.\u201cE, Expensive? I only sell it at the original price!\u201dShe looked quite pitiful. Her hair was stuck to her head like she hadn\u2019t washed it in days. The glasses on her face looked like antiques. Even her voice was cracky.\u201cOnly our store sells these kinds of medicines at this price in Babylon! Y, You should actually be grateful that I set up my store here! Yeah!\u201d\u201cAw, she\u2019s still not living in reality.\u201d\u201cSheesh. Does she think she\u2019s better to say that\u2026\u201dThe onlookers shook their heads and the crowd dispersed.The store owner who looked like no one would like her was still there.\u201cOh\u2026W, Wait. Since you\u2019re all here, how about a bottle of health potion\u2026With my special potion, even an almost dead hunter can flop back to life.\u201d\u201cI. I won\u2019t buy it, I won\u2019t.!\u201dShe tried to grab onto the onlookers, but it was too late. The water was already spilled. They cursed and disappeared.\u201cIt has really good effects\u2026it\u2019s not a lie\u2026\u201dShe plopped on the ground.\u2013Hey.Bae Hu-ryeong muttered after seeing that unpleasant scene.\u2013Is the \u2018historical pharmacist\u2019 you talked about\u2026that loser?\u201cWhat are you going to do if it is?\u2013I\u2019m going to sincerely worry about your welfare. Thinking, ah, this kid\u2019s brain must\u2019ve gone weird after dying 4000 times. And then I\u2019ll introduce you to the best therapist in Babylon.I snorted.\u201cYou should\u2019ve worried about my welfare when I started to see ghosts. That owner is definitely the historical pharmacist, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u2013That\u2019s not a historial pharmacist, that\u2019s a historical loser! You crazy bastard!Bae Hu-ryeong spoke loudly but I ignored him. I walked towards the owner who was sitting on the floor.\u201cExcuse me.\u201d\u201cUuh..?\u201dShe looked up at me. She looked even more pathetic up close. Her clothes were all too long for her. But since she was wearing a white coat, you could tell she was a pharmacist and not a beggar.\u201cStore owner-nim. You\u2019re still selling, right?\u201d [TN:Store owner-nim is a way to address store owners respectfully in Korean.]Of course, this person wasn\u2019t a beggar. She wasn\u2019t an ordinary pharmacist either.\u201cIf you\u2019re still selling, there\u2019s something I want to order.\u201dLord of Alchemy Castle.She was a pharmacist who would rise to Rank 5 status in the future.Right now, she was outside of the rankings, but she would definitely succeed.\u201cIt\u2019s alright if it\u2019s a bit expensive.\u201d\u201cAh, yes. Yes! Of course! I can make you anything!\u201dThe color came back to her face. Her store had been on the brink of going bankrupt, but there was a customer saying they would buy expensive medicine.\u201cUh, but how expensive are you talking about\u2026?\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dIn the future, she was a pharmacist that I couldn\u2019t even think about buying from, but this time was different.\u201cI want to buy about 20,000 Gold worth.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe dropped her mouth open.So what if she looked pathetic. To me, she looked like a goose that laid golden eggs. And 100% percent pure gold ones at that!I smiled.\u201cWhat are you doing? You need to take the order, Store owner-nim.\u201dI would be your sickening regular now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 \u2013 Solo Start (3)Translator: HH\u201cI, It\u2019s a bit shabby but\u2026please come in.\u201dThe pharmacist shuffled her feet. The store was messy like a tornado had passed through it.\u201cIt\u2019s really shabby but\u2026\u201dShe wasn\u2019t over exaggerating.There were broken glass bottles all over the floor. Shelves were on their backs, and the books had all fallen out. The dust floating around was a bonus.It was a wreck.-Wow.Bae Hu-ryeong exclaimed.\u2013When I was alive, I used to hear that I was untidy, but this is way above my level. Their cleanliness sure is trustworthy. Hey, do you really want to eat the elixirs this lady makes?\u201cUm. Are you really going to order 20,000 Gold worth items from me\u2026?\u201dBae Hu-ryeong and the pharmacist asked me at the same time, like they had planned it.I smiled bitterly.\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, should I pay in advance?\u201d\u201cY, You don\u2019t need to go that f\u2026\u201dShe waved her hand around and paused.\u201c\u2026No. Actually, if it\u2019s possible, advance payment it is.\u201dHer face was completely red. She was embarrassed at herself for saying this. But this was how bad her situation was.\u201cTake as much as you need from my safe. I\u2019ll tell Sangryun in advance.\u201d\u201cAs much as I need\u2026\u201dShe blankly mumbled.\u201cYes. But my wealth isn\u2019t limitless. I\u2019ll be grateful if you keep it under 20,000 Gold.\u201d\u201cW, What kind of medicine are you\u2026?\u201dWas she scared because of the amount of money? She was happy, but also seemed anxious at the same time.\u201cPardon me, but I can\u2019t make drugs. Because of my beliefs, making drugs is really\u2026If you came to order drugs, I, I\u2019ll refuse\u2026\u201d\u201cOho.\u201dI thought to myself.\u2018She\u2019s someone who fits the title of Alchemy Master well.\u2019There weren\u2019t a lot of people who could refuse thousands of Gold that was right in front of them. Especially if they were about to go bankrupt. But she firmly said she wouldn\u2019t make drugs.This pharmacist looked weak outside but was actually quite strong inside.\u201cHaa. They\u2019re definitely not drugs, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026t, then that\u2019s a relief. Specifically, which medicines are you looking for?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dI looked at Bae Hu-ryeong. His mouth had been shut since we entered the shop like he didn\u2019t like something. He sighed after looking at me.\u2013Haa. Well, fine. She doesn\u2019t look like a skilled child, but I\u2019ll tell you the recipe.He should\u2019ve said it earlier if he was going to come out like this.\u2013Listen. Bunny pig\u2019s liver and a balloon cat\u2019s eyes, and the shedding of a desert worm\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll let you know from now. Bunny pig\u2019s liver, balloon cat\u2019s eyes, and\u2026\u201dI delivered Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s recipe to her.\u201cAh. Please wait a moment! I, I\u2019ll write it down!\u201dShe frantically wrote it down. There were about 23 different materials. As the recipe got longer, her face turned more serious.\u2013Well. This is enough for the recipe. How it\u2019s made depends on the skills of the pharmacist.\u201cThis is enough for the recipe.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShe quietly looked at her notebook, biting the back of her hand.\u201cIf these are combined\u2026it\u2019s something that intensifies reflexes. Not something that relaxes, but stimulates. No, I guess it\u2019s more of an awakening.\u201d\u2013Huh?Bae Hu-ryeong looked at the pharmacist.The pharmacist continued to speak.\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely complex combination. Ah, it might just be my mistake\u2026but you would like these to be made not with dried or frozen materials, but with the most fresh materials, right?\u201d\u2013Yes, that\u2019s true but\u2026I nodded my head.\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d\u201cI knew it! Usually, there\u2019s a minute amount of poison in the desert worm\u2019s shedding. One of the ways to lessen this effect is to use the bunny pig\u2019s liver, but this has to be\u2026!She excitedly spoke. The stuttering lady in front of me disappeared, and was replaced with a chatterbox. Yeah. There were people like this in the world.\u2018Her method is wrong, but she\u2019s a skilled person.\u2019Someone who ran into the subject that they liked at full speed and achieved great results. I didn\u2019t dislike experts like this.\u201cIn how many days can you have it ready?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dThe conversation that seemed like it had no end got cut off. She blinked like she came to attention. It was like she had fallen into her own little world when she was speaking.\u201cS, Sorry! I saw a pretty combination like this for the first time in a while and\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. So how long will it take?\u201d\u201cIf the money is enough\u2026I, I can have it ready in 4 days. I would usually be able to get it to you faster, but I have to get new tools\u2026\u201d4 days.\u201cI can wait that long.\u201dBefore I regressed, it took about 1 year to be able to get medicine from this person. 4 days was nothing compared to that.\u2013Hey. I still can\u2019t approve.Bae Hu-ryeong continued to complain when we left the store.-There\u2019s a lot of people who only know how to speak like experts. Those kinds of people end up being drug dealers. Ugh. We\u2019re gonna waste money!\u201cSo where did you learn that recipe?\u201d-It\u2019s a combination I made myself. The best elixir that I made after drinking countless poisons myself. It\u2019s a precious elixir that you can\u2019t drink in your world even if you want to!I grinned.\u201cThe pharmacist said it was an extremely high-level combination.\u201d-\u2026\u201cShe\u2019s able to tell the true worth just with a glance, so just trust her. Even if she looks like that right now, she is going to be in the highest position of Alchemy Castle 10 years later.\u201dBae Hu-ryeong shut his mouth.-You just cursed me in your mind, huh?\u201cThis ghost is trying to hurt an innocent person now.\u201dI pretended not to know what he was talking about. He was uselessly too quick for his own good.4 days quickly passed.During that time, the pharmacist continued to take away money from my safe. Someone came from Sangryung to ask if it was really alright, but I told them to let her be. Even if it cost a lot of money, if it was for medicine made by the Lord of Alchemy Castle, it was nothing.\u2013Zombie. Wanna bet?\u201cGeez, what this time.\u201d-That lady\u2019s gonna run away with the money. I guarantee it. I don\u2019t know about anything else, but my eyes can tell what kind of person someone is. That lady looks like a thief from birth. Quickly, commit suicide. Zombie! Kill yourself 4 times and return to 4 days ago!Clearly, the ghost couldn\u2019t read people.On lunchtime of the 4th day.The pharmacist came to my room carrying the elixirs herself.\u201cS, Sorry. I wanted to give it to you faster, but it took longer than I thought\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You said you would make it in 4 days anyway. That\u2019s good.\u201dThe pharmacist bought 3 boxes of elixirs.If I drank it 3 times per day, it would last for 30 days.If we went to the store Bae Hu-ryeong wanted to go to, we would only get 2 days worth. This was an increase by 15 times.\u2018And the effects are probably better.\u2019This was how you should spend money.I subconsciously smiled.\u201cUm\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI, I know it\u2019s weird asking this now. But why did you leave such an expensive order to me?\u201dShe twisted her fingers.\u201cO, Of course, I\u2019m confident in myself. Looking at the recipe, I think there\u2019s only about 2 people in Babylon who can make this\u2026But, people only treat me like a freak.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dThe reason why I left it to this person.It was because this person was the genius of the century. The guild master of the Alchemy Castle. I had calculated to have some connection to the person who would grow to be the master of a large clan someday.However.\u2018That\u2019s not all.\u2019Before I regressed to 4000 days before.When the Flame Emperor had set fire to the slums. At the time, someone had arrived before anyone else to control the fire even though she was one of the highest rankers. Helping the people, Lord of Alchemy Castle had muttered.-That Flame Emperor, I don\u2019t like him.-He gives me bad vibes or something\u2026talking about someone\u2019s back here isn\u2019t nice,but I still think Saintess could meet someone better.Someone who had seen Flame Emperor\u2019s real self.\u2018She probably just guessed it with her senses without any evidence.\u2019Even if that was the case, she had the outstanding ability of reading people.She was skilled, nice enough to run immediately to help people in danger, and could read psychopaths. Wouldn\u2019t it be a waste not to be close with this kind of person?I opened my mouth.\u201cBecause you seem nice.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI helped you because you seemed nice. Well, you probably would\u2019ve made it big even if I didn\u2019t help you. But shouldn\u2019t kind hunters like us help each other to grow?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t let psychopaths be the only ones to succeed. That\u2019s unfair. Store owner-nim and I should work harder.\u201dI said exactly what I felt without telling any lies. I couldn\u2019t be more honest than this. Now, it depended on how the other person accepted my words. She stared at my face and spoke.\u201c\u2026I see. Yes. Since we have to succeed first to change the world.\u201dIt was a determined tone.\u201cThank you, customer-nim! As you said, I\u2019ll work harder too!\u201dHer fist was clenched.\u201cIf you have anything more to order, contact me! I\u2019ll always prioritize your orders!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be grateful for that.\u201dWe both smiled at each other and turned away.Unfortunately, my smile didn\u2019t last for long.-Hoho. I haven\u2019t seen a hunter who called himself nice in a while. And I\u2019ve never seen someone accept it like that. Hey, are you guys crazy? Tsk tsk tsk. You\u2019re not in your right mind.\u201c\u2026I know I said something embarrassing so let\u2019s just start training.\u201dThe next day.We headed towards the hunting ground. I took a sleeping bag and plenty of elixirs in my backpack.If there was something different than normal, it was that I was on the 3rd floor hunting ground and not the 2nd floor.There were lots of monsters that were still too much for me to deal with. Orcs and goblin hordes hovered around. I looked at them from far away.\u201cWhat do I do from now?\u201d-Drink your elixir first.I nodded my head.I gulped down the elixir that was the tumbler I brought without any hesitation.\u201cMm.\u201dThe taste itself was normal.It tasted good, like honey and lemon were added to it.The moment I thought it was a relief that it tasted good.\u201cHm\u2026.?!\u201dThump.My heart beat faster than normal.At first, I thought I was hallucinating, but I wasn\u2019t. Sweat dripped down my back. The most interesting fact was that\u2026I could feel each and every drop of sweat on my back clearly.\u2018What is this?\u2019Thump.It wasn\u2019t just the sweat. The touch of the air on my fingers and the feeling of the ground I was stepping on. When I blinked it felt like 30 seconds.\u201cThis\u2026is\u2026\u201d-Effects of the elixir.Only Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s voice felt the same amongst everything that felt different.-It slows down what you feel. It\u2019s easy if you think that it extends your time. I don\u2019t want to admit it, but that lady is pretty good at making elixirs.It was horrible.I could feel each strand of hair moving on my body. I could even feel the veins in my ears twitching. If I didn\u2019t know, I would think that I drank poison, and not an elixir.-Can\u2019t you feel it?\u201cWhat\u2026are\u2026you\u2026.talking\u2026about?\u201d-The thing moving in your heart.Thump.There was something there. No, something was flowing. And it wasn\u2019t blood.It was softer and more frail than blood. But it definitely flowed in my entire body. It was slowly spreading from my heart. Something that I had never felt before.-That\u2019s Aura.Bae Hu-ryeong spoke.-All hunters in the Tower have Aura in their bodies. They just live not knowing it. How much you\u2019re able to feel this Aura and control it is what determines victory.Bae Hu-ryeong laughed.The laughter lasted for 20 seconds. It was probably only a short second, but somehow, it felt like 20 seconds to me.I felt tired, like I would fall over if I just let go.-Usually, you get used to this feeling by quietly training by yourself.Inside of it. Something big approached.-But that\u2019ll take too long.Boom.Footsteps.Even the footsteps seemed long to me. When I lifted my head to see, a big orc was heading towards me.-A talentless body like you has to suffer a bit.This damned.-Alright! If you don\u2019t want to be hurt, use your Aura, Kim Zombie! You have to train with real things! You\u2019re not gonna kick the bucket anyway, so what if you get a little hurt.\u201cThis\u2026ghost\u2026really\u2026!\u201d-Hm? I can\u2019t hear what you\u2019re saying because you\u2019re a loser who can\u2019t even use Aura.He burst into laughter again.\u2013Are you in anguish? Kill yourself if you don\u2019t like it. Oh, then your kill count increases from 4000. Then grandpops Marcus will hunt you over and over again, huh?Ah.My partner was really a bad bastard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 \u2013 You Have a Skill Too? (1)Translator: HH-Roarrrrr!The orc bellowed.It could\u2019ve been a short growl and not a bellow. But to me, it sounded like a long echo. 50 seconds! In that time of about 1 minute, the sound of the orc rang in my ear.\u201cKe, uk\u2026!\u201dIt was a head-splitting pain.-Hey. Focus.Bae Hu-ryeong was ever the same in that slowed down time.-Don\u2019t get scared by something like an orc! Orcs are just ridiculously strong, their attack patterns are simple. If you can tell where they\u2019ll attack, you can easily avoid them and fight back. It\u2019s a fucking piece of cake.\u201cThat\u2019s easier\u2026said\u2026than done!\u201d-He\u2019s coming.The orc swung his club around. No, he was swinging it. It slowly but surely approached my head. If I stayed still, my head would explode.\u201cSh, it!\u201dI jumped to the side with all my strength. But my body didn\u2019t follow my command.\u2018I\u2019m slower!\u2019Just one step. I could avoid the attack with just one step, but that one step was too slow. I felt frustrated. I was so frustrated I felt like crying. I could avoid it! I even knew where it would attack!-You can avoid it. Don\u2019t give up.Bae Hu-ryeong spoke in a low voice.-Focus your Aura on your feet. Amplify your senses! Like the flow in your heart is being sent to you right foot, quick!Damn.\u2018He\u2019s a ghost but his mouth is blabbering like it\u2019s alive!\u2019For the first time in my life, I felt what Aura was. How would I focus this on my leg? It was really easier said than done. But\u2026there was no other way. I had to do something. Even if I wasn\u2019t scared of dying, I didn\u2019t want my head to fall off because of the orc\u2019s club!\u2018Move!\u2019The flow in my heart. It felt cool and clean, like a flowing stream. I focused on that cool feeling and tried to send it down to my right leg.Squirm.The Aura in my heart twitched with my efforts but--It\u2019s harder than you think, huh?It was hard.-It\u2019s because there\u2019s no pathway for Aura in your body yet. The path hasn\u2019t been made! Your body can be compared to a mountain road. You need to clear it like a highway to be able to use it.\u201cHup\u2026!\u201dI continued to focus on my right leg while Bae Hu-ryeong babbled on. If my heart was a blocked sink, my right leg was like a cup under it. Drip. Drip. Aura slowly dripped off of the broken sink.-You\u2019re able to feel it because you ate the elixir. Under normal circumstances, it\u2019s impossible. Tsk. That lady\u2019s cleanliness is disgusting but her skills are definite.The club whooshed close by me. I could feel the wind when it went by. The wind collided with my skin and dispersed. 1 second. No, if I was late by 0.5 seconds, my body would\u2019ve been destroyed by that club.\u201cW, What\u2026\u201dRelief only lasted for a moment.\u201cHappens\u2026?\u201dThe orc grunted. He probably didn\u2019t like this. The fact that a weak looking prey like me had dared to escape his attack. He immediately raised his club again.This time, it was a horizontal attack to break my back.There wasn\u2019t any time to rest.I focused my Aura on my upper body.-Hm? What happens what?\u201cIf\u2026make\u2026a mountain path\u2026into a highway\u2026!\u201dIt was hard. The sink in my heart was still clogged up. I didn\u2019t see water flowing from it anytime too. I was thirsty, but it was only releasing one drop at a time.\u2018I don\u2019t want to admit it but Bae Hu-ryeong is right.\u2019A mountain path without anything around it.It was a perfect metaphor that described me.So I was curious.If I could leave this level.If I could escape.\u201cAfter\u2026what\u2026happens!\u201d-He.He smirked.-You. When grandpops Marcus killed you, your neck was cut without even a chance to fight back, right?Yes.I remembered the view of the night sky and the crescent moon.Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s words dug into my brain.-You can think of that as a clean street.\u201c\u2026\u201dA clean street.That beautiful attack was just. Was just a clean street.-Even grandpops Marcus has a long way to go. And you, let\u2019s not even talk about you. Zombie. I\u2019m not nagging you because my personality is like trash, it\u2019s because you\u2019re worth being nagged. Heehee.I clenched my teeth.-Mm?Obstinance grew inside me.\u201cHup\u2026!\u201dI bent over. Whoosh! The orc\u2019s club swung into the air above my back. It was close. I barely avoided the second attack after the first one. And I didn\u2019t plan on letting it get in another attack.-What?I gathered strength in my knees.-Look at you.I focused my Aura on my feet. Not just focus it, but bend it. 5 seconds. 3 seconds. 1 second. It was messy, but when Aura gathered at my feet, I jumped up with all my strength.I lifted my sword.The target was the orc\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple!-Gwo?He looked down at me confusedly. I saw my reflection in his eyes, and the sword that was in my hands. My sword became bigger in his eyes. In an instant, my sword cut his throat and the orc\u2019s face crumpled in pain.-Kraaaaaa!Until the evening sky. In the large hunting ground, a scream rang out.When I thought it was finished.-Don\u2019t let your defenses down until the end!Bae Hu-ryeong shouted.-The skin of an orc\u2019s skin is tough! Fix your Aura on your blade! No, that\u2019s probably too hard. Just hit it like your smashing it!And so I did.The orc\u2019s scream became more violent. I squeezed out every drop of Aura in my heart that I could and used it to smash my sword down. Every time I brought it down, the monster\u2019s scream became more pained.-Kwo, ga\u2026krrrr\u2026!Blood splattered everywhere. The blood of the orc covered my face in slow motion. I didn\u2019t avoid it. I didn\u2019t even blink. It was to save every last bit of Aura for the sword.\u201cDi, e\u2026!\u201dIn a short moment.I felt the sword pierce the orc\u2019s skin all the way to the opposite side.-Grrrrr\u2026rr\u2026He stumbled.Even the time that he stumbled was long. He slowly fell backwards. I didn\u2019t let go of my sword, so when the monster fell, I fell with him.\u201cHu\u2026k, uk\u2026! Hup\u2026!\u201dI panted looking at the orc\u2019s corpse.It wasn\u2019t just the tired breathing.A moment later, my entire body became pained. The world spun. It really felt my entire body was going to rip apart.\u201cUuk\u2026?!\u201d-Does it hurt? It hurts, right? Yup. It\u2019ll fucking hurt.Bae Hu-ryeong smirked at me while flying around me.-Since you used your Aura when your pathway wasn\u2019t cleared yet. There\u2019s no way your weak body could take it! Sucks to be you.\u201cY, You\u2026.\u201d-Ah. But it was nice seeing you bending your Aura at the end. Good job. I\u2019ll compliment you. You have to be creative when you use Aura. A lot of people are misled, but the smarter you are the better you fight.I wasn\u2019t curious about those things right now.\u201cHee, huk\u2026keuk\u2026!\u201dThis pain!A pain like my bones were being crushed and my veins were exploding. My only interest was how to quiet this feeling. Usually, it would pass with time, but because my time was extended, that wasn\u2019t an option. It just hurt. It still hurt.I felt like I was going to die.-Does it hurt like you\u2019re going to die?\u201cCan\u2019t you\u2026see\u2026\u201d-Then you\u2019ll feel better if you really die.What?-People who force their Aura usually become half disabled. This can\u2019t be fixed with potions. So right now, you just made yourself disabled to catch an orc.\u201cW, What\u2026\u201d-I told you, Zombie. If you didn\u2019t have the regressing skill I shouldn\u2019t have suggested this kind of training. Grandpops Marcus eats elixirs too but he trains by himself. He doesn\u2019t stupidly attack monsters like you.This ghost bastard?-But you return even if you die. It\u2019s the freaking best! Even with extreme training, your body is fine. Wow, I\u2019m jealous. How nice would it have been if I had a regressing skill like you!Wow.How could he be so spiteful?Did this guy have a passive skill like [Son of a Bitch] or [Impudent Manner]? That would explain his trashy personality.-Zombie. But if you kill yourself, your kill count increases again.\u201cAnd\u2026so?\u201d-There\u2019s no need to raise your kill count from here. And it\u2019s dangerous if you get caught by grandpops Marcus.A worrisome sound came from behind. It was something I heard before not too long ago. I looked back, and my bad feeling was right. A monster that looked like the orc that just fell was drooling behind me.\u201cDa\u2026mn.\u201dThe monster was the same but my condition wasn\u2019t the same. As Bae Hu-ryeong said, my body was half disabled now. Even lifting a finger was painful.-It\u2019s ok! There\u2019s a lot of players who can\u2019t understand Aura their entire lives, and you somewhat got it just by taking the elixir. If this keeps up, 100 deaths should be more than enough. Step by step.Bae Hu-ryeong sniggered.-Let\u2019s go Zombie! 1 death coming up!At the same time, the orc\u2019s club started to come down. Slowly. Targeting my head. Looking at the club right in front of my nose, I opened my mouth.\u201c\u2026Shit.\u201dHave you ever felt your nose break, and then feel your brain explode into two right after that?You probably haven\u2019t. That\u2019s a relief. Because it\u2019s really not a good feeling.If there was a silver lining, it was probably that I heard the voice right after my brain exploded.[You have died.]My world returned to normal.To be precise, my sense of time returned.\u2018Whew\u2026\u2019A pitch black area.The space where I stayed until my next regression.In the place that I was somewhat used to\u2026someone that I didn\u2019t like was floating around.-Hm?Bae Hu-ryeong.-Dang. What\u2019s this?\u2018\u2026Somewhere I stay after dying. I picked my skill cards here when I was killed my Flame Emperor and Sword Saint. Well, I\u2019m calling it Nether World for now.\u2019-Fucking cool.Bae Hu-ryeong spun around the dark space.-But Zombie. Why am I here?\u2018Why would I know? It\u2019s probably because you\u2019re on me now.\u201dI sighed.\u2018If we wait like this, I\u2019ll regress with a voice that tells me I\u2019ll return to 24 hours before. Oh right. I\u2019m curious if you also\u2026\u2019It was the moment I was going to say I was curious if he would regress with me.[The skill condition has been achieved due to death.][The monster orc\u2019s skill is being randomly copied.]\u2018\u2026Huh?\u2019-What?Bae Hu-ryeong and I stopped at the same time. We both turned to look at each other. Bae Hu-ryeong looked baffled, and my face probably had a similar expression.[Skill cards are being created.]Two bronze colored skills popped out from the darkness.I stupidly mumbled to myself looking at them.\u2018\u2026Monsters had skills too?\u2019And Bae Hu-ryeong shouted.-What is this? It\u2019s a fucking cheat skill!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 \u2013 You Have a Skill Too? (2)Translator: HHThe voice continued to speak regardless of the blabbering ghost.[Please select a skill card.]This was real!Two orange bronze cards started to fly. They began to speed around me enough to make me dizzy, but my mind was one something else.-Shit. What kind of cheat is this! Getting to copy all the monsters\u2019 skills as well is unfair. Hey. Who\u2019s the person that manages this Tower! Why didn\u2019t you give this skill to me and to this lame-ass kid instead!\u2019\u2018Ah. Let\u2019s be quiet now.\u2019-Come out, you tower! This doesn\u2019t count. Ahh, my anger!Bae Hu-ryeong whipped his arms and legs around in fury. It was\u2026just hideous. He was no different from a child that was angry because their candy was stolen. He was so hideous that it was a wonder he could be that hideous.\u2018Sheesh. I should just focus on my cards.\u2019I observed the two cards flying in the air.\u2018Both of them are poop-colored cards so it\u2019s not gonna be a good skill, but\u2026\u2019But my heart pumped. Goodness. The skill of a monster. I could share the same skill as a monster! I felt like I had done something covert, like I played a prank on someone.\u2018I\u2019m curious.\u2019I stretched my hand out.\u2018Let\u2019s just pick one of them!\u2019And it was then, when I was just trying to grab any one of them.-Huh? You\u2019re getting that?The ghost bastard couldn\u2019t stay out of it and interfered again. My excitement faded away. Geez. His ability to bring someone down was really amazing.\u2018Yes. It doesn\u2019t matter which one I pick anyway.\u2019-Why doesn\u2019t it matter?Bae Hu-ryeong looked at me past the cards.-Since you\u2019re getting a free ride anyway, you should get a good skill while you\u2019re at it.\u2018I can\u2019t tell which is the better skill. They\u2019re both poop-colored. This is just a game of luck.\u2019-What? How come you can\u2019t tell which is the better skill?\u2019\u2018Geez. You\u2019re especially bad at understanding today.\u2019I shouted in frustration.\u2018The colors of the cards are the same! I can only see their backs! There\u2019s no way to tell between them, so how should I know which one\u2019s the better one.\u2019Then Bae Hu-ryeong tilted his head.-But I can see it?\u2018What?\u2019-I can see the front of the cards.Bae Hu-ryeong spoke in a shameless voice. I was stunned into silence.\u2018What kind of bullshit\u2026\u2019Is that, is what I was going to say, but I realized in the middle of my sentence.Location!From my location, I could only see the back of the card. Even when I tried to look around, the cards looked the same. Like how you couldn\u2019t tell which was the back of the moon on Earth, I could never see what was on the back of the card.But that was just me.Bae Hu-ryeong moved as he wished in this dark space.Yeah.He could move to where he saw the cards!\u2018Goodness\u2026\u2019I muttered.\u2018Can you really see it there? Can you see the card summary?\u2019Bae Hu-ryeong furrowed his eyebrows.-Of course I can see it. What are you saying, looking at my eyes. I was famous for having good eyesight since I was young. There was a guy called Dog Poop in my village, right? So he shot a firecracker at me, but my sight was already good enough to avoid it. Eventually, I raised it up to Heaven Eyes. Haa, that was how perfect I\u2026\u2018Eureka!\u2019-Fuck! Did this kid go crazy! Why are you screaming?Bae Hu-ryeong was surprised but I didn\u2019t care.\u2018Eureka! Eureka! Eurekaaaaaaa!\u2019I was just happy at the luck that came my way.Bae Hu-ryeong looked at me strangely and clicked his tongue.-This kid\u2019s brain really rotted like a zombie after calling him Zombie. Tsk tsk tsk\u20262.What Bae Hu-ryeong told me was this.+[Blessing of Reproduction]Rank: EEffect: Ah, nature has given us shelter, but also trials! This cruel world.

I couldn\u2019t stop being amazed.-How\u2019s that? If I didn\u2019t stop you, you would\u2019ve chosen the [Chiik, Chik]. Gong-ja, you were born as a man. You should experience the power of an orc at least once. Say \u2018thank you\u2019 to me. Go ahead!I was even amazed at what the ghost said. That meant I was out of it enough to be amazed.\u2018Mm.\u2019I ignored Bae Hu-ryeong, deep in thought.\u2018If I have to pick, I think [Chiik, Chik] is better.\u2019-Huh? Are you crazy?\u2018No. I\u2019m right.\u2019I nodded my head. I was completely sure.\u201cNo matter how much I think about it, I think [Chiik, Chik] is more useful than [Blessing of Reproduction].\u2019-Hey, hey! Wait! Think about it a bit more. You have to be cool-headed\u2026!Smirk.I laughed at the fumbling Bae Hu-ryeong.\u2018I think you\u2019re thinking the same thing as me.\u2019Before Bae Hu-ryeong could try to convince me anymore, I grabbed the poop colored card. The cards quickly flew around, but it didn\u2019t matter. Since there were only 2, anyway.[Selection complete. The skill is being copied.][You are regressing to 24 hours ago.]-N, No!\u2018Yes!\u2019Bae Hu-ryeong and I shouted in harmony.[Your current hunter rank is F class.][You will not receive a penalty based on your skill.]At the same time, the dark world became brighter.\u318d\u318d\u318d\u318d\u318d\u318dMy eyes burst open.\u201cHm!\u201dI felt refreshed.\u201cAh, this is nice. People need to sleep well to relax.\u201dThis was no longer the 2 pyeong room that I used to stay in. It was the room that I requested of Sangryun. It wasn\u2019t spacious, but it was a big enough hotel room. After being chosen for the 1st place lottery ticket, I decided to stay here for the time being.Meanwhile.-Damn! I thought you would fall for it, but you\u2019re uselessly smart!\u201cHehe.\u201dBae Hu-ryeong kicked the air around me. I guess he was angry that he wasn\u2019t able to prank me. Mm. Just by looking at him, my mind became relaxed like I was looking at a painting.\u201cLet\u2019s see, let\u2019s get the elixirs\u2026status window.\u201dI know longer had any reason to waste my time. I checked my status window on the way to the hunting ground.+Name: Kim Gong-jaRank: F ClassSkill (4/4)\u2013>I Want to Be Like You(S+):Passive\u2013>Returner\u2019s Clockwork Watch(EX): Passive\u2013>Sword Constellation(A+): Passive\u2013>Chiik, Chik(F): Active+\u201cGood. There\u2019s no problem.\u201dMy skill slots were full. But it was okay. I could just replace [Chiik, Chik].I\u2019ll use you as much as I want to until I get my next skill.-Gong-ja. So I was thinking\u2026I think it\u2019ll be okay to train just sitting criss-crossed. There\u2019s no need to train until you die, right? Criss-crossed. Mental training. How cool is that?\u201cHoohoo.\u201dWe arrived at the 3rd floor hunting ground. I could see orcs roaming around from far away.-Grrr\u2026chik.I observed their locations and pulled out the elixir. I drank it all in one gulp from the warm thermos.-Hey. Gong-ja? Can you hear me? We should just quietly train. Even if we train in a criss-crossed position, I\u2019ll help you understand Aura in half a year. Hm? Just trust me.\u201cKya! Tastes good.\u201dIt was only the 2nd time drinking it, but I already got used to it. It seemed like the pharmacist had specially taken care of the flavor when she made the elixir as well.I waited for the effects of the elixirs to take over me.\u201cSword Emperor. Did you know?\u201d-Huh? What? You\u2019re gonna sit criss-crossed?\u201cYou call me Zombie when it suits you, but you call me Gong-ja when you have the shorter end. And from earlier, you were calling me Gong-ja, and not Zombie.\u201dThump.\u201cI\u2019m kindly telling you that so you fix that habit of yours.\u201dAs soon as I stopped speaking, the world flowed slowly.My heart thumped. I could feel a faint flow in my heart along with it.Aura!The effects of the training definitely showed. Unlike last time, I immediately clearly grasped Aura right away.\u201cHoo, oo\u2026hoooo\u2026\u201dI controlled my breathing and approached them. Flinch. The orc\u2019s ears twitched after feeling someone\u2019s presence. The large green monster slowly turned around.-Grk?The orc\u2019s eyes grew bigger. He seemed confused. From his perspective, prey was walking on its own feet towards him.-Krrrrrr!The orc lifted his club like he decided to gladly accept this luck.That was when I smiled to myself.[Your skill is being activated.]I opened my mouth.\u201cCh\u2026ik! Chik!\u201dPause. The orc\u2019s eyes were bigger than before. His club stopped midswing.-Chirk\u2026chiik? Chi..ik?The orc tilted his head. He seemed to be wondering how to accept the fact that his prey was speaking his language.Of course, it was impossible to understand with the IQ of an orc, and my IQ wasn\u2019t lacking enough to throw this chance away.\u201cChiik!\u201dThe language of orcs perfectly poured out of my mouth.It was a skill that made native-speakers defenseless!-Krr? Ch\u2026irk?The monster in front of me was even more surprised. It was clear he was so confused that he didn\u2019t know what to do. When I ran at him, he couldn\u2019t properly react.My sword smoothly cut the orc\u2019s throat. I added a single drop of Aura on the sword blade that wasn\u2019t too much or too little. A fountain of blood exploded and the orc fell over.-Ch\u2026irk\u2026? Gr\u2026chik\u2026Like it felt wronged.If it was translated to human language, it would\u2019ve been equivalent to \u2018Even you, Brutus!\u2019\u201cChirk.\u201dI had a victor\u2019s smile. Forcing Aura out of my body still hurt\u2026but the condition of my body was incomparable to last time. I was okay. If I used just this much Aura, I was fine.-You cheating bastard! I knew you would do this!Bae Hu-ryeong trembled.-Do you like tricking the nice orcs like this! Huh?! You don\u2019t even think about how the orcs feel! The innocent orcs are hurt because of dirty humans like you!I didn\u2019t repeat what he said about it being fine to train using any method.Instead, I just said a single word with a smirk.\u201cChiik!\u201d-Argh! This is! So annoying! Why did you give such a cheat skill to this weak ass guy, o Tower?!When one week had passed.I passed the hunting ground on the 5th hunting flood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The senior member of the 5th floor had fallen.I looked down at the king goblin\u2019s face with determined expression.\u201cGor.\u201dThis monster was the strongest of the ones that I saw this week. Ah, how many times had I died to get this monster?\u00a0 I sent away the king goblin with the mind of sending away a brave enemy warrior\u2026-Stop bullshitting yourself. You psychotic zombie.\u201cAh. Geez. I barely managed to hunt this after 6 Coins. Can\u2019t you just let me look in peace?\u201d6 Coins meant that I had put 6 lives on the stake. Right now, I was on the 6th coin, so I had died 5 times to get this king goblin.Bae Hu-ryeong snorted.-You\u2019re a psycho if you get lost in thought like that after catching a monster. I only speak facts.\u201cWow, I see. Our Sword Emperor\u2019s personality is so nice.\u201dYou might be able to tell from our conversation, but I was used to Aura now. Time was still flowing slowly because of the effects of the elixir.It was just that I was speaking a lot faster than normal by focusing my Aura on my tongue.\u201cGork.\u201dAlthough it wasn\u2019t a steadfast victory and one that I used dirty tricks to win.I pulled out a poop-colored card and checked it.+[Goblin High Society]Rank: FEffects: The king goblin was lost in thought. \u2018The level of culture for us goblins is too low. All languages end in kerrk, kerk. I cannot show my dignity with this!\u2019 Then. The king goblin\u2019s genius mind flashed. \u2018That\u2019s right! From now on, I will speak gork and not kerk. Gork! It\u2019s a pronunciation that perfectly fits the precious king.\u2019\u203bHowever, the fights within the tribe become worse.\u203bThis is a skill copied from the Great King Goblin monster.+I clicked my tongue.\u201cGoblins worry about the most unnecessary things. Kerk and gork as basically the same thing.\u201d-That\u2019s why they\u2019re goblins. Humans aren\u2019t that different either.\u201cWhat?\u201d-I was talking to myself.When I was about to ask him what he meant, a voice rang in my head.[Your existence is becoming clearer.]It was a voice that I had never heard before.However, I knew what it meant. Countless players had testified to it, and even showed their own videos about it.\u201cF, Finally!\u201dIt was leveling up![Hunter Kim Gong-ja\u2019s level is developing.]\u201cAh\u2026\u201dIt was moving. I had lived my entire life as a F Class hunter. I was anxious that I might continue to live like this. But I had the copying skill and the regressing skill, and after hurdles of pain\u2026the moment of leveling up finally arrived for me.[Your skill slots are increasing!][Your hunter rank is now E Class!]Although I was only an E Class.[May luck be with you.]Swoosh!Red Aura flamed up from my feet. The thing that was similar to red liquid covered my body. Then, it slid back down and disappeared.-\u2026Was that a firework?Bae Hu-ryeong scrunched his eyebrows.-Or blood? Hm. That\u2019s confusing. I think it\u2019s either a firework or blood\u2026\u201cThat was just a level up artifact, right?\u201d-It\u2019s not an artifact that just looks cool.Bae Hu-ryeong scratched the back of his head.-It\u2019s a kind of hint.\u201cHint?\u201d-Mm. The type of artifact that reveals itself decides the [Shape of Aura]. Even the Flame Emperor that you killed. That guy\u2019s shape was probably [Fire].\u201cFireworks, you say\u201dI tried to remember. The scene of the Flame Emperor killing the Saintess with fire in the slums. It wasn\u2019t a good memory to rehash but\u2026it definitely seemed like Yoo Soo-ha dealt with a shape of Aura that was relating to fire.-A hunter\u2019s trauma is usually based on the shape of their Aura.Trauma.-Important events. Scenes. Memories. The ones that benchmark your life appear as the shape of your Aura. Like the shape of one\u2019s unconsciousness? Well, it doesn\u2019t have to be a negative trauma. But they generally are.\u201cI wonder.\u201d-From what I can tell, yours is either fire or blood.Listening to him speak , I became curious.\u201cNow that you say that\u2026what\u2019s the shape of Sword Saint\u2019s Aura?\u201d-Moonlight.Bae Hu-ryeong casually tossed it out.-Grandpops Marcus said he lost his way in the mountains when he was young. He didn\u2019t want to die, so he climbed all the way to the top, and as he reached the peak, the leaves covering the night sky started to show the sky. When he got to the top, he saw the entire black night sky.Moonlight(\u6708\u5149)-He said he thought of something then. The moon didn\u2019t shine by itself, but with the light of the sun. Even the life of someone who just accepts could be more than beautiful. Ah. I also want to shine by receiving that light.\u201c\u2026\u201d-He said it was memorable enough for him to keep it in his heart his entire life.I was unsettled listening to his story.\u201cBut he said it was when he was young.\u201d-Yup. When he was 12.\u201cWhat kind of 12 year old would have those deep thoughts?\u201dBae Hu-ryeong nodded.-That\u2019s why grandpops Marcus was a born boomer. Tsk tsk. When I was 12, I only thought about how to efficiently crush the bully in front of me.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s\u2026normal either\u2026\u201dIf Sword Saint was a born boomer, then what was Bae Hu-ryeong? A born bully?-Anyways, you\u2019re used to the 5th floor. Let\u2019s go up to the 6th.\u201cAh, about that.\u201dI spoke.\u201cCan\u2019t we just go straight to the 10th floor boss?\u201d-What?\u201cI know that I can copy a monster\u2019s skill. I\u2019m somewhat used to the Aura now. I think that I can get the 10th floor boss now.\u201dBae Hu-ryeong closed his mouth for a moment.He looked fiercely at me.-Kim Gong-ja. Is a newbie already being too arrogant?\u201cDefinitely not.\u201dI firmly replied.In our world, no one had succeeded in passing the 10th floor for several years. Since I dared to say I would clear that high difficulty area, Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s worry about me was expected.\u201cI\u2019m really confident.\u201dBut I really believed I could do it.No, I was sure.\u201cIf I can\u2019t do it with 2 Coins, I\u2019ll call you Seseung-nim.\u201d-Oh? 2 Coins?Bae Hu-ryeong looked tempted.-A guy that took 6 Coins to catch the goblin boss is gonna defeat the 10th floor boss with just 2 Coins? Really? You must not know, but I don\u2019t let people out of bets that easily.\u201cBut! I have a condition.\u201d-Hm?I lifted my forefinger.\u201cYou have to tell me what kind of skill the 10th floor boss has without hiding anything. You can\u2019t lie about this. Tricking me with cards is also not allowed.\u201d-Hm. Sounds easy enough.\u201cAlso!\u201dI grinned.And if I win, call me Gong-ja-nim. As politely as possible. With respect.\u201d-\u2026..\u201cWhy? Scared? Ha. If you\u2019re scared, you should quit.\u201dSquirm.The expression that a bully hated the most was probably \u2018scared?\u2019 And Bae Hu-ryeong wasn\u2019t a normal bully. He was the greatest bully that had climbed the 99th floor.His facial muscles twitched.-Spit! This newbie is mocking the great Sword Emperor just because he had some cheat skill? Hoohoohoo, fine. Let\u2019s bet on it!\u201cBet.\u201d-Bet! Kim Zombie, you won\u2019t be able to subjugate the 10th floor boss and have to call me Seseung-nim until you die. Ah! But since you can\u2019t die, you\u2019ll just have to say Seseung-nim forever.\u201cDo you have a hallucinating skill as well? Get ready to serve Gong-ja-nim.\u201d-Hehehe.\u201cKehehe.\u201dWe both glared at each other and laughed evilly.Hunters who had been hunting goblins from far away whispered amongst themselves.\u201cHey. That person keeps on talking to himself from earlier.\u201d\u201cAnd now he\u2019s even laughing to himself. Does he have a mental problem?\u201d\u201cSh! He might look this way. Pretend you didn\u2019t see, pretend.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u2026I would probably have to cut back on talking to myself now.I calmly shut my mouth and headed for the 10th floor.4.Unlike other hunting grounds, there was a doorkeeper in front of the 10th floor boss room.The person sent from the Hunter\u2019s Association furrowed his eyebrows listening to what I said.\u201cYou want to attempt the boss room yourself?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIt only took two seconds for his face to switch into an expression like he was asking \u2018Who is this crazy guy?\u2019\u201cUm. I don\u2019t know if you saw the news last time\u202630 honor members from Black Dragon guild. Along with the 4 highest rankers, but they failed. Hunting by yourself is committing suicide.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201dI was confident.\u201cSending a hunter to an attack they want to is the Association\u2019s rule.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true but\u2026\u201dHe had a troubled expression.\u201cPardon me, but I write down all the hunters who enter here. My boss will probably look through this\u2026and I\u2019ll end up being a bad guy who let a hunter die. Please consider my situation as well.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dWhat should I do? I calmly stroked my chin.-What? Hunter\u2019s Association? We never had those guys in my world!I meant to say that I was the only calm one.-These stupid fools! I didn\u2019t like how they did fucking politics making guilds and associations. That\u2019s why they are still begging on the bloody 10th floor! Hey, Kim Zombie! Just beat this guy up and go into the boss room.\u2018What Why would I beat up an innocent person?\u2019-He dares to block your way.He wasn\u2019t only a psychopath but also a mosquito.\u201cDoorkeeper-nim.\u201dI clicked my tongue inwardly and got out a pocket.\u201cI can see you working hard. You\u2019re right. Me attempting it by myself is just a suicidal plan. But\u2026I really want to kill myself.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just so tired these days\u2026\u201dI bitterly smiled.\u201cMy girlfriend died 1 year ago. Some time ago, the Alchemy Castle said I have a terminal illness. Even if I live, it\u2019ll only be half a year, and I don\u2019t have the confidence to endure that half year without my girlfriend.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d-What?Bae Hu-ryeong grimaced.-What kind of shit is this zombie guy saying?I ignored him. And I continued whispering to the doorkeeper.\u201cBut even if I\u2019m a lowly ranker, I\u2019m still a hunter. I don\u2019t want to enter the Alchemy Castle\u2019s hospital wondering when I\u2019ll die. Even if I die\u2026I want to challenge a monster until the very end.\u201d\u201cYou had that kind of\u2026\u201dHe had a pitiful face looking at me. You know. The face people make when they listen to others misfortunes.\u201cThis is money I collected from fights.\u201dI handed the pocket to the doorkeeper. There was 100 Gold inside.\u201cI don\u2019t have anywhere to use it anyway\u2026you can have it.\u201d\u201cI, I can\u2019t accept this money!\u201d\u201cI want to lightly leave the world, door keeper-nim. And please don\u2019t write down that I entered here. It\u2019s the last request of my hunter life\u2026\u201dHis face turned heavy, like he was going to cry. And a bit of that heaviness was probably from that moneybag.\u201c\u2026Alright. Enter. I didn\u2019t see anything\u2026\u201d-Ha, look at this.He was baffled.-Hey. Are the two of you filming a movie? This isn\u2019t a prank, right?Whatever the case, the doorkeeper let me in.I left him and moved inside. It was a cobblestone path. The place the 10th floor boss stayed was like an extravagant residence of an old noble family. I walked the cobblestone path.\u2018The 10th floor Flame Emperor Yoo Soo-ha cleared.\u2019I stood in front of the large door.I slowly pushed the door open.\u2018This time is different. Instead of Flame Emperor\u2026no.\u2019Creaaak.The door opened with a loud sound.\u2018I\u2019ll write a fancier legend than Flame Emperor.I took a step forward.And it began.-Hahahahaha!I heard laughter from around me. At the same time, the door that I used to come in closed. Boom! In an instant, it became dark around me, and the shiver-inducing laughter became louder.Candles flickered on one by one.-Are you gonna play with me?Here and there. Candles flickered on although no one had touched them. Where candles were lit, there were dolls. Small dolls that children players with.-Are you going to play with us?The dolls spoke.-Freeze tag? The flower had bloomed? Hide and seek?-The ice is melted. The flowers are ripped. Let\u2019s go with hide and seek!-Let\u2019s! Play with us! Play hide and seek with us!-Hahahaha!I got ready.\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll play with you.\u201dThe Aura that I trained in my body soared up.Like it had been waiting for me, a voice rang in my head.[You have entered the boss stage.][The challenger/s is hunter Kim Gong-ja. 1 person.][May luck be with you.]The stage that humanity hadn\u2019t cleared yet.The \u2018Hide and Seek of Hellfire Residence\u2019 began.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She challenged the 10th floor tens of times. Everytime she challenged it, she failed. The Rank 2 hunter lost, but she saved all the hunters who participated in it. In an interview, she said this.[We were just unlucky.]When Flame Emperor had passed the 10th floor himself, he announced to everyone.[Luck is also a skill, losers.]It was the interview called Loser Announcement.After that, Black Dragon started to be wary of Flame Emperor after being turned into a loser group\u2026well, it wasn\u2019t important anymore. Yoo Soo-ha had already died in my hand. The possibility of that kind of interview was gone now. But the problem was this.\u2018Why was the Flame Emperor able to clear the 10th floor?\u2019\u2018Because he was just stronger?\u2019Or.\u2018Because there was another reason?\u2019The answer was revealing itself in front of me right now.2.[The boss stage is commencing.]At the same time the voice rang out, the residence started to change.Everywhere, candles started to tilt over. Fire started where they tilted over. It was like they had poured oil on it beforehand. Fire instantly swallowed the western-style residence.-Hahahaha!Only the dolls were fine in the fire.-You\u2019re it! We\u2019ll run away!-Let\u2019s run away, run away! Let\u2019s run away from here!Hundreds. No, thousands of little dolls. Dolls filled the first floor lobby. There were probably ten thousands of dolls all over the entire residence.\u2018One of these.\u2019Gulp. I swallowed my spit.\u2018The [Real Doll] is hidden somewhere.\u2019A probability of 1/10,000!This was the reason why people had failed so far.\u2018Burning all the dolls while I find the real one. If I escape before I die, I only have about 10 minutes to look.\u2019The fire burning the residence wasn\u2019t normal fire. It was a shape of Aura, called hellfire.That meant.\u2018This entire residence is burning up with Aura.\u2019A boss monster who knew how to use Aura!So far, people who challenged it died from hellfire, escaped, or met one of these two fates. Hunters risked their lives on the probability of 1/10,000 but it was a waste. They only burned to death with horrifying screams.And here\u2026was the secret why only the Flame Emperor was able to succeed.\u201cThat guy sucking all the luck.\u201dI muttered to myself.Yes. The Aura of the boss monster was the same Flame Emperor\u2019s.To other players, this was hellfire. However, Flame Emperor felt comfortable like it was his own bedroom. Since the 10th floor\u2019s boss monster\u2019s hellfire was the same property as Yoo Soo-ha.\u201cTsk.\u201d\u2018He probably looked around until he found the real doll.\u2019And he bragged about it saying luck was also a skill.He definitely wasn\u2019t someone I liked.-The hunter that lives off of luck is you.\u201cWhat do you mean, I live off of luck?\u201dI crinkled my eyebrows at his mocking.\u201cI\u2019m barely hanging on with my Aura right now.\u201dSweat dripped down between my eyebrows. The burning heat! My body was covered in what was incomparable to the heat of a hot spring. If I didn\u2019t use my Aura, I would\u2019ve burned to death already.-Yeah. But 1 minute is probably gonna be your limit.Annoyingly, Bae Hu-ryeong knew my exact condition.-Also, grandpops Marcus would be able to last 30 minutes. Do you know why he hasn\u2019t challenged here yet? It\u2019s to extend that 30 minutes to 1 hour.\u201c\u2026ah, yes yes. Thank you for confirming the gap in our skills.\u201d-Heeheehee.Bae Hu-ryeong freely flew around the lobby that was burning in fire. Dolls were laughing below and ghosts were snickering above. There wasn\u2019t a better ghost house than this.-So? You only have 2 Coins but what are you gonna do now?\u201cWhat else would I do. I have to die.\u201d-Look at you. Do you think your Aura will suddenly increase if you die here?Bae Hu-ryeong sniggered at me.-There\u2019s only 2 ways to clear this room! Find the real doll with luck, or be able to use Aura real well until you find the real doll. But you only bet 2 Coins on yourself, stupidly. It\u2019s not gonna work probably.\u201cHehe.\u201dEven while sweating, I kept my smile.\u201cThis guy knows one but not two. No. Is it that he knows two but not three?\u201d-What?\u201cLet\u2019s see who\u2019ll win after dying once.\u201dNow I had 20 seconds until my Aura ran out.I approached a doll that was closest to me. The reason was\u2026well, I didn\u2019t really have one. I just thought it was boring to stand there waiting to die. I just might\u2019ve been real lucky for the doll in front of me to be [Real].-Are you gonna play with us?Creaaak.The doll\u2019s neck twisted. Only her neck twisted. It wouldn\u2019t be strange if she was casted in a horror movie right this second. She was wearing a frilled dress, but her dress didn\u2019t burn at all. Like it was immune to the fire.\u201cGot you.\u201dI put the doll\u2019s head on my hand and spoke.Giggle giggle.The doll let out chuckles with her indifferent face.-Beep! Not me!That wasn\u2019t the only thing she released. She let out her lips. Skin. Eyes. Her body slid down like paper. The fire instantly swallowed the doll, and she continued to speak like a broken record.-Not me! Not me! Not me!-Not! Not, me. Me\u2026me\u2026not\u2026me\u2026-Not\u2026me\u2026It completely melted down.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dI was speechless. My body felt hot but I was shivering. It was more horrendous than I imagined.\u201cI got goosebumps. Why would they make the boss monster like that?\u201d-Who would know the great meaning of the Tower. Zombie. A weak ass like you getting a fucking cheat skill is also a meaning of the Tower. If the Tower had a personality, it would probably be a pervert psychopath.\u201cYou really\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t complain any longer.\u201cKeuk!?\u201dMy Aura had run out.The flames ran at me like they had been waiting for this moment. The soles of my shoes melted first. Then my clothes. And the fire moved onto my hair.\u201cAh,\u201dFrom my head to my feet.\u201cAck! Aaaaaack!!!\u201dMy entire body was burning. Although my skin was sliding down, the fire didn\u2019t stop. Rather, it clung on me tighter like it found a delicious snack. Nerves. Bones. Throat. Liver.\u201cOw, sh\u2026! Uk, keackkk!\u201d-And you\u2019re a pervert that surpasses the Tower. Ke. Even if you want to be the greatest hunter in the tower, you accept burning to death like it\u2019s nothing. I admit it, Kim Zombie! You\u2019re a real pervert!I wanted to die.Quick, I wanted to die even a second faster!\u201cUuuh\u2026!\u201dI couldn\u2019t speak. The sound was muffled. My eyes and ears had been burned.The moment I felt like my head would explode from overheating, the voice came from my subconscious like it had been waiting.[You have died.]Damn.They should\u2019ve killed me a bit faster.\u318d\u318d\u318d\u318d\u318d\u318d\u2018-Puhua!\u2019I breathed like someone who had just surfaced after a long dive.

But there was something off. I felt uncomfortable, like I had choked on something and couldn\u2019t get it out. The feeling of the water pipe being broken but not knowing where it was.\u2018\u2026Anyways, read the next skills.\u2019-Hm? I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be a better skill than this.

Wow, a golden card! Wow, S Class skill! Dope! If you have this you can make hellfire when you want. How cool is that.\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019-Why don\u2019t you know! I\u2019ll fall in love!

The real one is the user of the skill, so of course, they won\u2019t be damaged.\u2019I held out my hand.\u2018But why are the fake dolls fine as well?\u2019And I grabbed the silver card.-Aaaack! No!

I wasn\u2019t here. It was just my consciousness floating around like a ghost, looking down at things from a third person perspective.\u2018What is this?\u2019I was taken aback.\u2018What\u2019s happenin\u2026?\u2019-S, Save me.Then, I heard a voice.A young child was sitting in the corner of the 2st floor lobby. At first, I thought she was talking to me, but she pleaded to someone else.-Please save me\u2026I\u2019m hungry\u2026something to eat\u2026something to eat, please\u2026-Mm.A person dressed like a noble.-Orphans like you are the plague of this kingdom.-Something to eat\u2026-Left alone, you eat society. You don\u2019t even work. You wander around from one village to the next, spreading your disease. I\u2019m a prison ward that isolates those like you from the kingdom.In an instant, information entered my brain.A time when there were many wanderers because there wasn\u2019t enough food. The noble gathered orphans into his residence. He funded an orphanage as a cover. He was known as a kind wealthy man, a great businessman, and a conscientious man with knowledge.-Others treat you as rotten. I\u2019m different.But in this large mansion.-I\u2019m going to educate you.The noble was just a tyrant.-Those who look for food just because they\u2019re hungry are beasts. Of course, you were born in the field like beasts, but you shouldn\u2019t live like one.-I\u2019m hungry\u2026hungry\u2026-Endure it. Even if you\u2019re hungry, endure it. Endure it, and become a human.The noble smiled. It was a generous smile. He was someone who was able to smile at a skinny child who\u2019s rib cage could be seen.-Repent!The crazy bastard called other crazy bastards.-Aaaaaack!-Oh, children of witches! The plague of our kingdom! Don\u2019t worry. God never turns his back on you. Like him, I won\u2019t turn my back on you sheep!-It hurts\u2026it\u2026hurts\u2026Some god\u2019s priest raised his hammer.-Pray!A time when lunacy was wrapped up as kindness.The screams didn\u2019t end inside the mansion.-I\u2019m hungry\u2026Starvation.-I don\u2019t like it\u2026please forgive me\u2026why\u2026forgive me\u2026Torture.-Ah. Thank you\u2026kind sir. Kind man\u2026reward for enduring pain. Promise. Thank you. Thank you, kind man\u2026Brainwashing.These orphans were brought in like corpses and left as corpses. It was only the death of someone who was about to die, but the children couldn\u2019t imagine the pain between the two.Tens, hundreds, thousands were in the mansion.And tens, hundreds, thousands of deaths.\u2018\u2026\u2019I stared blankly at the sight in front of me.\u2018Just what\u2026\u2019-Wow. Eff. What\u2019s this?I was able to come to attention thanks to someone.\u2018You were looking too? I thought you weren\u2019t here.\u2019-I was looking from the beginning. I didn\u2019t know you were here. I couldn\u2019t see you.\u2018Mm. Seems like both of our consciousnesses are floating around\u2026\u2019-That\u2019s not my problem.Bae Hu-ryeong spoke.-What kind of crazy psychos are these? Ha. They\u2019re educating them into humans? How would these nonhuman bastards educate others into humans?\u2018\u2026This is probably the origin of the 10th floor boss stage.\u2019Before my consciousness flew over here, a voice told. [The death of the enemy who killed you is being reenacted.]If it was the enemy who killed me\u2026it was the real doll hiding somewhere in the hellfire residence. That meant this was the trauma the doll remembered.\u2018I had no idea.\u2019I whispered.\u2018The monster was a human when it was alive\u2026\u2019-Not all monsters are like that. Only the bosses are like that. Usually boss monsters are made from humans from other worlds.I heard him click his tongue.-Carnivorous plants, or heroes of other worlds. Things like those. As you cross the 11th floor, it becomes more intense.\u2018What? Why didn\u2019t you tell me that?\u2019-You didn\u2019t ask.\u2018\u2026\u2019He was so shameless that I was speechless.-But I\u2019ve never seen something like this. Tsk.\u2018What?\u2019-The origin you talked about. The scenes we see now. I knew boss monsters were from other worlds, but how would I know what happened to them. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m psychic\u2026Bae Hu-ryeong muttered to himself.-I feel like shit.Agreed.\u2018\u2026Yeah.\u2019Things worse than this were probably happening all over the world right now, but imagining it and seeing for myself was different.I didn\u2019t know if it was a good or bad thing.-F, Fire!But the [Trauma] ended soon.Some servant accidentally tipped over a candle. The servant passed by without noticing it. It was nighttime. When people were sleeping, fire slowly and quietly spread. It was too late when someone realized the flames.-Cough, gasp. Cough!-We have to get awa\u2026The flames soared up.The ropes in the basement burned up. The chains burned up. The cuffs around the orphans burned up as well, and brainwashed kids, tortured kids, and starved kids burned. It was like the fire burned all brainwashing, injuries, and starvation.-Ah\u2026The children opened their mouths. The burning chains were tightened around the childrens\u2019 ankles and wrists. They couldn\u2019t move, like they were dolls. They just screamed.However, I could hear it.-I don\u2019t want to die.Hate.-I\u2019m hungry.-I want to live\u2026-Kind sir.The grudges and resentment entering my consciousness.-I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I didn\u2019t have a family. But it was still ok. I wanted to play a bit more. But\u2026-It\u2019s not our fault. I feel wronged. I didn\u2019t do it.-I\u2019m hungry.The mansion burned up.The chandelier in the 1st floor lobby burned up. The bedroom of the residence\u2019s owner burned up. The fancy curtains. And the stone stairs that led down to the basement.-I don\u2019t want to die.Crack.Crack-Sparks flew everywhere.Now what I could see was a mansion burning up from far away.[Trauma reenactment finished.][The penalty is ending.]And I returned to a day before.......When I opened my eyes.Bae Hu-ryeong and I didn\u2019t say anything. We both silently sat on the bed.Rather than being shocked\u2026it was because we didn\u2019t know how to react.-Mm\u2026After a while, Bae Hu-ryeong scratched the back of his head.-It was really sad and pitiful. I saw it well. But isn\u2019t there nothing we can do?\u201cWow. That\u2019s the first thing you say? You really\u2026\u201d-Yup. Right. My personality is trash.He frowned. Have you ever seen a gorilla get mad? It was totally similar to this.-But the truth is always like shit! The 10th floor boss is just a monster, and the children have already died in another world. It\u2019s something that happened a long long time ago. Zombie. What can you do!\u201c\u2026\u201d-And if it was something that happened in this Tower, you could die 4000 or 5000 times to return to the past. But that happened in another world in a different time. Even if I was alive, I couldn\u2019t fix that! Even if I was Sword God and not Sword Emperor, I couldn\u2019t do it.He was right.-Find the real king and hunt it. Kill it.Bae Hu-ryeong spoke.-And go the the 11th floor. That\u2019s the only way you\u2019re gonna clear the 20th, 30th, 40th, and 50th floor. If you decided to become the hunter at the top, deal with these things yourself!He was right again.But.\u201cFlame Emperor also thought that way.\u201d-Hm?\u201cFlame Emperor. Shit Emperor. Yoo Soo-ha. The first human I hunted.\u201dI got up from my bed.I tied my sleeping back to my backpack. I carried my backpack. I inserted my sword into my waist. In other words, I was ready to climb the tower. Even though it wasn\u2019t the best, I was still getting ready a a hunter.\u201cDid you know? Yoo Soo-ha would\u2019ve 100% found the real doll and exploded its head. Whether he saw the trauma or not. Without any hesitation.-So what?\u201cI don\u2019t want to be like that Flame Emperor bastard.\u201dI climbed the tower.Like the last time, I tricked the doorkeeper.And I stepped in front of the mansion again.The same noble mansion that I saw in the trauma.-Hey! You\u2019re not a baby. You\u2019re not gonna get the boss just because you don\u2019t want to be like that guy? What are you gonna do. You have to get rid of the boss to clear the stage, you zombie fool!\u201cWho said so?\u201d-What?I put my hands on the door and murmured to myself.\u201cDamn. I was stupid.\u201d-What are you talking about?\u201cI was stupid! And you were equally stupid. Shit. We\u2019re saying we can\u2019t remember.Bae Hu-ryeong wrinkled his forehead.-Did this kid lose his mind? You being stupid is a fact all over the world, but why am I stupid too? I grew up hearing that I was a genius.\u201cSkill card.\u201dI mumbled in annoyance.\u201cThe S Class skill card we didn\u2019t pick. Do you remember it? The Hellfire Limit. You went crazy saying I had to pick this one.\u201d-Hm? Of course I remember.-Huh, this Zombie. Fine\u2026listen.Bae Hu-ryeong rattled on with a frown.

No one. Then just how were the players who challenged the 10th floor able to escape from it.-Huh?Bae Hu-ryeong blinked.-\u2026Huh? Fuck, yeah, why?There was a guild called Black Dragon.The person who controlled them was the Rank 2 hunter. The Black Witch challenged the 10th floor countless times. Everytime she did, she failed. The Rank 2 failed, but all the hunters came back alive.They all came back alive.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201dI put some strength onto my arms.It slowly opened.\u201cIt says escaping itself is impossible if the boss doesn\u2019t let you go. That\u2019s the skill\u2026and they escaped perfectly fine even without killing the boss. Everyone. So it doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d-Then\u2026what happened?\u201cShit.

The flowers all ripped. Let\u2019s go with hide and seek!-Let\u2019s! Play with us! Play hide and seek with us!-Hahahahah!The flames soared up.The chandelier in the 1st floor lobby burned up. The bedroom of the residence\u2019s owner burned up. The fancy curtains. And the stone stairs that led down to the basement.In the midst of everything, the children, who were now dolls, didn\u2019t burn up.\u201c\u2026\u201dI clenched my teeth.\u201cAlright.

They didn\u2019t have any expressions, but I knew.-Isn\u2019t it hot?-Weird guy.-Can you play?-Are you gonna play with us?I nodded my head again.\u201cYup. Hide and seek. Be careful. I never lost hide and seek when I was young.\u201d-Giggle giggle! It\u2019s a weird guy!-Hide! Everyone hide!The dolls all laughed. I told them to hide, but no one moved. Tens. Hundreds. Thousands of children laughed.-Ready or not, here I come. Ready or not\u2026Hide and seek began.\u201c\u2026got you.\u201dI roamed the mansion. I grabbed dolls while I walked around. When I patted their heads, the dolls\u2019 heads creaked up. Then, they opened their mouths to speak.-Beep! Not me!The dolls disappeared while laughing.-Not me!-Not me!Everywhere I turned, there were dolls. There were so many. I got each and every one of them.-\u2026One.-Hey, this is\u2026Another one.-This is\u2026a memorial service.Bae Hu-ryeong muttered.Memorial service.Comforting the soul of a dead person.I quietly walked around the mansion. I saw the chains that wrapped the orphans, and I saw their cuffs. Where the chains and cuffs were, there were always dolls there.The fire burned up.-It\u2019s not me! Not me! Not me!-No! Not, me. Me\u2026me\u2026not\u2026me\u2026-Not\u2026me\u2026Time flew by.Eventually, I was in the basement. I had just stepped down the long stone stairs. There were dolls on the stairs as well. They were all toppled over. Like they had stopped while trying to escape from the basement.\u201c\u2026\u201dI got all the children who had fallen on the stairs, and stood in front of the last doll.-Are you gonna play with us?The doll was leaning against the wall.Around the doll, there were hammers, scythes, and nails.-\u2026I slowly walked towards it.And I patted the hairless doll\u2019s head.\u201cGot you.\u201dThe head of the child who made this hellfire was small. Enough to be wrapped around one hand.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re it now. Kiddo.\u201dThere was silence.The doll raised its head. Like the other dolls, the doll was expressionless. The doll spoke with the face that lost its expression.-Kind man.Its voice wasn\u2019t the only thing it let out. Lips. Skin, Eyes. Her body slid down like paper. The fire instantly swallowed the doll, and it continued to speak like a broken record.-Thank you.And it melted.-Thank you.The doll burned up. The chains melted down. Cuffs, hammer, scythe, pick, nails, they all burned up. Even the trace of starvation.

Me, who wasn\u2019t even in the ranking.If this was known, the world would flip around.\u201cHaa.\u201dBut I didn\u2019t feel comfortable. Like I was happy and sad at the same time.I stood in the ash covered building.-Hey. Why do you look like you ate shit? You even cleared the hidden stage. I can count the number of times I cleared a hidden stage on one hand. The reward will probably be pretty good.\u201cA psychopath like you wouldn\u2019t know why I\u2019m gloomy right now. Since you don\u2019t have any humanity.\u201d-Mm. Now that I see, you didn\u2019t eat shit but you\u2019re shitting me right now.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was surprising. My gloominess disappeared with a word from Bae Hu-ryeong. Yeah. Living with this crazy geezer, I wouldn\u2019t be able to feel sensitive to things.\u201c\u2026I was just thinking the world is fucked up.\u201d-Hm?\u201cYou saw in the boss stage just now. Whether it\u2019s our world or another world, fucked up things happen.\u201d-I guess.Bae Hu-ryeong nodded.-Places where people live are probably all like that.We stood quietly like that for some time. We both looked at the remains of the mansion and shuddered.-Alright. Enough. Whew. Things like this don\u2019t fit me! Aside from that, Kim Gong-ja, you were amazing earlier!\u201cWhat?\u201d-Using a method of your own to subjugate the boss. It was incredible. I\u2019ll compliment you!I furrowed my eyebrows. He was probably being genuine, but I got goosebumps.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s with the sudden compliments?\u201d-Kid. I give compliments when there\u2019s something to compliment. This was something you overcame with not your luck, but your skill. You and I are partners, so we should be happy together. Right?I furrowed my eyebrows even more.\u201cWeird\u2026\u201d-Nah. What do you mean weird. Good job, Kim Gong-ja! You\u2019re so cool, Kim Gong-ja! Let\u2019s continue going for the Rank 1 when the 11th floor opens! So what if they all curse you saying it\u2019s a scam. They should get a cheat skill if they feel so wronged!He laughed cheerfully. Hm? Why was he suddenly being like this? Unless the sun rose from the west, or the tower collapsed tomorrow, there was no way Bae Hu-ryeong would be like this.It was then.[Announcing to everyone.][Today, the 10th floor\u2019s stage has been cleared.]A voice.[Announcing to everyone again.]It wasn\u2019t a voice that only I heard. A voice filled the sky.[Today.][The 10th floor stage has been cleared.]A congratulatory message that signaled a new era.[After 24 hours, the 11th floor stage is being opened.]Whoosh\u2026!Something exploded in the sky. It was fireworks. First, a purple firework exploded, then red, blue, yellow, and all kinds of various colors decorated the sky.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dI blankly looked at the sky. The fireworks didn\u2019t disappear even though they exploded. They twisted and squirmed, and slowly formed a shape.[24:00:00]It was the shape of a clock.[23:59:59]And the clock of the sky started to move.\u201c\u2026\u201dBae Hu-ryeong and I looked at the atmosphere.Then, he muttered to himself.-It\u2019s finally the start of the real show.I nodded my head.\u201cYeah.\u201d-I saw a fireworks show like this when I was alive.\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m also seeing for the second time. But.\u201dI clenched my fist.\u201cBut the past me was in a first floor bar. It was just a spectacle to watch. I didn\u2019t even know what had happened. I lost the chance and ended up staying a F Class hunter my entire life\u2026damn. The more I think about it, the more stupid I was.\u201d-Heehee.Bae Hu-ryeong laughed.-So. How does it feel being promoted from an extra to a main character?I didn\u2019t answer right away. Instead, I pulled out my phone.It was to see how the online community was reacting to this.-what\u2019s this what\u2019s the fireworks-There\u2019s fireworks on the first floor. Is it just this floor?-im on the 3rd floor but theres also fireworks hereAs expected.The fireworks in the middle of the day were burning up the online community.-anyone hear the voice just now-i heard the 10th floor was cleared but is that true-did the black dragon guild clear it?-There wasn\u2019t any announcement. What\u2019s going on?Online posts.-The next assault that the Hunter\u2019s Association announced is 2 weeks later.-its def not the black dragon! They\u2019re all in front of the cafe in front of babylon bank on the 1st floor. picture attached as proof-who cleared it?More posts.-[Breaking News] 10th floor cleared!-Guild that cleared it hasn\u2019t been revealed yet.-[Breaking News] Black Dragon, no announcement of clearing.With every second, new posts were uploaded on the community. It was just one of them. All hunter communities were like this, and this fire soon spread to other communities.News agencies in Babylon frantically released one-sentence articles, and gossip sparked the fire again.-who is it if not black dragon?-im praying at the ten thousand temple rn. its crazy here. seems like the its not the ten thousand temple either.-yeah! it\u2019s the sword saint!-the sword saint cleared it by himself. 100%-ah, sword saint can do thatAt first, the fire burned individually. Some pushed for the Ten Thousand Temple. Other places pointed at the Sword Saint. Count, Venomous Snake, Crusader, etc. All the greatest hunters were mentioned at least once.But\u2026-what r u talking about. sword saint is drinking milk in a bar?-its not sword saint. picture attached as proof-venomous snake was teaching training guild members-what are you talking about?-crusader working in babylon square-i asked myself. sword saint said it\u2019s not him-wait. It doesn\u2019t make sense-this is sanghyun\u2019s executive. I can\u2019t reveal my real name but its not sangryun.-why isn\u2019t there a single guild saying they cleared it-what the f***The burning communities gathered as one. With one huge question.-then who is it-does no one know who cleared it?-who\u2019s the hunter that subjugated the 10th floor?-just who\u2026\u318d\u318d\u318dI turned off my phone\u2019s home screen.And I decided to answer what Bae Hu-ryeong asked me earlier.\u201cMy feelings right now.\u201dFrom sometime.I was smiling.\u201cIt honestly feels great.\u201dIt was something I had never felt in my entire life. But I knew what feeling this was without anyone telling me. I instinctively knew.It was the feeling of being at the top.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m on top of the world.\u201d-Right?Bae Hu-ryeong smirked.-That\u2019s nothing more than an illusion. You\u2019re not on top, and you only subjugated the 10th floor. But it\u2019s not 100% an illusion. Kim Gong-ja. You\u2019re closer to the top than anyone else in your world.\u201cI know.\u201dI turned my gaze.\u201cNow all that\u2019s left is to really be at the top.\u201dThe stone stairs who had to pass if you wanted to challenge the hellfire residence. There was one person running up the stairs.It was the doorkeeper that I had tricked saying I had a terminal illness.\u201cPant, cough\u2026! Gasp. Hunter-nim\u2026!\u201dThe doorkeeper was soaked in sweat. It seemed like he had run immediately over. And he stopped in front of me gasping for breath.\u201cThat\u2026that just now. W, Was it you?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201cT, The 10th floor clear!\u201dThe doorkeeper shouted.\u201cI\u2019m in charge today\u2026and you were the only hunter to challenge the 10th floor today, so\u2026.it\u2019s a mess right now. The Hunter\u2019s Association keeps on calling me to ask what happened\u2026!\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dI looked at the doorkeeper. Buzz. Buzzz. When he was talking to me, his pocket kept on vibrating. It was probably the calls. Like he said, he seemed like the entire Tower was panicked.I smiled.\u201cWhat are you going to do about it if I really cleared it?\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cI asked what you\u2019re going to do if I\u2019m really the hunter who cleared the 10th floor.\u201d\u201cT, That\u2019s\u2026\u201dThe doorkeeper had a flustered face.\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to check your ID so\u2026I would do it now.\u201d\u201cNaah. Doorkeeper-nim. That\u2019s strange. It wasn\u2019t that you couldn\u2019t check my ID. You even took 100 Gold from me.\u201d\u201cT, That\u2019s.\u201d\u201cYou go through a lot while working.\u201dI softly pat his shoulder. He looked at me with a disoriented face. And I passed him to head down the stone stairs.I heard a desperate shout from behind me.\u201cP, Please wait a moment! Hunter-nim! Even your nickname is alright! Please at least tell me your nickname before you leave! Or else I\u2019ll be beat up by my Association seniors!\u201dI answered without looking back.\u201cI don\u2019t have a nickname.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWork hard. Ah, and don\u2019t follow me. Or I\u2019ll really run away.\u201dThankfully, the doorkeeper didn\u2019t follow after me. Even if he did, it didn\u2019t matter. I could easily lose him since he was tired from the stairs.-Hey. His face is a sight to see. It\u2019s like he saw a ghost.Bae Hu-ryeong snickered looking behind him.-Anyways, good job. That\u2019s how you raise the value of your name. Yup. You have to make people find you. Even without you telling\u2026\u201cSword Emperor.\u201d-Huh? What?I stood in front of the transmission stone that was in front of the 10th floor entrance.\u201cI, realized.\u201d-Realized what?\u201cWhy you suddenly complimented me.\u201dI reserved the one heading down to the 1st floor and spoke.\u201cThe bet.\u201dBae Hu-ryeong paused.\u201cI remembered. You promised to call me Gong-ja-nim if I cleared the boss in 2 Coins, right? Wow, what are you gonna do now. I really did it in 2 Coins. Our Sword Emperor-nim is in big trouble.\u201d-Hey. Gong-ja\u2026but we\u2019re partners\u2026isn\u2019t that a bit wrong?Bae Hu-ryeong pleaded with a face that was about to cry.-Think about it. Partners have equal standing. You and me. Equal standing. Someone who dominated up to the 99th floor and someone who\u2019ll challenge the 100th floor. Hey, partner! Friend! How beautiful is that!I brightly smiled.\u201cAlright. Now call me Gong-ja-nim when you talk to me.\u201d-\u2026\u201cForever.\u201dIt was then, when Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s face fell in despair.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 -The Luxury of a Cup of Coffee (1)Translator: HHMumble mumble.\u201cSo who subjugated the 10th floor for real?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been watching the news but there\u2019s nothing. Only gossip\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the Black Dragon hiding it on purpose? And they\u2019ll do a big reveal\u2026\u201d\u201cAh. I said it\u2019s the Sword Saint for sure!\u201dIn the city of the tower\u2019s first floor, people were hectic.People were happy that the difficult 10th floor was finally cleared. But they were all gathered in cafes to discuss who the secret challenger was.How would they react?\u201cMm.\u201dIf they knew that person himself was sitting right next to them.\u201cIt\u2019s sweet.\u201dI sipped my caramel macchiato. This cafe across Sangryun was the only Starbucks in Babylon.I admired that fact that even though you couldn\u2019t leave the tower once you entered it, there were still franchises. And there was even the franchise with the red nosed chubby old man as the mascot.Ah. The desire of humans!\u201cWhat do you think, Sword Emperor? Isn\u2019t victory sweet? Actually, I feel like even an espresso will taste sweet right now. Hm?\u201d-\u2026..\u201cHm. Is this earphone broken? That\u2019s weird. There\u2019s no reply.\u201dI tapped the earphone in my ear. Of course, there wasn\u2019t any sound coming from it.It was a simple trick of the eye.I would seem like a crazy person if I just spoke to myself, so I pretended like I was calling someone. It actually worked quite well. No one in the cafe looked at me like I was weird.\u201cSword Emperor-nim? Sword Emperor? Excuse me, Mr.Psychopath. Excuse me, Mr. Crazy Guy?\u201d-\u2026what.\u201cAh. Now I can hear you. I thought you were deaf now. Tsk tsk, you made the superior Gong-ja-nim worry. Humans shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d-\u2026\u201cAh, right. You\u2019re a ghost, not a human. I\u2019m stupid, so I forgot. Oh right! Sword Emperor. Can I speak informally to you now? It\u2019s weird if I speak formally to you when you call me Gong-ja-nim. Right?\u201d-\u2026fuck\u2026Floating opposite of me, Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s shoulders shook.-I\u2019ve never experienced this humiliation in my entire life\u2026emperor\u2026how could someone who was called an emperor become like this\u2026\u201cNah. It was just a joke. Even if I\u2019m called Gong-ja-nim, I couldn\u2019t speak informally to such a senior. Although I could. I can. I\u2019ll just call you Sword Emperor-nim from now on. How\u2019s that? Satisfied?\u201d-Just kill me instead!Bae Hu-ryeong cried out.-Get a new skill and replace the Sword Constellation slot! You can do that, you son of a bitch! Just kill me!\u201cOh no. This person\u2019s saying things he shouldn\u2019t. Aren\u2019t we partners, partner? Forever friends. Best friends! Who in the world would kill their best friend? From now on, we\u2019ll be together forever.\u201d-Sob sob sob. Whatever\u2026I\u2019m just not gonna say anything. Grandpops Marcus. I wanna go back to grandpops\u2026Ah, it was sweet.I looked up at the sky sipping my coffee.[22:32:50]The clock in the sky showed that an hour had passed.Just when I was thinking it was time for it to show up.-Meow.\u201cMm?\u201dA brown cat crawled up to me. It was too clean to be a stray. If there was something special about it, it was that there were two gold pieces on its neck instead of a bell.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dGulp.I wondered how I should deal with this situation.\u2018Gold Piece Cat.\u2019-Hm?\u2018Gold Piece Cat. It\u2019s a really famous\u2026ah. People wouldn\u2019t know about it now.\u2019This cat wasn\u2019t a normal pet.It would be a well-known mascot of the Tower about 5 years later.\u2018\u2026I didn\u2019t know such a bigwig would come to me.\u2019I supposed I should pretend like I didn\u2019t know anything.I calmly looked down at the cat. Controlling my face.\u201cAre you lost?\u2019-Meow.The brown cat rubbed its head on my legs. I was a bit dumbfounded. If I didn\u2019t know its real identity, I would just think it was a friendly cat.\u201cDo you wanna stay with me until your owner comes?\u201d-Meoooow.I lifted the cat onto my laps. The cat calmly licked its paws in my lap like that\u2019s what it wanted the entire time. It even yawned with a meow.\u2018I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s a person crazy for cats. The acting is incredible.\u2019I rubbed the cat\u2019s head.-Meooow.As I was listening to the cat purr, a group of hunters came towards me. One of them spoke to me.\u201cExcuse me. Is your name Kim Gong-ja?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dJust by a glance I could tell their equipment was expensive. They weren\u2019t just a ragtag bunch. If not guild masters, at least executives. A group of those kinds of people were gathered around the cafe.I showed my ID to them.\u201cI wondered how long it would take. It took exactly 1 hour and 30 minutes I see.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe hunters\u2019 eyes shook upon seeing my ID. They frantically pulled their phones out and started to contact others.\u201cYes. I found him!\u201d\u201cIn the cafe right across the bank\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. Other guilds are also here\u2026yes. Yes, sir! Understood, boss.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t have him taken by other guilds!\u201dIt was the eve of a storm.I contentedly watched what was happening in front of me.\u2018I feel like I\u2019m a VIP.\u2019-Well. Most guilds will try to scout you. You cleared the 10th floor by yourself. That\u2019s a real VIP.\u2018Mm. I guess. Even a person who cleared the 99th floor calls me Gong-ja-nim, so it would be weird if I wasn\u2019t a VIP.\u2019-Fuck! Fuck! Fuuuck!The hunters ended their calls one by one.And they all looked at me with nervous faces.As I waited for the first guild to speak up, a large blonde hunter took a step forward.\u201cI am the HR team leader of the Civil Militia Guild. Kim Gong-ja hunter-nim. As you may already know, the Civil Militia is the most honorable guild in Babylon. If you enter our guild\u2026!\u201d\u201cJust a moment.\u201dI lifted my hand. The HR team leader of Civil Militia paused.\u201cSorry for cutting you off. But let\u2019s speak after two things are clearly established.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cFirst. Let\u2019s not leak anything to the media.\u201dI slowly looked at the hunters. I could guarantee that none of these hunters would be a lower rank than me. Before I regressed, I wouldn\u2019t even have dared to look at them. But now, I didn\u2019t fall short to any of them.My performance.I had the achievement of being the first person to subjugate the 10th floor.This was like a landmark that no hunter could destroy regardless of their level.Competent hunters considered performance important. If they were competent, they wouldn\u2019t be able to treat me like I was nothing.\u201cI won\u2019t sign a contract with any guild that leaks my name to the public. I won\u2019t even associate with them. Please be aware.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026u, until when?\u201dAnother hunt raised their hand to ask.\u201cThe Golden Newspaper reporters are sticking their noses into all the guilds\u2026Kim Gong-ja-nim. I don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ll be able to hide this.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m not saying to hide this forever.\u201dI pointed at the sky.The hunters all looked up at the sky too.[22:25:31]\u201cJust until today. Until the clock reaches 00:00:00, please keep the ban.\u201d\u201cAh! Alright. Somehow until then\u2026understood.\u201dThe hunters all sighed in relief.I smiled.\u2018I can\u2019t be held up by reporters. Not when I have to run as fast I can to the 11th floor when it opens.\u2019I opened my mouth again.\u201cThat\u2019s the first condition. And for the second-\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe hunters all looked at me with stiff expressions. They were probably nervous about what difficult condition I would request.I grinned and looked around me.\u201c-this is a public area so let\u2019s respect the other customers.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you see the customers looking this way? They\u2019re surprised because you all suddenly gathered here.\u201dI was right.All the other customers were looking this way. Most of the customers whispered to each other with suspicious eyes. There was even a customer who looked like they were filming this.\u201cIt\u2019s a nuisance.\u201d\u201cI know you were all rushed looking for me, but let\u2019s take it slow. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ll run away.\u201d\u201cS, Sorry.\u201dThe hunters realized the environment and dispersed.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t tell you the reason but if you could move\u2026\u201d\u201cSir. How much would it cost to rent this cafe for 1 hour?\u201d\u201cEveryone, thank you for your understanding! If you come to Chen Mu-mun sometime, we\u2019ll\u2026\u201dThe scale of the large clans\u2019 executives was definitely different.It took 5 minutes for them to make everyone leave and rent to the cafe from the owner. The cafe was empty after only 5 minutes.\u201cAlright.\u201dWe entered a corner of the cafe and started to speak.\u201cThen let\u2019s start the negotiations. State your conditions.\u201dFunnily, they all had a cup of coffee in their hands. It was because I said they were being a nuisance. How cute.\u201c\u2026Our Civil Militia offers 10,000 Gold for the contract fee.\u201dThat was the starting point.\u201c10,000 Gold? Dang. You\u2019re showing you\u2019re poor in a place like this. Kim Gong-ja hunter-nim! Please sign up with the Adventure League. We promise 20,000 Gold, and an executive position.\u201d\u201cCome to Chen Mu-mun, hunter-nim. Our guild grows combat specific hunters and we\u2019ll take you in as a trainer with 25,000 Gold.\u201d\u201cThe position of a trainer is just annoying. Please think well. Kim Gong-ja hunternim! If you come into our Ten Thousand Temple, we guarantee an honorary position. To be honest, we hope you promote our clan. With 30,000 Gold and a separate pay for other jobs\u2026\u201d\u201cAssociation! Please work as an ambassador for the Association!\u201dIt was a mess.The HR team leaders all pleaded with me. I understood how they felt. All the high guilds probably felt pressured by Sword Saint.The lone hunter who didn\u2019t register in any of the guilds who was Rank 1!Because of that, people probably wondered. If there was really a need to register in a guild. If solo play was the best option\u2026\u2018Although it\u2019s because Sword Saint is special.\u2019It still hurt the reputation of the guilds.\u2018And if a new hero that was as famous as the Sword Saint was born?\u2019I smiled.\u2018They would do anything to scout him.\u2019At the very least, block other guilds from taking him!Was probably the orders that these team leaders got. It was obvious.\u201cC, Civil Militia can give 36,000 Gold as the contract fee\u2026\u201d\u201cSheesh. The poor guilds should step back. Hm?\u201d\u201cAre you trying to fight us with thousands? Don\u2019t you understand the situation?\u201d\u201cUs Alchemy Castle can\u2026!\u201dIt was then.\u201cSangryun.\u201dA heavy voice came from somewhere.\u201c50,000 Gold.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe hunters all turned their heads. Their gazes landed on my lap. To be exact, it was the cat on my lap.The cat meowed and jumped up. It\u2019s feet were soft paws when it jumped off my lap, but when it landed, that wasn\u2019t the case. They lightly landed with shoes.\u201c50,000 Gold. I can give it to you here if you prefer.\u201dThe person looked back. Clang. The 2 gold pieces on their necklace made a clear sound as they shook.\u201cAnd the spot of Sangryun\u2019s vice leader position.\u201dHunter Rank 3.The guild master of the Merchant\u2019s Association. Count.\u201c50,000 Gold and vice guild leader. How\u2019s that.\u201dA woman with the skill of [Metamorphosis] brightly smiled and spoke. Although she was probably over 40, she looked to be in her 20s. She was probably drinking elixirs everyday.She was the wealthiest person in the tower.\u201cMm.\u201dA bigwig that I wouldn\u2019t have met in the past.I forced myself to calm down and smiled.\u201cNow we\u2019re talking.\u201dThe first step of negotiating for my body ended.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 -The Luxury of a Cup of Coffee (2)Translator: HH\u201cHmm. You got guts.\u201dCount slightly lifted a corner of her mouth.\u201cAnd you don\u2019t seem to be that surprised that a cat turned into a human\u2026you\u2019re not like young folks these days. Ah, this is a compliment.\u201d\u201cThank you. I do have guts. I even see ghosts and stuff.\u201d\u201cAhahaha. You\u2019re even relaxed enough to joke. Amazing.\u201dCount started to wave her fan and laughed. Even though he didn\u2019t say that as a joke.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dThe hunters all peeked at each other. Only the Count laughed. The team leaders who had been loudly shouting prices became quiet as mice with the arrival of the Count.\u201cUh, maam. Pardon me, but\u2026\u201dThe large blond hunter carefully spoke up.\u201cPardon yourself.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t 50,000 Gold and the vice guild master\u2026too much? O, Of course, subjugating the 10th floor is amazing. But\u2026the skills of Kim Gong-ja\u2026are\u2026not known\u2026\u201dAs he went on, he stuttered more. It was because he suddenly forgot out to speak. The Count was covering her mouth with her fan and looking at him. She smiled with her eyes past the fan.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you done pardoning?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cThen before you pardon yourself more, bring your bosses. Sorry, you guys won\u2019t understand me. Ah, it doesn\u2019t matter if you can bet higher than 50,000 Gold. Just sit here comfortably.\u201dShe was politely telling them to \u2018piss off.\u2019And since they were being told to piss off, there was nothing else they could do. They left one by one.And after 10 minutes, like they handed the baton over to someone else, new hunters entered the cafe.\u201cFucking Sangryun!\u201dRank 5. Venomous Snake, Guild Master of Chen Mu-mun.\u201cMm. I\u2019m a step behind. I admit it\u2019s our mistake.\u201dRank 4. Guild Master of Ten Thousand Temple, heretic questioner.\u201cMistake isn\u2019t the right word. Our job isn\u2019t to welcome a new hero, but to stop the existing hunters from being confused. You were too excessive.\u201dRank 8. Vice Guild Master of Civil Militia, Crusader.\u201c\u2026\u201dRank 2. And even the Guild Master of Black Dragon, Black Witch.\u2018Wow.\u2019I exclaimed to myself.\u2018They\u2019re all assembled.\u201dI was proud of myself. They were the highest rankers that I only saw in interview videos and such. They all sat down in front of me. I was able to realize how much more expensive my body was now.\u201cWelcome.\u201dCount cupped her chin and laughed.\u201cI don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s been since we gathered like this. It feels like yesterday when we subjugated the 2nd floor together. Now we\u2019re all old.\u201d\u201cSsangryun. [TN: An extra S on Sangryun sounds like bitch in Korean.] Before I boil you in soup, shut up.\u201dVenomous Snake growled.Chen Mu-mun\u2019s Guild Master, the one-eyed hunter. The person known to be the one to successfully clear the 2nd floor had an eye patch on his eye.They said it was a scar after challenging Sword Saint.\u201cI heard on the way here. What, 50,000 Gold? Vice Guild Master? You always cosplay a beast and even your IQ\u2019s been reduced to a beast\u2019s? The 50,000 Gold I could understand since that\u2019s Ssangryun\u2019s specialty, throwing money around, but Vice Guild Master my as\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright! Let\u2019s order coffee!\u201dHeretic Questioner spoke brightly.\u201cIt\u2019s rude to enter a cafe and not even order. Should the people who lead the greatest clans in the tower be like this? I\u2019ll order a cafe mocha. Everyone?\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019d like a warm americano.\u201d\u201cA cool cafe latte sounds nice.\u201d\u201c\u2026hazelnut latte. Hot. Additional shots. Grande.\u201dThe Guild Masters spoke one by one like they had been waiting. The only person to be surprised was Venomous Snake.\u201cWhat? Coffee? Hey. The world\u2019s been turned upside down because the 10th floor was cleared, and coffee goes down your throats? Are these bastards suckers for caffeine or\u2026\u201d\u201cChen Mu-mun would like a dark espresso, I see. Understood.\u201d\u201cThis fucking religious guy\u2026?\u201d\u201cStore owner-nim! Please take our orders!\u201dHeretic Questioner ignored the Venomous Snake and shouted. Flinch. The barista at the counter trembled. She became pale at the fact that she would be making coffee for the highest rankers.\u201cW, Would\u2026you like to\u2026.order\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dHeretic Questioner beamed.The Guild Master of Ten Thousand Temple. The blonde hunter. The young man who was in charge of making sure religious fights didn\u2019t occur in this place where people from all over the tower were gathered was famous for speaking formally to everyone.I heard he even spoke politely to terrorists he questioned.\u201cOne tall iced cafe mocha. One tall warm americano. One tall iced caffe latte. One grande warm hazelnut latte, with a shot. And one espresso! That\u2019s my order!\u201d\u201cYes! Uh, yes\u2026!\u201d\u201cAh, right-\u201dHeretic Questioner turned his gaze.\u201c-what would hunter Kim Gong-ja-nim like?\u201dAll kinds of gazes landed on me. The table instantly became quiet. An amused gaze. A bright gaze. A violent gaze. A cold gaze. An indifferent gaze. Five faces and 10 eyeballs silently looked at me.Like they were testing my reaction.-Don\u2019t be scared.Then, Bae Hu-ryeong, who had been quiet all this time, spoke up.-They\u2019re not much. Just think that they\u2019re not that much! You were even killed by grandpops Marcus. None of them are better than grandpops.\u2018I know.\u2019I knew well.\u2018It\u2019s just a mind game.\u2019And it was a twisted, tricky mind game.I shrugged my shoulders.\u201cStore owner-nim. Do you have a menu?\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cMaybe because I have a macchiato earlier, I don\u2019t really feel coffee right now. I want to decide after seeing a menu\u2026mm. Never mind. Please give me a hot chocolate if you have one.\u201d\u201cA, Alright.\u201dComposure.I had to show a composed attitude right now.\u2018These people didn\u2019t randomly come here at once.\u2019Earlier, when the team leaders came, and now, the hunters all arrived at the same time.Was this a coincidence?\u2018Never!\u2019A strategy hidden behind coincidence.They were acting.\u2018This is a strategy to make me lose my composure.\u2019It was a high-class strategy, kind of like how gangsters ganged up on one person to threaten them.\u2018Well. Even if they\u2019re a bit more scarier than hunters\u2026\u2019It was a frozen and tense atmosphere.\u2018It\u2019s nothing compared to being burned alive.\u2019In other words, it was just a little ice.Before I was killed by the Flame Emperor, I would\u2019ve trembled in fear seeing these people\u2026but not anymore. I wasn\u2019t scared at all.The reason was ridiculously simple.\u2018Try to kill me if you want.\u2019Even if they killed me, I would be fine!Bae Hu-ryeong nodded his head.-Yeah. Like I said. That talent is your strength! Glare at them like they can try to kill you if they want. Put power behind your eyes! Like these losers who can\u2019t even kill you are acting tough!\u2018Uh, thanks for the support. But I\u2019m not going to let you off the hook.-This damned\u2026!Bae Hu-ryeong grabbed his head in despair.\u201cMm.\u201dOn the other hand, the Heretic Questioner\u2019s expression changed.\u201cInteresting. It seems like you didn\u2019t do much before subjugating the 10th floor. A sudden change\u2026I guess you can\u2019t tell what\u2019s gonna happen to anyone!\u201d\u201cHe did do something.\u201dThe Count covered her mouth with her fan and smiled with her eyes.\u201cThat youngster was chosen as my guild\u2019s lottery winner. He\u2019s got luck. And guts. And I don\u2019t know how, but seeing as he cleared the 10th floor, he\u2019s got skills. Luck. Guts. Skills. If a youngster has those 3, they\u2019ll succeed.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026so that\u2019s why I said earlier!\u201dVenomous Snake sighed from across the table.\u201cDon\u2019t do this and that and just scout him! Would the person who cracked the 10th floor be a newbie who doesn\u2019t know anything? Tsk. We put on an act even though it didn\u2019t work\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not important.\u201dThe Guild Master of Black Dragon, who had been sitting quietly stood up.\u201cJust because some of our reputations were hurt doesn\u2019t mean all of ours were. We\u2019re all busy. Let\u2019s push back blaming others.\u201d\u201cGrunt\u2026\u201d\u201cHunter Kim Gong-ja.\u201dThe Witch looked at me.\u201cI\u2019ll ask directly. Which guild are you planning on signing up for?\u201dA steady gaze.\u201cIf you\u2019re planning on not registering in any guild like the Sword Saint, let us know in advance. We have to discuss how to handle the media if that happens.\u201d\u201cAnd if I\u2019m planning on applying?\u201d\u201cAn intense auction will start.\u201dThe Witch calmly spoke.\u201cWe\u2019ve stayed too long on the 9th floor. It was just tough. But since you cleared the 10th floor, the chance to advertise the value of the Tower to the outside world has come again.\u201d\u201cA chance, you say.\u201d\u201cYes. Chance. A chance to bring people from the outside who aren\u2019t just war refugees.\u201dThe barista brought a tray over and served coffee. No one spoke. The Witch just took a sip of her hazelnut latte.\u201cAnd most of all. The hunters who were living comfortably on the 1st floor will have a renewed sense of adventure with the 10th floor open. What kind of world will be waiting there? Even the realists will wonder.\u201cThe shortage of food will be solved.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe Witch looked at me like she didn\u2019t expect what I said.\u201c\u2026you\u2019re quick to understand. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s hard to manage the supply of food with just 9 floors.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been opening a pathway from the outside world to here 24/7.\u201dThe Count smiled.\u201cI\u2019m not as strong as I used to be. It\u2019s a bit tiring with my age.\u201d\u201cWe need a new product.\u201dThe Witch continued to speak.\u201cWe need to bring adventurers to the land beyond the 10th floor. And we need to find things that can only be found past the 10th floor.\u201d\u201cThen we need a way to positively appeal to the outside world. Something like [Start of a New Era!]. And you\u2019re saying that\u2019s me, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Right. Exactly on point.\u201dThey were all things that would happen in the future.That was also the reason why the Guild Masters couldn\u2019t touch the Flame Emperor. To be a hero. Being the new icon of the new era. It was because for the tower to keep growing, there needed to be new heroes!\u2018But the Black Dragon still tried to assassinate the Flame Emperor.\u2019I thought of the conversation I overheard in the slums.-Who ordered you to kill me? Just answer that.-Was it the Witch of Black Dragon?The Saintess had nodded her head back then.If she was telling the truth, then the Witch in front of me had tried to poison the Flame Emperor. I couldn\u2019t know the reason why now but\u2026\u2018We\u2019ll get along.\u2019Why?\u2018Someone who hated the Flame Emperor can\u2019t be a bad person!\u2019Like the enemy of my enemy was my friend. I felt a camaraderie with her.\u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying. You\u2019re saying the guild that successfully catches me can be the new symbol of the tower\u2019s growth. And other guilds will probably have to act as lackeys.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll feel bad if that happens\u2026so let\u2019s do this.\u201dThe hunters focused on my words.I pulled out the trump card I had.\u201c\u2026a trump card?\u201dThe Witch tilted her head.\u201cAre you saying we should choose by playing a game? The guild you\u2019ll be in?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll join the guild of the winner. I don\u2019t even need a position or contract fee. However!\u201dI grinned.\u201cIf I win, I\u2019ll apply simultaneously to all your guilds.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAh. I\u2019ll only be a guild member on the outside. In reality, you have to treat me like I\u2019m on the same level as you all. And you can sell my image, so it\u2019s good for you. I\u2019ll be on the same level as the leaders of all the greatest guilds. How\u2019s that sound?\u201dAt that moment, the eyes of the Guild Masters changed.\u201cHahahah.\u201dCount burst out in laughter.\u201cA youngster who just subjugated a single floor wants to be treated like us?\u201d\u201cYes. If I win.\u201d\u201cAmusing. I\u2019m fine with that.\u201dThe Count put her coffee down and looked around.\u201cWhat about you guys?\u201d\u201cAs long as there\u2019s no tricks, I\u2019m fine as well!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner agreed first.\u201c\u2026let\u2019s not use our skills. Then you all have the advantage. If you get caught using your skill, that person\u2019s automatically disqualified.\u201dNext was the Venomous Snake.\u201cOur guild is poor anyway so if we bid on you we\u2019ll lose. Even if I lose the game, I won\u2019t lose anything else, and if I win, I\u2019ll gain a lot. Sounds good.\u201dAnd the Crusader agreed.\u201c\u2026\u201dLastly, the Witch nodded her head.\u201cFine. I\u2019ll accept your suggestion.\u201dThe gamble was on.We decided the rules of poker. The rules itself were simple. The highest rankers neatly checked whether there were any tricks on the cards.\u2018Sword Emperor.\u2019And when the cards were distributed.-Huh\u2026?\u2018You don\u2019t really want to call me Gong-ja-nim, right?\u2019I called out to Bae Hu-ryeong, who was still in despair.\u2018Let\u2019s do this.\u2019-Do what\u2026?\u2018Just call me that until the end of this game.\u2019Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s eyes widened.-Huh? Can I really do that?!\u2018Yes. Of course.\u2019I grinned.\u2018Instead, you have to tell me what cards each of these players are holding.\u2019-Yes! Yes! Alright!Bae Hu-ryeong jumped up and down.-That\u2019s fucking easy! As expected of Gong-ja-nim! Look at this generous guy! I don\u2019t know how someone can be this nice! You want to know what cards these bastards have? Yup, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll even tell you if they\u2019re cheating or not! Sir!Alright.Time to begin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 -The Luxury of a Cup of Coffee (3)Translator: HH-Gong-ja-nim! This is a straight. Kill him.\u201cDie.\u201d-Ah. Gong-ja-nim. He\u2019s bluffing. Ah, you poor thing. Call him out and kill him.\u201cCall.\u201d-Dang. He has the same cards as Gong-ja-nim. But what can we do? Gong-ja-nim\u2019s two pairs are the highest? Heehee. This is fun. Let\u2019s keep on going until we die, Gong-ja-nim!\u201cRaise.\u201d-Wow. He\u2019s trying to get a full house? Gong-ja-nim. Don\u2019t worry. I just looked under the table to see the cards. He won\u2019t get a full house. Trust me, and go!\u201cAll in.\u201dAbout 30 rounds of poker continued.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dThe guy opposite of me trembled. Venomous Snake. The one-eyed hunter was burning up.\u201cShit! This is a scam!\u201dThe Venomous Snake burst up. Boom! The table shook. Other hunters raised their cups like they expected this. Fortunately, we were able to avoid spilt coffee. Mm. Good timing.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense! It\u2019s already been 30 rounds but this guy hasn\u2019t lost once. Even bluffing doesn\u2019t work. This is a scam! I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s passive, but he\u2019s using a fucking skill! It\u2019s a scam! A scam!\u201d\u201cDo you have proof?\u201dI sipped my hot chocolate. It was cold now, and became a weak chocolate latte. This was tasty in itself as well.\u201cI might be an expert at poker. I\u2019ll feel wronged if you accuse me like this without any proof. Look upon me nicely, sunbae-nim. [TN: Sunbae-Term for addressing someone with more experience than you in a particular subject]\u201cHey, is this really a F Class hunter?!\u201dThe Venomous Hunter shouted while looking around him.\u201cHow is this a F Class hunter! I\u2019ll believe it if you say the Association lied about it after taking some side money. He\u2019s at least a B Class!\u201d\u201cWow. How\u2019d you know? That I\u2019m not a F Class?\u201d\u201cRight? I knew i\u2026.\u201d\u201cActually, I became an E Class Hunter yesterday. But I was busy clearing the 10th floor yesterday and I wasn\u2019t able to let the Association know.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI smiled.\u201cThank you for judging me so highly. And Mr. Master. You\u2019re out of chips.\u201d\u201cEh\u2026\u201dThe Venomous Snake turned away and plodded away. To the out zone. It was where the people without any more chips sat.\u201cWelcome! Chen-mu Master!\u201dHeretic Questioner, who had been out first, brightly smiled.\u201cI thought it was about time for you to be out. So I ordered another expresso! You don\u2019t need to refuse. Drink as much as you want.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like espresso\u2026\u201d\u201cYes! I know. Being picky is bad!\u201d\u201cFucking zealot\u2026\u201dThe Venomous Snake sat down in the out zone looking like he was gonna cry.Now, there were 3 hunters left in the game. Me. The Witch of Black Dragon. And unexpectedly, Crusader.\u201cMm.\u201dCrusader looked down at her cards and wrinkled her forehead. She was the vice leader of the Civil Militia. A hunter famed for her righteousness. The Civil Militia was a guild established to protect the capital of the first floor. They were like the police. And I heard she donated all his wealth to an orphanage or something. [TN: I thought Crusader was a guy but we learn she\u2019s a girl in this chapter! Korean\u2026tsk tsk tsk.]\u201cI lose.\u201dCrusader placed her cards down with a sigh.\u201cI thought I had a pretty good poker face. Kim Gong-ja. Do you have a clairvoyant skill?\u201d\u201cMaybe. It could be clairvoyance or telepathy. Try guessing.\u201d\u201cNewbies these days.\u201dThe Crusader smiled bitterly. She bowed and moved to the out zone.\u201cHey! How could you give up so easily!\u201dThe Venomous Snake shouted in anger at her. The surroundings of his mouth were messy, like he spilled his espresso.\u201cYou should stick next to him like a hunting dog even if you think it\u2019s not gonna work! Are you gonna leave that con-artist be!\u201d\u201cCon-artist. That\u2019s too much to the new hero.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s obviously using a skill!\u201dCrusader shrugged her shoulders.\u201cI knew from the beginning.\u201d\u201cHuh? What?\u201d\u201cIt would\u2019ve been weird if I didn\u2019t know. Would a newbie really suggest a game of luck without any preparation? The fact that he challenged us to this game means that he was letting us know he could use a skill and get away with it without being caught. And we accepted that challenge.\u201dThe Venomous Snake gaped with his mouth open.\u201cT, That\u2019s how it was?\u201d\u201cChen-mu Master\u2026it\u2019s good that you work hard for martial arts, but use your head.\u201dCrusader looked at the Venomous Snake pitifully.\u201cFrom the beginning, we had nothing to lose. If we win, it would be awesome. But even if we lose\u2026like the newbie said. He\u2019s going to apply to all the guilds here. And that\u2019s a pretty good result in itself.\u201d\u201cB, But. We have our pride! How are we gonna be treated the same as\u2026\u201d\u201cDoes pride feed you?\u201dThe Venomous Snake was left speechless.\u201cEspresso feeds you! Here, Chen-mu Master. Drink up!\u201d\u201cFuuck\u2026\u201dIn the end, the Rank 2 player was left, the Black Witch.And me.It was us two.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe Witch focused on her cards and spoke.\u201cIt\u2019s a relief.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSince you can get us.\u201dThe Witch bet her chips. Raise. She raised the bar. Was she trying to provoke me?\u201cI\u2019m from Ukraine. To be exact, I\u2019m from where Ukraine used to be. With the war, after I lost my family, I suffered a lot. As you know. A woman living alone outside or in this tower is tough.\u201d\u201cI suppose so.\u201dI gladly accepted her provocation. Re-raise. I raised the stakes.\u201c\u2026\u201dShe hesitated for a moment and tapped the table twice. It was that she was accepting victory. The Count spread the cards out as the dealer.\u201cSo what are you trying to say?\u201dI rubbed my chin, pretending to contemplate.\u201cEveryone in the tower. And especially the first generation. It\u2019s hard to find someone who doesn\u2019t have a heart-breaking story. I\u2019m an ordinary orphan as well.\u201dMy cards was one pair.\u201c\u2026this top is like my hometown.\u201dHer\u2019s were a flush.\u201cIn the tower, people don\u2019t ask where you\u2019re from. No, we made it so it was like this. The fact that I\u2019m from Ukraine. That Chen-mu Master\u2019s from China. That you\u2019re from Korea\u2026that isn\u2019t important in our tower.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes. Thanks to the blessing of the tower, we can understand each other. Here, we\u2019re all equal. At least\u2026more than the outside world.\u201dIf this went on, I would lose.But I raised the stakes higher composedly.\u201cPeople outside consider here a trash can.\u201d\u201cEven roses bloom in trash cans.\u201dThe Witch signaled a call.\u201cKim Gong-ja. The moment the clock in the sky shows [00:00:00], the media will pour out articles about you. You\u2019ll start a life different from before. I hope you deal with it wisely.\u201d\u201cSounds good.\u201dAnother card was flipped over on the table.\u201cI\u2019m not bragging, but I like attention. I like it when people compliment me and are jealous of me. It\u2019s the truth. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201dNow my cards were two pair.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re honest. I guess you\u2019re the exact opposite of Sword Saint.\u201dHer cards were still a flush. I had the shorter hand, but.\u201cAll in.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m confident.\u201dI lifted my eyes from the card to look at her.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you all now while we\u2019re on the subject. I don\u2019t want to be treated like you because I just cleared the 10th floor. The 20th floor. 30th. 40th. 50th. And the 100th. I\u2019ll subjugate them all. No matter how long it takes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI know you consider the tower special. I respect that. I don\u2019t plan on uselessly fighting with all of you. But I think of you as my opponents.\u201dWho would be the first to climb the Tower?Who would be called a hero?To be remembered by people, to be complement, to receive jealousy. To build the gold tower that everyone saw.\u201cI want to see the world beyond the tower rather than within the tower.\u201dSo I was going to climb the tower.\u201cRefugees. Famine. I don\u2019t have time to worry about that. Honestly. If you need my name, just use it. However many times you want. Just support me in climbing the tower.\u201dThe feeling of subjugating the tower. I wanted to feel it again. I had only tasted in once\u2026but I felt like I was addicted to it.Because that\u2019s how amazing it was.\u201c\u2026Sight.\u201dThe Witch sighed after a silence.\u201cI thought wrong. You\u2019re not the opposite of the Sword Saint, but exactly the same.\u201dThe Witch pushed all the chips in. Clatter. They all gathered in the center of the table like a small mountain.All in.\u201cIs that a compliment?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s a curse. Greedy people.\u201dThe last card was flipped. The opponent cards were a flush. Mine were\u2026Full House.\u201cIt\u2019s a compliment.\u201dI smiled.\u201cThank you.\u201dIt was my victory.\u201cThen as promised, I hope I\u2019m treated the same as the rest of you.\u201d\u201cCan I expect that the more authority you have, the more jobs you\u2019ll have?\u201d\u201cHm? Isn\u2019t the job of a hunter to climb the Tower? Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll continue doing the job of a hunter.\u201d\u201cA lazy newbie\u2026\u201dThe Witch bitterly smiled.-Mm. Kim Zombie is a bit lazy. If there was a skill for laziness, he would\u2019ve reached S Class.\u2018\u2026Are you really going back to Kim Zombie as soon as the game ended?\u2019-Of course, you mutant zombie! Gong-ja-nim my ass!\u2019Bae Hu-ryeong flew around in excitement.-Zombie! Zombie! Zombie bastard! Wow, I didn\u2019t know I would miss this so much! I\u2019m never gonna bet with you lazy ass again!\u2018Pathetic\u2026\u2019How was the person that was called the Emperor of the Sword this pathetic.I inwardly clicked my tongue and stood up.\u201cYou\u2019re leaving already?\u201d\u201cYes. The 11th floor is opening soon. I have to get ready now if I don\u2019t want to be behind others.\u201d\u201cHow are you gonna prepare if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s on it?\u201dMm.\u2018It wouldn\u2019t be bad to give them a hint here.\u2019Since I was going to be treated like them, it wouldn\u2019t be bad if they were in my debt a bit. I organized my thoughts and spoke up.\u201cIt\u2019s a [Play].\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cThe theme of the 11th to the 20th floor is [Play].\u201dEveryone looked at me with flashing eyes. It was obvious why. With even the smallest hint, you could move faster than others. The information I was giving them right now was priceless.\u201cThey gave me a hint as a reward for clearing the 10th floor.\u201dIt was a lie.I still hadn\u2019t gotten my reward for the 10th floor yet. I guessed I would get it when the clock hit 00:00:00. But I still knew what would happen now.Knowledge of the future. There was no reason not to use it.\u201cI don\u2019t know any more than that.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thanks for sharing.\u201dThe Witch nodded her head.\u201cI\u2019ll definitely return this favor.\u201dI was looking forward to it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were people who even threw their hats in the air. Thousands of hats soared up. They looked like flowers in spring.And before all the hats fell down to the floor-[Letting everyone know.]A voice rang out in the sky.It was announcing something to everyone.[From today, the tutorial is being ended.]That the prologue was now finished.[Letting everyone know again.][From today, the tutorial is being ended.]That it was now the start of the real thing!\u201cWoo hooo!\u201dPeople shouted in excitement. Passion. Heat. Enthusiasm. When was the last time hunters were this heated up? Even the old man who set up a store and the middle-aged man who gave up on the 2nd floor were shouted in happiness in the square.Everyone was a hunter at this moment.\u201c11th floor! 11th floor! 11th floor!\u201d\u201cOpen the 11th floor!\u201d\u201cHey, news just came up but\u2026this\u2026\u201dAnd as if responding to their heat.The clock in the sky exploded with light. It was a light as powerful as the sun. The hunters shut their eyes and looked at the sky through their fingers. I wasn\u2019t an exception.[Warriors. Climbers of the tower.][Congratulations on the crossing over the regrets of the hellfire residence.]There was a large human in the air. So, an angel or goddess would be more appropriate. The was emitting a holy light, white clothes fluttering in the air.It was like something that should be engraved on a temple.\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201d\u201cPretty\u2026\u201dEveryone in the square let out exclamations. Most hunters were staring blankly up. That was how beautiful the image of the goddess was.-Zombie. Wake up. That\u2019s not a real goddess.But Bae Hu-ryeong was cold.Sword Emperor. The one who had cleared up to the 99th floor was seduced by what was in front of him.-It\u2019s just a system that explains quests to you.\u201c\u2026Is it like an NPC?\u201d-Right. Even if there are goddesses, that\u2019s nothing more than a recorded video. It\u2019s something that automatically plays when the 10th floor is cleared. Tsk Tsk. How pathetic.I became curious.\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d-Huh? Because\u2026It was when Bae Hu-ryeong was about to reply.[Warriors! There is a world that needs your help. In this world, there is a scary Devil King. From now, you will be summoned as warriors to this place, and you will receive a mission to protect mankind. If you want to accept this mission, say \u2018Transmit\u2019\u2026]Because she finished, someone jumped into the air.\u201cHup!\u201dThe hunter lightly stepped on the roof of the building. The 3rd floor. 5th floor. 7th floor. In an instant, the hunter arrived at the bell tower of the square. And the hunter flew high midair.Sword Saint.Marcus Calenberry.\u201cHaat!\u201dThe current Rank 1\u2019s sword technique split the sky. The trajectory of his sword cut past the goddess. The image of the goddess was split into two.It was a beautiful and quick attack.Everyone who had seen the blink-of-an-eye attack dropped their mouths.\u201cHuh, huh\u2026?!\u201dAnd that only lasted a moment.The split goddess quickly returned. Like how cutting through the ocean was futile, the goddess spoke in the same beautiful voice before.[\u2026If you want to accept this mission, say \u2018Transmit\u2019. Warriors. Then, you\u2019ll take your steps on the 11th floor.]The goddess was still shining.She had light, but it wasn\u2019t holy anymore.Since a god ripped once wasn\u2019t a god anymore.\u201cHmm.\u201dSword Saint lightly landed on a roof. He was wearing the same black suit that I saw in the bar. He looked at the sky like he didn\u2019t like something, and slowly looked down at the square.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe square was silent.-Mm.Bae Hu-ryeong spoke.-I did that in the past too. See. NPC, right?I was flabbergasted.\u2018\u2026Do you have to check to be satisfied?\u2019-Yeah. I don\u2019t get people who don\u2019t check. Don\u2019t you want to cut it with your sword when something big appears? Aren\u2019t all people like that?\u2018Sigh.\u2019He was a psycho.I strengthened my vision with Aura and looked at the Sword Saint. Careful not to meet his eyes.\u201cTransmit.\u201dThe Sword Saint quietly mumbled. The same like from the goddess wrapped around the old Sword Saint. A moment later, he was gone without a trace. Only White bird poop was left on the roof.\u201cAhahahat!\u201dLaughter exploded from the silent tower. The hunters turned their heads.It was from the Guild Master of Ten Thousand Temple, Heretic Questioner.\u201cI lost again! Ah! It\u2019s a beautiful day today!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner took off his cap. He politely bowed to the people looking at him.\u201cThen I\u2019ll see everyone on the 11th floor! Transmit!\u201dA white light covered the Heretic Questioner. The next moment, the Heretic Questioner was gone. Looking at his disappearance blankly, the hunters realized belatedly.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dThat the Sword Saint and Heretic Questioner had taken a step ahead of them to the 11th floor.And that was the starting point.\u201cT, Transmit!\u201d\u201cTransmit!\u201d\u201cTransmit!\u201dCountless hunters shouted out \u2018transmit\u2019 frantically. The square was filled with light. Everytime someone shouted, light poured to where they were. These lights increased in the thousands and lit up the sky.[Warriors. Climbers of the tower.]In the midst of that, the goddess\u2019s welcoming was still going on.[From the 11th floor to the 20th floor, you will be met with a test. A test of faith.]The goddess gathered her hands on her chest.Like she was praying.[\u2026You will find your answer. Someone will light the way. So you will be able to know yourself\u2026]But there weren\u2019t many listening to her. Everyone was in a hurry not to be behind.The small amount of people that were left were filming it with their phones.\u201cWhat a shame.\u201dSomeone walked up next to me and muttered.The Vice Guild Leader of the Civil Militia. It was the Crusader.\u201cA shame?\u201d\u201cThink about it. Whoever made the tower put effort into making it. That\u2019s also a message for us. But no one cares.\u201dThe Crusader had a sad expression.\u201cPeople should\u2019ve looked at this emotionally. The fact that there\u2019s a tower and we can use skills is an amazing miracle\u2026but we\u2019ve become used to everything on the 10th floor.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a touchy feely person.\u201d\u201cMm. I majored in music on the outside.\u201dShe lifted a corner of her mouth.\u201cDo I seem more charming after hearing I\u2019m a woman who did music?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026I think it\u2019ll be hard to earn money.\u201d\u201cOof. You hurt with facts.\u201dWe both laughed.Bae Hu-ryeong crept between us.-Zombie, be careful. This human is suspicious. Hm?\u2018Ugh, what again.\u2019-There\u2019s no way someone would approach someone like you. Do you have a handsome face or personality? Everything\u2019s disgusting. Kya, I see! This is a con-artist! 100%This guy\u2026never mind. Let\u2019s just not.\u201cExcuse me!\u201dThen, a crowd of people came at us.They weren\u2019t reporters, but seemed to be people doing their own broadcasting online.\u201cT, The hunter there is Kim Gong-ha hunter-nim\u2026right?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 \u2013 Enter, Warriors! (2)Translator: HH\u201cOops.\u201dThe Crusader grimaced in annoyance.\u201cI guess the attention\u2019s on us cause of me. Sorry, Kim Gong-ja. I\u2019ll be off for the 11th floor.\u201d\u201c\u2026Wait. Did you approach me to do this?\u201dI became reasonably suspicious.And the Crusader looked a bit guilty.\u201cHaha. It\u2019s because I have the ability to read people.\u201dThe ability to read people?Did she mean she was confident in guessing what someone was thinking?She mischievously scratched the back of her head.\u201cI spoke with you because I wanted to know what kind of person you were. Think of it as a show of my interest.\u201d\u201cSo what kind of person do you think I am?\u201d\u201cMm. Well, I\u2019ll say the answers in your heart. Transmit!\u201dGoodness.She\u2019s obviously running away.Eventually Crusader left, leaving me to the crowd.-Whew. See, I\u2019m right, huh? My greatness is never wrong!\u2018Shit. It\u2019s noisy.\u2019People crowded more around me when the Crusader left. I was surrounded by individual broadcasters and reporters.\u201cKim Gong-ja hunter-nim! Please say something!\u201d\u201cIs it true that you cleared the 10th floor boss yourself! People are saying this is a scenario you planned to apply at the same time to all the large guilds!\u201d\u201cThere was an official announcement that you were E Class! Many people are very curious if this is true. Can you just confirm\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat kind of relationship are you in with the Crusader of the Civil Militia! You looked really close, are you deeply involved personally?\u201d\u201cKim Gong-ja hunter-nim!\u201dWow.\u2018Is this the [Unending Request for Shaking Hands] that only the successful hunters get\u2026\u2019Being on the receiving end, I realized why Flame Emperor had been so annoyed with the reporters.I wondered how I should react and decided to say just one word.\u201cI\u2019ll clear the 20th floor as well.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cThen, work hard everyone. Transmit.\u201dWhoosh!White light came from under me.\u201cAh, w, wait! King Gong-ja hunter-nim.\u201d\u201cNo! Get him!\u201d\u201cJust a few more-\u201dSorry.I think the mysterious concept is the best.[Climbers of the tower.]And before the light completely covered me.The goddess\u2019s voice spoke for the last time to the square.[May luck be with you.]The light around me faded away. I could start seeing in front of me.What came into my sight first was\u2026a large battlefield.-Krrrrk!-Chiik! chik!Monster. Fearsome monsters were running towards me from the horizon. Goblin. Orcs. Ogres. The different species that I saw from the 10th floor in the tutorial were running at me as one.They looked like a horde of ants.\u201cStop them!\u201d\u201cI, It\u2019s impossible! There\u2019s too many!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t step back! If we\u2019re pushed back, our empire is over!\u201dThere was only\u20261 line to block the horde.Was this from the Middle Ages? The soldiers wearing armor were trying to somehow close the port. The human soldiers tried to put the deep lake behind them.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cWhat in the world is happening\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhoa! E, Everyone, be careful of the arrows! They\u2019re flying around everywhere!\u201dHunters summoned to the battlefield were looking around in confusion.It wasn\u2019t weird for them to be so dumbfounded. Since they had only experienced safely prepared hunting grounds so far.But this was common from the 10th floor.\u2018Like they said, the tutorial\u2019s over.\u2019A battlefield where you didn\u2019t know when you would die.A fighting ring where you had to risk your life with every floor.\u201cOhoh!\u201dSomeone approached the flustered hunters. He was wearing quite fancy armor, like he wasn\u2019t just a soldier. The general shouted out to us.\u201cThank you! You\u2019ve come to help our empire, warriors!\u201dThe hunters murmured.\u201cWarriors? What does he mean.\u201d\u201cStupid. Didn\u2019t you hear what the angel said in the square? They\u2019re receiving the attack of the Devil King. We\u2019re the warriors.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t hear in the back!\u201d\u201cWhoa, is this real?\u201d\u201cAre those soldiers real humans or NPC\u2026\u201d\u201cCan you be quiet over there!\u201dPeople kept on arriving even while the hunters were speaking to each other. People came on top of each other and pushed others. It was pandemonium.\u201cWarriors! Please help our empire!\u201dFortunately, a few skilled people including me knew how to use their Aura to strengthen their sight and hearing. While a few non-skilled people were just staring blankly ahead, a few hunters listened to what the general NPC was saying.\u201cThis port is the last defense of our empire. For the empire\u2019s capital to continue being supported, we need to defend this place. Warriors from another world! Please protect Aegim Empire with us!\u201dThen, a voice rang in my head.[The quest of the 11th floor is being given.]Messages popped up in front of my eyes.+[Supply Route Defense]Difficulty: F~AMission task: Calamity has struck the Aegim Empire. The Devil King. A being only seen in legends has forced an army. The Devil King is cunning, evil, and strong. He wishes to block the Aegim Empire\u2019s supply route.Defend the port!This fight will become the first step in saving the empire.\u203bHowever, loss in the battle will result in the 12th floor being closed.+\u201cQuest\u2026?\u201d\u201cSee. The Devil King\u00a0did appear.\u201d\u201cWhere even is the Aegim Empire.\u201dThe confused hunters began to realize the situation. Some hunters wordlessly pulled out their weapons, and others formed teams.And some hunters aimed at the goblins.\u201cI wonder.\u201dSword Saint at the front muttered to himself.Blood was creating a lake where he was. About 6 monsters fell to the ground headless.\u201c-I don\u2019t know the exact situation. But you\u2019re saying we should knock them down first.\u201dAnd he jumped into battle.Hunters behind him who were frozen all shouted after seeing him.\u201cWooooo!\u201d\u201cNice! Let\u2019s follow the Sword Saint!\u201d\u201cFucking goblin bastards! For the past 6 years, I cut off thousands of your necks!\u201dThousands of hunters jumped into battle with their weapons, and thousands of hunters followed them. The defending forces suddenly grew in number.And when the battle was turning into a mess.\u201cOkay.\u201dI was smiling in the back.Because I heard a voice that others couldn\u2019t.[Welcome, hunter Kim Gong-ja.][The reward for clearing the 10th floor is being given.]A voice that announced my bonus.[Normal stage reward.][Blessing of the War God is being awarded!][You can view the map of the tower from the 11th floor to the 20th floor.]A translucent map popped up in front of me. It was a mini map.Red and blue spots dizzily twisted around each other and dominated the map. Looking closely, the red spots seemed like monsters, and the blue monsters seemed like the human forces.-Tsk tsk\u2026yup. I knew a cheat bonus would come out!Bae Hu-ryeong complained with a frown.-While others crawl around on the floor you\u2019ll be looking down from the sky, is that it? Sigh. Yeah. Don\u2019t think about building up your skills and use your head. This tower is really unfair when you think about it. The fed people continue eating and the ones well off keep\u2026But Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s boomer speech couldn\u2019t go on.[Hidden Stage Reward.][Blessing of the Human God is being awarded!][You can view all NPC\u2019s names and locations from the 11th to the 20th floor.]-\u2026Huh?Because that wasn\u2019t the end of the bonus notifications.[Hidden stage reward.][Blessing of the Merchant is being awarded!][You will receive a chosen item from the 11th floor to the 20th floor.]Next to the mini map, lists popped up. One was a directory of all the NPC\u2019s names and locations. The other was a directory with items and their effects.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.We were speechless.\u201cKill them! Push them away!\u201d\u201cAccck! The g, goblins are throwing spears!\u201dThe hunters on the front line diligently fought. Orcs cried out and human soldiers spilled blood. In the middle of the noisy battlefield, Bae Hu-ryeong and I were silent.The silence was soon broken.\u201cAh. It\u2019s a game to get skills\u2026\u201d-What kinda crazy game of luck is this!With opposing exclamations.Theme.The tower had different themes on floors.Maybe \u2018genre\u2019 will help you understand better.The 1st floor to the 10th floor was [Tutorial].There was a hunting ground, and a city where you could rest however long you wanted. It was a step for beginners to get used to the tower.And from the 11th floor to the 12th floor was a\u2026\u2018Devil King attack genre.\u2019Or a Devil King soldier genre.Since it was protecting the human empire, even a defense genre could be applied as well.\u2018It\u2019s defeating the Devil King\u2019s forces coming in hordes.\u2019Anyhow, from now, the level of fighting was different.Monsters didn\u2019t roam around by themselves like in the beginning hunting grounds. They formed groups. Legions. They made an army.There were only 2 ways to attack a monster army.\u2018Be a powerful one army strong enough to defeat the army by yourself or-\u2019I looked at the front lines.Sword Saint was massacring the monsters with a blue Aura.\u2018-fight with your own army.\u2019I smirked.\u2018The path I pick this time will be the latter.\u2019SInce I got the bonus.Wouldn\u2019t it be a waste if I left this alone?Of course, I didn\u2019t have any talent leading an army. Since I never did it before. But all you had to do was build those talents up.I was confident in making a new talent.\u201cStatus window.\u201dIt was to check my current status before I actually jumped into battle.+Name: Kim Gong-jaRank: E ClassSkill (5/5)1.

If he had only been complaining earlier, he was really frantic now.He quickly tried to convince me.-Wait! Zombie! I don\u2019t think this is it. Let\u2019s slowly get stronger. Hm? Slowly train, build up skills, and learn sword techniques. How nice is that?\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I do that later.\u201d-Eek! Even if you\u2019re a weak ass guy, this is really not right!

I didn\u2019t have any reason to hesitate.I quickly ran to find the NPC closest to me. Thankfully, they were nearby.

You\u2019re gonna be leached off of everything!Scum, he said.He was completely proficient in speaking the language of our world now.\u201cSince you trust me as a warrior, I have something to request of you.\u201d\u201cGo ahead! Thanks to you all, there seems to be hope. If it\u2019s something I can do, I\u2019ll gladly do it.\u201d\u201cPlease kill me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 \u2013 Enter, Warriors! (3)Translator: HHThe general\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201c\u2026Actually, I have a secret weapon. Like a self-destruct button. If I die, the blessing of a god will descend upon the battlefield. If the blessing is activated, the empire can win.\u201dI put on a serious expression. My acting was unexpectedly pretty good. Thinking of the moment Flame Emperor burned me up, my face instantly hardened and my voice became determined.-Ack! It\u2019s a lie! He doesn\u2019t have a self destruct button!Huh.The loser ghost who died right before the 100th floor should be quiet.\u201cT, That kind of blessing\u2026no. But kill you? I can\u2019t!\u201d\u201cGeneral Sarbast Aegim. Please think about what\u2019s important. Whether you use your sword or not, I\u2019ll kill myself. Since it\u2019s a sure way to guarantee victory for the empire.\u201dI spoke with a serious expression.\u201cI\u2019m asking this favor of you.\u201d\u201cFavor\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the leader of this port. You want victory for the empire more than anyone. Rather than dying by my own hand or by a monster, I want to leave my life in your hands.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no time. Hurry!\u201dThe general had a pitiful face.\u201cThe survival of our empire is at stake, but to take the life of a warrior from another world\u2026\u201d-Hey. Hey! You believe this? Shit! You\u2019re gonna believe Kim Zombie, this guy? Seriously?\u201cOur world is definitely cursed. The attack of the Devil King from legend, and how the magical animals continue to strike. And to take your life, it must all be a curse\u2026\u201d-Your brain is a curse!\u201cAh, please don\u2019t forgive our sins, god\u2026\u201dThe general spoke in a regretful voice like he was the main character of a tragedy. A sharp and elegant blade came out.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll send you off without any pain.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dI really was thankful.Dying didn\u2019t matter, but I didn\u2019t like pain.\u201cPlease tell me your name.\u201d\u201cKim Gong-ja.\u201d\u201cKim Gong-ja\u2026I thank you on behalf of the empire. You are a true warrior!\u201dKashing.Like what he promised, it was a clean cut. The blade of Aura instantly cut my neck.[You have died.][NPC Sarbast\u2019s skills are being randomly copied.]As I expected, copying an NPC\u2019s skills was possible.And when everything became dark, I heard Bae Hu-ryeong shout out.-Stop dying you bastard! Do you like cheating like this!I answered him in my mind.Sit Gong-ja says. It\u2019s lit.The exciting day began again.They said this.Above a running person, there was a flying person.And also this.Next to a sword-wielding hunter, there\u2019s a dead hunter.Gong-ja-nim said that.\u201cHey, what\u2019s that!\u201d\u201cHuh? He seems like a hunter judging by his clothes\u2026?\u201dThe battlefield. Hunters turned back from diligently swinging their swords. It was a dangerous thing to do while battling monsters. But they had a bit slack to do that.I made that slack for them.\u201cWarrior!\u201dThe general shouted back at me.\u201cAre you sure this is the right way!\u201dHis body shook. My body also shook. That\u2019s because we were riding the same horse.He was holding the saddle while I was behind him.My butt felt horrible but I felt amazing.\u201cCrystal. If you head this way and turn to the right, that\u2019s where the demon army\u2019s commander is. There\u2019s a bit of monsters nearby. Oh well. It\u2019s ok. We can get rid of them.\u201d\u201cOh! Okay!\u201dBecause behind us, there were a thousand warriors behind us.\u201cArmy, follow me!\u201dHe lifted his baton.\u201cThe warrior of the goddess will protect us!\u201d\u201cWOooooOO!\u201dThe soldiers shouted and followed the general. The soldiers, who had always been on defense, took the offense. Goblins and orcs got in the way, but they fell to the side.\u201cHehe.\u201dIt was the effect of the minimap.I advised the general to attack where the forces of the demons were less.\u201cAh. Turn to the right here.\u201d\u201cUnderstood! Warrior of the goddess!\u201dOf course, I hadn\u2019t gotten the general\u2019s trust with just the minimap. Should I say it\u2019s because of the day\u2019s repeat?I needed a lot of preparation.I experienced the general\u2019s trauma when I got my skills\u2026but I\u2019ll talk about that later.\u2018Status window.\u2019Because it was time to focus on what was on hand right now.First, skills. The techniques I had were like so.+Name: Kim Gong-jaRank: E ClassSkill (5/5)1. I Want to be Like You (S+)2. Returner\u2019s Clockwork Watch (EX)3. Sword Constellation(A+)4. Goblin High Society(F)5. Discernment of the Battlefield (B)+\u2018The new skill I got is related to war.\u2019Like what it was called, it was a skill that identified the battlefield. If our forces had the upper hand or not. How to attack the enemies. I could instinctively feel it.It made me into somewhat of an expert.\u2018Although that\u2019s not all of the skills.\u2019I grinned and lifted my sword.It wasn\u2019t an ordinary sword. It wasn\u2019t what I used to skill myself either. The shining Sword Body. There was an image of a lion\u2019s open mouth on it. As the silver light spread everywhere, the warriors gaped.\u201cIt\u2019s the light sent from the goddess!\u201dThe Holy Sword from the beginning\u2026.ah, the empire hasn\u2019t been abandoned!\u201d\u201cHurrah for Aegim Empire!\u201dYes.This sword was the last puzzle piece for me to lead the army.It was what I picked with the Blessing of the Merchant God.+[Lefanta Aegim\u2019s Holy Protection Sword]Rarity: LegendSummary: \u2018One who holds the Holy Sword will hold the empire.\u2019 The Holy Sword from ancestors. There is a legend that the ancestor who founded the Aegim Empire received it from the goddess. \u2018One who holds the Holy Sword will be held by fate.\u2019The ancestor chose his successor and left. Did he kill himself? Was he killed by the rebelling forces? When legends and history weren\u2019t different, his whereabouts were unknown, and so was the Holy Sword\u2019s. Only leaving a line in history.\u2018The day fate arrives, so will the one with the Holy Sword.\u2019The one who had the Holy Protection Sword will be absolutely trusted and supported by the people of the Aegim Empire.+The effects of the legendary item were outstanding.\u201cHurrah for the empire! Hurrah for the warrior!\u201d\u201cGoddess, protect us!\u201d\u201cAttack! Kill those dirty creatures!\u201dThe soldiers ran forward\u201cKya.\u201dFrom what the soldiers saw, I was a legendary warrior. The real person leading them was the NPC general but\u2026it felt like I was leading them.I felt like I was flying.\u2018Good. Ah, good. I feel like I cleared the hidden stage just with this?\u2019-It\u2019s a fucking useless item!Bae Hu-ryeong flew up when I was about to fly up.-\u2019It\u2019s just a shiny sword that\u2019s slightly strong!\u2018Tsk tsk. You\u2019re sentimentality must be weak since you\u2019re a ghost. This is a shiny sword that all the NPCs from the 11th floor to the 20th will go ballistic for. Got it? NPCs aren\u2019t just tools to get quests.It was a theory of coincidence.\u2018Their beings to help break through them!\u2019And the development actually worked.While the hunter players were sweating like dogs, I was breezing through the battlefield with the general.\u201cW, What\u2019s that\u2026?\u201dEverytime I passed a hunter, they were surprised. There were even some who were stunned.\u201cWhy\u2019s he going around with the general?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t he an NPC?\u201d\u201cWow. Wait. It looks like he\u2019s giving orders to the general\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, look at his clothes. He\u2019s a hunter!\u201d\u201cWho is that person\u2026?\u201dSurprised voices. Suspicious voices. Jealous voices.They were reactions for when people looked up at someone who was above them.\u2018Ah.\u2019I was drunk.\u2018This is it. This. Dang, it\u2019s to die for.\u2019-\u2026this psycho isn\u2019t training his Aura like I taught him to but using it to eavesdrop on gossip. Zombie. You\u2019re amazing. You\u2019re really like a Zombie\u2026\u2018What can I do!\u2019The attack was working. The monsters continued to fall.They were even trying to block us frantically but\u2026\u201cHup!\u201dSkilled hunters like Sword Saint massacred the orcs at the front, and-\u201cHahaht! Ah, what a touching day! A new battle! A new era! How-.\u201d\u201cShut up! If you have time to blabber on, get another goblin!\u201dMembers from large guilds like Heretic Questioner and Venomous Snake were at the sides.The wings of the enemies were falling off. There weren\u2019t any extra forces to stop up. Clip! Clop! The heads of goblins were crushed under the horses of the soldiers, and spears pierced the orcs.\u201cWe can win!\u201d\u201cFollow the general! Follow the warrior!\u201dAttack. And attack some more!From some point, there was a hole in the enemy forces. We were almost to the commander. The minimap marked him as a red spot.-Go, Gorrr.Past the general\u2019s shoulder, I could see a high king goblin.\u2018Huh.\u2019I scoffed.\u2018I was wondering what the leader of the enemy forces was but it was a high king goblin?\u2019Of course, it was probably stronger than the high king goblin from the 5th floor that I cleared. Since he was leading forces of thousands. But it was only a goblin. If his subordinates were swept aside, I wouldn\u2019t be hurt.More than anything.[Your skill is activating.]I had a skill specialized for goblins.-Gorrk! Gor!As the goblin lifted his cane, the monsters around him came at us. If it was human language, he was probably saying something like \u2018Stop those humans, fools!\u2019And to that high king goblin, I shouted.\u201cGorrrk!\u201dIn fluent goblin language!-Go, Gork?\u201cGorrrr!\u201d-Gorrk?He was clearly flustered. As the leader was flustered, so were his underlings. And during that time, our forces were fighting. The last hope for the enemies flew away.-Gorrrk?!The high king goblin fumbled. Then, he realized that he was tricked.But it was too late.I put Aura into the Holy Protection Sword and powerfully swung it.\u201cIt was a nice gorrk!\u201dI cut the goblin like tofu. His head flew off without even a scream.\u201cWhoa!\u201dThe general shouted, slowing down the horse.\u201cThe warrior has gotten rid of the demon creature!\u201dHe wasn\u2019t saying it to me. It was to let his soldiers know. The general put Aura in his voice so his voice could be heard in the noisy battlefield.The people around him understood what he was saying.\u201cThe demon creature has been cleared!\u201d\u201cThe warrior of the goddess had gotten rid of the enemy leader!\u201dFrom the general to his deputies. From the deputies to the commanders. From the commanders to the soldiers. Voice rang out again and again like an echo.\u201cWhoohooo!\u201dFlags were waved in the air. Cheers. It was the cheers of the soldiers.\u201c\u2026\u201dI got off the horse and looked around.I met the eyes of a flag bearer. He had lost his left arm in the battle. He was waving the flag with his right arm. When our gazes met, he smiled happily. And waved the flag even more.Sunlight poured onto the flag.\u201cHurrah for the Aegim Empire!\u201dWe had won.\u201cGet rid of the enemies!\u201d\u201cAttack! Attack! Don\u2019t let even one escape!\u201dThe tables were completely turned.-Kerk, kerrr\u2026-Grrr!The beastly monsters started to run away.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cLook at them.\u201dThe gazes of the hunters changed. A fight between armies wasn\u2019t familiar, but chasing after individual monsters was a hunter\u2019s specialty. The hunters smiled, baring their teeth, and ran at the goblins and orcs.\u201cKill them all!\u201dIt was time to hunt.The massacre didn\u2019t last long.Some time later, a clear voice rang out over the battlefield.[Stage clear!][Today, the 11th floor stage has been cleared.]It was the voice of victory.[Letting everyone know again.][Today, the 11th floor stage has been cleared.]Cheers exploded.\u201cWoohoo! Is this real?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t we too strong?\u201d\u201cHurray for Black Dragon Guild!\u201dHunters exploded in cheers this time. Some threw their caps like in the square, and others hugged each other.The clearing of the 11th floor in less than a day!It was an amazing attack.[Calculating subjugators\u2026calculation complete.][It has exceeded the limit.][The top 10 clearers are being announced.]The hunters looked up.Something was being engraved into the sky with light.+[Level of Contribution Rank]Rank 1.

They said his name was Gong-ja!\u201d\u201cSomeone who hasn\u2019t received a nickname from the hunter is Rank 1 again?\u201d\u201cAre they like a secluded master or something?\u201dBae Hu-ryeong looked sour.-Ha. Secluded master, my ass. Just a weak ass who plays tricks\u2026\u201d\u2018Do you acknowledge it\u2019s a game of skills now?\u2019-No! Never!He whipped around. He seemed to be mad because I didn\u2019t train with my sword. This ghost\u2026prioritized basic skills over everything else.I bitterly smiled.\u2018I\u2019ll train my sword technique before the 20th floor is over, so don\u2019t be mad.\u2019-Really?His ears twitched.\u2018Yes. Of course. I can\u2019t not do anything when I hang out with the Sword Emperor, right? You\u2019re someone who passed the 99th floor. I should beg to be taught.\u2019-Right!He spun around the air like he was never in a bad mood.-Kya. Zombie finally sees my worth. Even though the tower is a bit different, I really climbed the tower in my world like there was not yesterday. The 11th floor was a piece of cake\u2026!Ah. It\u2019s easy.So easy to ease this ghost.How could it be this easy?\u201cWarrior of the goddess.\u201dWhile Bae Hu-reyong was flying above, the general approached me. His body was dirty with the blood of the monster. Only his face was clean, like he wiped it just now.\u201cWe were able to be victorious thanks to you. Really, thank you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. We all won together.\u201d\u201cAhaha.\u201dHe scratched his palm like he was embarrassed.\u201cI worried for nothing.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cA long time ago, we received a prophecy. That when the Devil King came, warriors from another world would come, so we didn\u2019t have to worry\u2026but I didn\u2019t believe it. Why would warriors fight for their lives in a world that wasn\u2019t even theirs?He smiled.\u201cBut it was just useless concern. Thank you again.\u201dHe held out his hand.Even though it was a different world, it meant the same thing. Was it because people had hands in both worlds?\u201cI look forward to your accomplishments in the future.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll work hard.\u201dWe shook hands.[Calculating rewards\u2026calculation complete.][Rewards are being given to the highest ranks.]Then, a light surrounded me from the sky, along with a voice.It wasn\u2019t just me. Light came from the sky onto the battlefield here and there. One, two, three, four. A total of 10 rays of light poured from the sky.[The highest ranking challengers enter the 12th floor first.][Until the highest ranking challengers receive their rewards, the remaining challengers cannot enter the 12th floor.][Letting everyone know again.

    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25- The Chosen Ones (1)Translator: HHBae Hu-ryeong frantically spoke when the light poured down.-Hey, wait. If only the 10 ten are summoned, wouldn\u2019t grandpops Marcus be there? What are you going to do when he sees you and tries to get you?\u2019\u2018Nah, you worry too much. It\u2019s ok. The worst I can do is die, right?\u2019-Kim Zombie you\u2026Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s lips twitched like he was about to nag about me. Sheesh. I quickly added on.\u2018It\u2019s ok because I have plans. Don\u2019t you know? I\u2019m Kim Gong-ja. The weak ass that the Sword Emperor acknowledged! Trust me.\u2019-You have plans?\u2018Of course! I have definite plans. I\u2019ll show you them soon.\u2019-Ahem.He crossed his arms with a doubtful look.But it was already too late. The summoning had been started, and the white night completely covered us.The only thing we could do was meet Sword Saint.I closed my eyes and,[The transmission is complete.]When I opened my eyes, I was already on the 12th floor.It was completely different from the 11th floor. Like the exact opposite. If the 11th floor was a dirty and intense battlefield, the 12th floor was an extravagant palace. It was the Imperial Palace of the Aegim Empire.\u2018\u2026no.\u2019I looked around.\u2018Since the politics in the palace are as dirty and intense.\u2019In the reception room, other high challengers were summoned. There were people I saw for the first time, but most of them were hunters I met already, like Witch and Count. Of course. They weren\u2019t the leaders of the large Guildss for nothing.I met the eyes of the other hunters.\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dAll of their reactions were different. There were some hunters who were smiling brightly at me like they knew I would be here, and there were some with grimaces like they never would\u2019ve expected me here.\u201cHunter Kim Gong-ja! You were amazing!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner was the former.\u201cI saw what you did on the 11th floor! To use the NPCs that way. I was touched!\u201dHe ran over to me. Because he was so short, he seemed like a tiny puppy.\u201cIs the sword on your waist a special item? The NPCs seemed to follow you right away after seeing you had this sword. Did you get this as a reward for clearing the 10th floor?\u201cWell. I guess\u2026\u201d\u201cAs expected!\u201dHe was all smiles looking up at me.\u201cYou used the 10th floor reward to clear the 11th floor. Your application skills are amazing!\u201d\u201cNo, well. Not that\u2026\u201d\u201cFrom now, a lot of hunters will be jealous of you. They might even treat you as a lucky parvenu. Ignore them! It\u2019s all thanks to your skills!\u201dUh.What was this person?An angel?Bae Hu-ryeong shouted.It was different from his usual teasing tone. He was frantic.-Be careful! Behind you\u2026!Then. Before Bae Hu-ryeong could finish, everything ended.\u201cHm.\u201dThe first person to react was the Heretic Questioner in front of me.His jolly eyes were gone, and they were replaced with narrowed ones. He pulled my wrist back. I toppled over, not being able to catch my balance. One step. The Heretic Questioner pulled me back and stepped up instead.\u201c-Holy Technique, Inner God(\u8089\u795e).\u201dHe quietly muttered to himself. Then the sound of iron crashing against something else rang out. It was simple iron.It was an attack with clear murderous intent.\u201cHa.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner laughed.His eyes weren\u2019t laughing.\u201cThat\u2019s surprising, Sword Saint. When did you become an assassin?\u201d\u201cMove.\u201dAn old man dressed in a suit. Sword Saint spoke coldy.His sword was raised at us.No.Never mind.\u201cI\u2019m going to kill that guy.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t raised at us, but at me.Silence descended on the reception room.Like there was electricity in the air, my body felt sparked.\u201cMm.\u201dOnly Heretic Questioner spoke in an attitude that wasn\u2019t much different than before.\u201cExcuse me. But by \u2018that guy\u2019 are you talking about Kim Gong-ja hunter?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dSword Saint replied.\u201cIf you don\u2019t move from there, one of your arms will be cut off as well.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner had a beaming smile.\u201cThat\u2019s a bit difficult! I can\u2019t move for you. Hunter Kim Gong-ja has received the acknowledgement of the Five Large Guilds, including the Ten Thousand Temple. If I let him die, the reputation of the Five Large Guilds will be hurt!\u201d\u201cYou want to lose an arm I see. Youngster.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s a bit difficult as well! My arms are still useful to me.\u2019The Heretic Questioner tilted his head, still smiling.\u201cCan you tell me why you\u2019re targeting hunter Kim Gong-ja?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have to tell you.\u201d\u201cAre you saying you won\u2019t give him up?\u201d\u201cMove and stop the nonsense.\u201dSword Saint firmly refused.Yeah. In his eyes, I was a slaughterer who killed over 4000 people. Since he didn\u2019t know my skill, he would react like that.\u201cI\u2019ll say it again, but I\u2019m going to kill that guy.\u201d\u201cMm! Then you\u2019ve left me with no choice.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner gathered his hands.\u201cI\u2019ll control you here. Holy Technique, Transmission God.\u201dSuddenly, light exploded behind Sword Saint. Two hunters appeared from the tight. Chen-mu Master Venomous Snake. Civil Milita\u2019s Vice Guild Leader Crusader. The two hunters shouted. Both of their weapons were pointed at the Sword Saint.\u201cHaaaaaaa!\u201dSword Saint furrowed his eyebrows.\u201cThese pricks\u2026\u201dHe clicked his tongue. During the span of one click, he swung his sword once. His blue Aura split the air and spilt blood. Two slashes. With just two attacks, the Crusader\u2019s cheek was hurt. The Venomous Snake\u2019s arm was bleeding.\u201cThis, monstrous geezer!\u201dIt happened in an instant.\u201cWhat does that oldie eat to be that energetic! Please, age! Retire! Because of you, young people can\u2019t move up.\u201dVenomous Snake gritted his teeth and shouted.Sword Saint lightly snorted.\u201cAren\u2019t you over 40 now? Looking at the real young ones, you\u2019re also old.\u201d\u201cFunny! 40s are still young! That\u2019s when your real life begi\u2026\u201d\u201cChen-mu Master! You are old! You are almost blind!\u201d\u201cThat damned zealot is on my side, right?\u201d\u201cSigh.\u201dCrusader sighed.\u201cFocus on the opponent at hand. We\u2019re at a disadvantage.\u201dEven while sighing, Crusader didn\u2019t let down her guard. No, she seemed even more nervous. The Heretic Questioner, Venomous Snake, and Crusader. The highest 3 hunters were fighting together, but the Sword Saint was still gging. [TN: gg as in go go.]\u201cMm. We\u2019re definitely at a disadvantage like this.\u201dDid the Heretic Questioner feel it too?He smiled brightly and requested for help.\u201cCount!\u201d\u201cWhat.\u201d\u201cPlease give me some money!\u201d\u201cHow much?\u201d\u201cThankfully the Sword Saint hasn\u2019t lost his mind yet. It\u2019ll be enough to control him for some time. 10,000 Gold please!\u201d\u201c15% interest.\u201dCount unfolded her fan while quietly watching the fight.\u201c3 months time. Is this good?\u201d\u201cHaha! You\u2019ve misunderstood me! I didn\u2019t ask to borrow money. I said to give me money.\u201d\u201cHuh. Are you asking a merchant to donate?\u201d\u201cYes! That\u2019s it! Isn\u2019t it money you got from dirty deeds anyway? I\u2019ll use it a good place, so repent at the temple and go to heaven!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a worse thief than me\u2026\u201dCount shook her head and pulled something out.It was a pouch with a snail pattern on it.Count untied the gold string at its entrance.\u201cWithdraw, 10,000 Gold.\u201dThe pouch opened its mouth. A bunch of coins fell out. The pouch itself was probably a rare item. As gold coins formed a small mountain, Count took her pouch back.\u201cThere. Take it, priest. It\u2019s exactly 10,000 Gold.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take it well!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner smiled exuberantly and gathered his two hands.\u201cHoly Technique, Devotion!\u201dThe gold on the floor emitted a light. A golden light filled the reception room. IN the middle of it, Heretic Quesioner muttered, moving his hands rapidly.\u201cHoly transfer, physique strengthening. Receiver, Crusader and Venomous Snake. Time, 300 times. Gold will grab our hands. Technique complete!\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d\u201cHumph\u2026\u201dAnd something strange happened. All the gold on the floor disappeared like it had never been there.Instead, the light from the coins landed on the Crusader and the Venomous Snake. It was like Aura. The Heretic Questioner spread his arms apart, saying, \u201cHere we go.\u201d\u201cFor 300 seconds, Crusader and Chen-mu Master will become noticeably different. Sword saint! Even if you\u2019re strong, you can\u2019t bear the attack of the four of us! Me, Count, Crusader, and Chen-mu Master!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd the Count\u2019s treasury isn\u2019t empty. Haha. I don\u2019t know if it ever will! If you want to test whether the Count will become bankrupt first, or if your neck will be cut off first, go ahead!\u201dCount pouted from far away.\u201cWhy are you pulling my treasury into this test! I just donated because that zealot told me to. Whew. Being a merchant is hard both inside and outside the tower.\u201d\u201c\u2026and if I added something to that.\u201dA cold voice spoke. It was the Witch. The Rank 2 hunter broke her silence.She looked at Sword Saint with an expressionless face.\u201cIt won\u2019t end with the four. I\u2019ll show my intent to participate in the fight right now. Because hunter Kim Gong-ja has made a deal with the Five Large Guilds.Sword Saint frowned.\u201cA deal?\u201d\u201cYeah. A deal.\u201dThe Witch nodded.\u201cHunter Kim Gong-ja isn\u2019t bound to a single place but applied to all Five Large Guilds. In return, we promised to treat him as an equal. Sword saint. If you pull your sword towards Kim Gong-Ja, that means you\u2019re attacking all of us.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cOf course, by \u2018us,\u2019 I\u2019m talking about the Five Large Guilds.\u201dShe pulled out some mirrors.\u201cBlack Dragon. Sangryun. Ten Thousand Temple. Chen-mu Mun. Civil Militia.\u201dThe mirrors floated up by themselves. And they started to spin around. One. Two. Three. In total, the six mirrors spun around the Witch like they were hunting dogs protecting her.\u201cCan you really deal with all of us, Sword Saint?\u201dSwish.The five hunters all pulled out their weapons towards Sword Saint.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe old sword wielder was quiet.Yes.\u2018Even if the Sword Saint is freakishly strong.\u2019In this moment-\u2018He\u2019s not strong enough to have all of the Five Large Clans as his enemies.\u2019This was why I made a deal with the Guild Masters.A day when I was stronger than Sword Saint could come. No, it would. But it wasn\u2019t today or tomorrow. So until that day came, I had to have a safety net.I inwardly smiled.\u2018Do you remember what I said on the 11th floor?\u2019-What?\u2018That there are two ways to deal with a powerful opponent.\u2019Be a one man army strong enough to chew your enemy up.Or, make my own army and fight back.\u2018The Sword Saint is nothing more than a solo player.\u2019But I was different.\u2018I already have allies.\u2019So if Sword Saint and I fought, it would be my victory.\u2018See? This is my plan. Go ahead, be awed.\u2019-Tsk tsk. What a weak ass\u2026Bae Hu-ryeong sighed.But his face didn\u2019t look too bad. He seemed pretty satisfied that I came up to the 12th floor with a strategy. That ghost, although he didn\u2019t show it, worried about a lot of things.I took a step forward.\u201cSword Saint-nim.\u201dThe hunters all looked at me. And Sword Saint was amongst them. I smiled on purpose to seem relaxed.And I looked Sword Saint in the eye.\u201cCan we talk?\u201dListen well. Because sir Gong-ja is speaking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26- The Chosen Ones (2)Translator: HH\u201c\u2026Talk?\u201d\u201cYes. To be honest, I\u2019m a bit taken aback right now.\u201dOn the stage of the 12th floor, the palace, we were in the reception room. My voice rang out in the middle of it.\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re attacking me. You may be seeing me for the first time, but I used to admire your sword technique. Since you\u2019re raising your sword to me like that, it\u2019s really awkward for me.\u201dSword Saint\u2019s face stiffened.Even though I was telling the truth.\u2018I guess he would be like that.\u2019There was a reason his face hardened like that.The first day he met me, the day that he didn\u2019t remember, Sword Saint had said this.-Did you think I wouldn\u2019t know you were an assassin sent from Black Dragon?-I don\u2019t know if the Witch sent you, but I\u2019ll do my best to kill you!He thought I was an assassin.\u2018And an assassin from the Black Dragon at that.\u2019He was probably thinking the same thing right now. That I was an assassin employed by Black Dragon who killed many innocent lives. No, he might be even more sure of himself now.\u2018Or a special assassin from the Five Large Guilds.\u2019-Mm. Right.Bae Hu-ryeong nodded his head.-From another\u2019s respective, you\u2019re really weird.\u2018Exactly.\u2019The appearance of a new hero when no one was expecting it!An E Class hunter had cleared the unclearable stage. And as soon as he did, he made a deal with the Five Large Guilds and was promised to be treated the same way as the Guild Masters\u2026\u2018It\u2019s too strange.\u2019-Right. From what grandpops Marcus sees, you\u2019re not a hunter who worked hard to get there. You\u2019re a fake hero that the large guilds set up. Tsk tsk.Bae Hu-ryeong tsked his tongue.-Zombie. How many was your kill count at? 4090?\u2018It\u2019s probably at 4093 now.\u2019-Right. The 4093 grandpops Marcus sees is just the number of people you\u2019ve killed. Because you\u2019re not a hunter that moves alone, but a hunter that was created by the large guilds.That was the only result that the Sword Saint could come to.-And\u2026\u2018Yes.\u2019The same bunch.\u2018He probably thinks of it as a number that I killed on orders from the large guilds.\u2019The large guilds that ruled the tower.That they had killed 4093 humans.It was a misunderstanding\u2026but to him, it was probably a dirty sight.\u201cHah.\u201dIf he was less of a just geezer, he would\u2019ve stepped back here.\u201cBabylon is no different from the outer world.\u201dBut the Sword Saint didn\u2019t know how to step back.Even if he did, he denied it.\u201cAfter I entered the tower, you begged of me every day. To apply in a guild. But I refused. Do you know that?\u201dSword Saint gripped his sword even more. His hands were old. Skin sagged. But the veins that popped out weren\u2019t old at all.A lion\u2019s teeth weren\u2019t less sharp because of age.\u201cI wanted to show that in this tower. That in this new world, you could rule at the top alone.\u201dThe Sword Saint looked around him with violent eyes.\u201cFamily, country, where you\u2019re from. Unlike the outer world, you can survive by yourself with a sword in this place. If you work hard, you can succeed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cTo show that hope to people, I didn\u2019t join a guild until now. But what have you guys done?\u201dHe lifted his blade.\u201cYou\u2019re no different from the rotten water riddled with dirt.\u201dThe Guild Masters squirmed.Rage. Humiliation. Hate.Emotions swirled in their eyes. What the Sword saint just said was an announcement for war.There were some who just smiled like it was nothing, like the Heretic Questioner, but most of the guild masters\u2019 faces didn\u2019t look too good.\u201cSword Saint. I don\u2019t know about others but you\u2026\u201d\u201cHa! You forgot about how you just skipped out when we were subjugating the 5th floor? Seems like you forgot because of Alzheimer\u2019s!\u201d\u201cYeah, Mr.Calenberry. If you used your connections from the outer world, we would have more food, and Sangryun\u2026\u201dThey all shouted.All the hunters here had known each other from the beginning of the tower. Was it because they had a lot of held back emotions towards each other? As emotion clashed against emotion, the atmosphere in the reception room soon became dark.\u201cIf you\u2019re a Rank 1, you should\u2019ve shown the attitude appropriate of it. But you were all good yourself. You lived by yourself. Do you know how many hunters we could\u2019ve saved if you didn\u2019t act so arrogant?\u201dThe Witch of Black Dragon spoke like she was cursing him.\u201cIt\u2019s not just the 5th floor. If you helped us on the 7th and 9th floor, we would\u2019ve suffered half the damage!\u201dThe Venomous Snake of Chen-mu Mun showed murderous intent.\u201cSomeone who was from a rich family in the outside world. If you helped a bit, the tower would\u2019ve been more settled. We\u2019re rotten water? Fine. Then you\u2019re a kid that doesn\u2019t have any responsibility.\u201dCount glared at him.It was a mess.Even with the curses and murderous gazes of the Guild Masters, Sword Saint just grimaced. Everytime he spoke, he made it worse.\u2018Be quiet.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you adults blabbering on about\u2026do you think I\u2019m your grandfather? Put it away. If you\u2019re gonna attack, attack with the sword.\u201dThe reception room became uncontrollably violent.-Dang! As expected of grandpops. Definitely my one and only disciple.Bae Hu-ryeong could\u2019t read the mood and just exclaimed in astonishment.-There\u2019s nothing more disgusting than players talking about connections or politics. If you have time to worry about that, you should fight with your sword instead!What he said made sense.But\u2026I had a regretful heart.\u201cEven in a place with just 10 people, you fight.\u201dThe hunters all looked at me.I sighed.\u201cEven the NPCs of the 11th floor fought to protect their empire. But look. Hunters like us are just pointing fingers at each other saying whose fault it is. Isn\u2019t it embarrassing to be worse than NPCs?\u201d\u201c\u2026Hunter Kim Gong-ja.\u201dThe Witch spoke.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have anything to do with you. It\u2019s worse than what you\u2026\u201d\u201cI know. I get it but\u2026there something that we should do if we\u2019re hunters.\u201dI looked around the reception room.\u201cLet\u2019s focus on clearing the 12th floor first.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good to give hope to people, and respectable to decrease damage, it\u2019s all good. But please work at clearing the stage that\u2019s in front of you.\u201dI especially looked at Sword Saint.\u201cThey\u2019re just NPCs\u2026but their empire is in danger. They want help. If we were summoned as warriors and just fight with words amongst ourselves, how pathetic is that.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dI was being genuine.Sword Saint couldn\u2019t threaten my life here anyway. Since the gap in power was too clear. Then my only focus was clearing the 12th floor.I wasn\u2019t interested in their politics or their emotional qualms.\u201cWhat\u2019s a warrior? Helping others solve what they can\u2019t. Since we cleared the 11th floor, let\u2019s solve the other stages as well.\u201d\u201cKim Gong-ja is right.\u201dThankfully, there was a hunter who agreed.Crusader.The Civil Milita\u2019s Vice Guild Leader stepped up.\u201cI don\u2019t understand why Sword Saint attacked Kim Gong-ja. But this isn\u2019t the time for use to fight. That one thing is clear. You\u2019re all too tense right now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dCrusader stepped to the center. But no one let their guards down. Sword Saint, Venomous Snake, Count, and Heretic Questioner were still ready to attack if needed.They were too distrustful of each other to convince each other with words.Because of the emotions that were held back for a long amount of time.\u201cSigh.\u201dRealizing that, Crusader sighed.\u201cFine. I\u2019ll sacrifice a little.\u201dAt the word sacrifice, the hunters looked back.Crusader murmured to herself at the center of attention.\u201cSkill card open.\u201dWhoosh!Light soared up from Crusader\u2019s hand. A moment later, a silver card appeared. It was a card that no one else could see unless the hunter allowed them to. It was the skill card of Crusader.\u201c\u2026Vice Guild Leader.\u201dThe Witch seemed worried about the Crusader. The high rankers didn\u2019t reveal their skill cards towards others. It was the secret weapon of a hunter. Showing it to others was like revealing your weakness.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dThen Crusader flipped the card over.\u201cLook closely.\u201d+[Lie Detection]Rank: A-Effects: You can tell whether someone is lying or not. It applies to not only people, but NPCs and monsters! But what they think of as \u2018truth\u2019 may actually be \u2018false.\u2019 Trust. Doubt. It all lies in your hands.\u203bHowever, you cannot guarantee that others will believe what you say as the truth.My eyes widened.\u2018Lie Detection!\u2019It was the skill that the Flame Emperor lied about having. So. Crusader had it, and not Flame Emperor.\u2018It fits the Vice Guild Master of the Civil Master perfectly!\u2019The Civil Militia was a guild that maintained order. Crimes were rampant in the tower. Like this. The Flame Emperor or Sword Saint killed people where others couldn\u2019t see.It was this kind of world. [Lie Detection] could be used in telling criminals apart.\u201cAs you can see.\u2019The Crusader spoke with the card in hand.\u201cI have the ability to tell whether someone is lying. It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say this is the skill that got me to where I am. Sword Saint.\u201d\u201c\u2026What.\u201d\u201cIf you trust me, ask anything you want to Kim Gong-ja. I\u2019ll tell you whether he\u2019s telling the truth or not.\u201dThe Crusader looked at me and Sword Saint with apathetic eyes.\u201cKim Gong-ja. Same goes for me. If you believe me, I can guarantee whether what you\u2019re saying is the truth.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDoubt is poison that swallows humans up, and truth is the most powerful antidote. You can\u2019t regain the lost trust, but with this, we\u2019ll be able to work together on the 12th floor.\u201d\u201cMm\u2026\u201dThe Sword Saint was deep in thought, rubbing his beard.\u2018Wow.\u2019And I thought to myself.\u2018It\u2019s lit.\u201dThis was the best opportunity. It was luck that I didn\u2019t expect to come my way. But\u2026this was right. The reason why the Sword Saint was suspicious of me was because of his skill. Since a skill had made him suspicious, a skill could be used to resolve it!\u201cI\u2019m fine with that.\u201dI answered immediately.It would be advantageous to the person who accepted it first.\u201c\u2026Crusader. You\u2019re the only person who hasn\u2019t hurt anyone here. Fine. I\u2019ll believe you as well.\u201dThe Sword Saint spoke mysterious words and accepted it.Crusader nodded.\u201cThen I\u2019ll take it that both of you agree. Sword Saint. Ask what you want to Kim Gong-ja. I\u2019ll put my honor on the line and fairly judge your answers.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dSword Saint glared at me.His face was ready, like he had been waiting for this moment. Was it because he wanted to prove how bad I was? His eyes were full of victory.-No\u2026Bae Hu-ryeong spoke up next to me.-Noo, grandpops Marcus. You boomer. This is why I said not to rely too much on your skill. One who lives by skills dies by it! Nooo, no.\u2018Please be quiet.\u2019Unfortunately, grandpops Marcus couldn\u2019t hear Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s voice. This ghost bastard was my ghost bastard.\u201cHunter Kim Gong-ja.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou killed over 4000 people. Isn\u2019t that true.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27- The Chosen Ones (3)Translator: HHSwish!He pointed at me with his free hand. What was I supposed to say? He sounded like he was saying \u2018How do you like it now! Your bad deeds have been revealed to the world!\u2019I smiled.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHaha, see! You bastards. I\u2019ll report to the world what kind of things you did using this assassin\u2026\u201d\u201cFalse.\u201dThe Crusader spoke.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNot true.\u201dThe Crusader spoke indifferently again.\u201cDidn\u2019t he say \u2018yes\u2019 to your question. That answer was false. So to organize things, Kim Gong-ja didn\u2019t kill over 4000 people.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you have any more questions?\u201dSilence.While the Sword Saint shut his mouth, Crusader tilted her head.\u201cBut 4000. Is it possible for one person to kill that many people? I think that\u2019s almost impossible.\u201d\u201cT, That\u2026you used this youngest as a special assassin\u2026\u201dI brightly smiled.\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m a special assassin.\u201d\u201cNot true.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSword Saint dropped his mouth open.\u201cC, Crusader. I saw you wrong! I thought you wouldn\u2019t lie!\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019ll believe me or not, is up to you.\u201dCrusader replied calmly.\u201cThat\u2019s why I asked if you would believe me at the beginning.\u2019\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you change what you\u2019re saying now it\u2019s a bit\u2026pathetic. No, it\u2019s really pathetic. Sword Saint. It\u2019s unlike how I thought of you.\u201d\u201cW, wait!\u201dThe Sword Saint frantically looked at me.\u201cBut there\u2019s no way you didn\u2019t kill anyone!\u201d\u201cAh. Yes. That\u2019s right. I did get rid of someone once.\u201dCrusader nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201d\u201cSee!\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s just one person.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dCrusader nodded again.\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, just because I killed one person doesn\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019m a murderer. But Sword Saint-nim. Even though I can\u2019t be clean, I can tell you this. That bastard really deserved to die. Because he tried to kill me first.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201d\u201cNo, he would\u2019ve been a gentleman if he just tried to kill me. He massacres people. Massacres. I saw him kill someone, but dang, he didn\u2019t even blink an eye as he burned someone to death! That fucking bastard!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201d\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know for sure, he probably killed tens, no hundreds of people. Yes. He\u2019s definitely someone to do that. I killed someone like that. Curse me as a murderer if you want to. But did you know? Even if I go back to the past, I\u2019ll get rid of him. Dang. Shit. I don\u2019t know how someone can be as evil as him.\u201dCrusader nodded her head.\u201cIt\u2019s all true.\u201c\u2026\u201dSword Saint was silent.He slowly looked around him. He didn\u2019t understand the situation, but now, he probably did after looking around.Because the Guild Masters were all looking at him like \u2018\u2026what are you doing?\u2019\u201cHahahah! Hahaha!\u201dHeretic Questioner burst out laughing.\u201cKim Gong-ja, the special assassin of the Five Large Guilds! How funny! It would be nice if that was true, but Sword Saint! We met Kim Gong-ja for the first time yesterday!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s also true, by the way.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe Sword Saint\u2019s silence was deeper.-Tsk tsk tsk tsk. One who lives by skills, dies by them.Bae Hu-ryeong continued to click his tongue next to me.\u201cMm. Well, I\u2019ve answered everything.\u201dI smiled.What sir Gong-ja said really was all correct.\u201cIt seems like there was a misunderstanding. It\u2019s a good thing that was it. But Sword Saint. If I was really \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI think a word of apology is appropriate here. What do you say?\u201dCrusader nodded her head.\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect truth. With any lie.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cQuickly apologize to Kim Gong-ja. Sword Saint.\u201dThe geezer paled.\u201cI, I\u2026\u201dSword Saint spoke after a considerable amount of time had passed.The hunters were looking at Sword Saint. His lips were dry.\u201cI, to Kim Gong-ja\u2026\u201dSword Saint could say a lot of things here.He could just not believe Crusader. He didn\u2019t have any reason to. Even though Crusader was famed for being just and righteous, she was in the Five Large Guilds. Why did he have to trust her?\u2018You\u2019re all trying to trick me!\u2019Could be what Sword Saint said.Or\u2026he could reveal his own skill card. The power that showed an opponent\u2019s kill count. But it wasn\u2019t wise to show others your skill. However, it was still enough.\u2018I didn\u2019t suspect Kim Gong-ja because I\u2019m a boomer. It\u2019s all because of my skill! What can I do when this is what my skill says? Isn\u2019t it obvious that someone should trust their skill before they trust a person first?\u2019It was natural for people to excuse themselves.\u2018Or there are psychopaths that just kill others like the Flame Emperor.\u2019Distrust. Excuses. Shutting their mouths.The Flame Emperor proved that he was a psychopath by choosing the method of shutting someone\u2019s mouth\u2026and Sword Saint would show what kind of person he was from this.\u201cMm.\u201dSword Saint wet his lips.And he decided.\u201c\u2026Did you say your name was Kim Gong-ja.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIf you didn\u2019t kill innocent people like I thought\u2026no. That\u2019s not it.\u201dSword Saint shook his head while he was speaking. Kashing. As he pulled his sword back in, sighs of relief could be heard in the reception room. The hunters around Sword Saint looked less nervous. Among them, Sword Saint tightened his necktie.\u201cI\u2019ll speak again.\u201dHe bowed his head.\u201cI\u2019m sincerely sorry.\u201dThe old man was apologizing.\u201cI was wrong. I misunderstood\u2026so I almost killed someone. I always thought that I should kill anyone I judged deserving to be killed. I killed by my beliefs.\u201dHe bent his head even more.\u201cBut from now, that won\u2019t happen again.\u201dHis low voice rumbled in the reception room.\u201cJust apologizing with words is useless. If you want anything, I\u2019ll try to uphold it\u2026It would be nice if I could say that but\u2026\u201dSelf-deprecation was mixed in his voice.\u201cPlease don\u2019t ask for my life. I ask you. I still want to live. I want to see the top of this tower. \u2026I made a big mistake, and almost killed you. But please forgive this old man and let him live.\u201dThe palace\u2019s reception room became quiet.The old man could\u2019ve made a different choice. He could\u2019ve not turested the Crusader, or excused himself with his skill. But he didn\u2019t. Instead, he acknowledged that he might be wrong.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe Crusader glanced at me. Our eyes met. She nodded her head silently. We didn\u2019t speak, but I knew what the Crusader was saying.\u2018It\u2019s the truth.\u2019Everything he said was true.His apology, and his promise not to kill people based on his skill. Not only that, but the fact that he didn\u2019t want to die.That he wanted to live more.To forgive him.-That boomer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 \u2013 Fall Rain is Blood (1)Translator: HHBae Hu-ryeong muttered. But he didn\u2019t say anything more. He just looked at the old man who was once his disciple with eyes mixed with regret.Was he trying to say he would leave it up to me whether or not I should forgive Sword Saint?\u201cMm.\u201dAfter hearing his silence, I decided.\u201cSword Saint-nim.\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cTeach me the sword.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dSword Saint lifted his bent head to look at me.\u201cTeach\u2026please accept my sparring request if I ever ask. I did get a teacher, but I don\u2019t have a sparring partner. If you do it, that would be nice.\u2019And I had promised Bae Hu-ryeong on the 11th floor as well.That before I cleared the 20th floor, I would officially start to train.It would be appropriate if I had Sword Saint as my sparring partner.I would gain growth and benefits for myself\u2026\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dNo.That wasn\u2019t it.That wasn\u2019t how I wanted that to come out.I shook my head.\u201cSorry. Allow me to rephrase.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I can just forgive you. But.\u201dI opened my mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit embarrassing. I seem like a nicer person than you. I\u2019m not that amazing a person. I\u2019m just happy that I won\u2019t be an enemy to a strong hunter like you.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cBut it seems a bit embarrassing to forgive you like nothing happened when we all lifted our blades. And it\u2019s embarrassing to pretend to be nice as well. I just don\u2019t like it. So teach me something that\u2019s most useful out of what you have. A sword technique.\u201dFor some reason, I was embarrassed.No, my cheek was twitching.\u201cThen I won\u2019t be embarrassed\u2026and your reputation won\u2019t be hurt.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dShit!To think that it was this embarrassing to speak your mind!Gosh. Sword Saint had asked to forgive him since his life was special to him, right? He looked pretty prideful. He was amazing. Dope. Could you really ask someone sincerely to forgive you? Beg? I could never. Ever. I\u2019d rather die.\u201c\u2026Goodness.\u201dCrusader muttered.\u201cSurprisingly\u2026it\u2019s all true.\u201dSilence descended on the reception room again.It was heavy.It was the same silence as before, but it felt completely different.\u201cUh.\u201dThe Venomous Snake spoke first.\u201cReally? You can ask anything of Sword Saint but it\u2019s embarrassing to act arrogant\u2026? So you want him to be just your sparring partner?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe but it\u2019s true according to my skill at least.\u201d\u201cWhat the heck. Is that newbie some kind of gift set?\u201dShut up before I cook you into snake soup.\u201c\u2026how fresh.\u201dThe Witch spoke incredulously.\u201cHow should I say this. After seeing children who do anything to get more\u2026it\u2019s been a while since I saw a hunter like Kim Gong-ja. I guess they were still living.They were dead. Very.Specifically, over 4000 times. Good?\u201cAwwww.\u201dFor some reason, Heretic Questioner was tearing up.\u201cSomeone who sincerely forgives and someone who is sincerely apologizing! How beautiful. Indeed. Humans endlessly fight. However, that is the reason why they can endlessly forgive! What a holy miracle this is! Ah, everyone. I-\u201d\u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dAt a word from the Venemous Snake, the Heretic Questioner really shut up.It was a surprising miracle.\u201cExcuse me. It\u2019s nice to see that it ended nicely. Does this mean that my 10,000 Gold was wasted?\u201dNo one listened to her.I sighed. I was craving some soju right now.\u201cAnyways. Sword Saint-nim. I don\u2019t need to train sword techniques now. You can help me when I ask. Please be my sparring partner.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dSword Saint was quiet for a moment. He just stared at my face. Then, he slowly opened his mouth.\u201cI.\u201dHis mustache and his lips were shaking.\u201cI can\u2019t believe I misunderstood such a kind youngster!\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cOh! You wanted me to teach you the sword. You said you wanted me to be your sparring partner? Of course, of course! I\u2019ll be your sparring partner!\u201dHe grasped my hand.\u201cUh, excuse me. Sword Saint-nim?\u201d\u201cCall me grandpa Marcus!\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cHow old is our Gong-ja? Hm. I think you\u2019re not over 30 yet. In the outside world, I left a very kind granddaughter outside. She\u2019s extremely kind. If she enters the Tower as well, I\u2019ll appeal for your charm!\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s really okay\u2026\u201dI wasn\u2019t interested in dating. My hand hurt more than anything. My hand.His power was extremely powerful, as fitting of Rank 1.\u201cWhat? You\u2019re not interested in my granddaughter?\u201d\u201cUh. Yes. Sorry, it\u2019s not just your granddaughter but I don\u2019t have interest in dating itse\u2026\u201d\u201cOho! That\u2019s not good!\u201dHis grip on my hand leveled up.\u201cYoungsters should feel the love. You don\u2019t have to marry. But dating is necessary! If you start dating, you see things that you didn\u2019t before, and you learn new things! Yup. And you learn how pathetic you can become!\u201d\u201cOh. I see\u2026\u201d\u201cHow important is it to know how pathetic you can become? I\u2019ll tell you my case. When I was 16, I used to laugh at the world. But I met her, who was the same age as me\u2026\u201dHuh?This old man suddenly became extremely annoying.His face was too close as well. I could see the pores on his nose, and even the blackheads.It was honestly burdensome.I hoped he would get off of me quickly.-I said he was a boomer.Bae Hu-ryeong clicked his tongue.-Whether you say it nicely or rudely, he\u2019s a boomer. Do you know what a boomer is? Someone who doesn\u2019t listen to others. Grandpops Marcus doesn\u2019t listen to others. Nicely said, it means he\u2019s got a backbone. Or it means that he\u2019s backbone is so stuck up that he\u2019s got a stick up his you know what.I didn\u2019t know.I didn\u2019t even want to know.\u201cAnyways, don\u2019t worry. Youngster Gong-ja! From now on, I\u2019ll take care of you well. Ah, do you want an allowance? I stacked up so much money in Sangryun\u2019s safe that I don\u2019t even know where to use it.\u201d\u201cUh. I can earn my own money. And an allowance? I\u2019m an adult now too\u2026\u201d\u201cLooking at your clothes, it\u2019s too casual! Ahem. A person\u2019s outfit should be neat for their mind to be clear. I know a good tailor. How about a suit!\u201dWhat.I should\u2019ve been happy to be liked by the Rank 1. But I wasn\u2019t. Rather, I was extremely embarrassed. It felt like I was listening to my actual grandfather brag about me.Why was\u00a0I\u00a0feeling embarrassed?\u2018What should I do? Should I just kill myself and start the day over?\u2019-Crazy bastard\u2026It was then.[Welcome, hunter Kim Gong-ja.][You have cleared the 11th floor as the Rank 1.]A voice rang in my head.Like it had been waiting for the fight to end.3.\u2018Ah.\u2019I automatically looked around me.Most people were sighting in relief. They looked relieved that the Sword Saint had stopped fighting. It seemed like no one had heard the voice.\u2018I\u2019m first!\u2019I smiled.\u2018I don\u2019t know why but the information about the subjugation on the 12th floor to the 20th floor was extremely limited.\u2019Was it because the media was blocked? There wasn\u2019t any information about the specifics. Before I regressed 4000 times, unlike the other floors, information of the 12th to the 20th floor wasn\u2019t that well-known.Like the large guilds had tried to hide the information on purpose.[The 11th floor clear reward is being given.]I was able to see the reason why soon enough.[The Goddess of Protection is suggesting a reward to you.][The Devil King of Fall Rain is suggesting a reward to you.][Choose between the two rewards.]\u2018Huh?\u2019I blinked my eyes.\u2018Pick a reward?\u2019I heard a voice that I hadn\u2019t heard on the stage before.As if responding to my surprised reaction, a selection window popped up in front of me.+[Goddess of Protection]Summary: The goddess who protects the Aegim Empire is touched at your dedication! The goddess has decided to appoint you to an important position.You can be the chancellor, supreme general, or the grand master.If you choose a position, you will also receive the powers that come along with it.Warrior of the goddess! Work with your fellow warriors!And destroy the core of the Devil King on the 20th floor!\u203b However, if you choose the Devil King\u2019s reward, you cannot choose the goddess\u2019s reward.+I slowly read the reward, nodding my head.\u2018It\u2019s the same as I know already.\u2019Role playing!Hunters would become members of the Aegim empire. Some could be the chancellor, and others could be the grand masters.It wasn\u2019t just a position. You would receive the authority and abilities that came with it.[The special classes you can choose on the 12th floor are being marked.\u2019And rewards were given to the hunters that were ranked higher.The authority to choose before others first!+[Chancellor of Aegim Empire][Supreme General of Aegim Empire][Director of Financial Affairs of Aegim Empire][Director of Foregin Affairs of Aegim Empire][Grand Master of Aegim Empire][Head Bodyguard of Aegim Empire]\u318d\u318d\u318d+Fancy positions were lined up.\u2018Dang.\u2019I exclaimed to myself.\u2018I was only able to choose a role like bodyguard A before\u2026\u2019Even before I regressed, I climbed to the 12th floor. But in completely different circumstances. The higher rankers had taken all the good positions for themselves.But how was the situation now?\u2018The stage rewards are really good I guess.\u2019I was able to pick from the chancellor and the supreme general.\u2018\u2026but what\u2019s the reward of the Devil King?\u2019I lifted my head.Information that I was seeing for the first time was on there.+[Devil King of Fall Rain]Summary: The Devil King is impressed by you. The Devil King suggests a secret alliance. The same things that the goddess offered, along with another present.Kill the other top ten rankers!If you do, you will be able to use the authority of the Devil King and go straight to the 99th floor.\u203bHowever, only 1 from the top 10 can receive this reward.\u203b. If the majority do not choose this reward, it is chosen randomly.\u203b If no one chooses, the offer disappears.+\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dI was left speechless.When I reacted a moment later, two voices overlapped in my head.\u2018What?\u2019-Huh?It was Bae Hu-ryeong and me.We blinked and read the reward of the devil king again.But it was still the same.[Kill the other top ten rankers!][If you do, you will be able to use the authority of the Devil King and go straight to the 99th floor.]It definitely said that.I looked around. Sword Saint. Witch. Heretic Questioner. Count. Venomous Snake. And Crusader. They were all accomplished rankers.\u2018If I\u2026\u201dKill all these people.\u2018I can go straight to the 99th floor?\u2019I swallowed.For the last time, a voice rang in my head.[Hunter Kim Gong-ja.][Choose from the two rewards.]Chapter 28.1 \u2013 Fall Rain is Blood (1)Translator: HHWe were silent.It was a silence between just Bae Hu-ryeong and me. The reward of the Devil King. The 99th floor. I read the rewards of the Devil King again and again. The words that I could be sent straight to the 99th floor spun around my head.-It\u2019s a trap.Bae Hu-ryeong cut my thoughts off like he read my thoughts.-It\u2019s definitely a trap. Zombie. Don\u2019t fall for it.\u2018I\u2026know. Of course it\u2019s a trap. Of co\u2026\u2019I murmured inside my head.It was obvious the reward was a trap.Because.\u2018There\u2019s no way the Flame Plague wouldn\u2019t have chosen the Devil King\u2019s reward otherwise.Since he was the psychopath of the century.\u2018He would\u2019ve definitely chosen the Devil King\u2019s reward. Since he doesn\u2019t care about whether another player dies or not. But\u2026he was on the 40th floor and not the 99th floor. So that means\u2026\u2019I tried to calmly think things through.\u2018The reward of the Devil King is a trap. The Flame Plague probably chose the Devil King\u2019s reward and regressed after figuring out it was a trap. I don\u2019t know exactly what trap it is but\u2026;But.\u2018\u2026To be honest, I want it.\u2019My heart pumped.\u2018This is a chance to get a skill of the 99th floor boss monster.\u2019I was different from Yoo Soo-ha. I didn\u2019t have to defeat the boss monster.I would benefit if I was just killed by it.\u2018He\u2019ll be the strongest boss monster other than the 100th floor\u2026\u2019It would be a lie if I wasn\u2019t tempted.\u2018The 99th floor.;How long would it take for me to get to the 99th floor using normal means?1 year? 5? 10?It might even take longer. Since even the psychopath Flame Emperor was only on the 40th floor after 10 years.But all of that. At once.-Gong-ja.Bae Hu-ryeong stared at me.-Don\u2019t.It was a voice I had never heard before.He was seriously looking at my face.-Look at me. I\u2019m the Sword Emperor. I went to the 99th floor by myself and failed. I\u2019m telling you, this is a trap. A horrible trap.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d-It\u2019s too hard for you to kill the Top 10 Rank players with your skills. Even if you kill them all, you can\u2019t climb over the wall of the 99th floor. Give up.I was silent.Was it because he was the only person to reach the 99th floor in this tower? He seemed credible.\u2018Is the 99th floor boss monster that strong?\u2019Bae Hu-ryeong frowned.-There\u2019s none.\u2018What?\u2019-There\u2019s no boss monster on the 99th floor. There\u2019s something that\u2019s worse\u2026bleh. I suddenly thought of the past. Anyways, this is a trap!He sat with his back to me. He was like a little kid didn\u2019t get his candy. I was a bit flustered.\u2018Wait, just what\u2019s on the 99th floor? You\u2019re scaring me. I\u2019ve never seen you like this before. Is it something like a Devil God if it\u2019s not a monster?\u2019-Humph. I\u2019m not telling you!I said that wrong.He wasn\u2019t\u00a0like\u00a0a kid, he\u00a0was\u00a0a kid.-I don\u2019t want to acknowledge it, but you\u2019re doing pretty well, Kim Zombie. Just keep on doing as you are. Then you can clear the 99th floor.\u201cMm.\u201dI was deep in thought. I rubbed my sword that was in its sheath. It was the sword that killed me over 4000 times. It was the sword that I used to kill Yoo Soo-ha. It was nothing more that a cheap sword, but touching it comforted me.\u2018Alright.\u2019I came to my decision.\u2018I\u2019ll throw away this regression.\u2019His ears twitched.-Throw it away?\u2018Yes. I\u2019m going to pick the most safe route for me. Ignoring all things like rewards and benefits. I\u2019m going to see how everything turns out first.\u2019-Ignoring rewards and benefits\u2026huh. Are you going to reject the [Reward of the Goddess] too? Why? You don\u2019t have to go that far.\u2018It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m taking a step back so I can run forward.\u2019You had to take the longer route the most rushed you were.I slowly opened my mouth.\u201cEveryone.\u201dAll the hunters in the reception room looked at me.\u201cThe rewards of the 11th floor just popped up for me.\u201d\u201cReally? That\u2019s nice.\u201dThe Witch reacted first. Was it because she hadn\u2019t seen the reward of the goddess and the reward of the Devil King yet? Her face was as indifferent as ever.\u201cI was starting to get bored wondering how long we would have to wait for the quest. If you pick the reward first, we can pick according to our ranks after. Choose slowly.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. I\u2019ve already decided.\u201dI announced in front of all the high rankings rankers.\u201cI didn\u2019t choose any reward.\u201dThe reception room was silent. Heretic Questioner and Venomous Snake, who were playing cards off to the side, turned to look at me as well. 3 seconds. 2 seconds. 1 second. After a silence, the Witch wrinkled her forehead.\u201cWhat?\u201dBut it was too late.[You have not chosen a stage reward.][You cannot choose the special class.][If you give up the reward, you can only choose the roles after the 13th floor.][Are you really choosing this?]I answered firmly.\u201cYes, I, Kim Gong-ja, will not choose any reward.\u201dThe selection window in front of me crumbled to pieces. It wasn\u2019t just that. A holy voice and a dark voice rang in my head.[The Goddess of Protection is questioning your decision.][The Devil King of Fall Rain laughs darkly.]The hunters all looked disbelieving.\u201cKim Gong-ja? What did you just\u2026?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dThen, Sword Saint wrinkled his forehead. His old eyes scanned midair. After me, Rank 1, Sword Saint was Rank 2. He was looking at the rewards now.\u201c\u2026Hm. I understand. You chose the safest option.\u201dSword Saint looked at me.\u201cBut isn\u2019t there no need to give up the reward? Youngster. This may be an old man\u2019s foolish concern, but I don\u2019t think you need to give up like that for your safety.\u201d\u201cThank you for your concern. However, I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d\u201cMmmm. It\u2019s a relief if you don\u2019t regret it but\u2026\u201dHe trailed off. The other hunters looked at us confusedly. They looked like they didn\u2019t understand what we were talking about.\u201c\u2026No.\u201dHe shook his head.\u201cJust giving up the reward is too mild. Sorry, youngster. I\u2019ll choose the goddess\u2019s reward. And choose the [Grand Master of Aegim Empire].\u201dCreak!It was the moment Sword Saint made his decision. The reception room door opened. A bunch of knights walked out. They were wearing fancy shining armor, and they kneeled in front of the old man.\u201cPledging allegiance to the highest sword of the empire!\u201d\u201cOho.\u201dSword Saint looked amusedly down at the knights.\u201cSo this is how the roles are decided.\u201d\u201cMm? Aha? So?\u201dNext was Heretic Questioner. Rank 3 of the stage. He tilted his head, and exclaimed with an \u201cAha!He seemed to have understood the situation now.\u201cI see. I understand now! Haha. It\u2019s similar to the mafia game.\u201dOther than us, the other hunters still looked confused. The Witch narrowed her yes.\u201c\u2026I have no idea what you people are saying.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry! I\u2019ll tell you right away!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner raised his hands. Words started to be written on the ground. He had used Aura to carve letters in the marble.\u201cLook, everyone!\u201dHunters crowded around to look at the ground.+[Goddess of Protection]Summary: The goddess who protects the Aegim Empire is touched at your dedication! The goddess has decided to appoint you to an important position.\u318d\u318d\u318d+The hunters started to murmur amongst themselves.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe 99th floor? Legit\u2026?\u201dThey didn\u2019t have much of a reaction when they read the goddess\u2019s reward. But their eyes changed remarkably at the Devil King\u2019s reward.The Witch\u2019s gaze especially turned darker.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u201cYup! It\u2019s similar to the mafia game! For convenience\u2019s sake, I\u2019ll call those who chose the goddess\u2019s reward [Warrior]s and those who choose the other option [Betrayer]s.\u201dHe smiled warmly.\u201cBut there\u2019s a big difference. The [Betrayer] is at more of a disadvantage than a mafia! Because there are 9 warriors, but only 1 betrayer. And we have the Vice Guild Master of the Civil Militia!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner pointed at the Crusader.The Crusader was looking at the marble floor with an apathetic face.\u201cThink of it! The Vice Guild Master has a Lie Detection skill. Haha. Compared to the mafia game, she\u2019s like the police. So even if someone chooses the Devil King\u2019s Reward, it\u2019s okay! Because the [Betrayer] will be reported right away!\u201d\u201cMm\u2026you\u2019re right.\u201dCrusader slowly lifted her head.\u201cIf you believe me.\u201d\u201cAnyways, this game is advantageous to the warriors! Hunter Kim Gong-ja. Giving up the reward was an extreme solution!\u201dHeretic Questioner fixed his hat.\u201cYou didn\u2019t accept any reward even though you defeated the 11th floor as Rank 1. Mm! It\u2019s a very hard thing for me to imagine. With respect towards your decision, I\u2019ll choose the [Supreme General of Aegim Empire]!\u201dCreaaak.The reception door opened again. General NPCs entered with their flowing red capes. The generals stood in front of the Heretic Questioner and saluted.\u201cAllegiance towards the highest flag of the empire!\u201d\u201cAh, amazing. I leave it in your hands as well!\u201dThe general NPCs lined up behind the Heretic Questioner.This was the deciding factor.\u201cTsk. I hate using my head. So you\u2019re saying it\u2019s better to choose a reward, right? Then I\u2019ll choose the [Head Bodyguard of Aegim Empire].\u201dVenomous Snake.\u201cThen me, the [Director of Foregin Affairs of Aegim Empire]. It looks the most normal.\u201dCrusader.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll choose the [Chancellor]. Please, don\u2019t choose the reward of the Devil King. It\u2019ll disappear if no one chooses it. That\u2019s the most wise decision. Everyone be careful.\u201dThe Witch.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Hm. Well, of course it\u2019s [Director of Financial Affairs].\u201dThe Count.The rest of the hunters had chosen their rewards.The reception room was filled with NPCs. The amount of knightages behind Sword Saint increased, and behind the Witch, there were countless emissaries.-Wow.Only one place in the reception place was empty. Behind me.-You were really the only person not to get a reward. Are you going to be okay, Zombie? I know you\u2019re throwing this regression away, but isn\u2019t this too bad?\u2018It\u2019s fine.\u2019I was sure.It might\u2019ve been my instinct as a hunter.\u2018This is the answer.\u2019When you had to attack the target. When you had to step back.I-[The calculation of the rewards is finished.]Felt that this was the time to step back.[The highest rankers have completed their choices.][Kim Gong-ja, Sword Saint, Heretic Questioner, Venomous Snake, Crusader, Witch, Count\u2026]A voice rang in the reception room.The hunters quietly exchanged glances when their names were announced.[Disclaimer of the Reward, 1 person.]Everyone turned to look at me. Of them, I was the only person to announce that I gave up the reward.The hunters made expressions like they couldn\u2019t believe I did that.[Receivers of the goddess\u2019s reward, 8 people.]And soon, their faces hardened.[Receiver of the Devil King\u2019s reward, 1 person.]The hunters all looked at each other.[Total 10 people.][All the highest rankers have finished making their decisions.][Letting everyone know again.]There was silence.[Disclaimer of the Reward, 1 person.][Receivers of the goddess\u2019s reward, 8 people.][Receiver of the Devil King\u2019s reward, 1 person.][All the highest rankers have finished making their decisions.]It was a long silence.[May luck be with everyone.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 \u2013 Fall Rain is Blood (2)Translator: HHCrunch.The first sound to break the silence was someone clacking their teeth together.\u201cYou foolish\u2026!\u201dThe Guild Master of the Black Dragon, and Rank 2. It was the Witch.\u201cI said not to pick the Devil King\u2019s reward! But you still\u2026stupid!\u201dA murderous aura swirled around the Witch. Her face wasn\u2019t emotionless like it always was. Hate. Fury. She looked around, face crumpled in anger.\u201cWell. I guess words wouldn\u2019t work on a stupid fool. Fine! I\u2019ll make a proclamation as the master of Black Dragon here. I don\u2019t know who dared to betray us, but I\u2019ll present to them the most painful death.\u201d\u201cHm. Surprising.\u201dHeretic Questioner stroked his chin.\u201cThis is a game that\u2019s way disadvantageous to the betrayer. But you still chose it\u2026as the Black Dragon Master said, it\u2019s a foolish choice! Haha. Well, it\u2019s definitely human-like to make such a foolish decision\u201d\u201cAh\u2026fuck.\u201dThe Venomous Snake scratched the back of his head.\u201cAh, I know. I know. This atmosphere. It\u2019s like when we first challenged the tower\u2026my back and my neck feel fucking cold. Some people are gonna die today.\u201d\u201cI know, right? It\u2019s like when the Five Large Clans were the Ten Large Clans.\u201dThe Count opened her fan. She had a lazy tone. But her eyes behind her fan were as sharp as a beast\u2019s.\u201cA lot of people died then. And killed a lot too. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cShut up! Everyone be quiet. It\u2019s not the time to think about the old times right now.\u201dThe Witch\u2019s face was twisted.\u201cCrusader!\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d\u201cQuestion everyone here with Lie Detection. Don\u2019t leave anyone out! If someone doesn\u2019t answer you or lies, I\u2019ll kill them right on the spot!\u201dEveryone knew she wasn\u2019t just saying that. She emanated a murderous aura, and it rode her on coattails like Aura. It was a black color. It was the color that cursed everything in the world.\u201cI was planning on doing that even if you didn\u2019t say it.\u201dCrusader quietly nodded her chin.\u201cFirst, I\u2019ll reveal that I\u2019m not the betrayer before I question everyone.\u201dAnd she turned her feet.The first person she stood in front of was\u2026none other than me.\u201cHunter Kim Gong-ja.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not on the suspects because you gave up the reward. You probably don\u2019t even need to be tested. But I\u2019ll still ask. Did you choose the reward of the Devil King?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dThe reception room was dead silent.Every hunter was watching us.After a few seconds of silence, the Crusader nodded her head.\u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201dSighs of relief could be heard from everywhere.The Crusader didn\u2019t stop and headed straight for the next person.Click clack.Because the ground of the reception room was made of marble, every footstep rang out.We followed her feet with our eyes.\u201cSword Saint.\u201d\u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cDid you choose the reward of the Devil King.\u201dSword Saint crossed his arms.\u201cI swear on my honor. It\u2019s definitely not me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201dClick clack.\u201cHeretic Questioner.\u201d\u201cYes! Please ask whatever you need to!\u201d\u201cAre you the person who chose the Devil King\u2019s reward?\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201dIn the midst of all the silence, Heretic Questioner laughed. The sound of laughter echoed on the marble and slid over the armor of the knights and the generals.\u201cBut it\u2019s not me! I don\u2019t want to die by the Black Dragon Master yet!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201dClick clack.\u201cVenomous Snake. Did you choose the reward of the Devil King.\u201d\u201cFuck.

Did you choose the Devil King\u2019s reward?\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s not me either.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201dClick clack.The atmosphere of the room turned downhill. When I was revealed not to be the betrayer, there were sighs of relief. But one by one, as everyone\u2019s truth was declared, the reception room was filled with silence and not relief.Like how sleep crept up.The silence crept up to our chins.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dThe Crusader and the Witch looked at each other.Every other hunter except for the Witch had been questioned. This was the last. In front of the leader of the most powerful guild in the tower, and the hunter second only to Sword Saint, the Crusader took a deep breath.\u201cBlack Dragon.\u201d\u201c\u2026yes.\u201d\u201cDid you choose the reward of the Devil King.\u201dThere was silence.\u201cNo\u2026it\u2019s not me.\u201dThe silence was continued.The Crusader slowly opened her mouth.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s the truth.\u201dAnd for the last time, silence descended on us.No.We descended on the silence.\u201cWait\u2026what?\u201dThe Venomous Snake looked around.\u201cWho is it then?\u201dSword Saint looked at the Witch. The Witch looked at the Heretic Questioner. The Heretic Questioner looked at the Count, and the Count looked at Venomous Snake. The Venomous Snake looked at the Crusader like he was hanging onto her, and the Crusader silently looked at me.Everyone looked at each other.\u201cWhy is everyone saying they\u2019re not it\u2026?\u201dBut no one answered.\u201cFuck! Who betrayed us?\u201dNo one.No one answered.Amidst the silence, a voice that wasn\u2019t ours rang out.[The Goddess of Protection sighs at the foolishness of the warriors.][The Devil King of Fall Rain laughs amusedly.]It probably wasn\u2019t a voice that only I heard. Everyone\u2019s face darkened.And the Crusader spoke with much difficulty in that silence.\u201c\u2026Calm down.\u201dNo one opened their mouths even though she said to calm down. How were they supposed to speak? They looked like they were all seriously in thought.\u201cDon\u2019t be taken aback. Yes. Maybe the betrayer has the skill to hide their lies. And there might be someone with a split personality. Everyone has their secret weapon, right? So it\u2019s not impossible\u2026\u201d\u201cOr.\u201dSword Saint spoke up.He was looking at the Crusader coldly.\u201cOr, you might be the dirty betrayer.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dThe reception room became silent.Gazes sharper than knives were exchanged. Just now, the Sword Saint and Guild Masters had been about to fight. The heat and sweat of that hadn\u2019t cooled down, but it was beginning to waver again.The Witch narrowed her eyes.\u201cAre you doubting us right now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSword Saint admitted it directly.\u201cEven if Ms. Crusader isn\u2019t the betrayer, she could\u2019ve lied to us. You all. You were all close as the controllers of the Five Large Guilds since a long time ago. A crow hides with other crows. Aren\u2019t you protecting each other?\u201d\u201cSigh, you\u2019re really\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course!\u2019The Crusader shouted out frantically. Sword Saint and the Witch stopped arguing to look at her. She tried to speak calmly.\u201cOf course, logically speaking, it could be me. Yes. I could be the betrayer.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cBut we all have to keep our cool. It\u2019s alright. We\u2019ve faced many dangers before. Isn\u2019t that right! So if we just trust ourselves we can\u2026\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201dSomeone laughed.\u201cYou\u2019re quite innocent. No, na\u00efve.\u201dIt was the Heretic Questioner.\u201cTrust. Mm. Trust. It\u2019s beautiful! But we need time to trust each other. Us Five Large Guilds have spent 10 years working together. But that also means\u2026\u201dHeretic Questioner took adjusted his cap.And he shook off his clothes.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to trust those other than us Five Guilds.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cAnd it would be inefficient to take 10 years to stack up trust with everyone. Yes, it\u2019s a waste of time!\u201d\u201c\u2026Wait.\u201dThe Crusader\u2019s face was frantic as well. I couldn\u2019t feel her relaxedness back when she asked me if a girl who graduated with a music degree was charming.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to talk about efficiency. Heretic Questioner. Please\u2026\u201d\u201cHoly Technique.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner gathered his hands.\u201cDivine Body.\u201dWhite light surrounded his hands.\u201cVenomous Snake. You take care of the 10th.\u201dThe light spread around.\u201cI\u2019ll kill the 8th and 9th.\u201d\u201cHeretic Questioner! You can\u2019t!\u201d\u201cHoly Technique, Divine Transmission.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner and Venomous Snake disappeared. In the blink of an eye, the Heretic Questioner was holding someone\u2019s back. It was the hunter who finished as 8th. The hunter instinctively looked back.\u201c\u2014Huh?\u201dIt was an extra who had quietly been standing to the back, surrounded by the Guild Masters. No, saying he was an extra seemed too mean. Since he was standing here with his contribution in the last stage. He was a much more powerful hunter than the old me.But his future didn\u2019t last for too long.\u201cSorry!\u201dHeretic Questioner smiled brightly. In his weaponless bare hand, there was pure white Aura.Swoosh!\u201cHuh, ah\u2026?\u201dBlood soared up.The hunter\u2019s body tilted.The hunter that wasn\u2019t bound to any guild, had the immense power of Sword Saint, or had an alliance with the guilds like me, the hunter that had climbed to where he was with his own power, died just like that.Simply.[A warrior has died.][He is not the servant of the Devil King.]Voices rang in my head again.[The Goddess of Protection thinks it\u2019s a shame.][The Devil King of Fall Rain laughs snidely.]It was a murder that had happened in the blink of an eye.\u201cE, eek!?\u201dA hunter that had finished 10th screamed. But the hunter\u2019s scream didn\u2019t last for too long.Crunch!The hunter\u2019s body fell to the ground, halved, by the Venomous Snake who was transmitted by the Heretic Questioner.[A warrior has died.][He is not the servant of the Devil King.]Blood flowed on the marble floor.[The Goddess of Protection shuts her mouth.][The Devil King of Fall Rain explodes in laughter.]Kashing!From somewhere, the sound of a sword being unsheathed rang out. It was the Sword Saint.\u201cYou bastards are finally showing your real selves!\u201dThe old man\u2019s face was crumpled in anger.\u201cDisgusting! You\u2019re not the slightest bit different as before! Stop this instant. If you don\u2019t stop, I\u2019ll-\u201d\u201cHoly Technique, Divine Transmission.\u201dWith a flashing light, the Heretic Questioner disappeared.The hunter who was 9th ran away as soon as they saw the 8th and 10th hunter die. But the moment he tried to leave, the Heretic Questioner appeared right in front of his nose.\u201cAh,\u201dThe hunter stretched his hand out.\u201cW, wait-\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner smiled from ear to ear.\u201cSorry!\u201dThe hunter\u2019s head exploded. The hunter fell over with one arm extended. Plop. The headless body lightly fell over. Blood and flesh that burst with the explosion was spread out everywhere.[A warrior has died.][They are not the servant of the Devil King.][The Goddess of Protection is silent.][The Devil King of Fall Rain is clapping his hands.]\u201cMm.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner pulled out his handkerchief.His face was red with the blood of the hunters who died. He lazily wiped his face. With just three wipes, the handkerchief was soaked in blood.\u201cSo it wasn\u2019t the three!\u201dIt was silent.\u201cThis is tricky. I thought the betrayer would be along the 3! Haha. Then that means that betrayer is among us. Seems like the trust of 10 years will disappear in a moment!\u201dHe threw the red handkerchief to the ground.It fell in a puddle of blood and floated like a paper sailboat.\u201cI said wait\u2026\u201dThe Crusader\u2019s shoulders were shaking.\u201cI said to wait. I definitely said so\u2026didn\u2019t I ask you to wait! I asked you to be calm, Heretic Questioner, and like the past\u2026!\u201cYou\u2019re being strange. Vice Guild Master! I\u2019m calm right now.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner smiled.Like it wasn\u2019t enough, he pulled out a handkerchief with his right hand.\u201cI calmly came to the decision that the three were most likely to be the criminal. Although it was wrong! Let\u2019s be on the positive side and think that we got rid of the three most suspicious people. Ah. If the media saw, it would\u2019ve been bad, but no one was filming so-\u201dIt was that moment.The handkerchief flew in the air.The clean white handkerchief that hadn\u2019t wiped blood yet floated up. Before it fell, something that was heavier fell first.It was the right arm of the Heretic Questioner.\u201cAh.\u201dIt might\u2019ve been a relief it was just that.If the Venomous Snake didn\u2019t stop the attack of the Sword Saint, it might\u2019ve been his head.\u201cFuck\u2026!\u201dThe Venomous Snake cursed and stood in front of the Sword Saint.\u201cHey, zealot! Let us know if you\u2019re going to kill someone beforehand!\u201d\u201cAhh.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner looked down. The handkerchief landed a moment later. It quickly turned red.\u201cThis is difficult now, not just tricky. I can\u2019t help without both hands. Sorry, everyone! I can\u2019t be of help anymore!\u201d\u201cIs\u2026that\u2026the\u2026problem now\u2026!\u201dThe Venomous Snake looked like he was struggling against the Sword Saint\u2019s attacks.\u201cSomeone\u2026fucking\u2026.help me! I\u2019m gonna die! Seriously!\u201d\u201cKim Gong-ja!\u201dThe Crusader shouted.\u201cI\u2019m leaving everything to you! You can even take my life!\u201dIt was more of a scream.\u201cOnly you didn\u2019t receive the reward! Others might be the betrayer, but only you\u2019re not! You 100% not the \u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cSo please, I\u2019m asking this of you! Stop the Sword Saint!\u201dThe sounds of swords clashing against each other filled the room. The Witch and the Count were helping Venomous Snake. Only the Crusader was looking at me.I momentarily looked at the fight in front of me.\u2018Sword Emperor.\u2019-Hm? What?\u2018\u2026Am I destined to be loved by psychopaths or something?\u2019I had expected something like this would happen.I thought they would raise their swords at each other if a betrayer came up. So I had given up the reward.But.\u2018I didn\u2019t think it would become like this\u2026\u2019I sighed.\u201cAh, that\u2019s good! It\u2019s not a bad idea!\u201dHeretic Questioner popped up between me and Crusader. He was holding his arm to stop the bleeding. Surprisingly, his face didn\u2019t seem pained.\u201cIn these cases, a lot of people only get in the way. So it\u2019s better to focus on the person who\u2019s not the betrayer.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying\u2026\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner smiled brightly.\u201cI\u2019ll give all judgement to you!\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cMm, I thought the criminal would be from the 3, but nothing can be done about it anymore! I don\u2019t trust myself. Hunter Kim Gong-ja. I\u2019ll do what you say!\u201dBae Hu-ryeong muttered.\u2013Yes. Yeah. I think you\u2019re destined to be loved by psychos. Guys like this aren\u2019t common. There was only about 1 of them in my tower.I really didn\u2019t like this fate.\u2018I even got all authority from the Vice Guild Master and the Guild Master\u2026\u2019-You\u2019ve been promoted. Wasn\u2019t this why you gave up the reward? I was impressed by you right now.\u2018I knew it would become a mess but not like this. What should we do about those poor people? I guess I\u2019ll have to regress\u2026\u2019I glanced at the Crusader behind me.She was gripping her head.\u201cUh. I have a question.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dDid she already know what I was going to ask.\u201cHe was already like that.\u201d\u2018He\u2019 was the Heretic Questioner.\u201cWhen we first entered the tower, it was pandemonium. Everyone believed in different religions, and they split and made up again. Then, the Heretic Questioner appeared and\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201c\u2026Killed them all.\u201dShe sighed again.\u201cHe completely killed everyone who fought because of religion. That\u2019s the only way he knows\u2026\u201d\u201cWow.\u201dI thought he had peacefully settled things with everyone, because that\u2019s what the media said. But to think such a massacre was behind all of it\u2026\u201cSave\u2026.me!\u201dThe Venomous Snake screamed a bit over where I was.It felt like the octave increased with every minute.\u201cDying! Fu\u2026ck! I\u2019m really dying! The Chen-mu Master is going to die, you bastards!\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner fixed his cap with his left hand.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for making this mess. Kim Gong-ja hunter! Can\u2019t you please stop the Sword Saint with the condition of my authority!\u201d\u201cSigh. You\u2026never mind.\u201dI shook my head.\u201cLet\u2019s talk about you later. Very deeply. But I\u2019ll take care of this right now because I think Venomous Snake will really die right now.\u201d\u201cYes! Thank you!\u201d\u2018Well. It\u2019s nice to be able to control Ten Thousand Temple and the Civil Militia if only for a bit\u2026\u2019I convinced myself.There was an intense fight going on. To join it would be suicide.But I knew the magic word to stop the Sword Saint.\u201cSword Saint-nim!\u201dThere was no reply.\u201cSword Saint-nim! Since you already bowed your head to me once again, please listen to me! Let\u2019s stop fighting and talk!\u201dThere was still no reaction.Ah. There was no other choice.I took a deep breath, and shouted.\u201cI\u2019ll ask your granddaughter out!\u201dPause.\u201cIf your granddaughter enters the tower. Yes, I\u2019ll meet her once. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll go out, but since I might be your grandson in law, please listen to me!\u201dHe quietly looked at me.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not forgiving them.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not stopping because of what you said. I just thought that it might be better to find the betrayer and kill them after. Right?\u201dWhy are you asking me-Was what I stopped myself from asking, and I nodded my head instead.\u201cAh, yes you\u2019re right. You can kill them after.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dThe Sword Saint pulled his sword back.Opposite of his, the Venomous Snake was panting hard.\u201cEveryone. Please calm down.\u201dI spoke looking at the hunters.\u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s the betrayer. We might not find out. But that\u2019s another problem. We can defeat the problem even without finding them.\u201d\u201c\u2026.How?\u201d\u00a0the Crusader asked.\u201cThe fact that they accepted the reward means they can stab us in the back any moment.\u201d\u201cLook at this.\u201dI pointed at the marble ground. What the Heretic Questioner had engraved was still on there.\u201cIt says the Devil King\u2019s Core is on the 20th floor.\u201dI looked at each of them one by one.\u201cDon\u2019t focus on finding the betrayer, it\u2019s a trap. Don\u2019t fall for it. The betrayer might be scared out of their wits right now, and they might have been forcefully picked by the system. Who knows?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s get rid of the Devil King first.\u201dIt became silent.\u201cIf we get rid of the Devil King, his reward will disappear as well. It\u2019s simple. No matter what kind of ridiculous test the tower offers, the solution is simple.Voices rang in my head.[The Goddess\u2019s eyes are shining.][The Devil King clicks his tongue.]I put emphasis on my words.\u201cLet\u2019s climb the tower.\u201dThis was my answer.\u201cAnd let\u2019s destroy the Devil King\u2019s Core on the 20th floor.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t my answer only towards the hunters, but to the tower.And there was a reply to my answer.[The quest of the 12th floor is being given.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 \u2013 Fall Rain is Blood (3)Translator: HH[The quest of the 12th floor is being given.]As soon as the voice could be heard, something poured on the window.Drip. Drip.It was rain.Rain slid down the fancy window in the reception room. For a moment, we turned out gazes to look outside. It wasn\u2019t because we were surprised by the sound. There was something else that made us surprised.\u201cUh, uhhhhh\u2026\u201d\u201cNightmare! The rain of nightmare is pouring down again!\u201dThe color of the rain.It was as red as blood. No, it might\u2019ve been actual blood. The NPCs who were with us started to hold their heads and groan.\u201cGoddess, please don\u2019t abandon us!\u201d\u201cW, What? Why are they suddenly being like this\u2026?\u201dThe exhausted Venomous Snake looked around him.\u201cIt\u2019s the Devil King\u2026\u201dThe NPCs wearing armor muttered. They were crouched down on the ground with trembling shoulders. Like the trembling was infectious, groans started to come from everywhere.\u201cIt\u2019s the end of the empire now\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Devil King is coming\u2026\u201d\u201cYour Majesty\u2026.where is our emperor\u2026?\u201dAll of their faces were dark. Despair. Acceptance. Exhaustion. Their faces were no different than actual humans.The Venomous Snake gulped.\u201cT, They\u2019re funny. Hey. This is all acting, right? What happened now?\u201d\u201cThe quest has begun.\u201dI spoke quietly.\u201cWe won\u2019t fight if we stay still. If there\u2019s arguments between us, they\u2019ll have no choice but to attack us.\u201d\u201cAttack? Who?\u201d\u201cWho do you think?\u201dI looked outside the window.\u201d\u201cThe being that caused these arguments between.\u201dLaughter flowed in my head.[The Devil King of Fall Rain is agreeing with you.]The rain poured down harder. The sound that was like someone knocking instantly became even more quiet. Tens of red drops covered the window.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dI approached the window. I couldn\u2019t see outside from here. Because the rain was too bad, the entire window was red. I broke the window with my sheath.Red rain poured into the reception room. I saw clearly down what was happening outside. The palace. The city beyond the palace. The great wall beyond the city.[The Devil King of Fall Rain is manifesting.]It was beyond the city walls.-Pitiful things.It whispered quietly.Yes. It was a whisper.Just a whisper climbed over the walls, the city, and flowed into the reception room through the broken window.-Did you think humans summoned from another world would be your shield? Did you think they would be your heroes?The rain endlessly poured.-Come at me. Come at me as much as you want. Summon as many as you want. Call for thousands of warriors and knights. It\u2019s pitiful you can\u2019t realize that they\u2019re only humans like you.The voice rang through the pouring rain. It rang in the walls. It rang in the palace\u2019s walls. It rang in the reception room\u2019s wall. It laughed. It was a loud laughter. The laughter echoed and echoed, ringing our ears.\u201cAgh\u2026\u201dThe NPCs bent down further. They gripped their heads like they were in pain.We were better off than them. It was our first time hearing the laughter. It was bearable. If we had to listen to that voice for over a year, the story would change.-Things who don\u2019t see humans as humans.It was then.On the map that only I could see, red spots suddenly started to appear on the map. One. Two. Three. The red dots that were slowly appearing, grew exponentially.Hundreds.Thousands.Ten thousands.Soon, the entire horizon turned into red.-Be swallowed by your evil.It hailed.The sky and the earth suddenly became pale, and the things between it showed themselves.It was the monsters that were the red dots.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dThe hunters shut their mouths. It was a monster army incomparable to the one on the 11th stage. A colossal army was heading towards us.-Krrrr.-Kiek, kek!The monsters cried out. They bared their teeth. They twisted their necks. Rain poured down the goblins\u2019 twisted faces. The blood rain was probably holy water for them. They looked at the sky like they were looking towards a god, and they saluted the red rain.\u201c\u2026I said so.\u201dI gripped my sword.\u201cIt\u2019s not the time for us to fight.\u201dAnd letters appeared in front of me.+[Defense of the Empire\u2019s City]Difficulty: A~SSSMission goal: Warriors! You have decided to fight bravely against the Devil King. The Devil King has joined the war himself after sensing danger. He can summon monster armies wherever. He is aiming for the heart of the Aegim Empire, the Imperial city, Hakamenia.Fortunately, the Devil King is weakened from manifesting here.Stop the Devil King!\u203bHowever, loss in the battle means the 13th floor will not be opened.+It was silent for a moment.\u201c\u2026became weak?\u201dThe Venomous Snake murmured.\u201cThat?\u201dWhat he said reflected what everyone was thinking.\u201cThis\u2026is unfair. How are we supposed to clear it? This isn\u2019t a quest that we can solve. Even if up to the 10th floor was only a tutorial\u2026this is too different. Things like this.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Let\u2019s be calm.\u201dI turned to look at the reception room.There were the hunters. Behind them, the NPCs were in despair.\u201cWe can do it. The tower doesn\u2019t give quests that can\u2019t be cleared.\u201d\u201cBut, how do we defeat those many monsters\u2026?\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you to be calm.\u201dI pointed at the NPCs.\u201cWe\u2019re not just hunters here. Did you forget? Venomous Snake. You\u2019re the Head Bodyguard. You have to lead them.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t break through this stage with just hunters.\u201dYeah.\u201cConvince the NPCs. Raise them up to fight. Lead them. Lead them into war like they\u2019re real people.\u201dThat was how the 11th floor was subjugated as well.\u201cWe can\u2019t fight each other here. Sword Saint-nim. You\u2019re the Grand Master of knights. A Head Bodyguard and Grand Master fight? How can we defend against outer forces?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cDid you think it was beneficial to get the reward? It is. But you have responsibility as well. We received the roles, and it\u2019s time to role play.\u201dI turned my head towards the Crusader.She was looking at me with a serious face.\u201cDirector of Foreign Affairs.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d\u201cThis is the reception room but the Emperor isn\u2019t in sight. He\u2019s probably somewhere in the palace. Please search for the Emperor with the NPCs. If the leader isn\u2019t here, the NPCs won\u2019t follow us.\u201dThe Crusader nodded.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u201cSupreme General.\u201dI looked at the Heretic Questioner. Even though he lost an arm, he was still smiling brightly. Rather, he was looking at me like he was amused.\u201cYes! That\u2019s me!\u201d\u201cI hate hunters like you. Really. I felt that I needed to see the end of things with you after seeing what you did. But, you can\u2019t forget that you\u2019re the Supreme General now.\u201d\u201cHaha. I\u2019m starting to like you more and more!\u201d\u201cSince you gave me authority, please shut up and listen to me.\u201dI looked at the map and spoke.There wasn\u2019t a lot of time. The red wave was getting closer.\u201cThere\u2019s probably a lot of soldiers at the city walls. Monsters are getting closer to them like hail, but there\u2019s no way they\u2019re feeling normal. Please go to the city walls yourself and assure the soldiers.\u201d\u201cMm! It\u2019s noblesse oblige!\u201d\u201cPlease defend the city walls no matter what. If they fall, this stage is over.\u2019\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dHeretic Questioner smiled.\u201cI\u2019ve never broken a promise since I was born. I\u2019ll guard it with my life!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dI looked around me.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be off first.\u201dIt was time for war.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 \u2013 Red Sword (1)Translator: HHAs soon as I left the palace, the remaining hunters were being summoned.\u201cWhoa. Where\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cGood thing it\u2019s not a messy port.\u201dThe hunters looked around like they were tourists.\u201cHuh, is this holy rain? The color is\u2026\u201d\u201cGo under the roof! Quickly!\u201d\u201cHey. It says to choose a role as my reward.\u201d\u201cRole? What\u2019s that?\u201dThe hunters didn\u2019t understand the situation. Was it because they arrived later than us?\u2018Even the highest rankers suspected and fought each other.\u20193 people had died just because they were doubted. How bad would it be for the remaining hunters! Not much could be expected from the hunters who just entered the stage.\u2018There\u2019s no time to convince the players.\u2019Because the Devil King\u2019s Army was coming even now.\u2018We need to stop the attack with NPCs first!\u2019I ignored the hunters and ran down the street. It became even more crowded. But thankfully, I had to mini map with me. I took the fastest path to the city walls.\u201cKim Gong-ja.\u201dIt was when I left the palace. Someone appeared next to me.\u201cWitch?\u201d\u201cCall me Black Dragon Master. I don\u2019t like my nickname that much.\u201dWitch. The Rank 2 hunter and I were running together. Did she have Aura on her feet? She ran the streets like she was sliding on it.\u201cWhy did you suddenly come here?\u201d\u201c\u2026it\u2019s my skill. I can teleport to where I can see.\u201dIt was a damn cheat skill.-Hey. Zombie. You should die by this guy once! Teleportation Transference is lit! I don\u2019t know about anyone else, but if it\u2019s by this guy, I\u2019ll acknowledge it. Quickly die!I ignored what Bae Hu-ryeong said and asked.\u201cThen what are you doing here not at the city walls?\u201d\u201cI came to get you. Obviously.\u201dShe answered emotionlessly. We were running, but she didn\u2019t look tired at all.\u201cI saw on the 11th floor. You have a sword that works on NPCs, right? I don\u2019t know what kind of sword it is, but it can raise their morale. What they need isn\u2019t me, but you.\u201dShe looked at me.\u201cAgree.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAgree that you\u2019ll teleport with me. If not, I can\u2019t teleport you. That\u2019s the limit of my skill.\u201dI was a bit taken aback.\u201cWait. Teleportation Transference has gotta be at least an S Class skill. Is it ok for you to reveal its limits like this? It\u2019s your secret weapon.\u201d\u201cFunny.\u201dShe wiped her forehead. Above us, the red rain was endlessly pouring. Hair was stuck on her white forehead because of the rain.Her black eyes looked at me.\u201cLike you said, I\u2019m the chancellor of this empire. Isn\u2019t it natural for a chancellor to reveal their secret weapon?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no time. It doesn\u2019t matter how you do it, so agree quickly.\u201dI nodded my head.\u201cI agree to the use of the Black Dragon Master\u2019s skill.\u201dIt was an instant. The Witch held my right hand. Grip. The wet hand covered mine. Her fingers intertwined with my fingers so as to not slip from the rain.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201c-There\u2019s another limit.\u201dThe Witch whispered while holding my hand.\u201cTransference.\u201dIn the blink of an eye, we were on top of the city walls.Like I expected, it was a mess. Monsters were coming, but the soldiers weren\u2019t fighting back. No, they couldn\u2019t. They were hiding behind the walls or praying to their god.\u201cIt\u2019s the end\u2026\u201d\u201cGod. Please pity us and\u2026\u201d\u201cSob, sob\u2026\u201dNPCs were no different than people who were alive. Even if they were illusions, the fear they felt was real.\u201cBlack Dragon Master. Take you for bringing me here. From now\u2026\u201d\u201cWait.\u201dThe Witch sighed.\u201cI can\u2019t just leave like this after showing my junior a pathetic side of me.\u201d\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t become the Guild Master for nothing.\u201dShe took a deep breath, and opened her mouth.\u201c-Soldiers of the Aegim Empire!\u201dBlack Aura exuded from her body. The black was a bit more dark than the red.\u201cRise! What are you doing here? Are you thinking the walls made of stone will protect you? Don\u2019t you know what\u2019s protecting the empire isn\u2019t that pile of stones, but you all?\u201dThe soldiers crouched behind the wall lifted their heads.\u201cChancellor\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the chancellor.\u201dTo them, the Witch was a chancellor. Someone recognized the chancellor, and what he said quickly spread like the rain that was pouring.The Witch nodded her head.\u201cRise!\u201dThe Witch looked mad. She looked angrily down at the wall, and the soldiers followed her gaze.\u201cRise, soldiers of the empire! The last wall of Aegim! Grab your shield! Lift your swords. Until you aren\u2019t able to! Rise for the empire, and for you!\u201dThe Witch grabbed my hand.\u201cThe goddess is protecting us!\u201dShe raised my right hand.I realized what I had to do.Kashing!The Holy Sword came out from its sheath.I lifted the sword up high. It shined down to the city walls on the soldiers\u2019 faces.\u201cThe sword of the beginning\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Holy Sword. The Holy Sword that the goddess has proved!\u201dAnd.[The Goddess of Protection expresses gratitude at your choice.][The Goddess of Protection musters out the last of her power.]There was light.1.No one knew. Just where these things came from.-Pitiful things.Only, when it appeared, it rained red rain.-Things that don\u2019t see humans as humans.Blood flowed where the rain was.-You kill humans after being born as humans. Do you say that that\u2019s the fate of humans? I think that\u2019s the accomplishments of a wild beast. What is the reason why I shouldn\u2019t kill beasts?Rain of nightmare.I saw the trauma of the general when I was killed by the NPC general on the 11th floor. In the nightmare, the general was screaming.Not only the general, but civilians.-Turn back!-Rain, again\u2026-Run away to where the rain doesn\u2019t pour!The small countries in the rural lands fell first.After that, empires started to fall.Other small countries and empires fell soundlessly. Every time a land collapsed, the safety zone of humans decreased. The history of humans became shorter when a king disappeared.Only the rain poured.-Where it doesn\u2019t rain\u2026The rain poured.-It\u2019s the end. The finish.The rain poured.-Goddess, please don\u2019t abandon us\u2026And the rain poured.Eventually, there was only a small strip of land for humans, and only a piece of human history left. The historians used their pens preciously. They accepted that they would write \u2018And humans went extinct.\u2019Only the empire was left on the continent.-Pitiful things.The owner of the nightmares.The king of all demonic creatures.And the last historians gave it a name.-Be swallowed up in your evil.Devil King\u9b54\u738b.2.The rain poured.Light shined.It rained on the ground, and light soared up to the sky.\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201dWhere the light shined, the blood rain stopped coming down.The soldiers looked up at the sky with bloodied faces.The rain had stopped/\u201cGoddess\u2026\u201dThat was it.The blood had stopped pouring.And it wasn\u2019t like it had completely stopped.It only stopped where the Holy Sword shined.It was a light rest. A small light.\u201cThe Goddess\u2026\u201d\u201cThe god is protecting the empire!\u201dHowever, there were times when small things excited people.It happened to people who only had small things left.This land was the only safety zone for the people of the empire. It was the last page of history books. The citizens of the kingdom knew, the generals knew, and the Directors of Security and Education knew.That was why there hadn\u2019t been any NPCs in the reception room.Because the chancellor had quit politics.Because the Supreme General had quit the army.Because the bodyguards didn\u2019t guard the Emperor anymore.Because the knightages didn\u2019t do the duty of knights.It was an empire that everyone had abandoned.That was why the tower had chosen the empire as its stage.Like an estate of the 10th floor with children that everyone had abandoned.\u201cRise!\u201dThe Witch of Black Dragon shouted.The soldiers all stood up. There were some who gripped the wall to stand up. There were some who barely stood supporting themselves with their spears. There were some who raised themselves with the help of their comrades.\u201cRise!\u201dThe Witch ordered them for the last time. Yes, they would be the walls of the city. They all echoed her command like they were enchanted.\u201cRise!\u201d\u201cThe chancellor is here! With us!\u201d\u201cThe sword of our ancestors is protecting us!\u201dAnd so the city walls became the city walls, spears became spears, and soldiers became soldiers.\u201cRise, quickly rise!\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing in front of the chancellor!\u201dThe higher ups smacked the backs of the soldiers. The soldiers all came to attention. They fixed their helmets.Red rain poured on their heads. But the rain didn\u2019t cover their eyes anymore. They looked forward.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201dThe Witch quietly sighed.The black Aura from her body slowly faded away. Did she go overboard? There weren\u2019t just drops of blood rain on her forehead, but also sweat.\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cIs it you\u2019re first time seeing an Ukrainina give a speech?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cIn our country, reds do it.\u201dThe Witch lifted a corner of her mouth.She realized too late that she was smiling.\u201cI don\u2019t like communists, but they\u2019re good at speeches. There were things I could learn.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201c\u2026Never mind.\u201dThe Witch\u2019s face became expressionless again. Huh? I didn\u2019t understand what the Black Dragon Master just said.-Wait.Bae Hu-ryeong inserted himself in the conversation.-I think she\u2019s just embarrassed that her dad joke didn\u2019t work.\u2018Eh. That was a joke?\u2019-I don\u2019t know. Seeing the atmosphere, it seems like it. But if you react like how you did\u2026never mind. Zombie. Don\u2019t plan on getting along with any higher ups in an organization. Just be a hunter like you are. Okay?I didn\u2019t know what he was talking about.I didn\u2019t know, but one thing was clear.\u201cKim Gong-ja. What are you going to do from now?\u201dThe situation had somewhat gotten better with her speech.\u201cWe\u2019ll have to hold up at the city walls.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dI narrowed my eyes at the red horizon.Countless monsters were around the Devil King. Even if the Witch\u2019s teleportation skill took me there, there wasn\u2019t any guarantee I would be killed by the Devil King.First, there needed to be a 1:1 confrontation with the Devil King.\u201cWe need to bring unters while the NPCs hold up. Then we won\u2019t fall back on fighting. If the Devil King tries to put more monsters in by forcing them in the city walls\u2026\u201d\u201cThe city walls?\u201d\u201cTeleport the Devil King in front of me.\u201dThe Witch openly peered at my face.\u201cCommando.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAre you planning on dying?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 \u2013 Red Sword (2)Translator: HHWhat she said was reasonable.I was still an E Class hunter. The continent wouldn\u2019t have fallen if the Devil King was able to be defeated by an E Class hunter.I was at a huge disadvantage.But death didn\u2019t mean loss to me.\u201cI plan on winning.\u201dDeath was a step to winning for me.\u201cI have a secret weapon too. Trust me.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dThe Witch sighed.\u201cOk. Since all hunters have a secret. I hope your sword will be as sharp enough to pierce that boss monster.\u201dThat\u2019s what I was planning on.-You\u2019re playing a fun game. Goddess.It was then.-You\u2019re last resistance is pitiful. Light. What can light do for those who don\u2019t know if they have a future. Even you\u2019re pitiful now.The Devil King\u2019s voice split the battlefield.-Then show me light as well.There was a large sound.The Witch and I didn\u2019t let our guards down. We were watching the Devil King\u2019s movements, so we knew the identity of the sound.It was a sword.Slowly.The Devil King slowly pulled out his sword on the horizon. Time seemed to slow down. The sword of the Devil King seemed to be on a different time than us. So it seemed like he was trying to cut time.But the Devil King cut time. He cut the sky. The trajectory of the sword was red.It precisely aimed for the walls, and pierced it.A storm rised.The Witch and I subconsciously closed our eyes. While we closed our eyes, dust covered us, and we could hear screams. It was the screams of the soldiers. I heard something break.And a moment later.\u201cGasp, cough\u2026!\u201dWhen the dust settled, we looked towards where the screams were coming from. It was painful because the dust entered our eyes, but the shock was greater than the pain.The Witch swallowed.\u201c\u2026Is he really weaker?\u201dThe walls of the empire were broken.The Devil King whimpered.-Poor things.Red rain poured from the dusty sky.Laughter echoed from where the Devil King was.-Is this really still your empire?3.It wasn\u2019t just the broken city walls.The red trajectory of the sword crushed streets and buildings. Even the palace was in its path.Boom![One warrior has died.]A voice rang from nearby.[They are not the Devil King\u2019s servant.]A voice that announced death.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dThe Witch and I looked at each other.\u201c\u2026It was where the reception room was.\u201dThe Witch spoke first.\u201cHeretic Questioner, Sword Saint, and Venomous Snake aren\u2019t in the reception room, since they\u2019re bringing the soldiers here. Crusader\u2019s looking for the Emperor on your orders. Then, the person that\u2019s left it\u2026\u201dCount.\u201c\u2026Dying first.\u201dThe Count wasn\u2019t the betrayer.\u201cRude.\u201dThe Witch quietly murmured.That was it.She didn\u2019t say anything else and just shook her head.I wondered if it was her way of saying farewell.\u201cBlack Dragon Master. If the Count really passed away then with the outside world\u2026\u201d\u201cRight now.\u201dThe Witch spoke in a low voice.\u201cRIght now, let\u2019s focus on what\u2019s in front of us.\u201dThe 2nd strongest hunter in the tower was glaring at the prey in the horizon.\u201cEven the Devil King won\u2019t be able to continue attacking like that. Kim Gong-ja. Help protect the broken city walls with me.\u201dThe red spots on the map changed.The monster army was approaching us like a wave before. But now, the red spots were pointy.Were they trying to exhaust us?\u201cYes, maam.\u201dThe points were heading towards the city walls.It was the crack where the red trajectory had split.\u201cI was thinking the same thing.\u201dThe Witch grabbed my hand.She nodded her head.\u201cTeleportation.\u201dWe moved towards the broken city walls.-Krrrrk!-Kiek, ke! Kekeke!-Gwoooo!The monsters were right in front of us. Arrow flew. They were from the soldiers above the city walls. It wasn\u2019t enough to stop the red wave. Goblin, ork, skeletons, and other monsters ran at us.There was only about 2 minutes before the first wave arrived.-Zombie.I heard Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s voice.-Even a minute is ok. No, 30 seconds.Tens, hundreds, of monsters were flying through the clouds.And tens times that number was rumbling the ground towards us.-Endure it yourself.There weren\u2019t any allies stopping me.-To win this battle, you must become hope to these people.So I was standing at the very front alone.-Endure it by yourself. Even 30 seconds is ok. It\u2019s important that you show you can stop those monsters by yourself. You don\u2019t call a human who lived for 30 years a hero. The 30 seconds that everyone needs. The human that provides those 30 seconds is the hero.I dropped my backpack on the ground.-Be a hero.Bae Hu-ryeong pulled out a glass bottle.It was what the future Lord of Alchemy Castle made.It was the glass bottle with the elixir.-I\u2019ll help you.One gulp. Two gulps. Three gulps.I gulped down the elixir.-I promised I would teach you sword techniques before the 20th floor, right? It\u2019s a bit early, but here\u2019s some lessons.Thump.My heart beat faster.-Take a step back.My heart beat faster.-Look ahead.I did.-There\u2019s two goblins in front. They can\u2019t see that well because of the dust. Quickly swing your sword before them.My heart beat even faster.Each second felt slower.-The Holy Sword shines, but it can take away sight as well. Take your opponents eyes with your sword, and get time from your opponent.And so a second for me was faster than my heart.-They\u2019re here.My sword would be a second faster than me.-Let\u2019s go. Partner.Bae Hu-ryeong stood next to me.-It\u2019s time to be a hero.I swung my sword. Blood flowed everywhere.-Kiiiiiii!The goblin screamed. In my second, the scream didn\u2019t stop.-One down.Blood scattered in the air. It was the same color as the rain. I gripped my sword even tighter. And swung it.-Keeeeeeeeeea!Two.Before the 1st goblin tied, I cut the second goblin. It was an instant. Blood flowed from my right and left. The monsters shouted without even being able to see my sword.I killed one, and another.-Aeeeeee!-Aaaeeeeeeeee!-Kiiiiiiiii!Before a monster could finish screaming, another monster screamed.The screams around me didn\u2019t end.The orchestra of my sword.I directed them with my conducting stick.-1 second has passed.Bae Hu-ryeong spoke.-Don\u2019t cut off your sword when you swing. Gong-ja. Don\u2019t divide each attack, and connect them.I swung my sword.-Cut from the top to bottom. Think. It\u2019s no different from music. When a tone pitches down, it can be pulled back up.Screams rang out.-Connect! If your sword is low, bring it back up again. That\u2019s how your sword can continue to connect.Another second passed.-A sword is a fight of time! If it\u2019s swung once, it\u2019s over. But a more skilled person can control 5 seconds.Enemies let out blood.And I let out my breath.-Don\u2019t lose time!Before the blood poured. And my breath faded.-Don\u2019t waste anything! Just because you cut your opponent, it\u2019s not over. You have to know where to cut next! Don\u2019t throw away a second. Live it.A blade swung between my breathing and the blood of my enemy.-A sword user lives by their sword.I swung my sword.-Do you think it\u2019s easy to live a second? Do you really want to leave?I swung my sword.-People aren\u2019t alive when they spend time. Gong-ja. You are a sword user. So you need to live by your sword.I swung my sword again.-Burn it up!A goblin scratched me and blood spilled from my arm. Ah. I felt dizzy. Even in the pain, I swung my sword, and looked forward.-Kiiiiiie!-Krrr,kr\u2026-Kwoooooo!Countless monsters.Monsters were pouring from the dust cloud. Countless enemies, and countless evil. They were all trying to kill me.-10 seconds now.This was 10 seconds. It had only been 10 seconds.-Burn more, Gong-ja. Don\u2019t spill your life, and burn it up.I tightened my grasp on the sword.-It\u2019s time to show who you are.I shouted loudly.In the cracks of the city walls, my shout rumbled. The soldiers on top flinched. The monsters coming from far away paused.-Yeah. Fuck, this is it.Bae Hu-ryeong giggled.-Now you\u2019re not that much of a zombie now, huh!I ran forward.-Gwo\u2026?I attacked the foot of the goblin who stopped first. Before he could react, he was dead.The goblin\u2019s head flew up with its mouth open.I swung my sword.-Krrrr, rrrAnd next was an orc standing blanky next to it. Before it could raise its club, I bought my sword down on it. Blood poured out like a fountain.I swung my sword.\u2018Just a bit more.\u2019Skeletons.\u2018Just a bit more.\u2019And more goblins.\u2018More.\u2019Countless orcs.\u2018More! Just a little bit more!\u2019At the immeasurable amount of monsters.\u2018Look!\u2019I swung my sword.\u2018Look at me!\u2019I was alive.I was alive when I swung my sword.-KOoooooo!An ogre appeared from the red dust cloud.Once. Twice. Everytime the monster moved, the wind moved around it.In the ogre\u2019s dust cloud, a goblin entered. Then, it died with the sounds of its bones crunching.Yes. That was right. They didn\u2019t have any camaraderie. Nor any pity and love for each other.So they were beasts.Disgusting beasts.-ROooooooo!The beast fiercely cried out.It bared its teeth to me.\u2018Come.\u2019And here, there was a hunter.There was a hunter chasing after a beast.\u2018I\u2019ll show you.\u2019Boom!The ogre toop a step forward.The city walls started to crumble.Boom!The disgusting beast took another step forward. Everytime it took a step forward, the ground shook. The city walls crashed down. The ogre shook the ground, heading this way.-Root your feet in the ground.However.-And look forward.What I had to do didn\u2019t change.-Cut your enemy with the sword.I ran at the monster.Boom!The giant beast stepped forward. I aimed for that moment. When it lifted its club to hit me, I twisted my sword in front of it.White light.The light of the Holy Sword entered the eyes of the ogre.-Gwooooooo!The ogre\u2019s body was already stumbling.It was hard for the ogre to change his direction.\u2018Why.\u2019When I was attacking the ogre, I was thinking of something.\u2018Why did you give an EX Class skill to a bastard like that.\u2019Of Yoo Soo-ha.Of the tower that gave him that\u2026rare skill.\u2018It didn\u2019t have to be a saint. Just someone that was a bit more normal. If it was given to someone like that, it would\u2019ve been fine. But why. To that psychopath.\u2019The ogre\u2019s club flashed by my nose.It missed, because it was blinded by the light.Thankfully, there was a blind spot.\u2018Oh\u2026so that was it?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The monster\u2019s lifeline was thick, but not as much as my Aura.The ogre whipped his arm even in the last moment. Did he feel wronged? I didn\u2019t need to feel surprised. I attacked again.[Your skill slots are being increased.][Now your hunter rank is D Class.]The ogre\u2019s neck split apart.A moment after that, the monster\u2019s body fell down.[May luck be with you.]Red dust flew up.-Krrrrrr\u2026-Kiii, gi! Giiiiii.I could see monsters. The monsters that had been running head first into the broken city walls has begun to hesitate. They were scared after seeing the large monster fall.Silence.Other than the sound of rain pouring down, it was silent. The soldiers on the city wall looked at me, and the monsters of the Devil King squirmed. It was dead silent. I was standing all alone by myself.-Congratulations.Bae Hu-ryeong grinned.-It\u2019s been 30 seconds.Then, someone passed by me.I could tell who it was just by looking at their back. The strongest hunter in the tower pulled out his sword.Tens of goblins lost their necks, and tens of orcs lost their backs. And tens of streaks of blood poured down as one.One second. Two seconds. Three seconds.It was only a moment, but I saw it. The blood streaming from the sky was darker than the rain.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dSword Saint slowly looked back at me, turning his back towards the pools of blood he created. He opened his mouth.\u201c\u2014\u2014.\u201dI didn\u2019t understand what he said.My time was still slow.\u201cMm.\u201dDid he realize that my condition wasn\u2019t normal?He smiled, and spoke with Aura this time.\u201c\u2013it was amazing.\u201dThe old man lifted his sword.It rained.The rain was red, so after the water poured down, the sword was red as well.\u201cMy name is Marcus Calenberry. Youngster.\u201dI realized that he was trying to be polite.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dI closed my mouth.This was the second time a Rank 1 hunter told me his name.The first time was when I was on the 1st floor.The Flame Emperor tilted my head back and whispered.-My name is Yoo Soo-ha.-Farewell.I died that day.I heard a name for the second time today. They were different names and different people.Suddenly, it occurred to me that I was different as well.And I was able to do something that I wasn\u2019t able to do the first time.\u201cMy name is Kim Gong-ja. Sir.\u201dToday.I spoke my name.4.The rain poured.The fire burned everything in its way, and the rain had to fall from the sky.\u201cMm.\u201dThe rain poured.There was an old man standing in the middle of it.He nodded his head at me.\u201cLet\u2019s fight together, Youngster.\u201dThe Rank 1 hunter.Sword Saint.Grand Master of Knights of the Aegim Empire.Alliance.\u201c-Ahahaha!\u201dThe rain poured.\u201cMm! Sorry I\u2019m late!\u201dWith the sound of puddles being splashing, laughter approached us.\u201cI could\u2019ve come faster. I guess it\u2019s not easy to lead a legion!\u2019The speaker had one arm. It was a road where everything was damaged. The one-armed man stood firm.\u201cThank you. Hunter Kim Gong-ja.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner fixed his cap with the hand he had.The rain poured.Far away from behind the Heretic Questioner, something crowded over to us.\u201cWe\u2019ll take over the time that you got for us.\u201dThousands of soldiers.The soldiers of the empire were jumping over holes past the puddles. No, there were even those who weren\u2019t soldiers. They were citizens who didn\u2019t have any armor.\u201cIt\u2019s the order of the Supreme General. Everyone.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner smiled.Thousands of soldiers and ten thousands of citizens shouted.\u201cDefeat the bastards who bared their teeth at the empire.\u2019The Rank 4 hunter.Ten Thousand Temple Master, Heretic Questioner.The Supreme General of the empire.\u201cWhoooooooo!\u201dThe rain poured.The monsters who had been coming like hail, stopped. They hesitated. The tables were turned. Water started to flow backwards from where the city walls were broken.\u201cThe god is with us!\u201dThe rain poured.\u201cHurrah for the Aegim Empire!\u201dThe rain poured.\u2018Ah.\u2019I couldn\u2019t know when I had started to flow with the water. It was probably because of my Aura. I was running as a small drop in the water.Refugees from other countries raised their spears from my left. Farmers from the empire raised their rakes to my right. When I looked backed, hunters like me were running.A hunter I saw raised their sword.They were continuing to say something, but,\u201c\u2014-.\u201d\u201c\u2014\u2014!\u201dI didn\u2019t understand them.Was it because of the rain? Or the people shouting? Oh, was it the screams of the monsters? Because time slowed down? Was it because I became a small drop of water flowing with them?Or, was it because I was swinging my sword.\u201c\u2014\u2013!\u201dForward.\u201c\u2014\u2014.\u201dEven more forward.Until water covered everywhere the fire was.Just a bit more forward.\u201c-hey.\u201dSomething touched my shoulder. It pierced through the ten thousands of voices and said something to me. It was one-eyed.\u201cGood job. I should\u2019ve come earlier. I was late because I was bringing out guild members. But don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll show you why we\u2019re called Chen-mu mun from now on\u2026\u201dPause.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dIt stopped speaking. Why? It stopped, and looked into my eyes with its one eye instead.\u201cYou\u2019re not listening. Are you immersed? Nice. I like it.\u201dIt laughed.\u201cHey, my name is Liao Fan. You can\u2019t hear, but it doesn\u2019t matter. \u2026you saved my life in the reception room later. I can\u2019t forget about a debt as the Master of Chen-mu mun, right? Just run with your eyes forward. I\u2019ll take the left. This is a huge benefit.\u201dIt raised its sword.\u201cNo one who stood on my right ever died.\u201dThe rain poured.\u201cGo. Holy Technique.\u201dI swung my sword.\u201cI\u2019ll protect you.\u201dThe water became even more violent.It flowed violently.\u201cSorry I\u2019m late! I was busy looking for the Emperor. I found him, but he had already committed sucide. It\u2019ll be hard to use his authority. Sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We don\u2019t need to gather anymore people. Ms.Crusader, you should fight too.\u201d\u201cOf course. Hm? Why is Kim Gong-ja hunter\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bother him.\u201dThe rain poured.\u201cThat guy. Is having the time of his life.\u201dThe rain poured.-Pitiful things.-Even if time is given, did you think it was for you?-Even the power of the goddess protecting you is gone. There is no god in the empire anymore. What did you expect? Will you prove yourselves? Fine.Laughter came with the rain.-Look.A red light.However, there were things blocking me.And there were a lot.\u201cHey, Witch! Get rid of them quickly!\u201d\u201cI know. I won\u2019t let them go twice.\u201d\u201cGeezer! You and I should cut them when the Witch scatters them!\u201d\u201cI can do it by myself.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re starting to come, everyone!\u201dThe rain poured.\u201c-scatter.\u201d6 rays of light shined. It was the light of mirrors. The red light slid against the mirror. The first, second, and third mirror broke. But the 4th mirror continued to reflect the red light.\u201cSword Saint! Venomous Snake!\u201dSomething shouted.\u201cHup.\u201dThere was the sound of intaking breath.\u201cYaaaaaa!\u201dAnd the sound of it being exhaled.The sky split.Even the red light split. It was light the ocean was being split into half.Five different voices chattered on.\u201cLook! Look! I\u2019ve still got a while before I die!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re continuing to blabber on.\u201d\u201cThis is the time!\u201dAnd a voice whispered amongst them.\u201cI\u2019ll transport you next to the Devil King. Everyone get around me!\u201d\u201cQuickly! If the Devil King summons monsters again we\u2019ll be back at the starting point!\u201dFive voices overlapped.They gathered into one place.And.\u201cKim Gong-ja!\u201dSomeone extended their hand.Rain was dripping down their face.\u201cHold on!\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cHurry, there\u2019s no time!\u201dAt that moment.The time that seemed like forever was released.I could see the people around me.I could hear the sounds around me.That wasn\u2019t all. Memories of where I was and how I got here flooded inside my head.It was the middle of the battlefield.The soldiers and citizens were pushing away the monsters. Hunters endlessly poured from the broken city walls.\u201cKim Gong-ja hunter!\u201dWe were at the very front.From here to the Devil King, it was empty. The monsters would come soon, but not now.\u201cHurry!\u201dIt was a bit ironic.The Heretic Questioner was on Venomous Snake\u2019s back. Venomous Snake was holding Sword Saint\u2019s arm. Sword Saint had his hand on Crusader;s shoulder. Crusader was holding the Witch\u2019s hand.\u2018\u2026it would be awesome if I took a picture of this and put it online.\u2019While I was thinking those thoughts, the Witch shouted.\u201cHurry! If you don\u2019t grab on we\u2019re leaving you here!\u201dThe Witch was extending her hand towards me.\u2018Ahh.\u2019And I realized.This scene would be gone soon.Even the argument Sword Saint and I had.How the Sword Saint pulled back his sword.And how he bowed his head towards me, apologizing.How Heretic Questioner had killed those innocent hunters.Them fighting each other.\u2018It\u2019ll all disappear.\u2019Everything.Like the rain that was pouring.\u2018Those people won\u2019t remember.\u2019However.-What are you doing. Partner.That was okay.-You have to go get the monsters, kid.It wouldn\u2019t disappear just because it wasn\u2019t remembered.I had a sword.This place had someone who died on the 1st floor. There was a ghost who died on the 99th floor. No one knew about their deaths. But us two were still here.\u201c\u2026okay.\u201dIf we returned, nothing would be solved.Sword Saint would doubt me, and the hunters would suspect each other when it became time to choose rewards.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dBut I was a bit stronger. I wouldn\u2019t let innocent people die. I wouldn\u2019t watch by while the Count died and our connection with the outside was cut off. Now I even somewhat knew who the betrayer was.I was sure.I would do better.\u201cGood!\u201dThe Witch tightly held my\u00a0hand.\u201cTeleport!\u201dThe next moment, we jumped down from mid air. The five of us landed at the same time. In front of us, the Devil King was standing with his sword.-Amusing.The Devil King was a sword.He was like a shadow in the form of a human.-Warriors of the goddess, I see.He had a face but no expression. He had arms, but no hands. He had legs, but no feet, and it seemed like he would fall over any moment.No. He was actually falling. The Devil King\u2019s body continued to flow down.The owner of nightmares.The moving shadow.-Warriors. Did you know there\u2019s a betrayer among you? You know, but you\u2019re still trying to trust with each other.Was there any reason to listen more?As far as I could see, there was none.I ran with my one sword.\u201cKim Gong-ja?!\u201dI heard a surprised voice behind me.\u201cNo! Wait! You can\u2019t go by yourself! Everyone has to work together to-\u201dSorry.I\u2019ll see you in my next life.Although you won\u2019t remember today.-Oho.The Devil King smiled at me running alone at him.-How foolish.It was a strange smile. There weren\u2019t any eyes or mouth on his face, so it seemed like he was flowing from his skin.-Did you come to kill me, warrior.He swung his sword.It was something I never would\u2019ve been able to block.Before the sword arrived at my neck.\u201cNo.\u201dI didn\u2019t pretend to block the attack.It was unnecessary.Instead, I politely raised my middle finger.\u201cI came to be killed. You son of a bitch.\u201dI\u2019ll see you in my next life too.It was short, but I definitely saw the Devil King\u2019s smile harden.\u201c\u2014\u2013!\u201d\u201c\u2014ja, \u2014!?\u201dSoon, I didn\u2019t hear anything.My consciousness faded away.All my senses were paused.I only felt the rain on my face until the last moment.Then.[You have died.][The Devil King of Fall Rain\u2019s skills are being randomly copied.]Alright.[Skill cards are being created.]It was time for round 2.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The 11th floor will open in a bit.\u201dI was a bit choked up.I lightly coughed, and spoke.\u201cI have to start preparing now if I don\u2019t want to fall behind.\u201d\u201cHow are you going to prepare when you don\u2019t know what the 11th floor is like?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dThere wasn\u2019t any problem on the 11th floor.It started from the 12th floor, when the Devil King began to interfere.There, you guys will split up.Someone will betray you, and someone will fall apart from that betrayal.There\u2019s even someone who dies.\u201c\u2026Kim Gong-ja?\u201dThe Witch furrowed her eyebrows.\u201cAre you alright? Your face turned strange. Are you feeling okay?\u201d\u201cMm. I\u2019m alright. It was just a bit touching to be here with amazing people who lead guilds.\u201dI casually answered her.Bae Hu-ryeong silently watched me.\u201cAnyways, yes. You\u2019re right. Everyone. I know what the 11th floor is like. Not only that, I know what the quest is.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!\u201dThe look in their eyes changed.Information was as important as someone\u2019s life. I had basically said, \u2018I know something about your life at stake.\u2019 It was understandable they would pale.\u201cI was given the information as a reward for clearing the 10th floor.\u201d\u201c\u2026and the reason why I\u2019m saying that now.\u201dThe Witch opened her mouth to speak.\u201cCan we take it that you\u2019re going to share it with us?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dI lifted my forefinger.\u201cHowever, there\u2019s a condition.\u201d\u201cGo ahead. We\u2019ll gladly listen to it.\u201d\u201cPlease do me a favor when I ask for it sometime.\u201dI looked at each of the hunters sitting around the table. They all looked like they were deep in thought.A favor. It was something easy, but also hard.\u201cWhat kind of favor is it?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t tell you right now.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cHowever, I can assure you that it won\u2019t put your life in danger. It\u2019s not about money either. I won\u2019t ask for you to take someone\u2019s life. If you think this is impossible, just refuse me then.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dHeretic Questioner stroked his chin.With the right hand that was cut off by the Sword Saint last time.\u201cSounds fine to me. To be honest, I really like that condition! Ahaha. There is almost nothing that can take you by surprise is you have information about it beforehand. I agree!\u201d\u201cHm. If we can refuse\u2026I also agree.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner and the Count approved.When the other hunters all finished organizing their thoughts, they promised that they would accept my condition.\u2018Nice.\u20191 thing done.\u201cThen I\u2019ll say it now. From the 11th floor to the 20th floor, it takes place in a world called the Aegim Empire. It\u2019s receiving the attack of the Devil King, and the 11th floor is\u2026\u201dMy voice quietly echoed in the cafe.The guild masters all started to murmur after hearing what I said.\u201c\u2026Hm. It was a tutorial up to the 10th floor. And we\u2019ll be thrown into a large scale fight from the 11th floor.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s priceless information, I see.\u201d\u201cYup! The fight will also be different now!\u201d\u201cI should give this information to our guild members. Whew. But our Sangryun kids aren\u2019t talented at all in fighting and\u2026\u201dThe hunters shared their opinions.I nodded my head.\u2018The 11th floor will be clear more easily with this information now.\u2019It was already changing. A lot of things had changed since the beginning of this regression.But it still wasn\u2019t enough.\u201cThen I\u2019ll take my leave now\u2026ah, Crusader.\u201d\u201cMm?\u201dThe Crusader turned her head. She was sipping her third Americano now with a straw.\u201cWhy did you call for me?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the Vice Guild Master of the Civil Militia. Would you like to walk with me? I have something to discuss with you.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dThe Crusader looked around and shrugged her shoulders.\u201cWell. I was planning on getting up soon anyway. As long as it doesn\u2019t take too long\u2026\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t take that long. 30 minutes is enough.\u201d\u201cThen fine with me.\u201dThe Crusader put her coffee cup down.\u201cI\u2019ll accept the date request.\u201d3.In the city bustling with people, hunters talked about the 10th floor in benches next to the fountains, outdoor restaurants, and in markets.\u201cSeeing as how there hasn\u2019t been any announcement, it was cleared by a nameless newbie!\u201d\u201cNo way. The higher guilds are controlling it.\u201d\u201cSeriously, who did it\u2026\u201d\u201cI want to clear a stage too.\u201dTo those who\u2019s tomorrow was canceled, the subjugation of the 10th floor had just happened.It felt like I alone was walking in deleted time.-Hey, Zombie.Well, to be exact, I wasn\u2019t alone.-He\u2019s following us.Since I had Bae Hu-ryeong.\u2018Are you sure?\u2019-Definitely. And don\u2019t look back.To safely clear the 12th floor, two things were needed.One was the alliance with the leaders of the large guilds.And the other\u2026was for Sword Saint to not be hostile towards me.\u2018It\u2019ll be too late to do it on the 12th floor.\u2019I had felt it this time.\u2018Is has to be solved before climbing the tower.\u2019The relationship between Sword Saint and the guild masters was horrible. If betrayal was added on top of this? We would be taking the shortcut to destruction.-Dang, I can hardly tell. Look at his stalking skills. You probably won\u2019t be able to tell even if you turned back. He has a skill related to this.\u2018I got it, so please just check if it\u2019s following us.\u2019I was baiting the Sword Saint right now.I had heard about the Sword Saint\u2019s schedule from Bae Hu-ryeong already, and purposely got noticed by him. After he saw me walk by the outdoor restaurant where he normally ate, he began to follow me.Of course.\u201cKim Gong-ja. Where are we going?\u201dThe Crusader next to me wouldn\u2019t now.\u201cThere\u2019s only dark and creepy neighborhoods if we go this way\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a shop I want to recommend to you.\u201d\u201cShop?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s a shop that a nameless pharmacist runs. It\u2019s amazing. If her name was known, it would get famous right now. But it\u2019s not working out. If you think it\u2019s good, please help with their sales.\u201d\u201cMmmmm\u2026\u201dThe Crusader looked at my face.I knew what she was doing.\u2018She activated her Lie Detection skill.\u2019The Crusader opened her mouth.\u201cIs what you said true?\u201d\u201cYes. Of course. Why would I lie to you?\u201dI really was going to introduce her to the store so it wasn\u2019t a lie.\u201cAre you planning something suspicious?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m trying to receive help from you. Even if something happens, my life will be in danger, not yours. Trust me.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dShe slowly nodded her head.It was all probably registered as the truth.\u201cSorry.\u201dShe smiled.\u201cI hear that I\u2019m really doubtful of things quite a lot. Let\u2019s continue.\u201dNice. Pass.We passed the street and arrived at the pharmacist\u2019s store. She was moving something that seemed quite heavy. At first, she tilted her head looking at us approach her, then she smiled brightly when she saw my face.\u201cAh! Sir!\u201d\u201cAre you open now, Store owner-nim?\u201d\u201cAhaha. It\u2019s closed, but always open for you! You\u2019re my first regular. Hup!\u201dShe put down what she was carrying.She had looked pretty dirty just a few days ago, but she was completely neat now. She gave off the impression of a store owner now.\u201cWhew. Ah, sorry. This is\u2026?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s the hunter that\u2019s working as the Vice Guild Master of the Civil Militia. You\u2019ve heard of her, right? Her name is Crusader.\u201d\u201c\u2026pardon?\u201dHer eyes shook beyond her glasses.\u201cT, the Vice Guild Master of the Civil Militia?!\u201d\u201cYup.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s so high up!\u201dThis was the normal reaction for hunters.\u201cW, why is such a person at this lowly ship\u2026gasp!? Drugs?! Is this to crack down on drugs? I, I didn\u2019t make any! I\u2019m working in a place like this, but I didn\u2019t touch drugs at the very least, no, I didn\u2019t make even a gram of anything bad!\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cI lived conscientiously! And I\u2019ll continue to do so! So please don\u2019t investigate!\u201dShe bent over flat on the ground.This wasn\u2019t a normal reaction.\u201cMm\u2026\u201dThe Crusader had an awkward face. Since the Lie Detection had probably said that it was all true. She seemed to be considering whether she should think of the pharmacist in front of her as a psycho or a conscious business woman.\u201cHere, here. Store owner-nim. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dTap tap.I patted her shoulder.\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to tattle to the Crusader. You\u2019re such a nice person.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026?\u201d\u201cSales aren\u2019t equal to the quality of your work. So I wanted to introduce it to the Vice Guild Master here.\u201dThe pharmacist lifted her head and dropped her mouth open.\u201cI, Introduce\u2026?\u201d\u201cExactly what it means. Try giving the Crusader different potions to test out. Who knows? She might make a contract with you if she likes it.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be easier for you if the Civil Militia uses your potions?\u201dThe pharmacist blinked.It seemed to take her a while to understand.A moment later, she grabbed my hand.\u201cA, Angel-nim\u2026!\u201dI wasn\u2019t an angel-nim but Gong-ja-nim.\u201cYou helped me when my store was almost sold away, ordered a huge stock, and uh. Uh. Now you\u2019re even helping my sales. You\u2019re an angel\u2026How can I repay this\u2026?\u201dAnd when the future Lord of Alchemy Castle\u2019s eyes were shining.Someone stepped into the quiet street. The footsteps were pretty heavy, so the three of us all turned our heads to look.\u201c-there.\u201dThe owner of the footsteps was wearing black formal attire.\u201cCould everyone else except for that guy step aside?\u201dAnd he glared at me coldly.Sword Saint.He was the old man of this regression that didn\u2019t believe me yet.His low voice rang in the alley.\u201cI want to speak with that person alone.\u201dFine by me.It was time to clear the second condition.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 \u2013 My Death Is (2)Translator: HH\u201cSword Saint\u2026?\u201dThe Crusader frowned her forehead.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dShe probably didn\u2019t expect to meet him in this small alley. It was an unexpected place and person. It didn\u2019t seem to be a coincidence.\u201cA young lady is already having problems with hearing.\u201dThe old man was exuding a murderous intent towards me.\u201cI\u2019m sure I said to move. I have something to do with the guy over there.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that you want to speak alone with the Kim Gong-ja hunter?\u201d\u201cHuh. I\u2019m not interested in his name.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dThe atmosphere of the alley changed.The Crusader didn\u2019t frown anymore. She was expressionlessly glared at the Sword Saint. Her guard was definitely up.\u201cMove.\u201dSword Saint spoke.\u201cI already said to move 3 times.\u201d\u201cWhat doesn\u2019t make sense three times wouldn\u2019t make sense even after 30 times. Sword Saint. Did you lose your sense with your age?\u201dThe Crusader grabbed her sword.\u201cKim Gong-ja hunter already joined the five guilds, along with the Civil Militia. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking but\u2026don\u2019t think that the Civil Militia will stay still.\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dThe Sword Saint snorted.\u201cI knew it. The guilds were all working together. I knew it.\u201d\u201c\u2026working together. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to say.\u201dThe atmosphere became worse as time passed.\u201cSword Saint. I know because it was already reported that you hunt humans. Of course, if it\u2019s something according to your morals, I won\u2019t say much. But it\u2019s different if you\u2019re planning to do that right in front of me.\u201d\u201cDifferent?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll stop it with my life.\u201d\u201cAre you confident you can do that?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dThe Crusader looked at the Sword Saint expressionlessly.\u201cI\u2019m going to fight with all my strength, and die. And the moment I die, you\u2019ll be someone who killed an innocent player. Sword Saint. If you want to live the rest of your life as a murderer, be my guest.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cThe life that you don\u2019t have long to live. I\u2019ll show you.\u201dThe Sword Saint\u2019s old face crumpled.It was already evening. The sun set quickly in the alley. I could feel people walking her and there along the alley, but no one was here except for us. It was silent.\u2018Yeah.\u2019I brought the Crusader here to make this kind of silence.\u2018Sword Saint is weak to innocent people.\u2019And Crusader was probably the only innocent people of the large guilds.When the Sword Saint tried to kill me in the last regression, the Crusader got in between Sword Saint and me.-Ms.Crusader.-You\u2019re the only person here who hasn\u2019t hurt anyone. Fine. I\u2019ll trust you.It was what he said in passing.That meant.\u2018The kill count of the Crusader is [0].\u2019Even the Sword Saint had violent morals\u2026no. Because he had those standards, the Crusader would seem like an even better person.\u2018The Sword Saint won\u2019t ever be able to hurt Crusader.\u2019To evil people, he was a murderer, but to good people, he was a harmless old man.And\u2026\u2018It\u2019s not just the Crusader.\u2019Someone walked next to us. It was the pharmacist. At the appearance of the Sword Saint and Crusader, she was hesitating, and she spread her arms out.\u201cE, excuse me.\u201dThe pharmacist spoke. Even her chin was trembling probably because she was so nervous. She bit her lips several times and finally managed to speak.\u201cI don\u2019t know what it\u2019s about\u2026but the c, customer here! He\u2019s my savior!\u201dThe future Lord of Alchemy spoke as fiercely as she could.\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s laws in Babylon like the outside world but\u2026protecting a customer is o, obvious\u2026and even though you\u2019re the Sword Saint! I can\u2019t forgive you if you touch a customer here!\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cA few days ago gangsters made a mess and I was in trouble! Sorry, but please leave from here!\u201dThe pharmacist shouted. If she went against the Sword Saint, she would\u2019ve died in a second. But he was still weak to her.It was for the same reason.\u2018Saintess. Crusader. Lord of Alchemy Castle.\u2019These three hunters were famous for being kind.\u2018Even when the Flame Emperor was in the slums, the Lord of Alchemy Castle arrived first.\u2019Kind people.They were always on the short side, and received more stress than other people.But the only people who could stop Sword Saint were\u2026kind people like them.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201dThe Crusader spoke.\u201cIf you want to make a mess, go ahead.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dThe Sword Saint hesitated. If I was right, the result was already decided.And, I was right.Not too long after, the old sword user pulled his sword back.\u201c\u2026Today\u2019s not the day.\u201dThe Sword Saint took his murderous aura back.Even when he was walking back, he was glaring at me.\u201cI hope we don\u2019t meet again. If he didn\u2019t have anything to do with you, his head would be on the floor.\u201dGood.Stage 2 clear.With this, the Sword Saint wouldn\u2019t swing his sword at me anytime. Even if he killed me, I would have the opportunity to speak.\u201cSword Saint!\u201dBefore the old man completely turned away, I shouted.\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting in the empty field tomorrow morning!\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cYou can come if you want to. I\u2019ll be waiting. Really! If you want to know what kind of human I am, come tomorrow morning!\u201dThe old man turned his head around to glare at me. He examined my face with his blue eyes. But that was it. Without any particular response, he headed back out of the alley.Once his heavy footsteps couldn\u2019t be heard anymore, the Crusader sighed.\u201cWhew! That was close. To meet a murderer tonight.\u201dMurderer.\u201c..is the Sword Saint famous for being a murderer?\u201d\u201cNot famous. But the five Guild Masters know well.\u201dThe Crusader shook her head.\u201cI heard he lost his daughter to a murderer outside of the tower.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cBecause of that, the Sword Saint doesn\u2019t let go of murderers. He\u2019s ridiculously tough. Well, we didn\u2019t have any evidence, so we were just watching\u2026mm. And this is obviously a secret.\u201dBae Hu-ryeong got in front of me.-Yeah. Grandpops Marcus told me that once before. His daughter and son in law were killed by a serial killer. His grandchildren barely survived.\u2018Why are you saying that now?\u2019-Huh? What are you talking about? You didn\u2019t ask.Bae Hu-ryeong spoke shamelessly.Yeah. He was always like this.\u201cWell. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t understand the Sword Saint.\u201dThe Crusader looked around bitterly.In the empathy alley, the evening set cast shadows of the buildings.\u201cWorking at the Civil Militia, you met murderers. Sometimes, there\u2019s times when you think that it was okay for them to kill\u2026even I\u2019m tempted sometimes as well.\u201dThe Crusader mumbled.\u201cAll the guild masters have a behind story. Kim Gong-ja. Since you\u2019re with us not, you\u2019ll see that there are disgusting bits about us. How you\u2019ll react\u2026mm.\u201dShe shook her head. Was it because she thought she said too many things to an outsider?\u201cWe got off subject.\u201dShe intentionally spoke in a brighter voice.\u201cSo, how much is the potion here? The Civil Militia is also not funded well so it\u2019s a bit tricky if it\u2019s too expensive but\u2026\u201d4.The next day.I looked at my phone by myself in the empty field.There was really not a single soul here. It was obvious. The hunters of Babylon were all in the square having a festival.It was similar to the last regression.\u2018But there\u2019s something that\u2019s different.\u2019I looked at the news popping up on my phone.-[Breaking] 11th floor, guild attack? Black Dragon gathering all their members.-Guilds creating teams to clear\u2026-Heretic Questioner interview! \u201cYou have to have a team for the 11th floor.\u201d-Source of the information is a puzzle\u2026That was right.The world had changed a little.Because of me.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dAnd it was going to change again.\u201cHmm.\u201dSword Saint walked in from the other side. The sky behind him looked extra blue. People were shouting from the direction of the city.[00:01:31]The clock of light was floating up in the air.A blue sky, people\u2019s voices, and clock of light.Sword Saint was walking towards me with all that behind him.\u201cYou\u2019re really alone.\u201dSword Saint stopped.\u201cIs this the confidence to be able to stand against me by yourself? Well, I guess if you\u2019re a murderer that did all that, you would be confident.\u201dHis eyes when he was looking at me felt completely new. It was completely different to last time.It was because there was acknowledgement and respect in his life last time.But right now, there was none of that.Enmity. Hostility.It was like he was looking at a murderer.-Zombie?\u2018\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2019-Are you alright?I nodded inwardly.\u2018I\u2019m good.\u2019I was just a bit hurt.\u201cSword Saint.\u201dI folded my thoughts.\u201cI have something I want to say to you.\u201d\u201cGo ahead. If it\u2019s your will, I\u2019ll listen to it.\u201d\u201cI know why you\u2019re being like this.\u201dThe Sword Saint lifted a corner of his mouth.\u201cI see. You know your own fault.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because of the skill you have.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dThe Sword Saint\u2019s face hardened.\u201cHow do you\u2026?\u201d\u201cPlease believe what I\u2019m going to say.\u201dI thought of how hard it was to get someone\u2019s trust as I said that.Everyone had their stubbornness. For the Sword Saint, it was his [Detective\u2019s Insight] skill. The skill that showed someone\u2019s kill count. The Sword Saint looked down at you if his skill said so.That was why it was his stubbornness.He lived according to that stubbornness.The moment he threw away that stubbornness, he would throw away his lifestyle.\u2018You have to convince people like that.\u2019And I had to make him trust me.I needed to make him ignore the lifestyle that he lived until now.Thinking about it now, I realized how hard it was.\u2018But..I can do it.\u2019I clenched my fist.\u2018I can just put my life on the line as well.\u2019I opened my mouth.\u201cSword Saint-nim. I\u2019m a prophet.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI have a skill that\u2019s similar to prophesying things. That\u2019s how I know you have that skill. If I stay like this, you\u2019ll kill me, and I\u2019ll ask why you had to kill me.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cThen, you said that you have a skill called [Detective\u2019s Insight], and there\u2019s a number called [4093] above my head.\u201dIt was a small lie.But I needed to convince him even by lying.[00:00:00]The clock in the sky was turning to zero. Fireworks exploded. I could hear cheers.The old man and me.We just looked at each other.After a silence, the Sword Saint spoke.\u201c-guess.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m hiding my left hand behind my back. And I have my finger\u2019s held. Tell me how many fingers I\u2019m holding up. \u201cOkay.So that\u2019s how he was coming out.I expected this.\u201cIf you can\u2019t guess, I\u2019ll know that you\u2019re ly\u2026\u201dThe Sword Saint was probably getting ready to attack.But he didn\u2019t expect something like this.Before the Sword Saint could speak, I got out a dagger. Without any hesitation, I cut my throat.\u201cWhat?!\u201dThe Sword Saint\u2019s eyes widened.He had only attacked others his entire life. He wouldn\u2019t have expected that I would cut my neck. Because of that 1 second, I was able to kill myself.And.[You have died.][You are regressing to 24 hours ago.]1 second was enough for me.Again, I started my day.I went down from the 10th floor stage and met the large guild members. The Crusader and I walked into the alley. We met the Sword Saint.[00:00:00]And time was in this moment again.\u201c-guess.\u201dIt was the same test as my last regression.But my reaction wasn\u2019t the same as last time. Instead, I spoke like I had expected it before.\u201cYou\u2019re trying to hide your self hand behind your back again.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re trying to ask me how many fingers you\u2019re lifting up. It\u2019s easy to kill me here. But you can\u2019t clear the 12th floor stage like this. A lot of people will lose their lives.\u201d\u201c\u2026wait.\u201dThe Sword Saint spoke.\u201cThis isn\u2019t enough. You could have another skill\u2026\u201dFine.Once wasn\u2019t enough.I had already expected this.[You have died.][You are being regressed to 24 hours ago.]Of course it wouldn\u2019t be easy to convince someone.\u201cThat\u2019s not enough evidence. It could be\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re thinking it could be another skill like clairvoyance or something else.\u201dBut it was okay.If he wanted to test me, he could continue to do so.[You have died.][You are regressing to 24 hours ago.]He could suspect me as much as he wanted.[You have died.][You are regressing to 24 hours ago.]It didn\u2019t matter if it took a week or a month.[You have died.][You are regressing to 24 hours ago.]I was confident I could convince him.My death is longer than your life.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dThen, the Sword Saint closed his mouth.All his suspicions had been answered.I spoke calmly.\u201cSword Saint-nim. Please trust me.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t kill me here. Countless innocent people will die on the 12th floor stage. Really. I\u2019m not telling you I\u2019m innocent, and I\u2019m not telling you to save me forever.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then?\u201d\u201c5 days.\u201dI lifted my fingers.\u201cPlease don\u2019t just kill me for the next few days. Following me, you can judge with your own two eyes if I deserve to die.\u201dThe Sword Saint was silent.I knew that he was hesitating.The last final blow was needed.And I knew what the \u2018last blow\u2019 was.\u201cYou still don\u2019t believe me.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cYou say something to me in the future. You know that I\u2019m really a prophet if I say this.\u201d\u201c\u2026what\u2019s that?\u201dI answered.\u201cSword Emperor.\u201dThe old man\u2019s eyes widened.I continued to speak, regardless.\u201cI don\u2019t know who that is, but you said you would believe me if I said that.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dIt was silent.Cheers were still coming from the city far away. I could even see the image of the goddess descending.When the goddess slowly began to fade away, the old Sword Saint spoke.\u201c5 days. Youngster.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201dThe Sword Saint looked into my eyes.\u201cI\u2019m going to follow you for 5 days. I\u2019ll be observing you say and do without missing anything. After that, I\u2019ll decide whether you\u2019re a prophet or not.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cIs this good?\u201dVery.\u201c\u2026Yes. Good. That\u2019s enough.\u201dI bowed my head.\u201cThank you, truly.\u201dAll the conditions were cleared.First, getting the promise from the Guild Masters.Second, stopping the Sword Saint from killing me right away.Third, having the Sword Saint trust me for a while.\u2018Finally.\u2019Now, finally, even if we climbed up to the 12h floor, the Sword Saint and the Guild Masters wouldn\u2019t clash.Nor would the innocent hunters die.\u201cThen, Sword Saint. See you on the next stage.\u201dI barely managed to speak through my tight throat.The Sword Saint was looking at me strangely, but I couldn\u2019t worry about that right now. I had to do what I had to do.\u201cTransmit.\u201dWhite light surrounded me.Feeling my heart beat faster, I thought to myself.\u2018Now all that\u2019s left is to hunt the Devil King.\u2019The world changed.\u2018Wait. Devil King.\u2019And it was going to change a bit more.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 \u2013 My Death Is (3)Translator: HHThe white light settled down.When I opened my eyes, I was already in the middle of the battlefield.I confidently walked in at the familiar scene.-Krrrrr, kiiiiek!Monsters were crying out and soldiers were getting injured while fighting them.Thousands of monsters ran to destroy the port.The 11th floor.The first battle to protect the Aegim Empire had begun.\u201cThank you! I see you\u2019ve come to help us, warriors!\u201dThe general NPC who greeted us was the same as the last regression. He wore the same armor, had the same expression, and said the same lines.\u201cWarriors! Please save our empire and\u2026\u201dBut it was only up to there.That was the end of the similarities.At the general\u2019s words, the way the hunters reacted was different.\u201cGather, Black Dragon!\u201dA cold voice pierced through the battlefield. It was the owner of Black Dragon, the Witch. Just like in the battle that only I remembered, the Witch shouted after gathering her Aura. She had something about her that pulled people\u2019s gazes.\u201cBlack Dragon will take the directing right in this war from now!\u201dThe Witch looked at the battlefield.\u201cChen-mu mun! Civil Militia! Do whatever you need to at the left! Ten Thousand Temple and Sangryun take the right! Black Dragon will take the center. If anyone has any complaints, let me know after the battle! If you have time to complain right now, get another orc instead!\u201dThe world changed.\u201cOooowwwwwooooo!\u201dThe shouts of the hunters was proof of that.The large guilds moved about in a hurry. Was it because I shared information that this was a team subjugation?There wasn\u2019t any hunter who stood around blankly.\u201cKiddos, follow me! If someone dies before me I\u2019ll kill you!\u201dEven the Chen-mu mun that the Venomous Snake was leading.\u201cWhat are you\u2026never mind. Everyone, back Chen-mu mun up! We have to help those idiots when they start taking it overboard again!\u201dEven the Civil Militia, led by the Crusader.\u201cAhahaha! Acting individually immediately gets you a death sentence. Everyone! Move as a team!\u201dEven the Ten Thousand Temple, led by the Heretic Questioner.\u201cEveryone\u2019s so passionate. Let\u2019s take it slowly.\u201dAnd Sangryun, led by the Count.There wasn\u2019t a single blind spot amongst the guilds. Everyone focused on what they had to do. Hunters specialized for battles swung their swords, and hunters who specialized in support casted magic from behind. Like a tsunami, hunters were pushing the monster army behind.\u201cOhhhh\u2026!\u201dThe general NPC exclaimed in astonishment. Was he touched looking at the view in front of him?\u201cClearly the god hasn\u2019t abandoned us! Look! The warriors from the other world are pushing back the monsters! Soldiers of the empire! We should also fight back! Soldiers, follow me!\u201dThe leaders of the squadrons all shouted and ran.I stepped aside and watched them.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dYeah.What people needed was just a little bit of relief.Even if I just changed a little, if I moved secretly just a bit, the scene of the stage changed like this.Just then, Bae Hu-ryeong spoke in a low voice.-Zombie. Are you alright?\u2018Hm? What?\u2019-You\u2019ll stand out less this way.Bae Hu-ryeong was frowning.-There\u2019s no one who likes to stand out more than you. You go crazy for attention. Isn\u2019t the attention going your way going to decrease like this?\u2018Well. I guess.\u2019I shrugged my shoulders.\u2018But this isn\u2019t too bad either.\u2019-Hoho? I guess you grew a bit.\u2018What do you mean, \u2018grow\u2026\u2019 I\u2019m still gonna take what I can get!\u2019Then, I felt a gaze on my back.When I turned around, I saw the old Sword Saint looking at me.\u201cUh.\u201dI was a bit flustered.\u201cWhat are you doing there\u2026sir?\u201d\u201cI was watching you.\u201dThe Sword Saint spoke like it was obvious.\u201cYou said so earlier. To decide if I should kill you or not in 5 days. That\u2019s why I\u2019m watching you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Uh. Mm. You\u2019re not really planning on watching me 24/7 for 5 days, right?\u201d\u201cWhat a strange question. Of course I am.\u201dGoodness.What the heck. Was he a stalker?\u201cWait, you have to get monsters too! The next stage\u2019s rewards will be given based on the level of contribution!\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dSword Saint lightly swung his sword.Blue Aura clawed around the entire battlefield. About 20 goblins screamed and their heads fell off. Blood bloomed everywhere.The Sword Saint turned back to me.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m planning on using my sword occasionally as well.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cDo whatever you have to do.\u201dAs expected, he was super experienced.His level was completely different.\u201cAhew. This.\u201dI shook my head and headed towards the Witch of the Black Dragon. Their guilds members stopped me, but paused when they saw Sword Saint following me. When the Witch realized that we were approaching her, she waved her hand and cleared our path.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Hunter Kim Gong-ja. And even the grandpops.\u201dShe threw a fit with her forehead wrinkled.\u201cI\u2019m busy directing our guild members. I don\u2019t have the time. If you could say what you need to in 30 seconds I\u2019d be grateful.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t really have any business with you.\u201dThe old man spoke casually.\u201cI just followed this youngster.\u201d\u201cWhat? What the heck does that\u2026never mind. Not interested! I don\u2019t have time to be focused on you right now. This is a request, so if it\u2019s not important, please leave. Hey, you! Team 4!\u201dEven while rebuking the Sword Saint, she busily gave orders to her guild members.\u201cStop going forward stupidly and stay there! If you don\u2019t want a spear to land in your ass, stay there! What\u2019s Team 12 doing? Do you think we\u2019re here for a walk?! Hunt properly!\u201d\u201cS, Sorry! Black Dragon Master!\u201d\u201cIf you have time to be sorry, use your sword in that time instead!\u201dShe really did look busy.I quickly got to the point.\u201cBlack Dragon Master. I have the reward for clearing the 10th floor.\u201d\u201cOf course you do. So what?\u201d\u201cThis mini map is the reward. I can see the entire battlefield with this map. And allies and enemies are marked. I can even see where the enemies\u2019 forces are.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dThen the Witch turned her head to look me right in the eye.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cWhy would I lie. It\u2019s real.\u201d\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you tell me sooner!\u201dShe grabbed my right hand.\u201cSpeak! Where is the boss monster!?\u201dI guess this person showed her real self when she was super busy.\u201cMm. There.\u201dI pointed in the direction that the mini map marked.\u201cIt\u2019s surrounded by monsters but there-\u201d\u201cSay that you agree to the use of my skill! Quick!\u201d\u201cUh, I agree with the use of Black Dragon Master\u2019s skill.\u201d\u201cTeleport!\u201dThe next moment, the Witch and I were floating in mid air. To be exact, we were falling. In the middle of the battlefield, monsters and humans were busily fighting.The Witch\u2019s black hair flew in the air as she shouted.\u201cWhere!?\u201d\u201cThere!\u201dI shouted because of the sound of the wind.\u201cWhere I\u2019m pointing-\u201d\u201cTeleport!\u201dEverytime the Witch shouted for her Teleport skill, we rapidly became closer to where the boss monster was. I hugged the Witch tighter in the air. It didn\u2019t mean much. I just thought that if only our hands were touching I\u2019d immediately fall from the sky.Like she understood, she didn\u2019t object. And she shouted with her eyes narrowed.\u201cAre you confident in using your sword?!\u201d\u201cEnough to skill the boss monster here!\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll send you on top of the boss monster! So in one! Okay!?\u201d\u201cYes, maam!\u201dI knew well what she was saying.\u201cTeleport!\u201dWhen the last teleportation was finished, we flew right above the boss monster.There was about 10 meters left to go.Around the boss monsters, goblins were shouted annoyingly. It was hard to believe that was how they directed their monster army.\u201cKim Gong-ja!\u201d\u201cYaaaaaaaaa!\u201dI covered my body with Aura and shotued. Did they hear us? The head goblin that was directing the monsters tilted his head to look up.-Korrrk?The head goblin and I made eye contact.But it was already too late.My blade landed right on top of the head goblin\u2019s head. His body was split into two. He was a boss monster, but he couldn\u2019t even fight back. He just looked at me until the very end like he felt wronged. Well, I guess since he had been skilled by me twice, he would feel wronged.-Kerrrk\u2026-K, rrr\u2026?The monsters who had suddenly lost their leaders looked at my blankly. It seemed like they couldn\u2019t understand what had happened because it had happened so fast.I grinned at them.\u201cWhat?\u201dStepping on the body of the head goblin.\u201cYou want to be cut into half too?\u201dThe monsters belatedly screamed.-Kiiiii!-Krrrrrk! Krrr!?Unimportant little things like goblins and orcs quickly scattered. When one ran away, the other quickly began to run away, and soon, 30 of them were running away. They began running away like they were dominoes falling apart.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dNext to me, the Witch clenched her small fists.\u201cGood job, Kim Gong-ja! Goodness! It seems like we\u2019ll be able to clear the stage in less than an hour! Less than 50 hunters will probably have died. Maybe even 30\u2026 Ah! It can\u2019t get better than this!\u201dIt was the first time I saw the Witch so excited.Was the reason why she was so expressionless in the last chap because\u2026a lot of hunters had died at the beginning because they didn\u2019t know what to do? And she was happy because the damage was less this time?\u2018She\u2019s unexpectedly quite simple.\u2019Someone who was sad or happy based on the number of sacrifices.I smiled.\u201cNow now, you\u2019re too excited right now. Calm down a bit.\u201d\u201cYou have to be excited when you\u2019re feeling excited! I\u2019ll compliment you again. Good job, Kim Gong-ja! There\u2019s never been a case when the sacrifices to clear a stage have been this low. You can brag about this all you want!\u201dThe Witch smiled fancily.It wasn\u2019t just lifting the corners of her mouth, but she was genuinely smiling.\u201cYou might\u2019ve wanted to take the clear reward for yourself. It\u2019s really\u2026a relief that the new hero is someone like you. I\u2019m so relieved.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cAll the media in the tower will be fighting to get to you, so get ready!\u201dShe was purely happy.\u2018Yeah.\u2019The Witch held out her hand to shake.\u2018That\u2019s it.\u2019Grabbing her hand, I thought to myself.\u2018Getting attention from normal people\u2026getting it from a lot of people is indeed nice. It feels great. Being envied by people and treated like you\u2019re the best. It feels damningly good.\u2019However.\u2018Not as good as being acknowledged by these people.\u2019People who had lived with rigor.Those who could be able to confidently say that they did their best.Like the Sword Saint, who got to the top with just one sword.The Witch, who created the largest force in the tower.And countless other people, who had put everything into this.\u2018I\u2026\u2019I tightly held the Witch\u2019s hand.\u2018I want to live being acknowledged by these people.\u2019And it wasn\u2019t just that.\u2018I want to protect these people.\u2019So they couldn\u2019t be played by the Devil King.For the people who had lived so busily\u2026not even cursing or teasing anyone like the Flame Emperor. Or laughed at others, making them feel small. I just wanted to be acknowledged by them.No.I wanted to be respected by them.Even if it might be impossible.\u2018I want to live like that.\u2019In the slightly changed world, I also wanted to change.And that was my deepest desire.-Hu.Bae Hu-ryeong mumbled.-it\u2019s worth watching a fella like you.And not too long after, a voice rang out, letting us know that the 11th floor had been cleared.Large letters popped up in the sky.+[Subjugation Contribution Rank]Rank 1. Kim Gong-jaRank 2. WitchRank 3. Heretic QuestionerRank 4. Venomous SnakeRank 5. CrusaderRank 6. CountRank 7. Sword Saint\u318d\u318d\u318d+As much as the world had changed, the ranking had slightly changed as well.The Sword Saint slid down to rank 7. And the Witch, who was Rank 6, was at Rank 2.[The top subjugators are entering the 12th floor.][The remaining subjugators cannot enter the 12th floor until the top subjugators have received their rewards.][Letting everyone know again\u2026]And it was finally heard.The voice that opened the 12th floor.\u201cWe might be able to clear the 20th quickly at this rate.\u201dThe Witch spoke with a slightly red face.\u201cI thought at least 5,000 would be sacrificed\u2026but the first step is good. Very.\u201dNo.Left like this, a horrible sacrifice would be taken from us on the 12th floor.And the person necessary to communicate with the outside, the Sangryun Master would be lost. The moment that connection was cut off, the economy of the tower would break apart. Everyone would be confused. The sacrifices could exceed 5,000, and even get to 500,000.\u2018So.\u2019And so.\u2018I\u2019m gonna carry it.\u2019A blinding light surrounded us.When I opened my eyes again, I was there.The reception room of the empire.The marble floor was still white, not dirtied by blood like last time.\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dThe hunters were summoned one by one. The looks on their faces were different. There were some hunters who smiled like they expected me to be here, and others looked angry that I was first again.Like in the last regression.\u201cKim Gong-ja hunter! You were amazing!\u201dHeretic Questioner coming up to compliment was also the same.\u201cWorking together with the Black Dragon Master! Ahaht. Was knowing the location of the boss monster a reward of the last stage? It seems like\u2026\u201d\u201cJust a moment.\u201dUnlike the last regression, the Heretic Questioner couldn\u2019t continue to compliment me. I lifted my hand to stop him. He tilted his head.\u201cSorry?\u201d\u201cI have something to say to everyone first.\u201dThe hunters all looked at me.The Witch still looked flushed. The Venemous Snake had a frowning face. The Crusader looked indifferent, and the Count was fanning herself.In the midst of receiving all the hunters\u2019 gazes-\u2018What about the Sword Saint?\u2019I checked the old man\u2019s movements first.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dHe was standing by himself in the corner of the reception room. Even though our eyes met, he didn\u2019t react. He just quietly looked at me with his arms crossed.\u2018It worked!\u2019It was completely different from how he immediately lifted his sword to look at me.\u2018It finally worked!\u2019The frustrating fight at the beginning of the 12th floor was gone now.I made it disappear.I was successful in stopping the hostile relationship for a moment.I could feel my heart beating as I spoke.\u201cYesterday. I told you something.\u201d\u201cYesterday?\u201d\u201cThe favor.\u201dI answered the Heretic Questioner\u2019s question.\u201cI asked for you to do me a favor sometime.\u201d\u201cAh, yes! Of course I remember!\u201d\u201cIt would be nice if you could do that favor for me right now.\u201dI slowly looked at the hunters.The Guild Masters were all listening closely at the word \u2018favor.\u2019\u201c5 days from now. Please stay here for 5 days without doing anything.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cThen.\u201dI took a deep breath.And I opened my mouth.\u201cI\u2019ll clear up to the 20th floor in 5 days.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 \u2013 A Warrior\u2019s NicknameTranslator: HH Editor: ShaShaIn the last regression.It was when the tutorial of the tower was finished.-Warriors.-Those climbing the tower.The hunters had counted down with all their might in the square. And the goddess had descended in that square. The goddess spoke seriously like she was an apostle praying.-From the 11th floor to the 20th floor.-You will be met with a test.-A test of faith.The hunters didn\u2019t listen to the goddess\u2019s voice.A new era. A new stage.They were excited because a new stage was opened, and immediately left for the 11th floor. There was even a hunter who had tested if the goddess could be cut with a sword.-You will find the answer.However.-The answer you find will reveal who you are.I didn\u2019t do that.I stayed until the end.-And so that\u2019s how you will know yourself.Thinking back now, we had already received a sign of what would happen starting from the 12th floor.-Climbers of the tower.The question wasn\u2019t which award we would choose, or who we would suspect. The tower just let us know that our answer would be of importance.-May luck be with you.The goddess was quietly praying.At this moment, I arrived on the 12th floor again.I lifted my head, thinking of the scene in the square back then.And I spoke.\u201cI\u2019ll clear up to the 20th floor in 5 days.\u201dOf the answer that I had chosen.2.It was dead silent.The first person to speak was the Black Dragon Master.\u201cWait. 5 days\u2026?\u201dShe looked confused.\u201cDid I hear something wrong? I think you just said that you would clear up to the 20th floor in 5 days. If that was supposed to be a joke, that wasn\u2019t funny, so take it back.\u201d\u201cNo, you heard right. And it\u2019s not a joke.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dThe Witch shut her mouth.The silence in the reception room turned to low murmuring. The faces of the hunters changed. Some looked like they were flabbergasted, some looked like they couldn\u2019t believe it, and others looked like they didn\u2019t know how to react.\u2018This kind of reaction is obvious.\u2019I calmly took in all their gazes.Because it was an announcement that didn\u2019t make sense even if you thought about it logically.\u201c\u2026That\u2019s impossible. Kim Gong-ja.\u201dA moment later, the Witch spoke.\u201cYou know. It took us years to clear just until the 10th floor. Of course, since we cleared the 11th floor in less than an hour, you might be flowing with confidence but\u2026it\u2019s too much. You\u2019re overconfident. Aren\u2019t you a bit too excited?\u201d\u201cBlack Dragon Master.\u201dI bowed my head.\u201cIt\u2019s my request.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cI cleared the 10th floor. I didn\u2019t do it for you. I cleared it because I wanted to succeed. However, I still shared the rewards of the 10th floor with everyone.\u201dInformation that this would be a team battle, and the location of the boss monster on the mini map. I shared information, and the damage to the guilds was lessened.\u201c-everyone benefitted, not just me.\u201dSo I could speak with confidence.\u201cI have the qualification to ask this of everyone.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not telling you to wait until I clear the 20th floor. 5 days. Whether I succeed or not, please just wait 5 days. This is my last request.\u201dSilence swirled around the reception room.It wasn\u2019t a silence that was disadvantageous to me.Maybe that was the reason why.[Welcome, hunter Kim Gong-ja.][You have subjugated the 11th floor as Rank 1.][The 11th floor clear is being given.]The notifications popped up more quickly than last time.Last time, only after the fight with Sword Saint was finished was the reward given. It had taken a long time. On the other hand, this time was different. As soon as I spoke, information about the reward flew up.\u2018Hello.\u2019Like it was frantically trying to get my attention.[The Goddess of Protection is suggesting a reward to you.][The Devil King of Fall Rain is suggesting a reward to you.]The sounds of the notifications rang consecutively.I didn\u2019t select either reward.I just grinned inwardly.\u2018Are you feeling anxious because we didn\u2019t fight, Devil King?\u2019Soon, the rewards of the goddess and the Devil King slid up. Glance. I gave it a single look. I didn\u2019t show any interest or amusement.[The Devil King of Rall Rain advises you to choose a reward.]A voice rang in my head.[The Devil King hints that you can even give up a reward.]Again and again.My attitude didn\u2019t change.\u2018I don\u2019t care what you say.\u2019I was firm.I didn\u2019t look at the roles of the goddess\u2019s reward, or at the conditions of the Devil King\u2019s reward.I ignored them.[The Devil King of Fall Rain is bewildered.][The Devil King of Fall Rain cannot understand your intentions.]That\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t rush me.Since while you\u2019re confused I\u2019ll go find you.\u201cMm\u2026\u201dThe silence continued in the reception room. The Heretic Questioner looked around and laughed with an \u2018aha!\u2019 He seemed to have decided to speak first.\u201cIt\u2019s simple! Kim Gong-ja has shared information about the 11th floor with us. In return, he asked us to do a favor for him, and we promised to do it as long as it\u2019s not impossible!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner beamed.\u201cAll of us waiting here without doing anything. It\u2019s not a simple favor thinking of what the media will say\u2026but it\u2019s not impossible! So I agree!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible but\u2026\u201d\u201cA promise is a promise, Black Dragon Master!\u201dThe Witch\u2019s face turned dark.She opened and closed her mouth, then sighed.\u201cFine. A promise is a promise.\u201dShe was saying she agreed.The other hunters all agreed as well. The Witch and the Heretic Questioner. The influential hunter and the most psychotic hunter had agreed. Even the hunters who weren\u2019t Guild Masters ended up agreeing and promised 5 days of silence.\u201cI never agreed to that kind of promise.\u201dExcept for the boomer who was ranked the highest.\u201cThere\u2019s only one promise that I made with this person. That I\u2019ll watch this youngster for 5 days. Other than that, I don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re leaving to clear the 20th floor, I\u2019ll just follow you like our promise.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dI nodded.\u201cYes, that\u2019s fine.\u201dFrom now on, I was going to go up against the Devil King alone.I was confident but\u2026if the Sword Saint was behind me, it would be like I had an army of thousands. I had no reason to stop him from following me.I looked around the reception room.\u201cThank you for listening to my request, everyone.\u201dI slowly turned to move.\u201cSee you in 5 days.\u201dCreak-I opened the large door of the reception room and left.There was a large palace beyond the door. Past the palace, there were high walls, and beyond the walls, there was the city of the Aegim Empire.It was the same as last time.-Huh?But it was different.-Huh? The NPCs are all standing still?Bae Hu-ryeong and I looked here and there while walking together.Bae Hu-ryeong was right.The knights guarding the palace, and the NPCs selling fruit in the market. All the NPCs in the city were still.\u2018It\u2019s because the quest hasn\u2019t begun yet.\u2019Time was paused.I walked down the paused street.Far behind, Sword Saint was coming too.-Quest?\u2018Yes. No one has chosen their [Role] yet.\u2019In the empire right now, there was no chancellor or grand master of knights.Even though they were important figures that were needed.This was the quest of the 12th to the 20th floor.\u2018As soon as we entered the 11th floor, the quest was given. That\u2019s probably the right order. But didn\u2019t we already arrive here some time ago? Why would it take so long for the quest to be given?\u2019The quest opened after the roles were chosen.That meant.\u2018If roles are chosen, the quest doesn\u2019t begin either. The Devil King\u2019s attack didn\u2019t begin, and the empire soldiers don\u2019t fight against it.\u2019That was why the NPCs were still.And they would continue to be like that.\u2018In this world,\u00a0 we don\u2019t choose a role.\u2019It was a kind of trigger.When the highest subjugators chose a role, the quest would begin.\u2018But you know that, Sword Emperor.\u2019I crossed the streets. Because there were passersby, I twisted around them to move by them. It was like walking through a maze.Even while walking through the maze made of people, notifications continued to ring in my head.[The Devil King of Rall Rain advises you to choose a reward.]I ignored it.[The Devil King of Fall Rain advises you to give it up if you aren\u2019t going to choose a reward. In that case, the ability to choose a reward moves onto the next subjugator.]I ignored it and continued to walk.When I left the city, there was a large field in front of me.\u2018If. What happens if the Devil King dies in this state?\u2019-What?I could see it.A sparkling red dot that was clear on the half-transparent map.There was only 1 red dot at this point when no monsters were summoned.\u2018I said, what do you think will happen if the boss monster dies before the quest starts.\u2019The Devil King.\u2018Simple. No one will be able to choose the reward of the Devil King.\u2019-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2018Of course, there won\u2019t be any betrayer. He\u2019s just out before he can try anything.\u2019I crossed the field. I headed straight for the red dot. Not too long after, the red dot was right in front of me. If I went just a bit further, it would be where the boss monster was marked.[The Devil King of Fall Rain is furious at you!]Did he understand what I was trying to do now?Another voice that was slightly different rang inside my head.[The Devil King of Fall Rain is manifesting!]The sky in front of me swirled with black. Like a black hole, a pitch-black hole was opened, and something like wastewater flowed out.One drop. A stream. A clump.It gathered to make a figure, and a voice leaked out from the figure.-You dare.The Devil King was red with rage.-Take the proper steps, warrior of the goddess. It\u2019s rude coming here without choosing anything. Only those who received the qualification of the empire can take my sword.\u201cWhat kind of bullshit is that?\u201dI gripped my sword even tighter.\u201cI picked the right thing.\u201d-What\u2026\u201cLook. This is the best choice.\u201dIn this time when the quest didn\u2019t begin yet.And the city wasn\u2019t attacked by the Devil King yet.So, it was a world where no one had died.\u201cDevil King. I\u2019ll kill you before the quest begins. Then not a single hunter will die, and nor will anyone from the empire. There won\u2019t even be a betrayer either.\u201d-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201cDid you understand? It\u2019s a happy ending without any sacrifices.\u201dI smirked.\u201cI never really liked bad endings. Is it because of my personality? I like happy endings more. You were continuing to fuck with us, and so we couldn\u2019t get a happy ending, so please die.\u201d-You dare\u2026The figure of the Devil King squirmed.-You dare to try to stop me by yourself? Without even the help of the empire?!\u201cYup.\u201dI pulled out my sword.I precisely aimed the blade at the black figure.\u201cHelp, my ass.\u201dIn the middle of the paused field.I became a part of my sword and targeted my enemy.I opened my mouth.\u201cA warrior is supposed to fight alone.\u201dThe 5 days of forever began.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 \u2013 A Warrior\u2019s Nickname (2)Translator: HH Editor: ShaShaThe day it rained, it opened its eyes.It didn\u2019t have a name. It didn\u2019t have a figure. It could\u2019ve been called a shadow. The day it was raining, it could\u2019ve been called a shadow, and when it opened its eyes, it saw the first form of life.-Ribbet.It thought of what it was. There were a lot of things it didn\u2019t know. Just sounds\u2026the sound of rain. He continued to hear the sounds of frogs ribbiting.There was a delicious scent from the rain.Like a snake, although it didn\u2019t know what a snake was, it slithered towards the living thing in front of it. The living thing didn\u2019t know that something was approaching it.There was a delicious scent from the living thing as well.It was over in an instant. The adorably ribbiting thing was swallowed in the blink of an eye. Ribbet! The thing didn\u2019t have any teeth, so the living thing\u2019s body wasn\u2019t shredded apart. It just melted. It fell in the thing\u2019s stomach and slowly melted.The rain poured.When the life in his stomach was almost gone, it realized it had front legs. It also had back legs. Its legs stepped on the ground, but it wasn\u2019t able to step on the sky. Rain connected the sky and the ground. The world became a bit brighter.Ah.Feeling the touch of the rain through its skin. The feeling of life.-Ribbet.It opened its mouth to let out sounds of joy.-Ribbet.The rain poured.It wanted to live a bit more.4.At first, it was an attack.My eyes couldn\u2019t even follow the attack, even though I drank the elixir. I extended the second, but the Devil King\u2019s attack was faster than my second.[You have died.][You are regressing to 24 hours ago.]A day.I drew a 1 on my hand with a permanent black marker. So I wouldn\u2019t forget about this later in the future. It was like a number that inmates in jail used to check off how much time had passed since they were in there.-Zombie.Yes.-The sword technique of the guy isn\u2019t that amazing in itself.This was like a jail. A jail of time.-It\u2019s more like he\u2019s just ridiculously strong. That itself is pretty scary. Since he can just break apart whatever it has with his strength. But\u2026\u201cBut, if I know the direction of the attack, I can avoid it.\u201d-Right.What would have happened if the quest continued like usual at this time?How many warriors would have died in this war?Every time a warrior died, they would die with at least 20 years more left to live their life. People who could live 20 more years would die futilely. If 10 died, that was 200 years. If 100 people died, that was 2000 years.Thinking of that time, I didn\u2019t choose any role.I just stood in front of the Devil King with my sword.Then, this body.[You have died.][You have regressed to 24 hours ago.]Would have to get ready to fight forever.-But the problem is that even if you know, it\u2019ll be hard for you to avoid it. You weak-ass! You zombie-like corpse bastard!\u201cUgh,\u00a0 quiet please.\u201d-Kekekeke.[You have died.][You have regressed to 24 hours ago.]When I returned to a day ago, the day repeated.It didn\u2019t just repeat, but the fight of the past repeated.I reviewed it.-You\u2019re still not used to using Aura. That\u2019s a big problem. You can just focus Aura on your feet and that would be enough.\u201cIf I move while I\u2019m focusing on my feet, my stance becomes messy.\u201d-So you have to make the Aura flow up to your thighs and shoulders. With balance.\u201cEasy for you to say\u2026\u201d[You have died.][You have regressed to 24 hours ago.]-You can just die if you can\u2019t do it.\u201cFuck.\u201dA day.Another day passed.-You dare.How many times had I heard the Devil King\u2019s furious voice by now?-Take the right steps, warrior of the goddess. Coming here without choosing anything is rude. Only those who\u2026\u201cAlright. One-shot!\u201d-What?I was getting sick of talking to him now, so I just drank the elixir. In the period where time had slowed down, I ran at the Devil King. Regretfully, my attack was blocked by the Devil King.-You\u2026\u201cThe warrior cuts the Devil King.\u201d[You have died.]\u201cThe Devil King has cut the warrior.\u201d[You have died.]\u201cWhat else do you need to say?\u201d-\u2026\u201cCome. Devil King.\u201d[You have died.]\u201cI am the sword of the empire.\u201d-Fine![You have died.]-Then prove it in front of me![You have died.]-Prove it to me!\u201cSure.\u201d[You have died.]\u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d[You have regressed to 24 hours ago.]The world stopped, and the only thing providing me with an indication of time in this paused time period, was my sword.My sword was the only moving object.For a time to flow in this world, a second of my sword had to flow.It was only a second from my sword, but this world breathed again with a second.I could only live for a second even though I wanted to live forever.I lived my life.\u201cGood job, Kim Gong-ja!\u201dA day.\u201cGosh! It hasn\u2019t even been an hour and it looks like you\u2019ll clear the stage!\u201dAnother day.\u201cLess than 40 hunters probably died!\u201dAnd, from some time ago.\u201cIt might\u2019ve been less than that\u2026ah! It can\u2019t get any better than this!\u201dThe Witch\u2019s words started to change little by little.The 11th floor stage.It was the quest where I teleported to the boss monster grabbing the hand of the Black Dragon Master. It was something I had to do to repeat my day. Living day by day, the 11th floor\u2019s circumstances started to change little by little.Slowly.\u201cGood job, Kim Gong-ja! Goodness! We\u2019re about to clear the stage in less than 50 seconds! Less than 30 hunters probably died!\u201dBut surely.\u201cLess than 40 minutes! Less than 20 hunters have probably died!\u201dA little bit faster.More efficiently.Every time a day repeated, the Witch\u2019s face became a bit more excited. Her voice was brighter. She looked happier when she said only 20 people died than the time she was saying\u00a0 50 people died.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dI died day by day.\u201cUnbelievable\u2026good job Kim Gong-ja! Like you said, we confronted the golem after healing the knight called Joshua, but wow, less than 10 people probably died\u2026To think this was possible. In this battlefield, mm. It was\u2026\u201dI lived a day.-You dare.One day, the Devil King asked.-Why are you doing that?\u201cWhat.\u201d-I\u2019m asking why you\u2019re grinning.I smiled.\u201cBecause I\u2019m happy.\u201dMy heart was beating fast.\u201cI\u2019m laughing because I\u2019m happy.\u201dThe Devil King lifted his sword.-You\u2019re happy even though you\u2019re going to die?\u201cYou won\u2019t understand. You can\u2019t.\u201d-How arrogant, warrior of the goddess.\u201cI\u2019m just simple.\u201dI swung my sword.-Poor thing.The sword cut me.[You have died.][You are regressing to 24 hours ago.]But I didn\u2019t give up.There wasn\u2019t a reason to.My sword was faster than yesterday.Tomorrow, it would be even faster.Because I was living.Because I was alive.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dThe day came to me without a sound.The Witch grabbed my hand. She didn\u2019t know, but there were 100 black marks on my palm. They were like wrinkles to me. Wrinkles that told me how much time had flowed.\u201cJust now\u2026\u201dThe Witch\u2019s voice trembled.\u201cI just checked. Kim Gong-ja. Not one\u2026\u201dThe Witch\u2019s hand was trembling in mine.\u201cNot one died.\u201dHer trembling turned into crying.\u201cEven the Ten Thousand Temple was checked and there\u2019s none\u2026there were some stupid fools who were hitwith arrows, but\u2026but. No one died.\u201dBlack Dragon.A guild that had been at the top ever since the beginning of the Tower.Black Dragon was ruled by the Rank 2 hunter. The Black Witch challenged the 10th floor tens of times. Every time she did, she failed. She failed, but she always brought back the hunters safely.She was such a person.\u201cThank you\u2026\u201dThat kind of person leaned her head on me.\u201cReally, thank you\u2026\u201dThe Witch was crying.She was also laughing.I wanted to live a bit more.And so.Time flowed.It flowed in my heart.-You dare!The moment my heart thumped, I swung my sword.-You dare to stop me yourself! Without any help from the empire!\u201cYes.\u201dIt was a large field.In the world where time was stopped.I pointed my sword at my enemy with a thumping heart.\u201cI said a warrior fights alone.\u201d-You fool!The Devil King roared in anger.It didn\u2019t have a name. It didn\u2019t have a form. It could\u2019ve been called a shadow. The shadow lifted a red sword as vibrant as blood. The air shook unstably and I was in the range of the sword.It was blood.-You\u2026!The next attack.And the one after that.-My shadow is the evil of all you humans!That was when it changed.The Devil King swung his red sword. At the fourth attack, the sound of a mirror breaking could also be heard. The light on the sword glinted.\u201c-Sorry, King Gong-ja.\u201dSomeone lightly landed next to me.The black hair waved in the wind.\u201cI wanted to stay in the reception like you said. But I couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\u201dThe Master of Black Dragon.The Witch lifted a corner of her mouth.\u201cI felt like I was going to die if I stayed in there any longer. So I came here wondering what you were saying\u2026humph. You were playing fun games all by yourself?\u201d\u201cThey were warrior games.\u201d\u201cWas it fun?\u201dI smiled.\u201cFucking great.\u201d\u201cI guess. It\u2019s a beast that seems worth hunting.\u201d5 mirrors came flying.\u201cI can\u2019t let you have all the fun to yourself. Let me join.\u201d\u201cWow. I had it all. You\u2019re stealing it now?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? Taking someone else\u2019s prey is the tastiest.\u201d\u201cI agree with that.\u201d-You\u2026The Devil King growled.The being who couldn\u2019t be laughing right now was probably the Devil King.\u201cSorry. Hey-\u201dI lifted my sword.\u201cI wanted to take care of you myself. But I think it\u2019s right for warriors to get the Devil King together. It\u2019s to brag about history and tradition, right?\u201d-How rude you are!The wastewater on the Devil King\u2019s body boiled.-I won\u2019t use this sword against you anymore!Wastewater fell to the ground.Like the source was limitless, the wastewater kept on pouring onto the ground, and turned the field black.It was like a large shadow had covered the earth.-Monsters, respond to my voice.Brrr. Boil.The shadow boiled and coughed up bubbles.-Kirrrrk!-Keeek, Kiiii!In each of the bubbles\u2019 shadows were monsters. Black water turned into forms.Some bubbles became goblins, and some became orcs.An orc stirred his head. When the bubbles flowed, thousands of monsters were surrounding us.-Kwwwooooo!The beasts cried out fiercely.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dThe Witch frowned after looking around her.\u201cThis isn\u2019t something we can do ourselves. Sword Saint! What are you doing there staring blankly? Not even helping us.\u201d\u201cI wanted to watch a bit more. It hasn\u2019t even been 30 seconds since that youngster began fighting. Who knew that wastewater would call for monsters.\u201dSword Saint, who had been watching me for about 30 seconds, spoke.\u201cThat\u2019s correct. I was wondering whether I should ask for help after a minute.\u201dI smiled, looking at his face that had been watching me for over 30 weeks.\u201cMen\u2026anyway. Kim Gong-ja, hold my hand. We have to get out of here. Sword Saint! Come here too. Can\u2019t you see this?\u201dThe Witch shouted and held out her hand to me.\u201cNo. It\u2019s okay.\u201dBut I didn\u2019t grab her hand.The Witch frowned, looking at me strangely.Instead of answering her, I quietly murmured.\u201cHundred Ghosts Summon.\u201dPause.The Devil King was flustered for a moment.-You. What did you just\u2026?My voice was faster than the Devil King\u2019s.[Your skill is being activated.]It was a voice that proved my qualification.Soon, the entire field was flipped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It knew about frogs, snakes, and eagles.The happiness of touching rain when it was a frog.The happiness when it slithered on the ground as a snake.The happiness of leaving its body to the sky when it was an eagle.It knew about the happiness of the sky and the ground.-Krrrng.And it became a lion and realized the happiness of killing.The meat of a deer was delicious.

It was shocked.What a delicious scent!What was this scent?!It became addicted and drunk on the blood. It dug its teeth into the living thing and tried to swallow everything up. Blood\u2026..skin\u2026.., bone! Even the intestines. Everything was pleasant. The deeper its teeth dug in, its back feet became shorter, and its front became longer.Its back feet were legs, and its front feet became arms. The mane of the lion turned into hair.It all happened in an instant. It calmly ate the remnants of the living thing. When it ate even the last pieces, the memories of the living being flowed in.-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.Human.That was what the living thing said.The human was born in a rural village. It grew while receiving the love of its family. It didn\u2019t lack any love. But it still lacked something. The human\u2019s health was strained.Disease.There wasn\u2019t a way to fix the child\u2019s illness in this rural village. Even if there was, they didn\u2019t have money. Humans died one by one in its family. And this young human refused to die lying in bed.-I want to walk until I can\u2019t anymore!-I want to breathe the outside air even if it\u2019s just a little bit.It was a mistake.The human had come too far. It had tested how far it could travel before it died.And it had been greeted with death. In its stomach.-Child! Estelle!No.-You were here!It stopped being itself.-I said not to leave by yourself! It\u2019s dangerous near the forest. You don\u2019t know when there might be a beast. Don\u2019t leave by your\u2026but why are your clothes like that!-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.The little girl opened her mouth.-Dad.She smiled.-I think I\u2019m healthy now.Estelle.That was the first name the Devil King had.A voice rang in my head.[Your skill is being activated.]The field began to be flipped.The beginning of change was under my feet. Shadows. Shadows started to expand under me. My shadow covered the blackened field.-Gwooooo\u2026Something soared out from the shadow.-Gwoooo!It was a bone.A pure white bone from a person came stretching out from the shadow. It looked like a demon trying to escape from prison.\u2018Sword Emperor.\u2019Looking at the shadow around me, I spoke inwardly.\u2018You wanted to know why I chose the [Hundred Ghosts Summon], right?\u2019-Oh, yeah. I did.\u2018At first, I wanted another skill too.\u2019It was one that strengthened Aura.The red trajectory of the Devil King was truly fearsome. How cool would it be if I could do that someday?But after thinking about it some more, I changed my mind.\u2018Skill card open.\u2019+[Hundred Ghosts Summon]Rank: SSEffects: What you killed will be summoned as monsters. The dead cannot use their abilities from when they were living. They can\u2019t remember it either. They\u2019ll be summoned as goblins, orcs, zombies, skeletons, etc.\u203b However, you can only summon them once a week.+It was a shining gold card.\u2018Summoning those I killed myself into monsters\u2026\u2019Looking at the card, I muttered to myself.\u2018There\u2019s a problem though. How many people do you think I killed?\u2019-Uh.Bae Hu-ryeong furrowed his eyebrows.-That Flame Plague and you. Isn\u2019t it 2 in total?\u2018Yeah. It would seem that way.\u2019I laughed.\u2018But why do you think the [Detective\u2019s Insight] that the Sword Saint has, says my kill count is 4000?\u2019-What?\u2018It\u2019s honestly pretty bad. And strange. I know suicide was a daily lifestyle for me, but did I kill someone random? Honestly, it was just me. But why is the kill count over 4000? It should logically be 2.\u2019-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2018So, this is what that means.\u2019I looked in front of me.\u2018There\u2019s a certain way death is counted in this tower.\u2019At the field of shadows.\u2018Even if the same person is killed twice, it\u2019ll be considered [2] and not [1].\u2019The monsters that were coming from my shadow.I saw a bunch of skeletons trying to escape from my prison.\u2018Okay. So let me ask you again.\u2019It was an army.A bunch of monsters covered the field.\u2018How many deaths do you think I reached?\u2019Suicide for 4097 times. The first hunting of Yoo Soo-ha, and having to kill him again because I was killed by Sword Saint first.So that meant it was 4099 deaths.Traces of my death were clear on the large field.\u201cDang\u2026.\u201dI nodded my head, looking satisfactorily at the island of death that I made.\u201cWow, I died a lot.\u201dIt was then.-Gwoooooo!The bone army cried out.-Kaaaaaa!The skeletons bared their teeth. They all looked the same. Their bodies were similar to mine, and their heights were similar to me as well. Wasn\u2019t it obvious? It was because they were monsters that proved my death.\u2018All even the weapon is the same.\u2019A dagger.All the skeletons were holding the same dagger.It was the weapon from when I took my own life, and when I killed Yoo Soo-ha.\u201cNo way\u2026.!\u201dBut I was the only person calmly watching the weapons of the skeletons. The Witch and Sword Saint were both looking around with shocked expressions.\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Kim Gong-ja. Is this your skill?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me!?\u201dThe Witch was taken aback.\u201cGoodness. A skill that summons thousands of monsters! I\u2019ve never heard of it! So this is how you cleared the 10th floor by yourself!\u201d\u201cUh.\u201dThe Witch seemed to have misunderstood how I subjugated the 10th floor. Because I could correct her, she continued to be amazed.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it but\u2026\u201dMm.Whatever.\u201cWell, I guess. Yes.\u201d\u201cI knew it!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s talk about it later.\u201dThere was no need to fix that misunderstanding now.Talking in front of the Devil King should be done in moderation.-You\u2026how do you have the same skill as me\u2026The Devil King was also surprised.He was frozen in place. He didn\u2019t have any expression, but from his voice, I could feel how surprised he was.It was a shame.If I could see his face, I would\u2019ve been able to see him frown.\u201cAre you curious?\u201dI folded my thoughts and smirked.\u201cBut what should we do? I don\u2019t want to tell you.\u201d-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201cYou can continue being curious. Or should I tell you about the condition of your life? How\u2019s that?\u201d-I can\u2019t forgive you\u2026! This can\u2019t be allowed!The Devil King cried out like an injured lion.-Just how long are you going to tease me! Goddess! My hate! My regret! You promised you would accept it all! How could\u2026!\u201cSword Saint-nim!I didn\u2019t listen to what the Devil King was saying. He had his business, and I had my role. The Devil King was my enemy. If the enemy was preoccupied, it was an opportunity for me.\u201cPlease fight with the skeletons! If you assist, we won\u2019t fall behind!\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dThe Sword Saint replied in an annoyed tone.\u201cFine. Fighting alongside monsters is creepy but\u2026it\u2019s better than helping you.\u201d\u201cThank you! And Black Dragon Master, please help me! We can defeat the Martial King ourselves!\u201d\u201cI know. Just don\u2019t pull me back!\u201dThe Sword Saint swung his sword and the Witch exploded her Aura. The two seemed to have decided to follow my orders until the Devil King was defeated. I nodded my head and shouted towards my deaths.\u201cHundred Ghosts!\u201dThe bones growled.\u201cShow them what you\u2019re best at!\u201dI commanded.\u201cKill, and be killed!\u201dThe army obeyed my orders.-Gwooooo!The skeletons ran onto the battlefield. They were light because they only had bones. It landed on top of the orc and cut the orc\u2019s head with the dagger.The skeleton crazily swung the dagger around. On the blade, the orc\u2019s eyes, mouth, and neck were ripped. The orc screamed and collapsed to the floor. Because of the impact, the skeleton\u2019s left arm was broken, but it didn\u2019t stop. It just headed straight for the next prey.-Kieeek!From somewhere else, a goblin screamed in pain. There was a skeleton that was so damaged that only its skull was left. It had used its teeth to rip off the goblin\u2019s arm.-Gwoooo!-Kiiii!Around the goblin, there were other skeletons. They were all skeletons that were hurt somewhere.A broken arm. A disappeared leg. A lost head.But they all had daggers. Kiiik! The goblin squirmed, but it was useless. The skeletons gathered around the goblin and brought the dagger down.Blood soared up.-Wow, shit.Bae Hu-ryeong clicked his tongue.-Look at how much tenacity they have. I wonder who they\u2019re like. A monster army that\u2019s not scared of death. What the heck. That\u2019s super scary!A massacre occurred all over the field.The Devil King trembled with anger.-You dare!The Devil King\u2019s shadow was continuing to produce wastewater. If the wastewater was blood, I would\u2019ve thought it was the Devil King\u2019s blood. The Devil King was in despair.-You don\u2019t have the qualification!His despair rang into the sky.-Someone from another world.He hit the ground.-Someone who doesn\u2019t have any life, evil intent, or hate towards this world! How dare you stop me?!It echoed on the sky and the ground.\u201cWhat does it matter where I\u2019m from?\u201dI spoke in front of the echoes.\u201cI\u2019m here right now. But if you still say that I\u2019m not qualified\u2026\u201dThe echoes hadn\u2019t even settled down yet.I heard a voice in my head.[The tower is bestowing you a nickname.]As if someone who had been watching me for a long time was blessing me. Like they were congratulating me after being freed from the prison of time.[Your nickname is Death King.]The voice echoed.[Respects to the king who harvests death.]Yes.Someone was remembering me.Even though I died again and again.Someone knew about the reason why I was here.That was enough.\u201cDon\u2019t interfere.\u201dI lifted my sword and spoke.\u201cThe Tower acknowledges my qualification.\u201dDeath King.That was my second name.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 \u2013 His Time (1)Translator: HH Editor: ShaShaIt didn\u2019t get older.It was always young.-Estelle.It became beautiful by the day, and the ends of its fingers always smelled like apples. On its feet, there was a grape scent. People were always enchanted by its scent every time it walked by them. Its hair was a gold color, and when it fluttered in the wind, the villagers could feel autumn.-Estelle, Saintess of the Frontier.From some time, people began to say this,-Miss Saintess.A young girl came holding a baby. She said that she had come from far away after hearing rumors.-Please. It\u2019s a sick child. Please bless this poor thing\u2026-Do you know the rules?-Yes, yes. I do\u2026!Estelle nodded her head.-Leave the child here. You can come tomorrow at dawn.The young girl bowed her head and left.There was a small child where the mom left, wrapped in an old but soft blanket. The young girl had gathered the softest things she had to cover the baby. An old blanket, stained with milk\u2026Estelle momentarily dug her nose inside it.How pleasant.Humans would do anything for love.-Kyu?The baby reached out its hand to touch Estelle\u2019s hair.Estelle smiled. Life was beautiful even though it was wrapped up in rags. Estelle considered this to be happiness.-It\u2019s okay.Estelle\u2019s shadow squirmed.-You won\u2019t be hurt anymore.-Kya\u2026The shadow opened its mouth.-Poor thing.Estelle quietly swallowed the newborn baby.The death of the child was calm. It didn\u2019t even resist. It just helplessly settled down. When the newborn baby\u2019s skin and bone melted, its memories entered Estelle. They were memories from the baby\u2019s skin and bone. The pain of being born, feeling of its finger,the smile of its mom\u2026-Yeah.Short memories from a short life. After examining it\u2019s blink of a life, Estelle waved towards her shadow. The shadow boiled.-Let it live a little longer.At that moment, the shadow shrunk to a baby\u2019s form. The black shadow turned into a skin color. It squirmed around, smiling like an innocent beast.-Kya!Estelle smiled.-Poor thing.As soon as it dawned, the mother came. Had she spent the night waiting? She looked pitiful. Estelle, who had been waiting in the doorframe, handed the baby in the blanket to its mother.-It\u2019ll be healthy now.-Ah\u2026-It won\u2019t even catch minor illnesses. Please continue to love it as you did so far.The mother\u2019s face crumpled.-Thank you\u2026Rumors started to spread across the continent.-Miss Saintess\u2026The small rumors scratched at the small land.-Thank you, Miss Saintess\u2026The small rural countries were upheaved first.-Estelle.After that, it was the larger countries.-Saintess Estelle.The continent was large. There were plenty of unhappy humans everywhere. People who were rotting from diseases, people who were crippled from birth, people who couldn\u2019t see.-The saintess of savior!They all gathered towards Estelle. Every time they did, Estelle\u2019s shadow became larger.-Our savior!As Estelle\u2019s shadow became darker, the power of humans lessened. A king couldn\u2019t rule a village that they had thrown away.-The hope for all the ill!Estelle.The kings realized that this was the name of the new disease.And they knew what they had to do to make the disease disappear.-Burn her!Fire.-Burn the nest of the witch!Estelle screamed.The fire was burning a person.No.That wasn\u2019t it.-Don\u2019t show mercy. They\u2019re all cursed monsters! Don\u2019t miss a single one!Humans were burning humans.2.-Things that don\u2019t see humans as humans.It groaned. It sounded like a scream. The groans combined to become a shadow, and the screams became a sword.-Be swallowed by your evil!The Devil King swung his sword.The sword was trembling like it was groaning.\u201cKim Gong-ja!\u201dThe Witch shouted.\u201cI\u2019m okay!\u201dI was confronting the Devil King. Whoosh! It seemed like the Devil King\u2019s sword would burst with a red light any moment.\u2018Right?\u2019I focused my Aura on my feet.\u2018Or is it left?\u2019It was a fifty fifty chance.The Devil King\u2019s sword screamed.A sword that was more red than blood and hotter than fire approached me.[You have died.][You are regressing to 24 hours ago.]\u2018It\u2019s the left.\u2019I would die.When I died, I would return to 24 hours ago.[You have 6 days, 23 hours, 53 minutes, and 27 seconds left to use Hundred Ghosts Summon.]\u2018[Returner\u2019s Clockwork Watch (EX)]\u2019 said that the user\u2019s memory and skills were kept the same.[You have died.][You have 5 days, 23 hours, 51 minutes, and 42 seconds left to use Hundred Ghosts Summon.]The Sword Emperor Bae Hu-ryeong was able to share my memories because my skills were maintained even when I died.My powers, my memories, everything.Of course, the cool time was included in this.[You have died.]A day passed.[You have 4 days, 23 hours, 49 minutes, and 33 seconds left to use Hundred Ghosts Summons.]I subjugated the 11th floor.No one died.I climbed to the 12th floor to fight with the Devil King. The Witch of Black Dragon helped me.The angry Devil King summoned his Hundred Ghosts. I ran towards the Devil King and died.[You have died.][You have 3 days, 23 horus, 47 minutes, and 15 seconds until you can use the Hundred Ghosts Summons.I died.[You have died.][You have 2 days, 23 hours, 45 minutes, and 28 seconds\u2026]I died.[You have died.][You have 1 day, 23 hours, 43 minutes, and 13 seconds\u2026]A day passed.[You have died.][You have 23 hours, 41 minutes, and 53 seconds\u2026]And.That day came again.[You can use Hundred Ghosts Summons again.]It was time to repeat.We could fight a final battle of sorts.\u201c\u2013Kim Gong-ja!\u201dThe Witch shouted.I nodded my head.\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201dIn this life, I ran to the right without even looking at the redness.The red light cut into empty air. Tens of skeletons were swept away. But there were 10 times that amount of goblins and orcs that burned up.-You!The Devil King\u2019s voice trembled with fury.-How! Do you have the eyes of prophecy!\u201cIt\u2019s similar.\u201d-Stubborn.Bae Hu-ryeong clicked his tongue.-What a stubborn bastard.Bae Hu-ryeong continued to tell me where to swing my sword and how to move my feet.-But this is so cool. Hey Zombie! See if you can do a repeat summons next time. Stay inside somewhere for a week and summon monsters again.I frowned.\u2018Please! Focus!\u2019-I think it\u2019ll cancel the previous summons and use the current one instead, you never know. 4 thousand can become 8000 and 8000 can become 80,000. Kya! Then you\u2019ll be upgraded from a Zombie to a Zombie King! Zombie King Kim Gong-ja! How cool is that!\u2018Geez, stop talking! I can\u2019t focus because\u2026\u2019[You have died.][You have regressed to 24 hours ago.][Fucking\u2026!]-Why do you die so much? That\u2019s why you\u2019re such a pathetic zombie.\u2018I kicked it because of you! I have to repeat another week now!\u2019-That\u2019s because you\u2019re a weak-ass. It\u2019s not my fault. Anyways, it\u2019s not.Bae Hu-ryeong snickered.\u2018I swear I\u2019ll kill you someday!\u2019-Oho. I\u2019m already dead though. How are you gonna kill a ghost? Haha. Is our Zombie getting angry?\u2018You fu\u2026\u2019-Use that anger to get the Devil King. I cleared through the 20th floor even though I didn\u2019t have a lit cheat skill. Oho, how pathetic, Kim Zombie.\u2018Shit!\u2019That was what we said, but we continued to fight the Devil King.The skeletons continued to stop the Devil King\u2019s forces. The Sword Saint blocked the monsters coming to us. I died continuously throughout the week and predicted the Devil King\u2019s attack, and the Witch continued to play the Devil King using my prophecies.\u201cBlack Dragon Master! It\u2019s right next!\u201d\u201cGot it!\u201dThe Witch spread black Aura. The mirrors reflected it. Everytime it was reflected on the mirror, the Aura was amplified by 2 times. In an instant, the tens of black attacks cut the Devil King\u2019s waist.-Keaaahh!The Devil King\u2019s scream ripped through the sky in the paused world.\u201cHahaha! Missus, nice shot!\u201dI laughed. Laughing, I swung my sword.\u201cWho are you calling missus! I\u2019m not married yet!\u201d\u201cWhat were you doing to not get married at that age!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still young!\u201d\u201cNah. You probably became younger with elixirs! I know it all.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026see me after we get the Devil King.\u201dWe crossed over different scenes.Sometimes, the Witch was swept by the red light. Even the Sword Saint. 1 second. Another second. We gave our lives for the fight. Even a second being off guard was dangerous.[You have died.]But it didn\u2019t matter.[You are regressing to 24 hours ago.]My lethal move was stronger than the Devil King\u2019s lethal move.-You\u202612 times.-You dare to\u2026.my hate\u2026!The Witch\u2019s Aura pierced the Devil King\u2019s body 12 times. Then, the Devil King\u2019s movements became slow. Black wastewater boiled where he was attacked.\u2018Huh?\u2019Was it just me?For a moment, before the wastewater boiled\u2026I thought I saw the color of skin. It really was just a moment. When I turned my head to check again, the Devil King\u2019s body was already covered in wastewater.-Keuk!The Devil King took back his sword.Even though he didn\u2019t have a face, we could feel he was glaring at us.[The Devil King of Fall Rain decides to retreat.]What?[The Devil King of Fall Rain is falling back to the 13th floor!]That was ridiculous!Anger completely filled me up to my head.\u201cWait! What kind of boss runs away when it\u2019s almost caught!\u201d-Don\u2019t think that! I\u2019m coming back again!\u201cLook at this bastard!\u201dI swung my sword. But the Devil King\u2019s body crumpled before that. Like there was a pipe somewhere that we couldn\u2019t see, the black wastewater was pulled in.\u201cHey! You chocolate milkshake-like bastard!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just the Devil King. The monsters born from the shadow fell, vomiting bubbles. It was like the sound of water going down the toilet. The monsters disappeared under the ground.\u201cWow.\u201dThe Witch, Sword Saint, thousands of skeletons, and I were left in the middle of the field.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dIt was when I was despairing because all my deaths were for nothing.[The tower has acknowledged your choice.]I could hear a voice in my head.[Hidden quest made.][The 12th floor quest is being revised!]\u201c..Huh?\u201dConsecutively, at that.[The 13th floor quest is being revised!][The 14th floor quest is being revised!][The 15th floor quest is being revised!][The 16th floor quest is being revised!][The 17th floor quest is being revised!][The 18th floor quest is being revised!][The 19th floor quest is being revised!]I was speechless at this situation that I never experienced before.Could quests be revised?\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dWhile I was gaping, letters popped up in front of me.Letters for me.+[Warrior of the Paused World]Difficulty: UnknownTask goal: You have chosen.

Lightly shining, it looked like fog. The light covered the field in an instant, and it even covered the capital of the Aegim Empire.Raindrops.They could only be described as that. Sprinkles of light started to breeze through the air like dandelion seeds.\u201cThis is\u2026?\u201dThe Witch looked around not knowing what to do.\u201cKim Gong-ja, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cUh, no. This is the first time for me as well so\u2026\u201dI also didn\u2019t know what to do.Seeing the world completely covered by light, I asked inwardly.\u2018Sword Emperor.

Hey, Kim Zombie. You just cursed me, huh?\u2018No way. I was just thinking that you\u2019re so amazing and a lowly person like me wouldn\u2019t be able to understand you.\u2019-That\u2019s strange. You look like you just cussed at me secretly\u2026Bae Hu-ryeong frowned and complained.Even when we were talking, the light rain continued to whirl around.\u201cHuh?\u201dIt was then, that I felt a change.I pointed my fingers at the gigantic city walls of the empire.\u201cBlack Dragon Master. Look there.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cThe city walls. It seems like all the flags are vanishing.\u201dThe flags on the city walls that were red and gold were quickly disappearing. The hundreds of flags decreased to tens of flags in an instant. And they were still continuing to disappear.\u201c\u2026Yeah. You\u2019re right.\u201dThe Witch frowned.\u201cHold onto me for a moment. We should go check.\u201d\u201cYes, I agree.\u201d\u201cTeleport!\u201dThe Witch held my hand and used her skill. The next moment, we weren\u2019t in the middle of the field, but on the tallest fortress of the empire. A fancy view entered our eyes.\u201cGoodness\u2026\u201dThe Witch quietly murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s all changing.\u201dIt really was.The world was changing.The squatter settlements and the harlem were wrapped in white light, and\u2026they disappeared. As if they never existed.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dThe clothes of the citizens on the streets also changed. The dirtied rags turned into normal clothes.

The rotten apples started to shine and looked tasteful.I subconsciously muttered.\u201cHistory changes\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHistory changed.\u201dThe numbers of guards around the city walls noticeably decreased as well.Not only did their numbers change, but their expressions also changed.Their faces weren\u2019t filled with fear and despair of the Devil King\u2019s presence. They looked like they were bored with their jobs.\u201cNormally, the Aegim Empire should\u2019ve been attacked by the Devil King, whether they won the war, or were destroyed by loss\u2026whatever it was, they should\u2019ve had to fight against the Devil King. But\u2026\u201dI swallowed.\u201cIn this world, the attack of the Devil King itself became [Nonexistent].\u201dWhile no one knew.In the time that no one knew, the incident of the Devil King attacking vanished from history.Yeah.I made it disappear.\u201c\u2026History changed.\u201dAnd that result was spread out right in front of my eyes.[The 11th floor stage is being revised.][The 12th floor stage is being revised.]White light covered the city.The light touched the face of a child beggar.The rain of light streaked on the clothes of a man who was worrying about tomorrow\u2019s meals.Shhaaaaa\u2026Light fluttered around like dandelion seeds.In the markets, in the corners, on the lamp post of a street and on people returning home.It softly stroked the world.[Revision complete.]And soon, it faded away.It had disappeared somewhere.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dI shut my mouth.The Witch also did the same.In the paused world, we couldn\u2019t hear anything, so because we were both silent, it was like the world was holding its breath.But then-\u201c\u2013Everyone, it\u2019s cheap!\u201dNot too long after, the silence was broken.\u201cApples that just came over from Ailbrant! Fresh apples! Sir, even elves get these seasonal apples! Come look at these fresh apples!\u201dSound.\u201cThe water in the sauna is horrible these days. I can see the dirty things. Geez, what are we supposed to do if the people who take care of it don\u2019t\u2026\u201dI could hear sounds.After I accepted the quest, the paused time started to flow again.\u201cSheesh! The Crown Princes are so naughty! I can hear the Emperor screaming at them every night over the palace walls. They\u2019re just rumors, but I think\u2026\u201d\u201cHow about a drink this evening? Just us\u201d\u201cDonate a little! Just a little! The goddess loves everyone.\u201d\u201cAilbrant apples that even elves like! Cheap!\u201dThe world started to breathe again.\u201cYou there!\u201dAmong them, there was a sound calling out to us.\u201cWhere are you from?!\u201dThe Witch and I turned our heads in the direction of the voice. A general was holding his sword on the city walls. He frowned menacingly.\u201cHow rude! Who dares to step on the fortress of the empire?! Come down immediately!\u201dSomehow, it was a familiar face.I muttered.\u201cSarbast Aegim\u2026\u201dThe general\u2019s eyes widened. He looked like he was seeing me for the first time.\u201cHuh! How does a guy like you know my name?\u201dI shut my mouth.\u2018\u2026I see.\u2019He was a general that should\u2019ve been on the 11th floor.A citizen of the empire who greeted hunters kindly.The NPC with the skill that I copied after dying.\u201cYou bastards! Didn\u2019t you hear me tell you to come down?!\u201dHe was shouting like he was talking to a stranger.Even the history of the 11th floor had changed as well.Thump.\u2018Ah.\u2019My heart suddenly vibrated.Unknown emotions wrapped around my heart, my chest, and my entire body. I couldn\u2019t even speak. Why was it me? The world had found its breath, but my voice seemed to have been taken by something.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dI shut my mouth and looked down at the general.It was now an old memory.Thinking of the words the general NPC had said to me--End your life. I can\u2019t do it!-I thank you instead of the empire.I remembered the general\u2019s last smile.-Please, take good care of our empire.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dAhh. I see.This was what it was.\u201cHe.\u201dI didn\u2019t know why, but laughter escaped my mouth.\u201cAhaha! Hahahaahm, uahhhah!\u201dI laughed while holding my stomach.The general looked at me dumbfoundedly. All the soldiers turned their gazes towards me. The Witch looked at me strangely. Bae Hu-ryeong looked at me like I was crazy.But I didn\u2019t care.I was sad that the citizens of the empire had forgotten about me, but a greater emotion than that had captured my entire body.\u201cAhh.\u201dI took a deep breath and opened my mouth.\u201c\u2014-The empire!\u201dA lion\u2019s roar exploded from my mouth.The general\u2019s shoulder twitched.\u201cI protected!\u201dThe soldiers on the city walls paused.\u201cI protected your empire!\u201dAnd I didn\u2019t stop.My lion\u2019s roar was amplified with red Aura.\u201cI! Kept the promise!\u201dThe citizens of the empire turned their heads.Some from the streets, some from the market, others from their houses.My voice rang in the city, climbed the city walls, and scratched against the reception room. I laughed. Loudly. My laughter echoed and echoed and rang to the tower.\u201cWithout any shame!\u201dI pointed at the sky on top of the fortress.Hundreds of days.With the thought that I didn\u2019t want to create a single victim, the fact that I defeated the Devil King of Fall Rain after 100 days was,\u201cI\u2019m proud!\u201dI was overjoyed.\u201cI did it!\u201dIt was the first time in my entire life that I felt an emotion like this.I lived like trash. I was envious of others, laughed at them, and spent my days drinking.I threw my life away. I threw myself away.But not today.[Stage clear.]Today, I could stand tall.[Today, the 12th floor stage has been cleared.]I could stand tall in front of people.To the Witch, and the Sword Saint.And to the world.Most of all, I could stand tall in front of myself.[Letting everyone know again.]I could be proud of myself.[Today, the 12th floor stage has been cleared.]I could be that kind of person.[Calculating challengers\u2026][Calculation complete.]I was so happy that it felt like my heart was going to burst.[The 3 challengers are being announced.]Light was carved into the sky.+[Subjugation Contribution Ranking]Rank 1.

Let\u2019s go!\u201dThe general\u2019s mouth opened and closed like a goldfish.\u201cI, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying from earlier\u2026just what\u2026\u201d-Uhahahaha!Bae Hu-ryeong rolled in the midair holding his stomach.-Heek! Heeheeheehee! Kuek?! C, crazy bastard! You psychopath! Zombie bastard! I thought you were going to be mature but you just explicitly bragged like that! I\u2019m curious about how your brain works. Hey! Kim Zombie! I acknowledge! You\u2019re worth researching!\u2018Ah.\u2019I swept my hair back.\u2018Then what should I do? I\u2019m so lovable today.\u2019-C, crazy bastard\u2026! Kim Psycho Bastard! Uhuk, fine! I like it because you\u2019re not being like a loser! Uheeheeheeheek!Bae Hu-ryeong continued to roll in the air like it wasn\u2019t enough.I turned to look at the Witch.\u201cAlrighty, Black Dragon Master! What are you doing? Let\u2019s go to the 13th floor!\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dThe Witch sighed.\u201cYeah\u2026there\u2019s no normal person in the higher ranking hunters. It\u2019s okay. I understand. I\u2019ll think of it as a relief since you\u2019re better than the Heretic Questioner at least.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cTeleport.\u201dThe Witch grabbed my hand and activated her skill. The next moment, we were back in the field again. She didn\u2019t say much and grabbed the Sword Saint\u2019s arm.The owner of Black Dragon peered at my face.\u201cThe first entrance is always given to the Rank 1.\u201dShe spoke.\u201cYou can say Transmit for all of us. Death King.\u201dIt was the first time my nickname was called.Today was full of firsts.\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201dI smiled.\u201c-Transmit.\u201dAnd.We headed towards the next stage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 \u2013 His Time (3)Translator: HH Editor: ShaShaWe passed through countless fights.We endured against endless battles.Eventually, we arrived.The 13th floor stage.\u2018It just had to be this stage with villains.\u2019Was that the reason why? As soon as we entered, it was different. Two different species greeted me after we were transported.One with a happy voice, and one with a horrendous voice.[Welcome, Death King.]First was the happy voice.The Tower no longer called me \u2018Hunter Kim Gong-ja.\u2019Instead, it used my nickname, Death King.I was acknowledged by the tower, and I was welcome as someone who belonged.Was I too simple if I was happy at small things like this?-Keaaaaaah!And.-I won\u2019t forgive you!There was a voice that sounded like it was being ripped apart.-You dare! To my children!No.The owner of the voice was actually being ripped apart.-You dare to take the children that I saved! You dare mock me! Or are you trying to trick me? Are you going to take my flesh, my blood, and my soul?!The Devil King.The owner of the red demon was spilling wastewater.-I\u2019ll curse you!The Devil King\u2019s figure was ripping apart. Black blood and the boiling wastewater were evidence of his pain. He looked more pitiful than when he escaped from the 12th floor. He shouted towards the direction of the sky.-You! The world! I curse everything that\u2019s not me! If the world is trying to get rid of me, I\u2019ll swallow the world! Your oceans will become my spit, and your earth will become my flesh! Your flesh! Bones! Heart! I\u2019ll chew everything up to your last organs!\u201c\u2026\u201dNext to me, the Witch was silent. That was how violent the screams of the Devil King were.It was an intense murderous intent.Even the Sword Saint took a step back and tightened his grip on his sword.\u201cIt\u2019s a horrendous scream.\u201dThe Sword Saint murmured.\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a voice like that. It sounds like he has a thousand mouths.\u201d\u201cYeah. Why is he shouting like that\u2026?\u201dThe Sword Saint and Witch wrapped their Aura around themselves. Was it to prevent themselves from being covered by the murderous intent?There was only one person different.-Huh?Bae Hu-ryeong only tilted his head calmly.-What\u2019s with that guy?And he said totally unexpected words.-He\u2019s weaker than before.\u2018Pardon?\u2019-He\u2019s a lot weaker than when he was fighting on the floor below this.He was a lot weaker.I slowly observed the Devil King.\u2018\u2026That?\u2019-Yeah.Bae Hu-ryeong wrinkled his eyes.-Since he was cut by the Witch or whatever her name is. It\u2019s obvious that he would be injured. But it\u2019s not just an injury and\u2026his [Level] completely dropped.\u2019\u2018His level dropped?\u2019-Mm. How do I say this? For example\u2026Bae Hu-reyong carefully thought about his words.-Yeah. Let\u2019s compare him to a head king goblin. That guy was like an SSS Class head goblin that was a combination of Alexander and Arthur, with a goblin.\u2018You\u2019re metaphors are becoming even more innovative. How do you know Alexander and Arthur?\u2019-An emperor should know about the great ones before him.\u2018Ah, sure. Let\u2019s go with that, Sword Emperor.\u2019I spoke inwardly.\u2018So the Devil King on the 12th floor was that kind of SSS Class head king goblin but\u2026\u2019-Yeah. He\u2019s kinda like just a head king goblin with the SSS Class tag taken off. And not the head king goblin that was leading the 11th floor army, but the weak head king goblin you cowardly gorked and krred at to defeat.In the tower\u2019s time, it happened a few days before.But as Bae Hu-ryeong referenced something that was a far-off incident to remember, he tilted his head.-Hu! That\u2019s strange. Bosses have to become stronger as they climb the tower usually. But why did that happen? Did the Witch\u2019s attack have some kind of lev down effect earlier?\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dListening to the Sword Emperor speak, I looked around.It was an empty temple.The Devil King was still crying out towards the sky like a lion. The nightmare causing the fall of rain was crying out in pain, and he was furious.\u2018\u2026Could it be\u2026\u2019His appearance gave me a bit of assurance.\u2018Did something unexpected happen to the stage?\u2019It was then.[Calculating the 12th floor clear rewards.][Calculation impossible!]Voices flowed into my head.[The hidden quest is currently being progressed.][All awards will be calculated when the 19th floor is cleared.][Only the smallest rewards are being given currently.]Something iridescent was spread out in front of my eyes.[The Blessing of the War God is being strengthened.]It was a map.However, it was completely different from maps that I saw up until now.[All maps from the 11th floor to the 20th floor are being opened!]It was a world map.Like its namesake, the map that was given to me on the floor below was a \u2018mini map.\u2019 Even if it was big, it was limited to a single floor usage. But the map in front of me was on a completely different level.It was a map of this world, a map of Another World.I began seeing a \u2018world map.\u2019\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!\u201dAs soon as I saw the map, I realized.\u201cI figured it out!\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dThe Sword Saint and the Witch looked at me at the same time. The Witch had a questioning face, and the Sword Saint had an indifferent face.\u201cFigured\u2026what out?\u201d\u201cWhy the Devil King is being like that. Black Dragon Master. Think of the last stage.\u201dI spoke quickly.\u201cThe history of the Devil King\u2019s attack disappeared. And the cities are completely different. Things like the refugees shelters are completely gone.\u201d\u201cSo what\u2026?\u201d\u201cSheesh, think about it logically. Where would the refugees have come from? From the rural villages in the empire, no, probably from across the entire continent. But the refugee shelters where those people were completely disappeared.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dThe Witch finally looked like she caught onto something.\u201cI see.\u201dShe narrowed her eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s not just the empire\u2019s history that changed. All the other refugees from across the empire\u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI nodded my head.\u201cNot just the empire, but the entire continent changed. We returned to the time before the Devil King attacked!\u201dYes.\u201cAnd now!\u201dThat was what happened.\u201cAnd we\u2019re at the point when this temple was being attacked!\u201dSeeing the world map, I became sure.The continent of this world was divided by mountains. The mountains were so high that you had to risk your life to climb them. But in between the mountains, there was a small area. People could pass by this area to get to opposite sides of the continent.This temple was located right in that area.A temple that connected the east and the west. There would probably be a long history and countless legacies about this.This temple was the shield of the goddess.Inside the shield, there was a large horizon to the east. Small lands were in the field, and beyond that, there was an empire. Past the empire, there was only the ocean, so the empire\u2019s borders started on the plains and ended on plains.On the other west side, it was completely red.All the land beyond the goddess\u2019s shield was stained red. It was the Devil King\u2019s land.The Devil King had broken through this shield to plough through the east. And at the end, he had pushed them back until the port.That was how history was supposed to go.\u2018So this is what \u2018history changing\u2019 means!\u2019I understood.The time of this world was going backwards.History changing.It might\u2019ve been more appropriately called [History Regression.]-Keahhhhh!Yes.Why the Devil King was crying out like that, and why the Sword Emperor said the Devil King\u2019s level had fallen.I could completely understand it now.I muttered inwardly.\u2018His level went down.\u2019-What?Bar Hu-ryeong furrowed his eyebrows.-Level went down?\u2018Yeah, you know. The voice that we hear when hunters climb a level.\u2019There was.There was a chosen voice that hunters heard when they became stronger.[Your existence has become even clearer.][Your level is growing.]Bae Hu-reyong probably thought of the same voice as me.-Are you talking about the \u2018your being\u2019 thing?\u2018Yes, exactly!\u2019It was easy to understand what \u2018your level growing\u2019 meant. But it was confusing what [Being becoming clearer] meant. I just thought they were trying to sound fancy but\u2026Looking at the Devil King now, I knew.\u201cThat boss monster probably grew by killing more people. But his murders and hunts became nothing. And so.\u201dThat was why.\u201cHis growth was deleted.\u201dHis being was growing faint.\u201cThe path that he took so far\u2026the history of massacres had been erased.\u201dBecause I changed the history of the 12th floor after going through endless battles.-Keaaaaaah!Every time I took a step forward, the Devil King took a step back.[The Devil King of Fall Rain is furious.][His being is becoming fainter.]And the voice that I heard proved that I was right.-You\u2026!The red nightmare growled.It was the same murderous intent as before.But no one was pushed back. Not anymore.The Witch, Sword Saint, and I looked the Devil King directly in the eye.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dI spoke.\u201cLet\u2019s light the signal fire of counterattack.\u201d5.-Hundred Ghosts!Bgrrrrr!The Devil King\u2019s body boiled.-Thousand Monsters!It was a voice that sounded like it was screaming.-My child!As if replying to that, monsters from all over the stage were raised. It was summoning magic. They had probably been there from the beginning.From the column of the temple, from the remains of the collapsed building, monsters slowly got up.-Oooouuuuh.About a thousand zombies got up.Were they the humans that were in this temple in the past? They were some who wore mitres, and some who were dressed as paladins.The Devil King shouted.-Kill them!The horde of zombies ran at us.Next to me, the Witch sighed.\u201cHaaaa. I didn\u2019t like zombie movies from when I was young\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t really like them either.\u201d\u201cCan you win, Death King?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if I can.\u201dI raised my sword.\u201cI will.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

My sword went through like it was slicing through tofu.

Giants. I think it\u2019s a zombie giant.\u201d\u201cMm. Since the history of the temple is pretty old\u2026that\u2019s probably a giant soldier who used to protect this temple. He died beside the Devil King and became his subordinate\u2026it\u2019s probably something like that. If the Heretic Questioner was here, we would\u2019ve known more\u2026\u201d\u201cWhoa, that person knows about otherworldly religions too?

Look at the giant zombie with a single eye. Look at the gigantic eye. Can you see it?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026I\u2019m looking at it. I know it\u2019s basically begging to be targeted. But you can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cHow come? That\u2026eye, Death King\u2026if you could use Beam like me, and you saw an eyeball like that\u2026\u201d\u201cI admit it\u2026Witch. If I was you, I would try to argue that I was going to aim at that eye. But I don\u2019t have time to explain that right now\u2026please?\u201d\u201cUt\u2026\u201d\u201cListen to him, Witch.\u201d\u201cSword Saint, even you\u2026\u201d\u201cThat youngster says he\u2019s a prophet.

We saved each other.We did things.We talked a lot.-My children\u2026..!We broke through the zombies that were at the temple.-My general\u2026.!We pushed aside the giant one-eyed soldier that was probably a legend back in his days.-AHHHH\u2026..![The Devil King of Fall Rain chooses to retreat.]And,[The Devil King of Fall Rain falls back to the 14th floor!]We pushed the Devil King back floor by floor.Like on the 12th floor, raindrops of light whirled around.The temple that was the barrier of the continent was shining like a newly wiped shield.With the sound of a bell, people sang songs. From the East, merchants were riding horses, and from the West, merchants passed by on strange birds.\u00a0 The paladins were thrusting their hammers together while sparring, and the apostles who were looking at them with amorous eyes were pulled to the temple by their ears.\u201cThe priest sneezed!\u201dThere was an orphan who shouted jokingly and received a knuckle to the head by an apostle. A one-eyed soldier waved his hand at the apostle.Ah.\u201cDeath King.\u201dMm.\u201cOkay,\u2026Witch. Let\u2019s go. Alright, Sword Saint, are you ready/\u201d\u201cWait a moment. There\u2019s a merchant selling good whetstones over there.\u201dSword Saint brought a whetstone. While he was sharpening his sword, I turned my gaze away from the giant and looked at the world map.The red land that was pretty far away was squirming like it was going to horde over here again.But we still had time for Sword Saint to sharpen his sword.That would be enough.\u201cDeath King.\u201dThe Witch grabbed my hand. When Sword Saint was finished, he immediately held the Witch\u2019s hand as well.\u201cTeleport.\u201dThe light surrounded us again.\u201cHm. Is the 14th floor a forest. The Devil King\u2026seems to have hidden.\u201d\u201cBe careful. I can feel enemies all around us.\u201d\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s go slowly. Slowly.\u201d[You have died.][You are regressing to 24 hours ago.]\u318d\u318d\u318dAnd like that, we cleared through the Devil King\u2019s Elf army.[The Devil King of Fall Rain has chosen to retreat.][The Devil King of Fall Rain is falling back to the 15th floor!]\u318d\u318d\u318dIn the middle of a waterfall that flowed backwards, we defeated the Devil King, who was using the Queen of Mermaids.[The Devil King of Fall Rain has chosen to retreat.][The Devil King of Fall Rain is falling back to the 16h floor!]\u318d\u318d\u318dOn the top of an exploded volcano, we fought against the wyvern-using Devil King.[The Devil King of Fall Rain has chosen to retreat.][The Devil King of Fall Rain is falling back to the 17th floor\u2026]History was regressing.To a time before the Devil King attacked the empire.To not only the empire but before he attacked several lands.Before the temple was destroyed.To before the Fairy Forest was cursed before the waterfall flowed backwards, and before the volcano exploded.Before, before.Before the Devil King ruled an army.Without any pause.Like how a wave covered another wave, and how a drop of water disappeared just like a bubble.Like how flower petals fell.Every time we climbed the tower, the Devil King\u2019s territory shrunk, and he became weaker.[The Devil King of Fall Rain\u2019s existence is becoming faint.]Like how the Devil King of the 13th floor was weaker than the 12th.The Devil King of the 14th floor was weaker than the 13th.And the 15th was a bit weaker,And bit by bit, little by little\u2026[You have died.][The Devil King of Fall Rain has chosen to retreat.][The Devil King of Fall Rain\u2019s existence is becoming faint.][You have died.][The Devil King of Fall Rain has chosen to retreat.][The Devil King of Fall Rain\u2019s existence is becoming faint.]\u318d\u318d\u318d\u318d\u318d\u318d-You dare!The 97th time.When I arrived on the 19th floor while at my 97th death, we were in an unknown small country.-You dare!The Devil King cried in the middle of the empty land.It wasn\u2019t the Sword Saint or the Witch.The person the Devil King was glaring at while grinding his teeth was me.-If it wasn\u2019t for you!His eyes were bloodshot with fury.-It\u2019s because of you! Everything\u2019s you\u2019re fault! If you took the right steps\u2026yes! If it wasn\u2019t for you, this wouldn\u2019t have happened! You dare! A measly sword user from another world\u2026I lifted my sword.\u201cDang. I finally see the eyes.\u201d-What\u2026?\u201cIt\u2019s exactly how I said. After all this time, I\u2019m finally seeing how your eyes look.\u201dYeah.The original Devil King of Fall Rain had no eyes.He was a squirming shadow. He had a face, but no expression. He had arms, but no hands. Wastewater. Because he was covered in that black boiling solution.That was how it was.\u201cDoes that make sense?\u201dThe Devil King\u2019s mask was finally broken.\u201cThe Devil King and a warrior weren\u2019t able to meet eyes. It\u2019s an unbelieve tragedy.\u201dAnd finally, there was a part that wasn\u2019t covered by wastewater. Bloodshot eyes. They emanated a grotesque murderous Aura but\u2026I wasn\u2019t scared. Rather, I was glad.I point my blade at the Devil King.\u201cFight with all you got.\u201d-You\u2026\u201cOr run away again. Hey, aren\u2019t you curious? How much weaker you\u2019ll get if you run away this time.\u201d-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201cIf you don\u2019t fight with what you have, you can\u2019t win.\u201dEven without the rewards I got from the 19th floor, the Devil King of the 20th floor would have been completely weak.-You dare say\u2026a mere hyena that ate all my flesh, what would you know\u2026It was a growling voice like he was cursing me.There was a lost shadow where he was.I slowly opened my mouth.\u201cEstelle.\u201dPause.The Devil King\u2019s red eyes widened.\u201cI warned you to fight with everything you have.\u201d-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201cIf you don\u2019t-\u201dAnd I hit the ground that I was standing on.An exploding scream came from him.Black water was flicked everywhere.\u201cMy time will be longer than your history.\u201dListening to the Devil King, Estelle, scream, I glared at him.Face to face.Towards the path that I was walking on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The person that was really in hell all alone, was on the other side.-Burn the witch\u2019s nest!Estelle.The saintess from the countryside.-Don\u2019t show mercy. They\u2019re all monsters that have been cursed!-Don\u2019t miss a single person!Estelle couldn\u2019t understand.She couldn\u2019t speak.Because she couldn\u2019t understand, her mouth just moved without making any sounds.Why?Why were humans burning humans?They were parents who had said they were thankful to her. Babies that had received new lives from her. All of them were massacred.-It\u2019s what the sir wants!Soldiers who had appeared out of nowhere destroyed the village,-His Majesty has ordered it!And knights who had different insignias brought their swords down.-The Pope has said to the heretic who dares to call herself the saintess\u2026-The owner of the forest had ordered this, so spirit, please\u2026.-The Queen of Mermaids has given us magic power to\u2026..-Us warriors have come to keep the promise of the volcano! Alright, dragons! Let\u2019s shoot fire to\u2026.They all revealed where they were from, but Estelle still didn\u2019t know who they were.Who were they to burn humans?-Ahhh, ackk!-Save me!They surrounded the village like they were catching prey. There wasn\u2019t a way to escape. There were some families who tried to leave the village, but they were slaughtered once they were caught.The only escape was the square of the village.They were pierced by spears, chased by swords, injured by arrows, beat with canes\u2026..People continued to crowd the square.-Cough!In the middle of the village, there was a paradise that they had made themselves.Estelle looked around in the smoke-filled air.-Just endure it a bit more. Just a bit\u2026A father hunched over. Between the space between the ground and the father, there was an empty area. His child hid in that space. The father was hit with the fire instead of his child and swallowed smoke for his child.The father died first.The child was able to live a minute more than his father.-Just a bit more\u2026.An old couple held each other. Were they trying to die together? That was what Estelle thought. But when she looked closer, that wasn\u2019t the case. There was a newborn baby between them.-Just a bit\u2026.When the fire spread, the couple screamed. But they didn\u2019t fall apart. Their arms were burnt from the flames. Even when they turned to ash, the old couple was holding each other. It wasn\u2019t an embrace for their last memory, but to protect the small child.The couple died first. The sobbing of the newborn baby ended after a minute.One by one, the screams in the square paused.The family that had become rich due to their farm, the old man who had woken up early in the morning to work.-Why\u2026.?There wasn\u2019t a citizen who was untouched. There were people with cancer, people with blindness. Because there were so many diseases in the world, Estelle swallowed all of them.But her heart was blacker than,-How\u2026..?When she swallowed all those diseases.She was surrounded by smoke.She burned from the fire.She quietly tried opening her mouth.-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.In her mouth, she could smell something burning.Estelle realized that her heart was a bit more black. For a day, the village burned up. For a day, Estelle burned up.Crunch!Estelle\u2019s hand scratched at the ashes. No one bothered her. The soldiers had all left seeing the village in flames. All that was left was the remnants of the paradise it was.-Lepandor\u2026..There was a corpse of a father.-Dajena\u2026.Under the father, there was a corpse of a child.-Solape\u2026, Joe\u2026.Ugansha\u2026.She dug.-Mobaijan\u2026..Topho\u2026.Anna\u2026..Garchoff\u2026\u2026With her bare hands.The remnants of the village.

It wasn\u2019t just blood. Something else was flowing from her eyes.It probably weren\u2019t tears.If they were tears, why weren\u2019t they clear?-Poor things\u2026.So it was wastewater.The wastewater that the humans had used and thrown away had come to her.It had gathered in her heart.-Poor things\u2026.The wastewater didn\u2019t stop flowing.-You,The wastewater flowed.-You, you and you are all humans.It flowed in her mind.-You were all born as humans, and knew the beauty and tears of life, so why?

I felt like this was the situation where they were surrounded by the soldiers in the village.-Keuk!There wasn\u2019t anything else for the Devil King to do other than escape. But the reason why the Devil King couldn\u2019t easily decide was because he knew as well. It was the same.Like how avoiding a fire only extended your life for a minute, even if the Devil King retreated to the 20th floor, his defeat was just pushed back.-Shit\u2026.! Shit!Blood dripped from his mouth.[The Devil King has decided to retreat.][The Devil King of Fall rain is falling back to the 20th floor!]Yes.Running away even though you knew you would burn to death was something a human would do.The further the Devil King was running away, the closer he was to becoming a human.[Confirming the Devil King\u2019s retreat.][Historical change.][The 19th floor stage is being revised.]The world was covered by raindrops of light again.After I checked that the Devil King was gone, I turned to look behind me.\u201cSword Saint.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d\u201cBlack Dragon Master.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cSorry.

In my eyes, the trace of burns is still left! The scent of burning is carved into my head! That fire! You!

Yeah. Everyone allied themselves to burn you and your village-the Emperor, the military, everything. Let\u2019s say that no one on this continent is free from that responsibility. But not me. I\u2019m a complete outsider. Hunters like us have the freedom of choosing.\u201d\u201cUt\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t deserve to hold me responsible. And of course,\u201dI took another step forward towards what stepped away from me.\u201cYou don\u2019t have the strength to stop me.\u201dIt trembled. The trembling escaped from its mouth.\u201cI\u2026.I didn\u2019t do\u2026..\u201d\u201cAre you trying to say you didn\u2019t do anything wrong?\u201d\u201cI! I just healed\u2026\u201d\u201c[Estelle] was probably as scared as you.\u201dIt flinched.\u201cShe probably had screamed to live more. She probably shouted that she didn\u2019t want to die. She looked for her father. But what did you do?\u201dI spoke nonchalantly of what it did because it became Estelle, and had the memory of humans.\u201cYou dug your teeth into a human\u2019s flesh. You ate what you wanted, and became it. And is that all? You swallowed the newborn baby that the mother entrusted to you. And you acted like you were the best, saying that you saved people. You betrayed the mother that entrusted you with her child.\u201d\u201cI\u2026, that\u2019s not it. I didn\u2019t do that. I just\u2026..\u201d\u201cYou hid the truth. Even though you knew that people would misunderstand, you stayed quiet because you thought you would be treated as a monster. You tricked people.\u201dI took another step forward.\u201cEven if you make excuses, it doesn\u2019t matter. There\u2019s no one who knows you as much as I do in this world. What you went through, what you felt, and how you changed. I know everything.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not a flawless saintess. You\u2019re not an innocent victim. We don\u2019t even have to talk about the mother and her child. As I said, the moment you swallowed Estelle, you lost your innocence and,\u201d\u201cI!!\u201dAnd it shouted in response.\u201cI didn\u2019t know!\u201dI paused.With its teeth clenched, trembling, it covered its face. Cries escaped through its fingers.\u201cI didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t have the memory of humans\u2026the knowledge, I didn\u2019t know\u2026\u201dThe meaning of pleading to be saved.The begging.\u201cThen\u2026.then, I didn\u2019t know what it meant\u2026I,\u201d\u201cAre you saying you did it because you didn\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cYeah! So I, if only I knew, I never would\u2019ve,\u201dIt tried to say it wouldn\u2019t have eaten her, and I cut it off.\u201cThat\u2019s what humans do.\u201dIt became speechless.\u201cThe kings that you killed will be able to say the same thing. No, they definitely will. And they probably did, right? What did they say to you before you covered their world with blood/\u2019I didn\u2019t know,I didn\u2019t know that you didn\u2019t have evil intentions towards us.I just thought you were a twisted witch.They explained themselves,\u201cUt\u2026..\u201dEventually, it became completely silent.\u201cSorry, I\u2019m not that well-educated. I\u2019m stupid. All I know is the justice of the world.\u201dA step more.\u201cMore than retributive justice.\u201dIts shoulders trembled.\u201cAn eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth.

Doesn\u2019t that seem logical!\u201dI ignored Estelle and shouted.\u201cI\u2019m not even asking for their ability to be kept! I\u2019m not even asking for the cool time to be decreased. Memory!

But a moan never stopped anyone.\u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re human.\u201dI spoke.\u201cThink about it. If you were a monster, you wouldn\u2019t qualify to be summoned for the [Hundred Ghosts Summons], right? No, I guess it\u2019s now [Hundred Ghosts Reincarnation]. Although the name of the skill doesn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cAhhhhhhh!\u201dWaver.It fought back its fear for the last time. The red sword of the Devil King. It wasn\u2019t even able to properly lift it anymore. It barely swung the sword at me.\u201cMm.\u201dThere was no way I would fall to that. I lightly avoided it. Once, twice, thrice, it trembled as it swung the sword.Bae Hu-ryeong muttered.-It\u2019s nothing.He eyebrows were furrowed.-Its stance is unsteady. Its feet aren\u2019t properly stepping on the ground either. It\u2019s not even looking in front of it. There\u2019s no certainty in the path of its sword, geez. What\u2019s it trying to do after it swings that sword? What\u2019s it doing?Bae Hu-ryeong grumbled.-Tsk. It\u2019a sword user that just relies on Aura and its skills. No, it\u2019s not even a sword user.After I cleared the 19th floor, he had been silent, but the Sword Emperor seemed extremely displeased looking at the actions of the creature.-Look. Zombie. Look at that. This is why I keep on telling you the importance of the basics. At the end of the end, all humans have to rely on is their hands and feet.Bae Hu-ryeong spoke.-Close the curtains.I did.With just one swing, I broke its sword. As blade clashed against blade, the sounds rang out.

The Acacia flowers were crushed under its bottom.\u2018Is it like the Devil King said?\u2019I calmly looked at its despairing appearance.\u2018Something that collects death\u2026\u2019I suddenly thought of what the tower said as it gave me my nickname. Respects to the king who harvests death. That was what the tower said. It was strange, because it seemed to fit exactly with this situation.\u2018Yeah. I guess it\u2019s not wrong.\u2019I slowly put more force on my sword.It was the moment I was about to bring my sword down upon the Fallen Constellation.-Uh. Zombie?

I just said it because I was bored. Anyway, wait a minute.And like always, the Sword Emperor inspected. [TN: Inspected and Sword Emperor are the same words in Korean.]\u201cUgh. What?\u201dFeeling annoyed, I just spoke out loud instead of inside of my head. The Sword Saint and the Witch weren\u2019t here anyway. There weren\u2019t any hunters around to think I was crazy.-No. Just because you seem to be really sure.\u201cSo\u2026.about what?\u201d-You\u2019re sure that isn\u2019t a monster anymore. But does that make it a human? What I\u2019m saying is, are you treating that as a human, just like yourself. It could just be a normal NPC.\u201cSo what\u2026.\u201d-Are you sure even NPCs can be summoned through [Hundred Ghosts Reincarnation]?I stopped my sword.\u201cUh\u2026.can\u2019t that be the case?\u201d-You\u2019re a fucking loser so you haven\u2019t killed an NPC yet.

Mr.Tower\u2026?\u201d[The tower is listening to what you\u2019re saying.]Fortunately, I was ignored.Earlier, I heard that I was being given the power of an apostle. Was it thanks to that?

Earlier you spoke informally to the tower, so what\u2019s with all the respect now? What a funny guy?\u201cI accidentally spoke informally because I was so caught up in the moment and\u2026geez, never mind. Be quiet!\u201dEven while we were fighting, the tower answered calmly.[The tower is checking what your question is.]\u201cLet\u2019s see. Mm. So, does the Hundred Ghosts Reincarnation skill acknowledge an NPC? Or does that just apply to hunters like me?\u201dAnd I received an unexpected answer in response.[The tower is judging.][The question surpasses the authority of the tower.]\u201cPardon?\u201dAnd that wasn\u2019t the end.The voices that followed went way past my expectations even more.[The tower is confirming the authority of the questioner.][Pass.

There were only 5 in total.Then where was the last 1 vote?And,-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dJust what was the remaining being like, for everyone to remain so respectfully quiet?\u2018\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2019It was someone who didn\u2019t have to participate in this space.It was someone who didn\u2019t have to come here, because they were already here from the beginning.The person who knew everything while in here.The owner of the tower.\u2018\u2026..I.\u2019I looked straight at the dark area in front of me.The most powerful being was right there.\u2018I think voting for it is right.\u2019I thought as calmly as I could.I quietly spoke about what I had been contemplating.\u2018Let\u2019s say NPCs don\u2019t count. Then how was the Devil Kill able to summon so many monsters? All the people who were massacred by the Devil King must\u2019ve been NPCs.\u2019The gazes silently looked at me.\u2018Of course, I know what you\u2019re all worried about. You\u2019re concerned that I\u2019ll just kill any NPCs in sight to summon them\u2026But, I think I showed you what kind of person I was.\u2019A dark area.I looked at each of the directions where I felt the beings were.And I spoke.\u2018I\u2019m not that kind of person.\u2019-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2018And I won\u2019t live like that in the future.;In the end, it was the same.No matter how strong my opponent was, there were already methods that were chosen for me. It was always just two.Fight, or convince them.\u2018The Devil King can kill NPCs and summon them, and I can\u2019t? That\u2019s unfair.\u2019-Not bad.Something opened their mouth.A voice.It sounded like it was whispering right in my ear, and also like it came from far away. It caused shivers down my back every time it spoke.-But it\u2019s complicated.The voice was laughing.-Death King. Speak with your heart, and not your head.\u2018\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2019I was silent for a moment.And I spoke.\u2018That Devil King is a game that I caught.\u2019I said what I could.\u2018\u2014It\u2019s mine, so please don\u2019t touch it.\u2019The voice burst out in laughter.[The 1st Constellation.][\u2018The Owner of Ten Thousand Lives\u2019 votes for it.]The sound of the laughter pierced through the darkness.[The voting is finished.][3 votes for. 2 votes against. 1 vote given up.][NPCs are included in Death King\u2019s skill, \u2018Hundred Ghosts Reincarnation.]Clang, shatter!The darkness cracked like glass due to the laughter. In the empty prison, another empty space had opened up. From there, white light flowed.[The temporary apostle authority of the Death King is being taken away.]I realized while I was being surrounded by the blinding light.[The conference is being ended.]That I succeeded in convincing the tower.[May luck be with you.]\u318d\u318d\u318d\u318d\u318d\u318d-Zombie. Hey, zombie?Blink.When I opened my eyes again, I saw the Acacia flowers. Bae Hu-ryeong. And the Fallen Constellation that was once called the Devil King of Fall Rain. There wasn\u2019t any sound from the Acacia flowers, and the Fallen Constellation didn\u2019t dare make a sound.Only Bae Hu-ryeong spoke floating in the air.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d-Kim Zombie? Hey, Zombie King. Can you hear me?I felt strange.It seemed like only a few seconds had passed by\u2026but at the same time, it felt like forever had passed. It was really strange. And the memory of what had just happened became faint, so I didn\u2019t know exactly what went on.\u201cSword Emperor\u2026\u201d-Wow. You finally responded. Your brain must be turning into an actual zombie\u2019s because I keep calling you a zombie.\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear it? You didn\u2019t see it?\u201d-What?\u201cThe tower summoned me to the nether world\u2026and something about ten thousand lives and constellations\u2026and someone like the owner of the tower appeared and laughed\u2026you don\u2019t know?\u201dBae Hu-ryeong frowned.His face looked as if he had seen a dog with rabies.In other words, he looked like he was looking at a crazy person.-Sorry, Zombie. I teased you too much. I\u2019ve never been sorry my entire life, but I suddenly feel really sorry\u2026I won\u2019t tease you as much, so get a grip.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know.The Sword Emperor, who climbed up to the 99th floor. Bae Hu-ryeong, the legend who had earned the name of \u2018Sword Constellation\u2019\u2026 even he didn\u2019t know what I was talking about.The back of my neck felt cold.\u2018Who did I just meet now?\u2019The cold feeling wrapped around my neck and spread to my shoulder and back.\u2018Just\u2026\u2019Grip.I tightened my grip on the sword.\u2018\u2026No. Let\u2019s be calm. Kim Gong-ja.\u2019I swallowed and looked in front of me.The path I had to take was still in front of me.\u2018Although there\u2019s still a lot of things I don\u2019t know.\u2019I slowly raised my sword.\u2018Now, I am going to strike the final blow on my game.\u2019When I reached the 100th floor, I would be able to know something.Bae Hu-ryeong tilted his head.-Huh? Gong-ja? You\u2019re just going to kill it? Don\u2019t you have to ask the tower first?\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dI answered.\u201cI already found my answer.\u201dThe Fallen Constellation stretched out its hand.\u201cW, Wait\u2026! Save\u2026\u2026!!\u201dI flung my sword.This sword was my reward from the 10th floor. It was what moved the hearts of the soldiers on the 11th floor stage. Tens of times. Hundreds of times. Thousands of times. It was the sword that was always in my hand when I was trapped on the 12th stage.It was a sword that proved my time because it was always with me.With that sword, I cut the Fallen Constellation.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!\u201dThere was a small scream.As the screaming sound cut off, the Fallen Constellation collapsed.Blood poured out.The blood flowed and stained another Acacia flower. Looking at the white and the red, I slowly opened my mouth.\u201cGhost, wake up.\u201dSquirm.My shadow shook.A black hand shot out from my shadow. The hand that looked like it was escaping from hell didn\u2019t seem to want to leave. But it was a futile act.\u201cStand up.\u201dThe shadow couldn\u2019t refuse my orders. Its head lifted from the shade. Then, it was his chest, legs, and feet.\u201cYou\u2026heuk, ah\u2026ahh\u2026\u201dIts arms and legs shook like a newborn baby. Even though it had the body of an adult, it was nothing more than a newly born being.And.\u201cEstelle is nothing more than the name you stole. It\u2019s not a name you can have.\u201dThere was always a responsibility to those who gave life in this world.And the first of those responsibilities was giving a name.\u201cPreta.\u201dIt looked at me through its wavy black hair.\u201cFrom now on, your name is Preta.\u201d\u201cServe me as a master.\u201dIt was celebrated as the rural saintess.And the being that used to be respected as the Devil King of Fall Rain had his shoulders shaking.\u201cYes, sir\u2026..\u201dThe one that didn\u2019t deserve to have a name received a name from me, and bowed. The white Acacia flowers fell, and landed on its head.\u201cI\u2019ll obey your orders.\u201dIt was the last day of the promised 5.\u201c\u2026..My lord.\u201dDeath King and Devil King.One of the two kings fell.1.And in that place where a king and his servant were left, the first person to open their mouth wasn\u2019t either of them.-Technically speaking, an emperor, not a king or a servant opened their mouth\u2026\u201c\u2026Sword Emperor, do you have to do that now?\u201dHe was such a party pooper.He twisted his body like a baguette with anguish.-Yeah\u2026I have to\u2026I don\u2019t want to do it either\u2026.honestly, I want to get away from the two of you and pretend like I don\u2019t know you, sheesh, but I\u2019m the only person who can say this.\u201cGeez, what are you going to say?\u201d-What are you guys doing?I didn\u2019t know what he was saying, but it seemed like he wanted to be the one giving the name.\u201cWhat am I doing? As you can see\u2026\u2026\u201d-Sure. So you killed the Devil King and saved him with your skill. You even gave it a name\u2026\u2026sheesh, that name. What kind of name is \u2018Preta\u2019 for a girl? If you wanted to call it a preta, you should\u2019ve named her Green Preta and call her Greenie for short.\u201cYou\u2019re even complaining about the name now?\u201d-No, let\u2019s just say the name\u2019s fine. Next\u2026..why are you suddenly establishing a hierarchy?The Sword Emperor looked at Preta and me like we were the strangest things in this world.-Like you guys\u2026what kind of bond do you have? Okay fine! Let\u2019s say you have it. Since it\u2019s the game you caught, hm? You can do that old \u2018I got u under my skin~\u2019 trend.\u00a0[TN: reference to TVXQ\u2019s song Mirotic, the lyrics before this section are \u2018You\u2019re my slave.\u2019]\u201cYou listen to popular songs too?\u201d-One of the hobbies of that Marcus guy is\u2026..anyway. So you\u2019re you, but I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s going \u2018Yes my lord.\u2019I was able to learn one of the Sword Saint\u2019s hobbies.I would\u2019ve been better off if I didn\u2019t know that, but\u2026.that wasn\u2019t important.Hm.\u201cSo you\u2019re asking why Preta is serving me as I\u2019m her lord, right?\u201d-Yeah. Zombie? I\u2019ll list all the things that you did to her.I nodded my head.-You blocked her way while laughing and saying she wouldn\u2019t win, right?\u201cThat\u2019s how it started.\u201d\u2013And you erased everything she stacked up. After that, you even blew her mind away with everything you said.\u201cThat\u2019s what happened.\u201d-And you even killed her. Whew, you forced a kid that didn\u2019t want to come out with Hundred Ghosts Reincarnation.\u201cThat\u2019s how it ended I guess.\u201dThe Sword Emperor clicked his tongue.-Haaa, you indifferent bastard. Is your heart made of stone?\u201cThere might even be a cobra in there. You forgot to talk about the fact that I \u2018closed the curtains to the one who doesn\u2019t even know how to use a sword\u2019 like someone told me to.\u201d-That was necessary, and that preta is probably thankful for that deep inside her heart. If she has the passion of a sword user still left inside her.The Sword Emperor spoke in a serious tone.I thought this ghost was just good at nagging, but it seemed like he was also good at talking about bullshit.-Anyways, so I think it would be normal for her to be angry at you. But why is she bowing her head and asking for you to command her? Was the disaster that swallowed up a whole world actually a masochist of the century?\u201cWow\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Sword Emperor said that he wanted to get away from us, but the same went for me. I took a step back.Seriously, that gorilla\u2019s imagination\u2026.\u201cSword Emperor\u2026.the reason why Petra is obeying me\u2026\u201d-The reason is?\u201cBecause Petra knows.\u201dI looked at Petra.\u201cYou\u2019ll know soon enough too.\u201dSounds of sobbing rang out in the Acacia field.\u201cHeuk\u2026.ah\u2026heuk\u2026\u2026\u201dPetra was crying. They were tears of sadness and fury. Her despair dripped down.It was true.Petra knew well.[Searching for the existence of the Devil King on the 20th floor.]What kind of tragedy would happen from now on.[Search impossible.]Petra\u2019s shoulders flinched.[Confirming the absence of the Devil King.]Drops of light soared up from around us. They came from the ground and flowed from the Acacia trees. The 20th floor stage was small anyway, so it was quickly surrounded by light.In the middle of the white light\u2026\u201cNo\u2026.please. No\u2026..\u201dPetra trembled with a moan.But what did that all matter for anyways?[Historical change.]A strict sounding voice came from the sky.Like a judgement against the guilty in court.[The 20th floor is being revised.]Slowly.History started to move backwards.\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dPetra looked far off into the distance with wet eyes. Something came from the entrance of the Acacia forest path.Chulkuk! Chulkeduk!Every time they moved, their armor bumped around. Above them, there were flags of various colors.\u201cPlease\u2026.\u201dThey were a countless number of soldiers.There were the footsteps of soldiers and the sound of wings flapping.\u201cAgain, the village\u2026.burn the village\u2026\u201dTo turn back history.To burn up paradise.Forces from all around the world were allied together and entered the Acacia forest path.\u201cNo, please\u2026.ut, ahh\u2026..\u201dPetra collapsed to the floor and bowed.Her bowed head and hands were directed at me.\u201cLord\u2026..\u201dLike what the Sword Emperor said, Petra should\u2019ve been trying to tear me to shreds.But the fact that she was bowing desperately towards me probably meant that she was that much furious and hurt.\u201cMy lord\u2026\u2026!\u201dHowever, she did it.She had to.\u201cI won\u2019t have any grudges\u2026..I won\u2019t take revenge\u2026..\u201dPreta didn\u2019t have any choice other than accepting to become bound to me and serving me as her master.But when a helpless person had something to protect, they would do anything.\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you ask me to\u2026.servant, slave\u2026..I don\u2019t care about what happens to me, so please,\u201dIt made people beg.\u201cPlease, my village\u2026.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dI.Not Saying too much.I began to walk.The Sword Emperor followed me. He, who had been looking at us with a silly face, had a more serious face than ever.-So that\u2019s how it was.\u201cYes, this is how it is.\u201dStep.-A servant has to follow their master.\u201cAnd a lord has the responsibility to take care of their people.\u201dStep.-Sorry I twisted it.\u201cYou lost the bet too, right? Please just think of the consequences for that.\u201dI walked past him.I took a deep breath and included Aura in my voice.I shouted.\u201cAll legions stop!\u201dThe Acacia flowers fluttered in the air as if an invisible force shook them.The sound of the dragons flapping and armor bumping against each other stopped. The sound of the horses\u2019 footsteps and the banging of the spear stopped.Stood alone in the Acacia field.There were only flowers between me and the army.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I hope to be in your care from now onwards and there might be some differences from the previous translations, but please bear with me. Alright, enough with the gibberish from me, I hope you enjoy it!]3.Bae Hu-ryeong.The so-called Sword Emperor (\u528d\u5e1d) was a man who was likely to pop out if you mixed a psychopath and an oldie in a 5:5 manner. Thanks to this perfect ratio, 99% of the time, what the Sword Emperor said to me was either crazy or useless.-When I swing my sword, it wasn\u2019t just my skills that mattered.In other words, the 1% contained the essence of the psychopath-oldie.-Faith! Confidence! Having faith in yourself is what\u2019s really important.Bae Hu-ryeong had a solemn expression.-Even your bullshit is the same.It was a thundering criticism that came from his real life experience.-I fooled myself to be able to deceive my opponents! You have to believe in your own lies. Have confidence! No matter how convincing your lies are, if you do it without confidence, your opponents won\u2019t buy it. But no matter how ridiculous it is, as long as you have confidence, you\u2019ll be able to lure them in.\u2018Really?\u2019-I know because I\u2019ve done it a lot myself!Maybe the psychopath-oldie ratio was around 6:4 instead.\u2013Of course, if it was 100% a complete lie, your opponents wouldn\u2019t believe you, nor will you believe yourself. So mix your lies with some truth! Mix 10% of the truth with 90% of the lie!\u2018Mix?\u2019\u2013That\u2019s right. That\u2019s the beauty of lies. If you believe in your 10% truth, the remaining 90% lie will flow naturally on its own!Indeed.\u2013Remember, zombie. Lying come downs to having confidence!\u201cMmhmm.\u201dI looked at what was in front of my eyes.Troops came from all over the continent to capture Estelle the Devil King. Among them, the soldiers of the Aegim Imperial Army, who were in charge of the vanguard, along with the general leading the soldiers were staring at me.If I didn\u2019t deceive them, I would be in danger.\u201cWhy is the emissary of the Founding Emperor\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut that sword is definitely\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy is the emissary in a place like this?\u201dMurmur murmur.Some of the soldiers suspiciously glanced at me. The Aegim Imperial Army was gently bowing its head, but that was all. The soldiers who belonged to other divisions didn\u2019t have a sliver of doubt on their faces. As expected, even the Imperial Army couldn\u2019t stand up against the Holy Protection Sword.\u201cBy-, by the way, are you the emissary of the Founding Emperor\u2026?\u201dThe very leader of the Imperial Army carefully examined my complexion.\u201cCan I ask you a stupid question?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cThe reason we\u2019re here today, as I mentioned before, is to defeat the witch. Why is the emissary of the Founding Emperor here at this place\u2026?\u201dI closed my eyes for a moment,\u2018Lying\u2019s all about confidence.\u2019I exclaimed with my eyes wide open.\u201cGentlemen from the Imperial Army! I\u2019ve already defeated the witch!\u201dMy aura-filled voice resounded loudly on the Acacia field.General Sarbast Aegim was shocked.\u201cHu-, huhhhh? What do you mean you\u2019ve already defeated her, What are you\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cLook here!\u201dI cleared the way. Then the vengeful ghost who was hiding behind me was revealed. Whether they had already known about Estelle\u2019s appearance, some recognized her and shouted.\u201cEs-, it\u2019s Estelle!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Witch of the West!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen her before! It\u2019s that woman!\u201d\u201cBurn the witch to death!\u201dThe vengeful ghost\u2019s mouth wailed and flinched.But I said without a care.\u201cVengeful Ghost.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cCome and kneel before them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dA firm command.The vengeful ghost, who was reduced to becoming a part of my Hundred Ghosts, had no power to disobey my orders. She stumbled and knelt.That wasn\u2019t the end.\u201cBow your head down.\u201dThe vengeful ghost bowed her head.\u201cOn the floor.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe vengeful ghost touched the floor with her trembling hands. Was it because of anger? Or was it because of disgrace? Either way, she couldn\u2019t speak, or she was biting her tongue, the two cheeks of the ghost had a deep pouted look. A little later, blood fell down her jawline to her lips.\u201cPlace your forehead to the ground.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026 \u201dThe vengeful ghost followed my orders.The soldiers watched, holding their breath, as the former Devil King bowed her forehead on the ground. Even more anger and disgrace mingled with the sound of the vengeful ghost\u2019s breath. Nevertheless, to protect her little paradise, she obeyed my orders.In a way, it was an imposing scene.To the vengeful ghost, I ordered solemnly.\u201cJust like that, straining both your feet, kick the floor, and do a forward roll.\u201dSilence.Silence dawned on the Acacia field for a moment.\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201dThe vengeful ghost turned her head and looked up at me.She looked as if she had just heard something wrongly.I frowned.\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me?\u201d\u201cUh, uh huh\u2026? \u201d\u201cGo ahead and do a forward roll!\u201dThe vengeful ghost flinched and reluctantly obeyed my orders. That is to say, she placed both her hands on the ground and made a forward roll.Degoureureu![T/N: Korean sound effect of rolling forward.]A small body rolled down the field, and her blonde hair which was even longer than her body fluttered away and swept up the acacia petals on the floor. After one such lap, the vengeful ghost still had an expression as if she didn\u2019t know what or why she just did, what she did.\u201cHmm.\u201dI nodded.\u201cNow do a handstand.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe vengeful ghost looked back at me one more time.She seemed to doubt the mental state of her new owner.Of course, I didn\u2019t lift even an eyebrow.\u201cHurry up, can\u2019t you even do a handstand?!\u201d\u201cHikkk.\u201dThe vengeful ghost trembled and touched the floor with both her hands. And as she slowly tried to do a handstand, \u201cAckkk!\u201d perhaps she didn\u2019t have enough strength, but she stumbled and fell. \u201cSobs sobs\u2026\u201d As if swimming on the bare ground, the vengeful ghost was floundering in tears.Either way, I continued to order in a stern voice.\u201cDo twenty jumping jacks!\u201d\u201cTen squats, start!\u201d\u201c10 push-ups as soon as you\u2019re done!\u201d\u201cI order you to do 20 sit-ups!\u201d\u201cStay in the plank position for 20 seconds!\u201dAfter a while.\u201cNo, no more, Lord\u2026I, I can\u2019t move my body\u2026\u201dThe former Devil King didn\u2019t have the power to lift even a finger and laid down on the floor.Tears filled her eyes.\u201cHmmm.\u201dI looked at Sarbast Aegim.\u201cDo you understand now?\u201dSarbast Aegim had his mouth wide open. Not only the general but also the soldiers under his command had a similar expression. The Continent\u2019s army looked dazedly at the vengeful ghost, who was crying like a mere child.\u201cHo-, holy emissary. What exactly is this\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAs I just said.\u201dI widened my eyes and stared fearlessly.\u201cThe witch has already been defeated by me. Now, no matter what happens, the witch cannot go against my orders!\u201dOf course, I added.\u201cIt is no longer possible for her to cause any harm to the people of the continent. Gentlemen. You may rest assured about the witch!\u201dThe soldiers cheered.Then the soldiers shuddered, the commanders of the army were confused along with them.\u201cUhmm, If the holy emissary\u2026 If you say so\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, wait a minute!\u201dSarbast Aegim, who was subservient to the authority of the Holy Protection Sword, seemed to be trying to somehow believe what I said, but the other commanders had a \u2018what a load of bullshit\u2019 expression on their faces.Among them, the Chief Holy Knight took a step forward and shouted.\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?! We came here to defeat the witch.\u201d\u201cI mean, the emissary of the Founding Emperor already said, the witch has already been defeated\u2026\u201d\u201cHow can we believe that?!\u201d\u201cOn-, on the contrary, how can I not trust him? The emissary of the Founding Emperor ordered me to\u2026\u2026But did you not see the witch do all those things?\u201dSarbast Aegim was angered. The power of the Holy Protection Sword was indeed amazing.The Chief Holy Knight had a face that said \u2018I\u2019m going to jump up and down crazily.\u2019 He shouted while jumping.\u201cHow can you believe that\u2026\u2026No, no, no, no, in the first place! Isn\u2019t that one sword the only thing that could prove that the young man was the emissary of the Founding Emperor? You\u2019ve been going at it since just now just for that one mere sword\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOne mere sword you say?\u201dSarbast Aegim\u2019s voice rose.\u201cDid you just say that one blade!? Oh my God. Right now, you dare doubt the authority of the Founding Emperor, who founded the Empire?! The evidence that we are favored by the goddess is that Holy Protection Sword. How dare you!\u201dThe Chief Holy Knight flinched.\u201cNo, General. Calm down\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean it to that extent,\u201d\u201cThe Founding Emperor took that sword and left for the wilderness! Running through the fields, leaving a legacy in every city he went, climbed volcanoes, burned down waterfalls, and even pierced mountains! Just to establish the Empire! All our ancestors stood with the Founding Emperor, and all of us owe him! But did you just say \u2018just for that mere blade\u2019?!\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I meant\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf not, then what the hell were you talking about?!\u201d\u201cYo-, Your Holiness, the Pope had given me orders. I was given a strict order to defeat the evil witch at all costs\u2026 But just because of one word,\u201dThe general of the Empire screamed.\u201cWhat do you mean just because of one word?! You are indirectly questioning the words of the Founding Emperor\u2019s emissary using the order of the Pope!\u201dWow.\u201cWhat, what\u2026\u201dThe Chief Holy Knight shut his mouth.It took exactly two seconds for his bewilderment to turn into anger.\u201cBack at you, you dare doubt the authority of the Temple of God!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you first doubt the authority of the Holy Protection Sword?!\u201d\u201cOh ohhhh, good! I got it! Seems like the Third Prince that you are loyal to doesn\u2019t need the Pope\u2019s declaration of support.\u201d\u201cHa, what declaration of support?! The emissary of the Founding Emperor has already turned up and defeated the witch. What does the Goddess\u2019s love have to do with looking over the sovereignty of the Empire?\u201d\u201cSo is that really the will of the Third Prince\u2019s faction?\u201dThe Empire\u2019s General and the Knights of the Temple were squabbling fiercely.I was grinning happily inside.\u2018Very good.\u2019There was something you must be careful about when groups of people band together.If an internal strife was revealed even once, it becomes a straight-road rush towards destruction.\u2018They wouldn\u2019t be able to go far.\u2019When we Hunters went up to the 12th floor. At that time, it was unfortunate, but there were exactly eight different power structures.Me, Sword Saint, and the top five guild masters all represented one power structure each. And the minor forces that were in a contribution by the 8th to 10th place.We were together for the external purpose of \u2018Clearing the Tower\u2019, but we were never a solid mass.There was something piled upon each other. There was distrust.That was why we pathetically self-destructed even though there was only one unexpected variable called [The Devil King\u2019s Reward].[Warriors, those who climb the towers.]As soon as the 11th floor was opened, I recalled what the hologram of the goddess said.[From the 11th floor to the 20th floor, you will face a test. A test of faith.]I grinned inwardly.The test of one\u2019s good faith.\u2018Not only the Hunters, but probably also the residents of the tower would have to go through it too right?\u2019Wouldn\u2019t that make the world a little more fair?Chapter 48.2 \u2013 How to Stand Against the World (2)Translator: WH Editor: Sasha4.The Empire and the Temple of God were fully in the midst of [The Test of Faith].Other forces began to intervene one by one as well.\u201cOhhh, everyone\u2026Now is not the time for fighting.\u201dThe Elf Ranger Captain from the Fairy Forest sighed.\u201cShouldn\u2019t we investigate thoroughly whether or not the witch is really under that young man\u2019s control? No matter how foolish you all are, there\u2019s a time and place for everything.\u201dWas he trying to stop the fight, or fan the sparks of the fight?Naturally, it didn\u2019t help whatsoever.\u201cThat\u2019s right if I had to add a comment to what you just said, isn\u2019t the Temple of God being self-contradictory? The Founding Emperor of Aegim\u2019s Holy Protection Sword was bestowed to him by the Goddess of Protection that you all worship at the Temple of God. To doubt the authority of the sword is to doubt the authority of the goddess, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s why humans who live short lives are so foolish\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?! The elves saw us in that kind of light?!\u201d\u201cThis is why these big-earned ones are unreliable sons of bitches!\u201dThey even got in the way.\u201cWhat on earth are the Temple of God and the Empire doing?! Arguing in front of us who came to uphold our honourable covenant!\u201dThe Dragoon Unit Captain that came from the volcano shouted.\u201cSettle it with a duel just like the warriors you are! What else are you going to use your weapons for?\u201dBasically, they were a unicellular unit.In Hunter terms\u2026 Yes, they were just like the Venomous Snake from Chen Mu-mun.\u201cOur Freedom City Union believes both the Holy Protection Sword and the Temple of God are right. But there must be someone more right. If you have any suggestions, I\u2019ll listen with an open mind.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why farming is for suckers\u2026 Oh, so when can we plunder that town? You said we could rob it right? So, since they came to see us.\u201d\u201cEv-, everyone. Guys\u2026 there\u2019s a witch\u2019s den right in front of us\u2026.\u201dWearing an armed top, she openly revealed her [Personal Status], she was a nomadic female chief who was grumbling while pulling along the horses.It was the closest place to the vengeful ghost\u2019s paradise, so only the lords of the minor countries, that initially tried to desperately spark the destruction of the paradise, were in a state of panic.In other words, it was a very dangerous situation.-Keuuhoooo!On the other hand, the Sword Emperor and I became that much more relaxed.Bae Hu-ryeong folded his arms and shook his head.-I understand why the vengeful ghost put up a fight against the Hunters. There was an exhilarating feeling when driving a wedge in, causing internal confusion!\u2018I admit it.\u2019Honestly, it was so much fun.However, of course, they were not the only ones full of trollers.\u201cHa. Guys, get out of my way!\u201dJust like us Hunters had a person that was so-called the \u2018Civil Militia Guild Master\u2019. A mediator. There were, of course, those who came forward to resolve the situation before the whole army headed toward chaos and destruction.A lizardman magician from the Mermaid Falls stepped forward.\u201cIn the eyes of this young one, the problem was simple after all.\u201dThe lizardman magician pointed at me with his webbed fingers.\u201cWhether the young man really is the emissary of the Founding Emperor, or if that woman was really the witch. Whether or not the emissary really defeated the witch and brought her under his reign. It\u2019ll all be solved as long as we can confirm this.\u201dThe Chief Holy Knight of the Temple of God, who became exhausted while arguing with the General of the Empire, frowned.\u201cSo how do you confirm that?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Of course, I have a way.\u201dThe lizardman magician placed her webbed hands on her chest.In her grasp was a blue bead that seemed to hold the condensed deep sea.\u201cThis is the Soul Jewel that the Queen of Mermaids gave me.\u201dThe lizardman magician was very serious. As if she was going to show us an extremely precious treasure from now on, and she sounded as if this was the fortune of our lifetimes to be able to see such a treasure with our own eyes.\u201cIf you drip a drop of blood here, you can determine whether the owner of the blood has a [Good-Natured Soul], or a [Evil-Natured Soul]. If you have a good-natured soul, the jewel will emit white light, and if you have an evil-natured soul, a black light will emerge.\u201dHmmmmm.So it\u2019s like the Crusader\u2019s [Lie Detector] and the Sword Saint\u2019s [Detective\u2019s Insight].-Uhuh. I think so. The demifolks are very good at making weird gizmos like that.Bae Hu-ryeong and I remained unfazed. The Queen of Mermaids\u2019 precious jewel or whatever, it sounded grand, but\u2026 It was nothing new for us.Unaware of our thoughts, the lizardman magician was confident.\u201cNow! If that woman is truly the Witch of the Frontier, and if you are truly the emissary of the Founding Emperor, accept the test of the jewel!\u201dThe lizardman magician lifted the jewel.\u201cThe evil deeds you have done. The good deeds you have accumulated. This jewel will prove everything!\u201d\u201cAlright then.\u201dI nodded meekly.\u201cTry as much as you like.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t regret it. As I said, the jewel will expose your soul as it is.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re standing quite far from that fork. How about you start running?\u201dThe snake-like eyes of the lizardman magician sharpened.\u201cI hope that confidence is not just false bravado. Well then, let\u2019s start with testing that woman\u2019s soul first.\u201dThe lizardman magician strode toward us. She grabbed the wrist of the vengeful ghost. Then she ran her sharp fingernails across the vengeful ghost\u2019s palm and scratched her.Blood flowed down from her palm.\u201cHikkk.\u201dThe vengeful ghost flinched. The dark red drops of blood trickled down and smeared the jewel of the Queen of Mermaids.Shinngggggg!The jewel was dyed black at once.\u201cWhat the f-!\u201d\u201cOh my God.\u201dThe commanding officers watching the soul test were terrified. The color exuded by the jewel was not an ordinary black. It was a color that was as dark as the abyss. A void-like black shadow writhed around, just like a slithering black snake.\u201cWhat an evil soul this is\u2026\uff01\u201dEven the lizardman magician, who was overseeing the test, gulped.\u201cIt\u2019s to a degree that\u2019s hard to believe. How many murders and evil deeds did you commit\u2026., This is a being that shouldn\u2019t exist in the world. A cursed being\u2026 She\u2019s undoubtedly the witch!\u201dPlop.The magician quickly let go of the vengeful ghost\u2019s wrist as if she was trying to avoid wastewater. The vengeful ghost could see that the magician\u2019s eye contained a great deal of contempt and fear, fear from even being close to her.\u201cNo. Not even a witch could compare. She\u2019s definitely a Devil King!\u201dThe vengeful ghost shrugged even more.The atmosphere changed. Was it because the lizardman magician confirmed the identity of the vengeful ghost? The soldiers\u2019 chattering died down. The commanders stopped arguing and stared fiercely at the vengeful ghost. The more they stared, the more she cowered, and she slipped back and hid behind me.\u201cNow, it\u2019s your turn.\u201dPeople\u2019s eyes naturally turned towards me.The lizardman magician raised her long nails.\u201cSelf-proclaimed emissary of the Founding Emperor. Are you ready?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m always ready.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no use bluffing\u2026Now, give your hand to me.\u201dI willingly extended my left hand. Screech! My flesh spread like gills on the spot where the fingernails of the lizardman magician had run through.Red blood flowed down from the cut. My blood dripped slowly onto the jewel that was dyed black because of the vengeful ghost\u2019s blood.And\u2026\u201cAh\u2026?\u201dThere was a ray of light.\u201cUh, Huh\u2026?\u201dThe blackness disappeared from the jewel as if it was cleansed of it. It wasn\u2019t just that. The white ray of light clung together and lit up, and finally spread like an explosion around me.Shingggggg!The Acacia field turned white instantaneously. Screams broke out from here and there. And I screened my face with my palm.The lizardman magician who was holding the jewel did the same.\u201cHo-, how can this\u2026\u201dShe was stunned and gasped.\u201cWait a minute, what the hell is this soul\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell is going on?!\u201dShouted the Chief Holy Knight of the Temple of God.\u201cThe \u2018water droplet\u2019 given by the current Queen! Why is this ray of light coming out from the jewel?\u201cHis soul\u2026\u201dThe wizard muttered without even looking back at the Holy Knights.\u201cHow can you be so\u2026 How many lives have you saved, such a pure white, this is\u2026 This is simply\u2026\u2026.\u201dAhhhh, said the lizardman magician.\u201cThis person is\u2026\u2026He\u2019s light itself\u2026\u2026!\u201dYes.I was the light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 \u2013 How to Stand Against the World (3)Translator: WH Editor: Sasha\u201cLi-, light\u2026?\u201dThe Temple of God\u2019s Chief Holy Knight stuttered.The brilliant white glow of light that emerged from the jewel subsided a little.Then it got to a point where I didn\u2019t have to cover my eyes anymore.\u201cWhat do you mean he\u2019s the Light?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s as I just said\u2026\u2026 He\u2019s just\u2026 He\u2019s just the Light\u2026.\u201dThe lizardman magician cried.I wasn\u2019t very confident in reading the lizardman\u2019s face, but I could at least recognize the expression that the lizardman was wearing. She was moved. Her snake-like eyes were filled with dews of tears.\u201cCan\u2019t you see how dazzling this soul is\u2026?\u201d\u201cI-, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you know? Do you have problems with your eyes? Or is your brain the problem?\u201dThe Chief Holy Knight looked dispirited. The extent of his intelligence was suddenly being questioned.\u201cNo. I mean, I just don\u2019t know what you mean by the Light.\u201d\u201cAhhh.\u201dThe lizardman magician whimpered.Then he quickly looked back at the Chief Holy Knight.\u201cThat\u2019s why the idiots from the Temple of God are so\u2026!\u201d\u201cWha-, what?\u201d\u201cDo you even know who you\u2019re looking at now? He\u2019s the light! Why don\u2019t you know that, even when the light is so dazzling? Do you not have eyes? Do you not have a brain? Pure white\u2026 It\u2019s not just an ordinary ray of light, The Light he exudes is pure white!\u201d\u201cLi-, isn\u2019t a ray of light always white?\u201d\u201cAhhhh! This is why! My words can\u2019t go through to these crude humans!\u201dThe lizardman magician pounded her chest as she was annoyed. Boom boom. A little more irritating and she would\u2019ve smacked his head instead, not her chest. Even the Chief Holy Knight felt it, so he cowered.\u201cHe who carries such a soul would never lie to us!\u201dThe lizardman magician strongly asserted.\u201cEven if he did lie, he would\u2019ve been lying for our sake! O, foolish humans. Those with corrupted souls like you all should just simply obey him quietly. This man is the emissary of the Founding Emperor\u2026 No. He must be the Goddess\u2019s apostle!\u201dThe lizardman magician looked at me.Her gaze seemed as if she was seeking for my recognition.It wasn\u2019t just the magician. The entire army that gathered at the Acacia Fields held their breaths and looked at me.\u201cYes.\u201dI folded my arms proudly.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dWith my utmost solemn expression.\u201cI, am the apostle of the Goddess.\u201d\u201cI knew it!\u201dRoaring.The soldiers all around started chattering. Following the General of the Empire, even the magician from the Mermaid Falls guaranteed my identity.\u00a0 Three men talking makes a tiger(\u4e09\u4eba\u6210\u864e). Even if the tiger didn\u2019t exist, the way those three said it, it would seem as if there really was a tiger.[T/N: It is a Korean Idiom, and basically means that if rumors are repeated continuously, they will become a fact.]\u201cApparently he\u2019s the Light.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean Light?\u201d\u201cIt seems that he\u2019s a dazzling Light. The sword\u2019s also flashy too\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a sword that the Emperor of Aegim or something once used.\u201d\u201cThen that means he\u2019s a noble that came from a prestigious family somewhere.\u201dMost of the soldiers were suspicious when they first saw the Holy Protection Sword. But now their gazes changed, and it looked like they were exclaiming, \u2018No way?\u2019.Of course, one more person was still needed to achieve the effect of \u2018three men talking makes a tiger\u2019.\u201cNo! As expected, I\u2019m not sure!\u201dThe Chief Holy Knight stepped forward.\u201cLet\u2019s say you are the emissary of the Founding Emperor and also light itself! But why is that young man\u2026 I mean, why did such a person march here by himself, and why is he blocking our way?! Have you all forgotten? We have a mission!\u201dThe Chief Holy Knight adamantly pointed to the place beyond my shoulder.\u201cWe must burn that place!\u201dEstelle\u2019s hometown.That was the paradise that the vengeful ghost had talked about.\u201cHis Holiness, the Pope was not only concerned about the witch. The heretics who followed the witch! We can\u2019t let them get away from receiving divine punishment! If you are truly\u2026 the apostle of the Goddess, take the lead in carrying out the heavenly punishment!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAughh. Someone grabbed the hem of my clothes from behind. \u201cIt was the vengeful ghost.\u00a0 I could feel that she was terrified without even looking back.\u2018It\u2019s all right.\u2019I folded my arms calmly.\u2018The best lies are in other words, made up of 90% truth, and 10% lie!\u2019Recalling the advice given by Bae Hu-ryeong, I slowly opened my mouth.\u201cHoly Knights of the Temple of God. Watch your language. It is not up to you to decide how the divine punishment should be executed. Whatever punishment that is given to the evil group, is entirely up to me.\u201d\u201cWhat are you\u2026?\u201d\u201cI have collected all evil (\u60e1), and divine punishment has already been carried out.\u201dI said gently.\u201cIt is my duty to bring divine punishment to man.\u201d\u201cDu-, what do you mean duty\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201dI raised my right hand.Wriggle.In an instant, my shadows spread throughout the Acacia field.-Guoooooooo!Skeletons began crawling out of the shadows.The soldiers screamed. The Chief Holy Knight turned pale while he contemplated, and the other commanders were so surprised that they armed themselves. In the meantime, the number of skeletons had risen from dozens to hundreds, and from hundreds to thousands.Before they knew it, the Continent\u2019s army was completely surrounded.Hundred Ghosts Reincarnation.Skeletons numbering around four thousand rose.-Guooooooo!-Uwoooo! Uwoooooooooo!The monsters cried ferociously and waited for my orders.As one could see from the fact that the vengeful ghost was out in the open, I still had the [Hundred Ghosts Reincarnation] in active mode. I could summon as many ghosts as I wanted.But it was a different story for the Continent\u2019s army who didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201cAgh, it\u2019s the devils!\u201dThe soldiers were thrown into confusion at the sight before them.\u00a0 Four thousand monsters suddenly popped out all over. And the monsters emerged from the ground as if they were climbing out from hell.It was literally a scene from the purgatory(\u5730\u7344\u5716).\u201cGo-\u2026 Oh almighty God.\u201dThe Chief Holy Knight trembled.\u201cWhat the hell are these horrendous beings\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my duty.\u201dI placed my hand on the vengeful ghost\u2019s head.The vengeful ghost flinched but she remained quiet.\u201cLook. How can this witch be the only evil being in this vast world? Every one of these ghosts are wicked evildoers that I have subdued. Devils, second only to the witch.\u201d\u201cAl-, all these monsters\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201dI stared at the distant sky with my squinted eyes.As if I was a hero that was doomed to have a tragic destiny.\u201cThe Goddess ordered me. Punish the overflowing evil that has corrupted the world on her behalf! Punish and subdue! That\u2019s why she bestowed me with this ability.\u201dMy voice naturally became somber.\u201cIt is my calling, my mission to bring down all the evil in the world. It\u2019s my duty to drag these devils to hell. What you guys are seeing right now is my Hell.\u201d\u201cOh my God\u2026\u201dThe lizardman magician lamented.Tears were flowing again from her eyes.\u201cThese are all wicked evildoers who were comparable to the witch\u2026?\u201dI nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cWith-, without us knowing\u2026 Was the Goddess\u2019s apostle by himself, alone, bringing down punishment to the evil that was rampant in this world???\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cOh my God. No one even recognized apostle-nim\u2026 How could you have such a Hell? How can you, who\u2019s nothing more than a mere human being, by yourself\u2026. Oh Goddess\u2019s Apostle, will you be alright\u2026?\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201dWith my arms folded, I nodded.\u201cThis is my duty!\u201dSeriously, earnestly, and solemnly.\u201cThere is no need for you all to punish the witch separately. There is also no need to punish the witch\u2019s pawns. I have already subdued all who are wicked. These evildoers will grieve and suffer in agony forever under my shadow. That is to say that I am their Hell!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026O holy light\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe lizardman magician fell to pieces as she sobbed.\u201cHow did I not realize how holy and white your light was? the foolish me has finally perceived your light! Without our knowing, you\u2019ve continued to save our Continent without rest!\u201dI nodded again.\u201cIndeed so!\u201dThe greatest lies consist of 90% truth and 10% lie.Although the process was filled with a series of lies, the ending was correct.In fact, since the end result was right, it wouldn\u2019t matter, right?-You son of a\u2026Bae Hu-ryeong had a proud expression on his face.-I see that there\u2019s nothing more I can teach you! Be on your way now!\u2018Oh, everything was thanks to your advice, master. How could this unworthy pupil be on his way.\u2019-No, no, no. Zombie, your immorality has already transcended mine\u2026.Bae Hu-ryeong lamented while sighing.-This master of yours is as innocent as a child, so I just can\u2019t handle a son of a bitch like you\u2026.\u2018You\u2019re too humble. I still have a lot to learn from master\u2019s vicious personality. Take your words back.\u2019-You bastard. Have you ever heard of Cheongchul Eoram?[T/N: Cheongchul Eoram (\u9752\u51fa\u4e8e\u84dd)is an Idiom that is used when the student surpasses the master.]\u2018Have you ever heard that no disciple is better than their master?\u2019The disciple and master praised each other\u2019s character.On a day like today, when relationships were being ruined.But actually, it was a beautiful and warm scene discretely unfolding.\u201c-Anyway.\u201dI deactivated the Hundred Ghosts Reincarnation.Fwoooshh.The four thousand skeletons disappeared in an instant. The Continent\u2019s army stared dumbfoundedly at the sight of the monsters being absorbed under my shadow as if a ship were sinking.\u201cYou all don\u2019t need to worry about the witch and her pawns. As long as I am here, they will suffer forever in my Hell. This is the will of the Goddess, and this is the divine punishment of the Goddess.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cDo you really intend to reject the dignified will of the Goddess?\u201dThe Chief Holy Knight staggered.\u201cIf-, if I may ask\u2026 o holy Apostle. Truly, are you sure these atrocious devils are secured? What this humble one is trying to say is\u2026 If these devils were to escape out into the world, the harm caused would be beyond our imagination\u2026\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201dI carefully nodded.\u201cYou basically want to confirm if these devils are truly imprisoned by me.\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon, but that is correct\u2026.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThud!I snapped my finger.Then a skeleton came out. It was the one whose summon had not been dispelled yet. It stood tall between me and the Chief Holy Knight.Shocked, the Chief Holy Knight took a few steps back.\u201cA-, Oh holy Apostle. Why is this skeleton\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll clear your suspicions properly.\u201dI patted the Skeleton on the shoulder.\u201cOh Hundred Ghosts, regain your memories.\u201dWiggle!Wastewater rose up from the shadow of the skeleton. The wastewater, which had climbed up the white bones, was shaped in the form of the skeleton. It formed the muscle. It formed the flesh. It formed the clothes.In the blink of an eye, instead of the bony skeleton, a handsome man had appeared.\u201cUrghhhh! Wha-, what the! the fuck!?\u201dHe was a handsome guy with a dirty mouth.\u201cWhat the hell\u2026 Ugh, man, you son of a bitch! What kind of resentment did you have towards me that you put me in this state? Fuck me! What the hell did I even do?!\u201dA fiery glance.That\u2019s correct.I returned the memory of the Flame Emperor \u2018Yoo Soo-ha\u2019.\u201cYou crazy son of a bitch! I\u2019ll kill you! How dare you, you trash-like motherfucker! I\u2019ll fucking kick your ass no matter what happens!\u201d\u201cAs you can see.\u201dHolding on to Yoo Soo-ha\u2019s shoulder, I looked back at the commanding officers. Yoo Soo-ha tried to move his limbs, but it was useless. Because it was impossible for him to defy me no matter what he did, as I was his \u2018Master\u2019.\u201cThis man was also an evil man that was comparable to the witch.\u201dI had a bitter look on my face.\u201cNo, I can say that he was more evil than the witch. The witch was born a monster from the beginning, but this man was born a human, but he did all sorts of evil and terrible things. He burned anything that got in his way\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll kill you! I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201dThere was no need for further explanation.\u201c\u2014 Fuc-,\u2014\u2013! Hey! I\u2019ll tear you to shre\u2013,\u2014-!!\u201dSounds of curses resonated in the Acacia field. One of the Hundred Ghosts, \u201cYoo Soo-ha\u201d opened his mouth and spewed out all kinds of curses that could have existed in this world.As the swearing continued, the commanders\u2019 faces turned pale. Less than 60 seconds later, Yoo Soo-ha described as many as 15 ways to kill me. It was absurd.\u201cNo wait, fucking hell, and who the hell are these people! Hey, lizard! Pointy ears! What are you looking at? Do you guys want to be fucked up by me so\u2014\u2013.\u201dSixty more seconds later, he started cursing not just me, but everyone else that was here. A little later, he even cursed the parents and family of the people present. He then listed about 10 more methods of how he would kill all those people.\u201cSu-, such a disgusting\u2026\u2026! Such darkness\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe lizardman magician was shocked.\u201cI don\u2019t even have to use the Queen\u2019s jewel. That man, he really has the devil\u2019s soul!\u201d\u201cCertainly\u2026\u201dThe Elf Ranger Captain groaned.\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of foolish humans over the years, but\u2026 It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen such a disgusting and evil man\u2026.\u201dOooh.Rejoice, Yoo Soo-ha.Finally, your greatness was recognized, moreover, it happened in this world itself.-Hey zombie. Aren\u2019t you desecrating the dead?\u2018That\u2019s right.\u2019-Isn\u2019t that a little too much?\u201cEven if I did this, it was a cheap punishment for Yoo Soo-ha. Besides, Mr. Sword Emperor. You said I was the Zombie king. The Zombie King wants to bully a zombie-like bastard, is there anything wrong with that?\u2019-Ummm.Bae Hu-ryeong nodded agreeably.-After listening to you, you\u2019re actually right. Logically, I can\u2019t refute that\u2026.\u2018Right?\u2019-As expected, Zombie, your immorality is way beyond me.That was just his opinion.Thud!I snapped my finger once again.\u201cDance.\u201d\u201cWhat, Fuc-, what the\u2014-\u201dAs soon as I gave my orders, Yoo Soo-ha began tap dancing. Yoo Soo-ha\u2019s heels tapped merrily on the flowery path. Tack, tack tack! Yoo Soo-ha\u2019s dance was quite skillful as if he had his share of fun going to clubs back in his old days.\u201cNo, this, wai-, wait!? What is this? fuck\u2014\u201d\u201cContinue dancing.\u201dTack!Yoo Soo-ha\u2019s dance changed from tap dancing to Jitterbug. For better or worse, he had a talent for dancing. After he finished dancing Jitterbug, he immediately started to do the Kazatsky dance.[T/N: Jitterbug is like South Korea\u2019s twist on Tango.]\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you!\u201dYoo Soo-ha cried out as he danced the Kazatsky dance.\u201cKi-, I\u2019ll kill you! Son of a bitch! You, fucker, you! You dare, to me! I must!\u201dAs he was speaking, he kept on dancing the Kazatsky dance.As anyone present could see for themselves, what he said while dancing the Kazatsky dance was not scary at all, no matter how dirty or appalling the curses were.Even if Hitler came back to life and began talking, no one would take him seriously if he was dancing the Kazatsky dance.That\u2019s the power of the Kazatsky dance.\u201cFu-, fuck\u2026! Fuck, FUCK\u2026!\u201dCould Yoo Soo-ha also feel the power of the Kazatsky dance?Realizing that nothing worked, Yoo Soo-ha just kept cursing and saying fuck. And he enthusiastically focused on the dance steps. It was fantastic background music and a fantastic scene.\u201cMmmm.\u201dI looked at the Chief Holy Knight.\u201cAre you still worried?\u201dThe Chief Holy Knight opened but didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cThe devils can never disobey my orders. Rest assured.\u201dIn the end.The Chief Holy Knight gradually kneeled down.\u201cOh Apostle of the Goddess\u2026 May I ask for your name\u2026?\u201dHe had spoken in a quivering voice.Everyone from the Continent\u2019s army was looking at me.I accepted their stares with pride and folded my arms again.\u201cMy name is Gong-ja.\u201dThe Chief Holy Knight bowed his head.\u201cI will follow your orders, Gong-ja-nim\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe commander, who cried out and insisted till the end to burn the village, gave up the attack.Then.[Congratulations.]A pleasant voice was heard.[Normal Stage Clear.][Hidden Quest, \u2018Warrior of the Paused World\u2019 has been cleared!]There was also a voice that was unwelcoming.-Again, you crazy bastard!The voice\u2019s owner rolled around frustratingly.-Crazy bastard! You\u2019re probably the first one to clear a quest like this! No, it\u2019s definitely the first! Wow, where did this crazy dude crawl out from? Hey, I gotta admit it! Kim Gong-ja!\u2018What do you admit?\u2019-You are\u2026\u2026the Light of all idiots!It was an irrelevant opinion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 \u2013 Paradise After the End (1)Translator: WH Editor: Sasha1.-You crazy bastard!The Continent\u2019s army moved their troops back a little.In the meantime, Bae Hu-ryeong just laughed hysterically.-From now on, I\u2019ll call you Crazy Kim!\u2018Ahhh, for God\u2019s sake, please stop\u2026.\u2019I sighed inwardly.Do you know how many nicknames you\u2019ve already given me? Zombie Kim. Zombie King. Crazy Kim. If you keep this up, I\u2019m going to be able to fill up an A4 paper with just my nicknames.\u2019-Oh, that\u2019s pretty nice. Let\u2019s go! Dozens of nicknames for this crazy dude, let\u2019s gooooo!Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s loud laughter resonated throughout the skies.But fortunately, there were more people in this world than those who made fun of me.[Boss stage cleared.]It was the voice of the tower.The voice told me that I had successfully reached the 20th Stage rang inside my head. It was just like when I cleared the 10th Stage, the so-called \u2018Hellfire Residence\u2019.[The challenger(s) is Death King (\u6b7b\u738b).][1 person.]I looked up slowly.The blue sky spread out between the branches and the leaves of the Acacia flowers.[Calculating clear rewards.][Calculation complete.][ The rewards will be given 24 hours later, once you enter the 21st floor.]That\u2019s right.I smiled brightly.\u2018Well, Even if I was a crazy guy or something, what\u2019s the big deal? Anyways, I did my job.\u2019-What\u2019s this. Look at this guy\u2019s confidence?\u2018I cleared up to the 20th floor just the way I wanted.\u2019I won\u2019t let anyone die.That was the goal I had set in my mind.Looking back, how absurd was that desire?\u2018While I was clearing the 20th floor, not a single Hunter died.\u2019The Devil King of Fall Rain. Now that she was reduced to being a part of my Hundred Ghosts and entrapped in another world, the Hunters who doubted each other and started killing each other were now no more.I had interfered and stopped the starting point of the tragedy in advance.\u2018Not a single soldier from the Empire or Continent died.\u2019I fought for this world that got its time paused.\u2018And\u2026\u2019I raised my right hand and placed it on someone\u2019s head.\u2018I subdued this bastard too.\u2019Vengeful Ghost(\u98ef\u9b3c).The captive, imprisoned in my shadow, sat on the street and stared blankly at the Continent\u2019s army.Soldiers who had originally burned down her small hometown in the past.But today history had not been repeated. The moment the Chief Holy Knight knelt, the Continent army\u2019s hostility was repressed. Believing that I am the apostle of the Goddess, they gave up their mission.The paradise had been protected.\u2018These are just my thoughts, but.\u2019He patted the vengeful ghost\u2019s head gently.\u201cMaybe this 20th floor\u2026 If I had just sat by and did nothing, it would have probably been cleared by itself. I didn\u2019t really have to come forward.\u2019-Huh? Why?\u2018That\u2019s because the village burning and disappearing is also a kind of [Outcome].\u2019Ending.I realized that while going through the Stages so far. The tower was open to both a happy ending and a bad ending. As long as it was a proper outcome, the tower would accept any kind of ending.\u2018Otherwise, Yoo Soo-ha wouldn\u2019t have been able to reach the 40th Stage.\u2019Even if you shattered the dolls in the Hellfire Residence like the Flame Emperor.Or, were like me, playing with those kids for a while.Either way, both acts were recognized as a kind of [Outcome].\u2018Basically, this world was not set by the tower.\u2019I turned my head and looked at the village,\u2018It wasn\u2019t an ending I chose because I had no other choice.\u2019Where the wheat ripens yellow under the sky.Taciturn and stubborn, however, the kids were putting up a playful act, and the old man turned a blind eye to it, while he sat in front of the orchard and smoked in vain.A refuge for the sick, who had no way of recovering.\u2018But this is the ending I choose.\u2019Today.Rain didn\u2019t fall from the sky here.Fire didn\u2019t burn the ground here.-Sure enough\u2026But why?When I was filled with a proud feeling for some time, Bae Hu-ryeong had a subtle look on his face. He looked as if he was staring at a pitiful child.\u2018What\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019-Nothing. It\u2019s just you said this was the ending you chose.Bae Hu-ryeong pointed his finger furtively somewhere.-I wonder if that was also part of the ending you chose.Yoo Soo-ha was standing there.\u201cFuck! Fuck you, you son of a bitch! Are you not going to make this stop!? Huh!? Make it stop right now\u2014 Fuck! Why isn\u2019t this stopping!?\u201dTo be more specific, Yoo Soo-ha was still hopping around dancing the Kazatsky dance.The entrance of the rural village that had beautifully ripened crops. The sky was blue, and there were petals on the ground, in this picturesque landscape, there was a handsome man there swearing \u2018fuck\u2019 all alone.It was a masterpiece (\u540d\u4f5c) that would get tens of millions of views if posted on the Internet.\u2018Hmm? What\u2019s wrong with that?\u2019I tilted my head.\u2018Isn\u2019t it extraordinarily beautiful?\u2019-As expected, this guy is Crazy Kim\u2026\u2026Bae Hu-ryeong murmured.It was then.[Today.][The 20th floor Stage has been cleared.]A voice resonated throughout the sky and the ground.It wasn\u2019t a voice that only I could hear.[Announcing to everyone again.][Today, the 20th floor Stage has been cleared.]An official announcement.Perhaps the same voice was spreading throughout the entire area of the tower, as it did when the 10th Stage was cleared.\u201cAh.\u201dI licked my lips.\u2018What a shame.\u2019-What is?\u2018The Internet isn\u2019t working here.\u2019My smartphone was fast asleep in my backpack right now. Five days in the real world, but in terms of the time I\u2019ve actually spent, I haven\u2019t touched my cell phone for hundreds of days.The only region where the internet was connected was from the 1st floor to the 10th floor.\u2018By now, the Internet must be making a real fuss though\u2026\u2026\u2019-Huh? What\u2019s this? Do you not care about people\u2019s reactions anymore?\u2018When did I ever say that?\u2019-No. You told me. Didn\u2019t you want more recognition than a normal citizen, just like the Witch and Marcus grandpops?\u2018No wayyyy.\u2019I shrugged.Don\u2019t you know Da-da Ik-seon? I want to receive recognition from people like the Witch and the Sword Saint. I also want to be recognized by the general public. And I, myself do not want to be ashamed to look up at the heavens.\u2019[T/N: It basically means the more the better (\u591a\u591a\u76ca\u5584)]-Wow. Aren\u2019t you being a complete pig? Why do you have so much greed?\u201cOriginally, people feel alive when they have greed.\u2019Fortunately, I was able to soothe the disappointment of not being able to see the Internet.[24 hours from now, the 21st floor Stage will be open.][24\uff1a00\uff1a00]Shinggggg!The fireworks filled the sky just like last time. When the first firework burst aflame, a clock made of light appeared. Then two Hunters were transferred as if they had been waiting for the moment.\u201cDeath King!\u201dIt was the Witch and the Sword Saint.The witch flew at once using a teleport skill. Flash! The witch reached her elbow out and hugged my head as he shed her signature bright smile.\u201cCrazy! You\u2019re really crazy!\u201d\u201cAck. Aaaackkk! Wait a minute, Black Dragon Witch. It unexpectedly hurts\u2026\u201d\u201cThis coming from a little kid! Coming from a greenhorn that\u2019s not even thirty yet!\u201dI tried to resist but to no avail. Gwaaargh! The Witch\u2019s strength was so strong that I couldn\u2019t escape from the headlock.Oh my God. How many elixirs did she usually take to be this strong?\u201cI can\u2019t believe it! You really cleared everything all the way until the 20th floor in five days! Are you crazy? You\u2019re crazy right?\u201d\u201cExcuse me. Black Dragon Witch, please calm down a little bit\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much of an uproar there the tower is in right now! Look at this!\u201dThe Witch showed me something.It was a smartphone.It was a five-year-old model. On the phone screen that had a low battery indication, there were internet articles that were not supposed to be accessible here.\u201cThis is\u2026?\u201d\u201cI stopped by the first floor and took a picture!\u201dThe witch had a genuinely excited voice.\u201cThere were so many articles that it was impossible to record them all! Sorry! But Death King, you have to understand. It wasn\u2019t just within the tower, but even the world outside was in an uproar. I only captured articles with the most view clicks, but look. There\u2019s already so much!\u201dThe witch swiped down her phone\u2019s screen.There were article headlines that showed.-[Breaking News] Skilful and smooth speed! The 14th floor was also cleared![T/N: The original text stated Gwe-do nan-ma (\u5feb\u5200\uf91b\u9ebb)\u2019s speed. It basically means handling something in a row without any difficulties.]-It\u2019s decided that his Sacred Nickname is the Death King.-Official announcement by the Black Dragon Guild. Currently, the raid team has three players.-Was the leader the Sword Saint? The Witch? The Death King?-[Special Coverage] Intensive Report on Death King.\u2022\u2022\u2022There was a lot.Just reading the headlines only, it was impossible to read them all because there were too many.\u201cEven though the title went like this.\u201dThe Witch laughed.\u201cThe articles were all only talking about you!\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cIt starts with what kind of life you lived before this, to where you actually came from. How did you come to the tower, and how did you get to the top of the ranks at once. It\u2019s really all just about\u2013.\u201d\u201cHol-, hold on.\u201dI was puzzled.I wasn\u2019t perplexed by the newspaper articles. This reaction was natural. In the past five days, even on the internet bulletin/forum, it was pinned hundred and thousands of times.It was something that I had experienced once.Instead, the reason why I\u2019m puzzled was nothing but\u2026\u2026\u201cDid you capture all of this yourself?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe Witch nodded.As I wasn\u2019t released from the headlock yet, her face was a little close.\u201cOf course!\u201d\u201cWas it to show me?\u201d\u201cThis kid. Then would there be any other reason?\u201d\u201cUmmm. So\u2026.\u201dAs I scrunched the middle of my forehead, I said.\u201cJust to show me what kind of articles were released, you purposely teleported to the 1st floor and looked for each and every one of the articles, and then took a screenshot of every single one of them\u2026 Is that right?\u201d\u201cIf I had to put it in words, then yes, that\u2019s right!\u201dI pictured it in my mind.Ranked second among the Hunters. Head commander of the biggest guild within the tower.Such a high-ranking person quickly went to the 1st floor, and diligently used her smartphone to take a screenshot of everything, then came back here again and showed off her screenshots as if she was boasting about it.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dNow that I think about it, it was somewhat of a cute scenario. But I still didn\u2019t understand.\u201cWhy would someone like the Black Dragon Witch go through such a bothersome\u2026?\u201d\u201cSeriously, what is this guy talking about?\u201dThe Witch giggled brightly.\u201cOf course it was because I wanted to do something for you!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, just in case, don\u2019t read the article comments later on. It\u2019s all about frame and fraud. The comments section has just been terrorized by a bunch of jealous humans.\u201dThe witch let out a short sigh.\u201cI don\u2019t know why those good-for-nothings always do that. What an amazing thing it was that the death count was zero! Death King. Don\u2019t pay heed to any of them. From now on, the Black Dragon guild will take full charge of the media.\u201dWhat\u2019s this? This person?Is she perhaps an angel?-Hey Zombie. Really now, if someone is just a little bit nicer to you, you revere them as angels\u2026No matter how pitiful your life was, you have to be open to the goodwill of humans. A man that\u2019s so strong against malice shouldn\u2019t be this weak against good-will.If she was not an angel, then maybe she was a Goddess?-You\u2019re a crazy dude\u2026Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s face crumpled.-Although I knew this bastard was going to be crazy one day. You\u2019ve finally gone crazy now.\u2018Then why don\u2019t you praise me a little bit sometimes. Do you know how hungry I am for praises? You don\u2019t know how precious the tiniest bit of attention is for me in this dreary daily life, do you?\u2019-No. That sort of thing\u2026 It\u2019d leave a bad taste\u2026 I\u2019d rather not have become a spirit.Bae Hu-ryeong really went \u2018ugh yuck\u2019 and retched.I wonder who is the psychopath here.I bet my whole fortune that this man didn\u2019t have a single friend when he was alive.-Hey! What kind of dogshit are you saying! I have friends too okay!?\u2018Excluding the Sword Saint.\u2019-\u2026\u2026Bae Hu-ryeong averted his gaze. It was my silent victory.I don\u2019t know what that victory was for though.\u201cAlso, look at this!\u201dOnly then did the Witch release me from her headlock.What the Witch was trying to show me this time was not a phone screen. The Black Dragon Witch loosened and tilted her small backpack, then took out a thick bundle of newspapers.\u201cHere you go!\u201dThe Witch spread the newspaper wide.\u201cIt was the first newspaper that came out yesterday!\u201dI couldn\u2019t understand the contents of the newspaper at first glance.However, the list, which was written in capitals, was the first thing I saw.Above the list was the title [Updated Hunter Ranking!]+Rank 1: Sword SaintRank 2: Black Dragon WitchRank 3: Death KingRank 4: CountRank 5: Heretic QuestionerRank 6: Venomous SnakeRank 7: Babel\u2019s LinguistRank 8: Kwangyeok MessengerRank 9: Crusader+\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI was lost at words for a while.While I was alone in a prison of time, fighting the Devil King.I only realized now about what was happening in the world below the 12th floor.\u201cThis kind of thing happening is the first of its kind since the tower opened!\u201dThe Witch laughed.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you climbed all the way up here in one shot from outside the rankings!\u201dThird in ranking.Just like a Hunter\u2019s nickname, the ranking was also decided by the tower.The ranking that was established this way was displayed on a monument erected in the first-floor plaza.\u201cI know it doesn\u2019t feel real yet, but\u2026 Try going down to Babylon today. You\u2019ll know right away what kind of person you\u2019ve become.\u201dBam!The Witch rolled the newspaper and smacked my shoulder.\u201cCongratulations, Death King!\u201dThat\u2019s right.\u201cYou are now also a representative of all Hunters!\u201dThe world changed in just five days.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 \u2013 Paradise After the End (2)Translator: WH Editor: Sasha\u201cFrom now on, you also have to consider your actions a little more!\u201dSaid the Witch.She kept whacking me on the forearm with the rolled-up newspapers. Thud! Thud! She was so excited that she couldn\u2019t control herself.\u201cMy actions?\u201d\u201cMmmhmm. Now you\u2019re in all of the top 5 guilds. But in actual fact, you\u2019re no different from a solo Hunter. Now that things have worked out so well, it\u2019s also good for you to create a new guild for yourself.\u201dThe Witch laughed merrily.\u201cSince you\u2019re the 3rd rank Hunter, you should have the title of \u2018Guild Master\u2019. Even if you joined all the top 5 guilds, it doesn\u2019t suit you if you\u2019re just a regular member.\u201dIt didn\u2019t feel real.\u201cBeing a Guild Master.\u201dMe, being the leader of a guild. Not only did it feel unreal, but it was also unimaginable. In the first place, was it even necessary to have Hunters under my wing?I already have an army of skeletons.\u201cYes.\u201dRealizing that my complexion didn\u2019t look very good, the Witch shrugged. Past her shoulder, the Sword Emperor stared silently at me.\u201cYou may be similar to that grandpops, your personality might suit solo-playing more. There are unexpectedly quite a lot of people whose romance is to destroy everything the Dok-go Da-I (\u7368\u56fa\u591a\u7570) way. If you don\u2019t have any thoughts of doing it, I won\u2019t force you.\u201d[T/N: Dok-go Da-I is a Korean idiom that means to do everything you want to do, or doing everything your way.]\u201cOh ho, are you talking about me behind my back now?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s that\u2026.\u201dThe witch turned her head, ignoring the Sword Saint.\u201cWhat are those?\u201dOn the other side of the Acacia field.On the small plain, the Continent\u2019s soldiers were building something. It was a barracks. They gave up attacking the paradise of the vengeful ghost, and in return, they would take a day off today and withdraw their troops afterwards.\u201cAhhh.\u201dI stroked my chin.\u201cThese soldiers gathered from all over the Continent.\u201d\u201cFrom all over the Continent?\u201d\u201cTo give you some context\u2026.\u201dI continued explaining. Of course, the story of the vengeful ghost was omitted. I only spoke about how I deceived the Continent\u2019s army.The Witch and the Sword Saint heard the story together, and as the explanation continued, their expressions became weird. A word from the Witch represented the two Hunter\u2019s thoughts.\u201cDeath King\u2026 I see that you have pretty good senses when it comes to lying.\u201d\u201cWell, thanks to you, the stage was cleared without shedding any blood.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not blaming you. On the contrary, you did really well.\u201dThe Witch\u2019s gaze sharpened.It was the look of a merchant who came up with an insidious plan.\u201cThis means from now on, we can trade here on the continent. We don\u2019t have to grovel anymore to the old guys in the outside world. Those bad guys! They always lower the prices using their source of food. We\u2019ll see if they can do that in the future.\u201dResentment was flowing from her voice.\u201cBasically, the trade between the tower and the outside world was unfair.\u201dSaid the Sword Saint.\u201cCapital, resources, technology. Whatever it was, the outside world has richer resources as compared to the tower. Of course, some elixirs and materials in the tower can\u2019t be obtained from the outside world either.\u201d\u201cFood provisions! Food is always a problem!\u201dThe witch stamped on the ground.When I first saw her, I thought she was an unfriendly person. Is it because the three of us broke through the 12th to 19th floors together? She expressed her feelings colourfully in front of us.That meant we had become that much closer.\u201cAnyways, Black Dragon Witch, you mean to say you\u2019re going to start trading with the people of the Continent?\u201d\u201cHmm? Of course. The outside world needs to know what bitterness tastes like too.\u201d\u201cThen.\u201dI grinned.Then I pointed to the military camp that was set up on the plains.\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to talk to them from now onwards. If you just say \u2018Let\u2019s trade\u2019, it\u2019s not gonna work. To the people of the Continent, we are strangers, and for us, they are other-worlders.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll lend you my name.\u201dI said.\u201cI am the emissary of the Founding Emperor and an Apostle of the Goddess in this world. If you make it look like you are also an Apostle sent by the Goddess, at the very least it will be useful for you to start trading with them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe witch\u2019s gaze sharpened again.\u201cIt\u2019s an offer I\u2019d be thankful for. It\u2019s also an effective move. But you are definitely not gonna lend me your name for free, so\u2026 What do you want?\u201d\u201cThe 20th floor.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI looked around.Acacia fields. A small plain. The hometown of Estelle.This little world was all that was on the 20th floor.\u201cI want the 20th floor.\u201dFor a moment the Witch was at a loss for words.\u201c\u2026Hold on. What do you mean by the 20th floor? Don\u2019t tell me you want to have the whole 20th floor to yourself?\u201d\u201cYes. To be exact, I want to possess all the land that is on the 20th floor.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cInstead, I won\u2019t accept anything for clearing the 11th and 19th floors. You can share the benefits of trading with the Continent with the other Hunters.\u201dAgain, the Witch\u2019s lips were shut tight.It was an unprecedented offer.Usually, when Hunters raid the stage, the participants would first share their achievements among themselves. The ownership of an item. And furthermore, the ownership of resources. But about half of the rights were left to be shared by all other Hunters.It was unprecedented for someone to have the whole [One Floor].\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026not something I can take care of on my own.\u201dThe Witch had a perplexed expression.\u201cWe need to call in the other guild masters to discuss about it.\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have anything to do for the next 24 hours, so I\u2019ll wait.\u201d\u201c\u2026You really want the whole stage here to yourself?\u201dThe Witch glanced around.\u201cThis land, it doesn\u2019t seem very valuable at all. The Acacia flower path\u2026is pretty, but there\u2019s not enough land to farm. And the size of the stage is also small.\u201d\u201cWell.\u201d\u201cBased on my experience, Death King. In such cases, it is much more profitable to receive the distributed rewards from the 11th to 20th floors that have been cleared. You\u2019ll be able to earn a fortune.\u201dI laughed.\u201cI prefer real estate to money. Land is the best.\u201d\u201cCall?\u201d[T/N: Call is like a Korean slang for agreeing to something, e.g. going out for drinks or whatnot.]The Witch sighed.\u201cI\u2019ll gather the guild masters. Let\u2019s discuss it on the 1st floor.\u201d\u201cOkay then.\u201d\u201cMmmhmm. You have to show your face to the people at least once anyway. But\u2026\u201dThe Witch slowly glanced around.\u201cThere is something I wanted to ask you since before.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026What the hell is that?\u201dI looked at the direction the Witch pointed at.\u201cFu-,ck\u2026 Black\u2026 fucker, this, stop\u2026Make it stop! Is it such a difficult request?! Fuck! What kind of grudge do you have against me, what did I do wrong\u2026??!!\u201dA top dancer was showing off his skills there.The dancer\u2019s sweat and tears flowed down the Acacia fields beautifully.It was beautiful.\u201cBlack Dragon Witch.\u201dI smiled brightly.\u201cBlack Dragon Witch, you didn\u2019t see anything today.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t see anything today. You know what to do right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Witch had a curious look on her face.She had the same face as a biologist who had encountered the mysteries of a lifetime.\u201cThat\u2019s right. There are all kinds of people in the world. I understand.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d the witch murmured.\u201cAs expected, you\u2019re also out of your mind\u2026.\u201dIt was also an irrelevant opinion.2.I left the vengeful ghost and the Flame Emperor on the 20th floor, and transferred to the 1st floor with the Hunters.\u201cIs it okay for the meeting place to be held at the coffee shop we went to last time?\u201d\u201cYes. I don\u2019t mind.\u201dIt\u2019s been a long time since I came back to the city on the 1st floor. Babylon.To others, it may seem like I returned after only five days, but that wasn\u2019t the case for me.Literally hundreds of days. It was the first time in years that I had returned to the city.\u201cHaaaaihhh.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNothing. I\u2019m coming to realization now, that I\u2019ve cleared the stage.\u201dThe Witch giggled.\u201cI\u2019m not sure. You probably need to comprehend it a little more.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI told you. In the tower right now, you\u2019re the only thing everyone\u2019s talking about. Brace yourself.\u201dThere was no need to ask what kind of preparation he had to do.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIs that perhaps\u2026?\u201dNot long after I stepped on the first floor transfer gate, the surrounding area began to buzz noisily.Passers-by on the street. Street vendors who set up stalls by the side of the road. Hunters, who were just getting ready to leave to go hunting, all whispered one after another.\u201cIsn\u2019t that the Witch and the Sword Saint.\u201d\u201cThen that guy is\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Death King!\u201dSomeone shouted. That was just the start.\u201cThe Death King appeared!\u201dA customer who was carefully looking at the used weapons at the stall turned his head. A couple who were enjoying coffee at an outdoor caf\u00e9 stood up. Merchants selling rare flowers, Hunters chatting with their colleagues, dozens, hundreds, all at once, looked this way. My way.A crowd flocked together in an instant.\u201cUwaaahh, wow\u2014\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a rumor that you cleared the 20th floor by yourself, is that true?\u201d\u201cLook here please! Wait please! Here here!\u201dChatter chatter.I didn\u2019t even have time to cope with anything. Just, I blinked my eyes once and people already surrounded our party. That wasn\u2019t the end. When I blinked twice, the encirclement doubled in size.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say anything.\u201dThe Witch whispered softly with a voice that only I could hear.\u201cYou haven\u2019t had any experiences dealing with the press, have you?\u201d\u201cYes, well. Of course.\u201d\u201cMysticism? Popular star?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m talking about the concept. Do you want a mysterious concept or a popular star concept?\u201dThe crowd tripled while the Witch was whispering. Our party\u2019s pace seemed to have slowed down by 30 times. Snap! Snap! Every step of the way, cell phone cameras continuously flashed.Oh my God.It felt like I was out of my mind!\u201cOnce a concept is set, it\u2019s hard to change it. You need to give me an answer now.\u201d\u201cUh. I know what the mysterious concept means, but what\u2019s a popular star concept?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s similar to a movie star.\u201dSaid the Witch.\u201cFirst of all, you need to make a new SNS account. You need to have a secretary for image management and a secretary that deals with the media. Of course, you should also hire someone who takes care of your looks and fashion. Oh, don\u2019t worry about the money. The Black Dragon guild will take care of that.\u201dI lost my mind even more.Next to us, the Sword Saint was frowning.He muttered a few words.\u201cI hate dealing with this bullshit, so I\u2019ll go on my own.\u201dIt sounded reasonable.\u201cI\u2019d like to have a mysterious concept\u2026.\u201d\u201cAre you sure? A person changes when they receives some maintenance. It\u2019s natural to be much more handsome than now, and you\u2019ll realize some new ways of dealing with other humans.\u201dFor example in the case of the Heretic Questioner, he\u2019s a magazine model and he probably also does personal photo shoots?\u201dI too knew that well.Before returning back to 4000 days, didn\u2019t I used to collect those magazines and pictorials? Even the Black Dragon Witch right in front of me was a regular model for magazine covers.\u201cNo, mysticism! I want to have a mysterious concept.\u201dHowever, if I was the one involved, it\u2019d be a different story.\u201cWhy? You don\u2019t want to shoot a pictorial?\u201dWas I shot in the head to be like that?!\u201cI\u2019ll die of embarrassment.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re all shy at first. No wait, the Heretic Questioner didn\u2019t know what shame was even when he first started\u2026 He\u2019s an exception. Death King, if we\u2019re talking about embarrassing things, when you went up the Pavilion at the Aegim Empire and shouted, that was even more\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m leaving the top five guilds if it\u2019s not mysticism.\u201dI meant it whole-heartedly.The Witch lightly laughed.\u201cYes. I suppose you\u2019ll do that. You look like you\u2019d really do it.\u201d\u201cWhat should I do about the mysterious concept?\u201d\u201cSimple. You just need to have a good poker face.\u201dThis was the first time in my life ever that I heard somebody advising me ,saying \u2018Keep a good poker face\u2019.\u201cSNS activities are absolutely forbidden. No magazines or broadcast. Even if a personal broadcast streamer or media company asks for an interview, refuse it. It\u2019s okay to have an interview about twice a year. I\u2019ll only send you reporters that I have verified in advance.\u201dHmmm.\u201c\u2026That\u2019s all?\u201d\u201cYou still don\u2019t know how difficult that will be.\u201dThe Witch giggled.\u201cAttention is a drug. The most addictive sort of drug.\u201dThe Sword Saint stepped in after she said that.\u201cIt\u2019s also a drug that thoroughly destroys people the most.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. If just 10 people paid attention to someone, that person would feel happy. But when you reach this spot, even if you say a few words, dozens and hundreds of people will react to it. There aren\u2019t really a lot of people who can resist this sort of drug.\u201dAn even bigger crowd gathered.It was as if the population of the whole city gathered here.\u201cIt\u2019s all for naught.\u201dThat\u2019s what the Sword Saint said.\u201cYeah. But it sure is a pleasant piece of crap.\u201dThe Witch replied.\u201cMaybe knowing how to enjoy this kind of drug is also a famous person\u2019s accomplishment. Until they get tired of the drug. Or you could choose to hang in there until you\u2019re disillusioned with your companions who take the same drug. What do you want to do, Death King?\u201dI looked around me.A curtain of people.It was packed with people, leaving no gaps. The camera flashes went off constantly, so I had to squint. The continuous flashes were eye-blinding, and felt like a mirage, and the curtain of people looked almost like a shadow.\u201c\u2026No one would be as hung up on others as I was.\u201dI opened my mouth.\u201cWhat I want to get is recognition. And although I don\u2019t really know\u2026 I think receiving attention and recognition is a little different.\u201dI thought of the Flame Emperor.Before returning 4000 times, he was the supreme being that hogged the limelight of the tower.\u201cI don\u2019t need the attention of millions of people. Just the attention of people around me is enough. Hundreds of thousands or millions, what I want from the people of the world is\u2026 It\u2019s not attention, it\u2019s recognition.\u201d\u201cAlright then.\u201dThe Witch smiled.\u201cI think they\u2019re not that different. But if that\u2019s your answer, I\u2019ll respect it.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re such a person.\u201dI had heard something like that before too.\u201cSo how do you make a good poker face?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll teach you the secret.\u201dThe sound of the crowd burst from every direction.Shortly, the speed of our party dropped to about 10 centimeters per second.\u201cThis really reminds me of a bad memory.\u201d\u201cA bad memory?\u201d\u201cYes. In my case, when I was in the outside world, my father died in a civil war.\u201dThe Witch said calmly.\u201cIt was when I was seven. I was running away with my parents, and the soldiers probably came after us. My father stayed behind. Then, my father shouted, \u2018Don\u2019t look back and run quickly\u2019. But\u2026\u201dThe witch led the way through the crowd.\u201cI really ran without looking back. I heard a gunshot, but I didn\u2019t turn around. I kept running.\u201dSnap! Snap!The camera\u2019s flashes didn\u2019t stop.\u201cIt happened when you were young right.\u201d\u201cIt happened when I was young.\u201dThe witch murmured.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I hated the fact that I ran away. I was a kid. But, why didn\u2019t I look back? It would have been an easy thing to do. It was just looking.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cI think of those times when I have to put on a poker face. When I recall the memory of my heart beating fast, I can put up a really good poker face. It\u2019s like a little magic trick of my own.\u201dThe Witch looked at me.\u201cYou have one or two such memories, don\u2019t you?\u201dI did.A dark alley.I recalled the memory of when the Flame Emperor gripped my head and burned my whole body.\u201cI suppose so.\u201dI could tell even without looking in the mirror.That I was putting up a perfect poker face.\u201cPlease look here for a while!\u201d\u201cPlease say something, anything!\u201d\u201cBlack Dragon Witch, when can I hear the official announcement\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat kind of relationship do the two of you have?!\u201d\u201cSword Saint-nim! What do you think of Death King?!\u201dWhen I looked around again, before I knew it, I got used to the camera flashes, so I could see my surroundings better. I had never been surrounded by such a large crowd before. It was also the first time that I faced a shower of flashes like this.But.\u201cIt\u2019s immediately effective though?\u201dI wasn\u2019t as out of mind as before.It was just my usual calmness.The Witch lifted the corners of her mouth slightly.\u201cYou\u2019re a fast learner huh. You\u2019ll get used to it soon.\u201dThe world clearly changed in 5 days.But it wasn\u2019t to a level where I had to change with it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 \u2013 Paradise After the End (3)Translator: WH Editor: Sasha3.We got through the crowd and finally managed to reach the caf\u00e9.At the caf\u00e9, there were people with anticipating faces waiting for me.\u201cHahaha, welcome!\u201dHeretic Questioner. The guild master of the Ten Thousand Temple shook my right arm.\u201cI never thought you\u2019d actually clear the 20th floor in just five days! It\u2019s the greatest feat that\u2019s ever happened since the tower was built. I sincerely respect you, Hunter Kim Gong-ja! No. We\u2019ll have to call you Death King from now on!\u201d\u201cRight now, I still doubt whether this is a dream or not, but\u2026\u201dCrusader sipped her iced coffee.\u201cHonestly, I thought that you three, Black Dragon Witch, Sword Saint, and you, would fail the raid and die. But you even cleared the 20th floor by yourself? Amazing. If you have a secret know-how, please let us know.\u201d\u201cWhat secret?\u201dI sat on one side of the table.\u201cYou just need to lead a good life though?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s very practical advice.\u201dCrusader smiled bitterly.\u201cAnyways, it\u2019s nice to see you after such a long time. Everyone. How have you been?\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s only been five days since the last time we met.\u201dPuff. Holding a pipe, Count smoked some tobacco.\u201cAt first, we stayed in the throne room just like we promised. A promise was a promise. But after a while, all of a sudden, the Empire\u2019s NPCs started moving around. It took us by surprise!\u201d[T/N: Originally called Reception room.]\u201cAh.\u201dIt was when I defeated the Devil King on the 12th floor.I defeated the Devil King and received a quest. It was then that the time that had been stopped began to flow again.\u201cI didn\u2019t think that far. How\u2019d it go?\u201d\u201cThe NPCs of the Empire thought we were intruders who invaded the Imperial Palace!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner tottered.\u201cSomeone in fancy clothes yelled, \u2018Catch those intruders!\u2019. Then the Knights of the Empire and the elite soldiers came to catch us. My my my, it sent a shiver down our spines!\u201d\u201cBut this kid had a lot of tricks.\u201dVenomous Snake, guild master of Chen Mu-mun.A one-eyed Hunter ruffled Heretic Questioner\u2019s head.\u201cFirst, we obediently surrendered and then we escaped from prison. Was what I meant. For real now.\u201d\u201cAha ha ha! Wasn\u2019t it fun? How could we have known that such a secret passage was hidden in the underground prison! It felt like I went back to my childhood days!\u201d\u201cHmmm? I heard you were caught by a Bulgarian mafia when you were a kid.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dHeretic Questioner giggled innocently.\u201cThat\u2019s why I recalled the fun times from my childhood. Prison! Underground! Escape! Ahhh, these were all \u2018decorations\u2019 that brightened my childhood beautifully! Everything has become a nostalgic memory for me now.\u201d\u201cCrazy bastard\u2026\u201dVenomous Snake sighed deeply.While I was working hard to hack up the Devil King\u2019s minions, the guild master\u2019s party seemed to have been pretty active as well.\u201cUhuh. I know all too well that we all had a wonderful life out there in the outside world.\u201dThe witch shrugged and sat down at the table.\u201cThe Count was born in a slum village in India. Venomous Snake, your parents were gang leaders. Crusader had suffered some hardships in Venezuela.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo we were all garbage when we were in the outside world. Don\u2019t you all agree?\u201dThe mood at the cafe instantly turned gloomyOnly the sound of Crusader sipping her coffee flowed quietly.\u201c\u2026That\u2019s not something we should talk about here.\u201dCrusader quietly glanced over at me.\u201cDo you mean to treat Death King as a member of [Us] now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSaid the Witch.\u201cYou guys probably don\u2019t know, but Death King had made a decisive contribution to clearing the tower.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s something we also know.\u201d\u201cNo. You all don\u2019t know.\u201dThe Witch shook her head.\u201cIn the raid this time, we didn\u2019t have a single casualty. Even on the 11th floor, where a lot of Hunters participated together. This was all thanks to Death King who taught me the strategies and tactics to clearing the floors.\u201dAll the Hunter\u2019s eyes were on me.Yes.\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cI.\u201dThe Witch opened her mouth.\u201cThis man, I want to make him the hero who represents our tower.\u201dSilence hung over the cafe.The Witch looked at the Hunters that were sitting around the table one by one.\u201cCount. You disclosed too much of your wealth.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true, I can\u2019t say otherwise.\u201d\u201cHeretic Questioner. You\u2019ve killed too many people.\u201d\u201cYes! It was a necessary sacrifice!\u201d\u201cCrusader. You don\u2019t like receiving attention from other people at all.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just how my character is.\u201d\u201cAnd Venomous Snake. You\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh? What?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re too ugly.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dVenomous Snake pouted. A dejected expression. But he soon bowed his head.It was a portrait of a sorrowful middle-aged man.\u201cSword Saint, as we all know, is an old man that is only crazy for the sword.\u201d\u201cMmhmmm.\u201d\u201cAnd me, I have to constantly act behind the scenes so it can\u2019t be me.\u201dAfter looking at those sitting at the table one by one, the Witch finally looked back at me.\u201cOn the other hand, Death King doesn\u2019t have any impression on the public yet. If we try hard enough, we can make it so that he becomes a perfect hero however much we want. This is an opportunity. An opportunity to revamp the tower\u2019s previous image.\u201d\u201cWould that really be the case?\u201dHeretic Questioner stroked his chin.\u201cWe\u2019re all people that have been around for a long time, so it\u2019s true our presence has grown a little weaker! We\u2019ve continued to print out magazines that contain updates on the activities of Hunters, but in the outside world, the sales volume is steadily decreasing!\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s what I mean.\u201d\u201cThen we\u2019ll have to start \u2018making\u2019 our image from today onwards!\u201dHeretic Questioner stood up.And just like a puppy, he began to circle around me.\u201cHmm. You\u2019re a little short. But that\u2019s fine! As you can see from my example, the photos will be able to cover all that!\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201dNo. Wasn\u2019t he just emphasizing that his height was his charming point?There was a big smile on the short Hunter\u2019s small face.\u201c[A short but passionate man, Death King]. If you use a catchphrase like this, it\u2019ll work!\u201dWithout having the chance to say anything, the Hunters gathered around me.Witch. Count. Venomous Snake. Crusader.Regardless of which guild they were from, all of them came close to me, and carefully examined my whole body.\u201cI\u2019m asking just in case, but are you seeing anyone now?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 No, I\u2019m not.\u201d\u201cWhat about since you entered the tower? Any ex-lovers?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d\u201cThat means, there\u2019s no need to worry about a scandal. This is the best!\u201dI didn\u2019t know what was best about it.The top-ranking Hunters began to chatter among themselves.\u201cI\u2019ve been watching him from the side, but this man, when he smiles, he gives off a cunning impression. So I\u2019m thinking of going ahead with the mysticism concept. Anything else, wouldn\u2019t matter since he would just have to put up a good poker face.\u201d\u201cBut we\u2019re in a pinch, he has never dated anyone before.\u201dSaid the Crusader.\u201cWe need to create a scandal that doesn\u2019t exist here. Otherwise, the people out there are just going to spread false rumors\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo worries. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d\u201cOhhh! Will it be a scenario where love blossomed as you stood side by side fighting together for five days? Hahaha, I like it! I can make a story that people would definitely dig!\u201d\u201cWhat about a scenario where he donated the majority of the money he earned so far to an orphanage? In case something like this might happen, I made regular donations anonymously(\u7121\u540d). Let\u2019s just say the donations were actually from Death King.\u201d\u201cMmhmm. I\u2019ll leave it to you, Count.\u201dWhat\u2019s this?What\u2019s going on here?\u201cFor starters, let\u2019s call a photographer! Let\u2019s take some pictures!\u201dHeretic Questioner smiled brightly.\u201cCall all the designers, too. We\u2019re going to have to at least give a picture to the press by the end of the day anyway. We\u2019ve already taken a video of the battle on the 11th floor, so we\u2019ll upload it on the internet when the right time comes!\u201dNo.Wait.\u201cHey, guys\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dThe Witch stopped me and smiled.It was a smile that told me about her numerous profound experiences.\u201cDeath King. You won\u2019t have to do anything. We\u2019ll take care of everything. You\u2026 that\u2019s right. You just have to do what you\u2019ve always done till now.\u201d\u201cNo, you said it was a mysticism concept. I thought we didn\u2019t need someone like a designer?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just today, please.\u201dThe Witch gently put her hands together.\u201cEveryone in the world wants to know about you. One picture. Let\u2019s just take one picture and show it to the people. Huh? Don\u2019t worry, Death King. The designers who signed an exclusive contract with us are amazing.\u201dI came to a realization 30 minutes later, that it was never going to be just one picture.\u201cLook here!\u201dSnap!Up to ten designers came and dressed me up. They styled my hair. Whenever I was dressed and my hair was styled, the photographer\u2019s camera flashes started to go off.\u201cYes, that\u2019s good. This time, hold the dagger! Like a wolf in a thicket waiting to hunt its prey!\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 wait\u2026.\u201d\u201cVery good!\u201dSnap!The Hunters huddled behind the photographer. They whispered as they examined my pose with hawk-like gazes.\u201cDressing up in a suit unexpectedly fits him well.\u201d\u201cMaybe we should go with a somewhat playful vibe.\u201d\u201cNo can do! Because the playful concept is mine first!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. Then what should we\u2026 Then how about a flaming youth with an adventurous spirit?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go with that.\u201dSnap!\u201cVery good!\u201dVery good, my ass.-Poohahahahahahha! Pooha, poohahaa! Keuhahahahahahhahah!!Bae Hu-ryeong was rolling about in the air since a while ago.1 hour passed, and then 2 hours went by, but the photo shoot didn\u2019t seem like it would end anytime soon, so my patience reached a limit.\u201cI\u2019m not doing it! Let\u2019s stop all this!\u201dI stripped off the suit I was wearing and threw it on the floor.\u201cHunters just have to climb the tower diligently! What media image?! What photoshoot?! Because all these useless things are always on your mind, for several years, the lot of you couldn\u2019t even clear the 10th floor!\u201dSilence.Did my heartfelt words work? The air became awkward. All the Hunters, including the Witch, stared at my face.And nodded.\u201c\u2026Wasn\u2019t that a pretty good speech?\u201d\u201cMmhmm. It felt like you really are a flaming youth with an adventurous spirit!\u201d\u201cThe headline of this time\u2019s magazine will be [The Hunter Who Climbed the Tower].\u201d\u201cWe also had that passion in our twenties\u2026.\u201dIt didn\u2019t work at all.\u201cAhhh, no thanks! I came here to talk about the 20th floor. I\u2019ll give you all the rights from the 10th to the 19th floor, so make sure the 20th floor is mine!\u201dThe Hunters nodded again.\u201cI like your greedless concept, too.\u201d\u201cHow about this for tomorrow\u2019s newspaper headline? [Death King, Shocking Announcement. Declares to distribute the rights of the 10th to 19th floors to all the other Hunters. Declares that he\u2019s satisfied with being able to clear the tower.]\u201cAgreed!\u201d\u201cIt will be appropriate to write an article on the second page like this, [Death King, known to have regularly donated to an orphanage].\u201d\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s just say that we\u2019re giving him the 20th floor as a sign of gratitude and respect to Death King.\u201d\u201cPerfect! Ahhh, what a beautiful finish!\u201dWrong.They didn\u2019t listen to a single thing I said.These people were too preoccupied right now by the idea of making me a hero.\u201cJust give up, young man.\u201dThe Sword Saint spoke bluntly.The old swordsman stood with his back against the pillar of the building.\u201cThe same thing happened when I was ranked number 1. Something like being old would make a favourable impression on the world, and asking me to grow my beard differently. I heard all sorts of things then.\u201dOh my God.\u201cThis was what they wanted to show the outside world. [We\u2019re living an honorable life too] It\u2019s kind of an inferiority complex.\u201dThe old man murmured.\u201cThey abandoned everything in the outside world and came to the tower anyway. What\u2019s so pathetic about it\u2026.\u201dThe Sword Saint stepped away.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIf you stay here, it\u2019ll be endless. After you finish the photo shoot, they\u2019ll tell you to take a video and then after that, they\u2019ll tell you to prepare for a press conference. They\u2019re that kind of people. If you don\u2019t run away now, the whole day will go by just like that.\u201dIt sounded horrible.Without the need to even think about it, I said.\u201cLet\u2019s run away quickly!\u201d\u201cGood decision.\u201dFocusing aura on the tip of our toes, we ran. A cry could be heard from behind us, \u201cAhhh!\u201d but we didn\u2019t stop.\u201cDeath King!\u201dCried the Witch.\u201cI\u2019m holding a press conference tomorrow, so come back in the morning if you can! You shouldn\u2019t be seen by others, so go around secretly! Even if you want to run away, get on the roof and run! Be careful!\u201dBae Hu-ryeong laughed hysterically.-Hey. That person isn\u2019t an angel, nor is she a Goddess. Isn\u2019t she more like a mom?That really was the case.And I didn\u2019t even know what kind of existence a Mother was.4.Before I knew it, the sun had set.Following what the Witch advised us, we went towards the roof and ran. Looking down from above, there were still hundreds of people crowding in front of the cafe. A swarm of reporters from the broadcasting station was there too.\u2018We could\u2019ve been in trouble if we went out from the front door!\u2019We skipped through the crimson-colored roof.The place we stopped at, was the bell tower built in the square.The guard who was guarding the bell tower and fiddling with a smartphone recognized us belatedly.\u201cHukkk! Swo-, Sword Saint-nim!\u201d\u201cMmmhmm.\u201dThe Sword Saint landed at the bell tower easily.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but can you excuse us for a moment?\u201d\u201cAhhh. It\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cFive minutes is enough.\u201dThe young guard was flustered. He must\u2019ve been taken aback when a living legend asked him to excuse himself. Then our eyes met, and the guard\u2019s eyes opened wide.\u201cAre you perhaps the Death King!?\u201d\u201cAh. Yes.\u201d\u201cUwaaa. Woww! It\u2019s my first time seeing you in person, woww! Awesome!\u201dThe guard scurried through his bag. A romance novel popped out from the bag. He seemed to have brought some random things to kill time when he was on guard duty.\u201cThi-, this is the only paper I have right now! May I have your autograph, please?\u201dSword Saint took the novel as if he was familiar with this situation.\u201cDo you have a pen?\u201d\u201cHe-here it is!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t received a nickname yet, so\u2026!\u201dThe old swordsman signed in neat strokes.The guard took the sign like an innocent boy and looked back at me.I don\u2019t know why, but his eyes were very bright.\u201cDea-, Death King-nim, may I also ask for your signature too!\u201d\u201cUh.\u201dMy autograph?\u201cI\u2019ve never signed anything before though\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my lifelong wish! Please!\u201dDazed, I was given a pen and a novel.How is his lifelong wish to receive my autograph? How light was his life?Feeling a little awkward, I put down the novel. Sword Saint\u2019s autograph was already written there. While I was trying to write my autograph with a pen, I suddenly realized that it was the first time I had written the name \u201cDeath King\u201d.Before I realized, Sword Saint\u2019s and my handwriting was already side by side.+Sword Saint\u528d\u661f.Death King\u6b7b\u738b.+\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cTha-, thank you! Thank you so much!\u201dThe guard bowed his back. Afraid that the autograph might disappear, the guard quickly took the novel back.When the guard took the novel, I was filled with a strange feeling, and it was hard for me to even determine what it felt like.\u201cExcuse me\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll honor it as a family heirloom! Don\u2019t worry! I\u2019ll never sell it to anyone else! Oh, thank you both so much! Have a happy weekend!\u201dThe guard quickly went down the steps of the bell tower. Thrilled, he said \u201cYayyy! What a lucky day!\u201d, and his excited voice gradually faded downwards.When the voice was finally gone, A speck-like crimson red sun that was setting could be seen from the bell tower.And only the silent breathing of the two remained.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dBoth of us were silent for a while.And then\u2026\u201cErrmmm, Sword Saint-nim.\u201d\u201cHey, young man.\u201dSword Saint\u2019s and my words clashed and faded away. It became like that because both of us spoke at the same time.An awkward silence, but it didn\u2019t last long.I said.\u201cSword Saint-nim, to you, it must look as if I have killed a tremendous amount of people. A mass murderer that must be punished.\u201dI looked at the Sword Saint with a calm face.\u201cBut if you look in the mirror, you will also see a mass murderer who has killed a great number of people. That person is you, Sword Saint-nim.\u201dSword Saint was looking at the sunset, not me.\u201cBut Sword Saint-nim, you wouldn\u2019t punish yourself for that. This is because you have a clear standard for killing someone. And the standard is [punish those who hurt many people].\u201dWhile the twilight spread, I continued on saying.\u201cI also had clear standards, and that was why I did what I did. And the standard is [punish those who hurt many people].\u201dThis was what I had prepared in advance since the time I lied to the Sword Saint that I was a prophet.\u201cIf Sword Saint-nim killed someone because they killed many people before, I killed someone before they could kill many other people.\u201dIt was a meticulous lie that I specially prepared for the Sword Saint.\u201cSo, Sword Saint-nim. You and I are actually walking on the same path\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYoung man.\u201dBut before I could finish my lie, the old man gently called out to me.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to try to justify yourself like that.\u201dYes.\u201cSword Saint-nim, I\u2026.\u201d\u201cYoung man.\u201dI shut my mouth as he called out to me in his low-pitched voice.While staring at the sunset, the old man muttered.\u201cI\u2019m different from the other Hunters.\u201dAt first glance, the remark seemed to come out of the blue.\u201cBlack Dragon Witch. Count. Heresy Questioner. Venomous Snake. Crusader\u2026 they\u2019re all kids who suffered harshly in the outside world. But I\u2019m different. I was born without shortages, and lived without any shortages.\u201dMarcus Calenberry.I knew the old man in front of me was from a prestigious household. Rather than knowing, I did a full-scale investigation on him as a foe, and looked him up. They say he came from a prestigious family recognized throughout Northern Europe.\u201cWhen the tower appeared in the world, I had already built my own family. I ran a company, I had been married, I had children, I had seen my children have grandsons and granddaughters. I\u2019ve seen enough success already.\u201dThe Sword Saint\u2019s voice was calm.\u201cBut I questioned.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by questioned?\u201d\u201cIs my success all due to my capabilities? I suddenly felt curious.\u201dThe old man slowly pulled his sword out of its sheath.\u201cWasn\u2019t it purely because I was born into a good household?\u201dThe sunset shone.The sword was crimson-red even though it had not cut anything.\u201cWasn\u2019t it just because I was a \u2018bird\u2019 born into a good family, received a good education, met good friends, and grew up only by drinking the best things? I was proud of the fact that I achieved everything myself\u2026But maybe it was just a delusion of someone trapped in a birdcage.\u201dThe Sword Saint explained.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201dIt was a blade-like sharp voice.\u201cThat can\u2019t be.\u201dA scarlet heart, like the sunset, was possessed by him.\u201cI\u2019m sure I was born with something good. However, I wanted to stand tall and proud on my own. I wanted to prove that my pride was not a delusion.\u201d\u201c\u2026So that\u2019s why you came to the tower.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe old man nodded.His wrinkles were deep and thick.\u201cHe who enters the tower can never go back to the outside world. Only my body. In this place where there are no prestigious households, no families, and no aides who support me\u2026 I wanted to prove my way of life with my own body.\u201dHowever, the Sword Saint murmured.\u201cI seem to have let my guard down unknowingly.\u201d\u201cOpen Skill Card. Disclose.\u201dShinngggg!A silver card floated from the hand of the Sword Saint.+[Detective\u2019s Insight]Rank: B-Effects: You can see the opponent\u2019s kill count. It does not include indirect murder. Only murders committed with a clear intention are counted.\u203bHowever, you are not able to know the method of killing.+\u201cI was foolish.\u201dThe Sword Saint lowered his skill card.\u201cI was going to only trust my eyes and hands, but\u2026 Before I knew it, I was relying on [Skills]. I saw it through the skill rather than through my own eyes, and I had blind faith in the judgment of the skill rather than in my own judgment.\u201dThen,\u201cYoung man. I\u2019ll ask you one last time.\u201dThe old man\u2019s blue eyes turned to look at me.\u201cHave you ever killed a single innocent life?\u201dIs that all?So that\u2019s why he said I didn\u2019t have to try to justify myself. I was convinced.Yes. To justify is to do it with one\u2019s own \u2018head\u2019 as I just did.No matter how elaborate a lie maybe, it\u2019s just to fool someone\u2019s mind, and not for winning over their hearts.\u201cNo.\u201dPersuasion, and not convincing.\u201cI\u2019ve never done that, Sword Saint-nim.\u201dJust like what I did as the pillar of the tower,I said whole-heartedly.\u201cI won\u2019t do that in the future either.\u201dThe Sword Saint shut his eyes gently.As if he was reflecting on my expression and voice.A long silence passed.And.\u201cHuppp!\u201dThe card flew away.The card that flew into the air, was cut with the crimson-red blade.A card split in two.A golden ray of light from the sunset pierced through the cut gap.\u201cI believe in my eyes.\u201dSoon, the cards became sprinkles of light and dispersed.The skill was destroyed.\u201cYou\u2019ve had a hard time for the last five days. Thank you for going along with the stubbornness of an old man.\u201dThe Sword Saint sheathed his sword.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit late to tell you now but, it was quite a pleasant experience seeing you break through the 12th to 19th floors. Take a good rest today. When the press conference ends tomorrow, the 21st floor will be opened immediately after.\u201dThe old man stomped on the floor.Just before skipping to the roof of another building, he glanced at me.\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to seeing you perform on the next floor. Death King.\u201dAnd in an instant, he was quite a distance away from the bell tower.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dFor a long time, I stood absent-mindedly.I opened my mouth reluctantly.\u201cSword Emperor. What just\u2026.\u201d-Uhhhh.\u201cJust now, Sword Saint-nim acknowledged me, didn\u2019t he?\u201d-I think so.My heart was at ease.\u201cWaaaaah\u2026.\u201dMy knees went weak and I slowly sat down. The floor made of stone was chilly. I stared blankly at the red sky that was slowly fading and began to turn dark.\u201cWow, it\u2019s really\u2026 It\u2019s really over. The 20th floor is also mine now. And the guild masters will take care of the press\u2026Yes. It\u2019s really all over.\u201dBae Hu-ryeong giggled.-What do you mean over? Someone else might think you just cleared the 50th floor or something.\u201cJust from what I feel right now, it\u2019s like I just cleared the 90th floor.\u201d-Tch tch tch. Zombie, sometimes I get confused about whether you have nerves of steel or are you just another coward.\u201cActually, I sometimes get confused too\u2026.\u201dAnyway, I wrapped up all that I\u2019ve done till the 20th floor.When I thought of what I had done, I was engulfed by a strange sense of satiety.[The Goddess of Protection was impressed by your achievements!]A voice that hadn\u2019t been heard for a while rang.\u201cHuh?\u201dCome to think of it.Despite defeating the Devil King of Fall Rain, the Goddess of Protection remained silent. No, except for the time when I broke through the 12th floor for the first time, the Goddess of Protection was actually always silent.[The Goddess of Protection acknowledges all your accomplishments!]As if venting out all she wanted to say all while being silent all along, a series of voices could be heard.[The Goddess of Protection concluded that even though you have lied about being an Apostle of the Goddess, in actuality, you are fully qualified to be an Apostle.][Goddess of Protection allows you to employ her name in the future!]But there was something strange about her words.\u201c\u2026What does she mean by using her name in the future? What does that mean?\u201d[The Goddess of Protection is hurt by your words, given the fact that we\u2019ve been doing well together so far.]It became more and more incomprehensible.\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing well together so far?\u201d[The Goddess of Protection asks you to look down.]I looked down.There was nothing but the stone floor.[The Goddess of Protection asks you to look to the left a little bit more.]I shifted my gaze to the left.At that side, my legs and waist were there.On my waist, there was a legendary weapon that was bestowed by the Goddess to the Aegim Empire\u2019s Founding Emperor, in other words, Lefanta Aegim\u2019s Holy Protection Sword, which was worn with a sheath.\u201c\u2026Wait a minute. By any chance?\u201d[The Goddess of Protection advises that you focus your attention on your waist.]I felt strange.I recalled the scene where I was fighting against the Devil King\u2019s army on the 12th floor.At that time, I was sure that there was a voice stating that the Goddess of Protection was squeezing out the last drop of her power. As soon as the words were over, a white ray of light burst out of something I was holding on to.There was no other miracle after that.\u201cNo. Wait a minute. Don\u2019t tell me the [Goddess of Protection] that was mentioned from time to time in the fight against the Devil King is\u2026\u201dI said it with a heart full of disbelief.\u201cYou\u2026 were you a \u2018sword\u2019?\u201dAfter a while.The voice answered.[The Goddess of Protection has affirmed your question!]Oh my God.To think the Holy Protection Sword I was using all this while, was actually a sacred sword.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 \u2013 The Obsessed Final King (1)Translator: WH Editor: Sasha-All of you are now watching an amazing video right now!-A witch, more popularly known as the Black Dragon Witch is leading the 11th floor raid team. This is the latest video we just got from BBS. Oh! Let me zoom in on this part.-Yes, this is the part! Let\u2019s pause the video for a second.A quiet waiting room.I was watching TV mindlessly.\u2013 To all our viewers, can you see it? The Black Dragon Witch is holding hands with another Hunter. This Hunter is presumed to be Death King(\u6b7b\u738b).-If the video wasn\u2019t fabricated, it would mean that Death King hunted the 11th floor stage boss in a single stroke. It\u2019s often called a one-shot one-kill among Hunters. But until now, there was never a precedence where the boss monster was defeated in one-shot.The caster and commentator were in a commotion.-So you\u2019re saying this is the first time?-Yes, it is. Of course, the Black Dragon Witch helped, but the Hunter who faced the boss monster by himself seemed to be Death King.Underneath the screen was a breaking news caption, \u201c[Death King\u2019s Press Conference This Afternoon].-Everyone, let\u2019s watch the next video together.-Death King who has been under the veil all this while had finally showed up yesterday afternoon. He came back to Babylon on the transfer gate. As you can see, the Black Dragon Witch and Sword Saint were with him.-It looks like they\u2019re escorting Death King though?-Yes. To properly convey the vibe of the scene, I\u2019ll raise my voice for a bit.There was a video that seemed to be taken by someone on their cell phone.In the middle of the screen, I was expressionlessly walking.-Please look this way for a while!-Please don\u2019t push me away! Please say something!-Black Dragon Witch, when can we hear the official announcements?!-What kind of relationship are you two\u2026.Tikkk!I couldn\u2019t stand watching it anymore and pressed the remote control.I frowned at Bae Hu-ryeong who was watching the TV with me side by side.-Ahhh, why did you turn it off? I was enjoying it for quite a while.I opened my mouth.\u201cBecause I\u2019m so embarrassed that I could just die!\u201dThis place is the waiting room.A day has passed since I received the recognition of Sword Saint.Today was the day where the press conference regarding the progress of clearing the tower will be held.Originally, it was supposed to be taken care of by the top guild masters, but this time, I was invited as a special guest. After a while, the interview will start.-Why don\u2019t you just kill yourself? You\u2019re not going to die anyway.\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to!\u201dI didn\u2019t have anything to do until the conference was held, so I thought I\u2019d watch TV, but it was a mistake.-Ahhh. Fuc-. I got it. Then switch to another channel.\u201cAll channels talk about me anyway!\u201dWhether it was the news channel or the others, almost all the broadcasts were talking about the raid from the 10th to 20th floors. And TV shows weren\u2019t the only ones. Things were the same even when I looked on the Internet.I had become a celebrity after a night\u2019s sleep.That\u2019s what I feel like right now.[The Goddess of Protection points out that it was just how exceptional your achievement was.]The Holy Sword quivered on my waist.[Fame is like the taxes a hero has to pay, day by day. The Goddess of Protection advises that you must get used to the position of Hero.]\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI felt so burdened that I lowered the Holy Sword.\u201cI was so tired yesterday that I fell asleep and couldn\u2019t talk much\u2026Ms. Goddess, you there? Aren\u2019t you thinking too highly of me?\u201d[You are the light!]The Holy Sword quivered more.I don\u2019t know if it was just me, but it felt like she was an idol\u2019s obsessed fan.[The Goddess of Protection whispered that she still remembers as clear as day. When you climbed up the Empire\u2019s castle and gave that roaring speech. And the imposing stance when you declared \u2018Leave the Empire to us from now on\u2019, you were so dashing then.]\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dI covered my ears.\u201cStop! Stop it! That was what I uttered when I was completely excited!\u201dBut it was to no avail. The Sword\u2019s voice was not heard by my ear but transmitted directly to my head.The Holy Sword whispered endlessly about my dark history.[Goddess of Protection expressed. It\u2019s an unwritten law that a hero must love himself! The words of a hero without self-love are always miserable, and it would make even the people around him unhappy. In that sense, your confidence is very likable! It\u2019s really quite amazing!]I was right.The Goddess of Protection was just my huge fan.\u201cStop\u2026 please just stop\u2026\u2026!\u201dJust like me who was once an obsessed fan of Flame Emperor, the Holy Sword had been a fan of mine.I wouldn\u2019t mind if she expressed the burning desire of a fan somewhere I couldn\u2019t see. But the Sword\u2019s voice was broadcasted live to me 24 hours a day.[The Goddess of Protection Confesses.][I am happy to serve someone like you as my second master!]Oh my God.Have I ever heard someone sincerely praising me continuously and been in their company for this long? Someone, that praised me so incessantly, that it made me think about my dark past which I wanted to forget as soon as possible.Just kill me instead.[Especially when you brought the Devil King of Fall Rain under your reign, and the moment when you muttered, \u2018The Lord has the responsibility to protect his own people\u2019, that was truly a great scene\u2026]This was really too much.I took out the Odo Oil(\u5fa1\u6cb9) from my backpack. Odo Oil was an oil used to clean a blade. I poured some of the oil on a cloth and glared at the Holy Sword.\u201cYou started it first. This thing.\u201dMy hand reached closer to the blade of the sword.A flicker of white light burst out from the Holy Sword.[The Goddess of Protection feels threatened.][The Goddess of Protection begs you to stop what you\u2019re doing.][The Goddess of Protection\u2026]10 minutes later.[The Goddess of Protection apologizes to you for her blunder.]Sparkle-.Thanks to my sincere towel skills, the Holy Sword became clean. The blade became as transparent as a mirror and reflected my face. But the Holy Sword trembled with shame.\u201cPhew, it\u2019s finally a little quiet now.\u201dI lowered the Holy Sword which had become more silent.\u201cSo I get that you\u2019re a Constellation but why a sword? Did you possess the sword from the very beginning?\u201dAs far as my understanding goes, the Constellation(\u661f\u5ea7) was like the administrator of the stage.Like the vengeful ghost, the Constellation may have been a monster at first. I couldn\u2019t even imagine how the \u2018Sword\u2019 became a Constellation.As I muttered that question, the Holy Sword gave off a subtle white glow.[The Goddess of Protection shakes her head.][It\u2019s easier to just understand that the Constellation is \u2018Something that Represents\u2019 the world.]A representative of the world.[The Goddess of Protection muttered.][I was originally a Holy Spirit who was revered as a god. But the Empire\u2019s founder \u2018Lefanta Aegim\u2019, split me into five swords and sealed me.][You are the first possessor of the Holy Swords, \u2018Idol\u2019.]I bat my eyes.\u201cIs the name of the sword Idol?\u201d[Positive.]And then the Goddess of Protection named the five swords.[First Sword, Idol (\u5076\u50cf).][Second Sword, Pity (\u61f7\u60d1).][Third Sword, Prayer (\u7948\u9858).][Fourth Sword, Sacrifice (\u6a23\u59d3).][Fifth Sword, Salvation (\u6551\u63f4).][These are the swords of the five sisters.][The goddess of Protection bragged that if you gather all the sister swords, she will regain the strength from her prime.]\u201cOhhh hohhh.\u201dIn short, the sword that was shining in front of my eyes was really just a fragment of the Holy Sword.In other words, the other four swords must be found to draw out its real power.\u201cInteresting. So where are the sister swords?\u201dShe did not answer.An awkward silence filled the waiting room.\u201cHello? Goddess? I\u2019m asking you where your sisters are?\u201dSilence.[T/N: Original text is\ubb35\ubb35\ubd80\ub2f5 (\u9ed8\u9ed8\u4e0d\u7b54), which means when someone is not answering even after asking about it numerous times.]My eyes sharpened.\u201c\u2026 By any chance, even you don\u2019t know?\u201dAfter a while, a voice murmured.[The Goddess of Protection pleads the Fifth.]\u201cIn the end, that just means you don\u2019t know.\u201d[The Goddess of Protection argues that she can feel the presence of the sister swords if they are close by.]I shrugged.\u201cWell, I\u2019m not in a hurry to find them right now. Anyway, you must have at least a fifth of the power. Mr. Idol Sword. What can you do?\u201d[I can get absolute support from the citizens of the Aegim Empire.]\u201cI know that better than anyone. Anything else?\u201dShingggg!As if the Holy Sword was waiting for it, it emitted light at its maximum output.\u201cAackk! My eyes?! My eyesss?!\u201dI rolled around the floor while covering my eyes.I could hear the Holy Sword snarling in my head.[The Goddess of Protection boasts that she is confident in emitting light.]\u201cI\u2019ve seen it to the point where I\u2019m sick of it, so of course I know it!\u201dWhat in the world??? I was lucky that I protected my eyes with Aura in an instant. I almost lost my eyesight!\u201cNo, what else can you do besides getting the support of the Aegim Empire\u2019s citizens and shining!\u201dSilence fell.The Holy Sword\u2019s glow dimmed. In human terms, it was as if she was stuttering.[I\u2019m confident in manipulating monsters.]\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d[Hurriedly, The Goddess of Protection adds that she is also confident in manipulating humans.]Knock knock knock.Amid the silence, where I was dumbfounded, someone knocked on the waiting room door. I quickly sheathed the Holy Sword. From someone else\u2019s point of view, I would look like a madman if I was seen talking to the sword.\u201cYou are?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201dThe Witch\u2019s voice could be heard from outside the door.\u201cYou\u2019ve been noisy since a while ago. Is something wrong?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m alright. Nothing\u2019s going on!\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026?\u201dThe Witch seemed suspicious but did not question me further.\u201cThe press conference will start in five minutes. The reporters will probably shoot you loads of questions frantically. And the 21st floor will be open by the end of the press conference. We\u2019re gonna answer the reporters in moderation and then head straight to the 21st floor. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cWhat a great reply\u2026 Don\u2019t come out late.\u201dI heard footsteps beyond the door. Tack tack. I pulled the Holy Sword out only after I properly checked that the Witch\u2019s steps were far away.And glared silently at the blade.\u201cBasically, besides being able to shine, there\u2019s nothing else you\u2019re useful for at all.\u201d[The Goddess of Protection is protesting against your biased opinions\u2026]\u201cAlright then. From now on, you\u2019re not the Goddess of Protection, I\u2019ll call you Shiny. It\u2019s a waste for you to have the name Holy Sword!\u201dCome to think of it, this Constellation was pathetic!Didn\u2019t she fail to protect her world and got devoured by the Devil King of Fall Rain? In the end, I had to \u2018carry\u2019 this Constellation and protect her world. Like the vengeful ghost, this Constellation was not in a position to raise its head against me.\u201cAnd it\u2019s too noisy. My head\u2019s already overloaded with one of that Sword Emperor. I\u2019m losing my mind because you keep going \u2018Goddess of Protection\u2019 this, \u2018Goddess of Protection\u2019 that! From now on, don\u2019t talk to me unless you really have to.\u201d[The Goddess of Protection\u2026]\u201cOhh hoh! Don\u2019t make me return you to the Aegim Empire. Do you understand, Shiny?\u201dSilence hung around for a while.After a moment, the Holy Sword quivered.[My Lord, Shiny agrees.]It was at this moment that I acquired the Constellation.2.The press conference was held in the square.Not only the central square but also the alleys were packed. A crowd that looked like it easily exceeded tens of thousands. As we walked onto the stage set up in the middle of the plaza, cameras flashed all around us.The Witch, Sword Saint, Me.The three of us sat side by side at the table that was prepared beforehand.\u201c-Thank you for welcoming us.\u201dIt was the Witch who spoke into the microphone. As the Witch\u2019s calm voice flowed, cheers soared from the corners of the plaza.\u201cBlack Dragon Witch-nim!\u201d\u201cKyaaaaaaa!\u201d\u201cPlease look here, Black Dragon Witch-nim! Just once will do!\u201dA group of people waved their placards around. There was even a person who brought a picture of a magazine cover that the Witch modelled for.\u2018Pretty incredible.\u2019Was it because the Saintess(\u8056\u5973) had not appeared yet? As a female Hunter, Black Dragon Witch was enjoying incomparable popularity.After bowing her head as a sign of greeting, the Witch started the conference in all seriousness.\u201cAs you all may know, we\u2019ve cleared the 10th to 20th floor. It was a splendid achievement as featured by the various media outlets, broadcasts, and even small media outlets. We\u2019ve been wondering how to announce this joyous news\u2026. But it seems like we didn\u2019t have to worry about it as you all promoted it well. Yes, that\u2019s right. Thank you all very much for letting us save the advertising expenses.\u201dThere was a slight laugh from the press corps that occupied the front row of the stage.\u201cBut there\u2019s something else that we\u2019re very proud of this time.\u201dThe plaza gradually quieted down.\u201cIt isn\u2019t about the fact that the 10th floor that we\u2019ve been longing to clear over the years has finally come true. And neither is it related to the event of us having cleared up to the 20th floor at an unexpected speed. Zero casualties. The fact that not a single person died\u2026 Of all things, this was what made us happy the most.\u201dAfter a little humour, she expressed her sincere feelings.Even to me, an outsider, I could see that the Black Dragon Witch skilfully led the conference with her speech.\u2018As expected, she has to be at this level to be the biggest guild\u2019s leader.\u2019I wondered if she was really the same person who dressed me up yesterday and acted like a fool.\u201cEveryone. Please look down for a moment.\u201dSaid the Witch.\u201cLook at the ground of Babylon\u2019s plaza that you are stepping on. You will be able to see each stone engraved with a name. The names of the fallen warriors thus far. The names of our seniors who devoted their lives to clear the tower.\u201dWe-ingggg-The cameras of the press corps flashed across the floor in unison.\u201cWhen we raided the 2nd floor, when we raided the 3rd floor, countless names were engraved on the floor. It is because of their sacrifices that we can be here today. In front of all these people\u2026 I\u2019m really happy to be able to announce this.\u201dThe Witch\u2019s voice resonated throughout the plaza.\u201cToday, we didn\u2019t engrave anyone\u2019s name on the plaza.\u201dSnap! Snap!Reporters snapped photos alternately between the tiles on the plaza\u2019s floor and the Witch. This would determine the photos that will be published in the newspaper, and also decide the atmosphere and mood of today\u2019s conference. The crowd shouted the Witch\u2019s name and cheered.\u2018There\u2019s no need for me to even butt in.\u2019I watched the conference unfold with an expressionless face.I felt gratified for no reason.\u2018As expected, siding with the right people is important.\u2019Feeling at ease, I glanced at the sky.[01:22:10]It was the same as when the 11th floor was opened. Even now, there was a clock of light in the sky. When the number indicates 0:0:00, the 21st floor will be opened.\u2018I can\u2019t wait to finish the press conference and go to the 21st floor\u2026\u2019When the press conference was proceeding smoothly.During the session of the reporters\u2019 questions and the Witch\u2019s replies.\u201cThis is Reporter John Evans from Babylon Daily News!\u201dA reporter sprang on his feet.\u201cI have a question for Death King, the new 3rd rank.\u201d\u2018Huh? Me?\u2019I stared at the reporter.Naturally, the eyes of the people who gathered in the plaza were also on me.\u201cThere are a lot of rumours about your sudden rise in the ranking, Death King-nim. Especially the speculation that you are the [the Big Rookie that the big guilds have been secretly raising from a long time ago]. It sounds extremely convincing!\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cIf this is really true, then it would mean that Death King-nim is a hero intentionally created by the big guilds. What do you think of these suspicions?\u201dRoaring.There was a commotion at the plaza.\u201cThere are also many voices of concerns that the top guilds may unite and monopolize the 10th to 20th floors. In particular, I heard that Death King-nim has been given the exclusive rights to the 20th floor! Is that true!\u201dA commotion was stirred up even further.Tsk.The Witch sitting next to me was expressionless, but she clicked her tongue so soft that only I could hear it. She turned off the microphone and murmured.\u201cHe\u2019s trying to aggro you. Don\u2019t answer him. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d[T/N: aggro is like aggravating you, i.e. making you lose your cool.]\u201cNo.\u201dI shook my head.\u201cThese kinds of people will keep popping out anyway. I\u2019ll have to make myself clear at least once.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201dI reached out my hand to the Witch.\u201cPlease hand me the microphone.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dMy determination was resolute.Before climbing the 21st floor, I have to make sure to nip this kind of aggro in the bud.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 \u2013 The Obsessed Last King (2)Translator: WH Editor: Sasha\u201cHaihhh.\u201dThe witch sighed anxiously.\u201cDon\u2019t just blurt stuff out recklessly. Most mistakes can be covered for but if you really go all out talking nonsense, even I can\u2019t restrain the media.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no one as gentle as me. You know me right. I\u2019m the prophet, okay? I know what the most exemplary answer is.\u201d\u201c\u2026Can I really believe you?\u201d\u201cAyyyy, of course.\u201dI took over the microphone from the Witch. The Witch seemed worried about me up till the last moment when she passed me the microphone, but it was really fine. I had a [Secret Method].\u201cAh. Ah ah.\u201dI warmed up my voice gently. My voice resonated through the square through the speaker.\u201cHello, everyone. I am a Hunter who received the nickname, Death King. Nice to meet you.\u201dSnap! Snap!The flashes formed a striking wave. I wasn\u2019t very flustered. Was yesterday\u2019s experience of being surrounded by a crowd a form of immunization against this? I was more relaxed than I thought and received the \u2018baptism\u2019 of flashes head-on.\u201cYour name is\u2026 John Evans-nim?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201dThe young reporter looked straight at me. Eyes burning with the spirit of a journalist. He had a heated gaze that looked as if he wouldn\u2019t miss any move I made and that he would surely reveal who I really was.It was quite an uncomfortable gaze.\u201cWell.\u201dMeeting a gaze like that.There was only one idea that came to my mind.\u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s a voice of concern that comes from my shortfalls.\u201dLearn from your lessons.[T/N: \ubc18\uba74\uad50\uc0ac (\u53cd\u9762\u654e\u5e2b) is a Korean idiom that basically means something that allows one to learn a lesson from a mistake, or a direct translation could be \u2018One man\u2019s trash is another man\u2019s treasure.\u2019 ]Let\u2019s just not become someone like Flame Emperor!\u201cHuh?\u201dThe reporter gripped the microphone with one hand and batted his eyes. He probably didn\u2019t expect me to react in this kind of way. Meanwhile, recalling in my head the weasel-like mug of the Flame Emperor, I said.[T/N: weasel in this context refers to someone who is deceitful and cunning.]\u201cI\u2019ll repeat it. In my opinion, it\u2019s all a voice of concern that comes from my shortfalls.\u201dMy secret move was very simple.\u2018No matter what, all I have to do is say it the other way round of how the Flame Emperor would!\u2019Did I look like I would have some kind of great knack for interviews?I was different from the Witch. I didn\u2019t have a talent at captivating the crowd with speeches. No talent, no skills, no experience.But, there was just one thing.I had the knowledge that others didn\u2019t.The world\u2019s most impudent Hunter\u2019s interviews!\u2018If I did the exact opposite of what Flame Emperor did, even if I was bad at it, it\u2019d still be decent.\u2019I was a big fan of the Flame Emperor for nearly a decade. Thanks to that, the inside of my head was no different than a library. A library where the atrocities and the absurd remarks of Flame Emperor were recorded.What if it wasn\u2019t me who was holding to the microphone now, but Flame Emperor?He would have said this.[It\u2019s because of my greatness that we could clear through the 20th floor, you little bastards.][I worked to the bones to clear the tower, y\u2019know? So what\u2019d you expect me to do? The items and experiences I got there would naturally be mine. Hey, trash reporter. If I don\u2019t fu-, if I don\u2019t take it for myself, then who should I give it to? Huh?][Your father?]I didn\u2019t just made that up on the spot right now.In fact, he really was like that!\u2018That was why before I returned in time, the Witch would turn pale whenever there was a press conference\u2026\u2019It was the so-called [Your father] case.So naturally, the press conference had a brilliant outburst. The swearing sounds of the reporters were broadcasted live, and by the time the Witch rushed to the conference, it was already too late.It was literally a major catastrophe.The live broadcast was stopped in a hurry, but the disaster was not over.As Yoo Soo-ha counterfire\u2019d the reporters, the mother of all curses and all kinds of curses that exist in the world were thrown at him, and the scene that unfolded was broadcasted by individual streamers just as it was.\u2018His nickname wasn\u2019t \u201cThe Plague\u201d for no reason.\u2019Rumour had it that the Witch had been bedridden for a week after that day.Perhaps due to the [Your father] incident, the Witch learned what kind of existence the Hunter Yoo Soo-ha was. Was it not because of this incident that the top guilds distanced themselves from Yoo Soo-ha?\u2018In the past, the Flame Emperor thoroughly screwed up this press conference.\u2019In other words.\u2018I just have to say the exact opposite of what the Plague said.\u2019Do the exact opposite of the worst, and it\u2019d be the best!I grabbed the microphone as I recalled Yoo Soo-ha\u2019s absurd remarks.[It\u2019s because of my greatness that we could clear through the 20th floor. You little bastards.]\u201cI know the public opinion is in an uproar because of me. But it\u2019s overrated. Without the help of Black Dragon Witch and Sword Saint here, I would\u2019ve never been able to clear up till the 20th floor alone.\u201d[I worked my bones off to clear the tower, y\u2019know?]\u201cOf course, I am proud to say that I gave it my all. Aiming at zero sacrifices, we really put in all of our efforts, to the point of grinding our bones. But, I don\u2019t think this can be considered as our \u2018sacrifice\u2019. It\u2019s what we should do as human beings. As a Hunter, this was the right thing to do. More than anything\u2026I did it because it\u2019s something I like to do.\u201d[The items and experiences I got there would naturally be mine. Hey, trash reporter. If I don\u2019t fu-, if I don\u2019t take it for myself, then who should I give it to? Huh?]\u201cBut, just cause of that, I don\u2019t have the intention of claiming my rights. That is why I entrusted the rights of the 10th floor to the 19th floor to the guild masters. I only said that I wanted the 20th floor to myself\u2026 No. The 20th floor is a kind of [Green Belt] area. On the 20th floor, the residents of the tower who originally resided there will live there. I will be happy with just the administrator role.\u201d[Your father?]\u201cReporter Evan-nim. That is all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo you still have any other questions.\u201dThe young man who was burning with the spirit of a journalist stuttered.\u201cNoth-\u2026 Nothing else.\u201dGood.From here, I worked my brain even faster.If it was the Flame Emperor, what would he have responded with when he heard the reporter\u2019s words?[Okay. If you don\u2019t have anything else to say, then fuck off, you American pig bastard.]It was a scene that I could obviously imagine happening.In addition to this, he would\u2019ve showed-off his bulky middle finger.\u2018Let\u2019s see. If I wanted to say the exact opposite line of this\u2026.\u2019I opened my mouth.\u201cThank you. Ahh. If you have any other questions, I\u2019ll answer it for a while, everyone.\u201dThere was a moment of silence that swept through the plaza.Though it was really just a moment of silence.\u201cHere here! I\u2019m from Hwanmun Newspaper!\u201d\u201cPlease take our question, Death King-nim! I\u2019m from Only Tower Daily!\u201d\u201cWe came from the Tower of Babel Broadcasting System!\u201d\u201cDeath King-nim!\u201dThe reporters raised their hands in unison. As soon as they sensed that I was an easy-going person, they rushed to make an article.This scene felt like baby ducks who were diligently swaying their beaks towards the mother bird.\u2018Wow.\u2019I was inwardly impressed as I watched the press corps.\u2018\u2026 The learning from your lessons strategy was insane.\u2019As expected of the Plague. A psychopath that was shittier than anyone else in this world.He was always the man who would become my compass in a bad sense.Even now, the compass clearly told me how to react.[What? Hwanmun Newspaper? I\u2019ll never do an interview with you guys, There\u2019s nothing but old baffoons there. Even when I flip open the newspaper, it gives off a geezer smell. Hey, if you\u2019re gonna call yourself a reporter, at least shower.]Again, I recalled the words of Flame Emperor and said,\u201c\u2026Then, starting from the reporter of Hwanmun Newspaper.\u201dThe effect was magnificent.The conference ended on a good note. It was literally a great success. Questions and answers popped up from everywhere for over an hour, but I didn\u2019t make a common slip of the tongue.In actual fact, it wasn\u2019t easy to end the conference on a good note. The reporters shot vague questions at me to somehow extract even one line of extra information so they could put it in their articles. In the end, the Witch took over my microphone and said a simple thankful greeting.\u201cEveryone! I understand your desire of wanting to know more about our new hero. Unfortunately, there is little time left.\u201d The Witch pointed at the sky with her finger.[00:05:27]Before we knew it, the clock of light was close to 00:00:00.There were only 5 minutes left until the new stage opened!There was no better excuse than this to be used to end the press conference.\u201cWe will end our night\u2019s rest here, and concentrate on clearing the tower again today. Please watch over us with your great interest and warm support. This time too, we will do our best to achieve the goal of zero casualties.\u201d\u201cAhhhhhhh\u2026.\u201dThere were regrettable bellows popping out from here and there.As I wondered if the press conference would end just like this, a brave figure raised his hand.\u201cBlack, Black Dragon Witch! One last question please!\u201d\u201cYes. With this one question, the conference will really end here.\u201d\u201cBlack Dragon Witch and Death King! What is the relationship between the two of you?!\u201dAt that moment, people\u2019s eyes shined.Pure interest. Slight mischief.Since the dawn of history, the one thing that humans have been most curious about was the story of love. The reporters probably wanted to match up the Witch and me in that kind of way.\u201cHmmmm\u2026\u201dThe Witch thought for a while, then glanced back at me.Should I say it was something like a mischievous prank?There was a faint playfulness in the Witch\u2019s eyes.\u201cThe relationship between the two of us\u2026 That\u2019s right.\u201dThe Witch slowly opened her lips.Then, a statement that would remain as a famous line of the era came out of her mouth.\u201c-A more than friend, comrade-in-arms kind of relationship.\u201dFluttering fluttering.The reporters cheered. Should they focus on the word more than a friend? Should they focus on the word comrade-in-arms (\u6230\u53cb)? Either way, it was a mood where they were unable to make out the heads or tails of what they were told.The reporter who asked the question also widened his eyes.\u201cFrie-, a more than a friend relationship, is what you\u2019re trying to say right?\u201d\u201cWho knows.\u201dThe Witch leisurely uttered.\u201cI\u2019ll repeat it again, it\u2019s a \u2018more than a friend, comrade-in-arms\u2019 kind of relationship, That\u2019s all there is to it. I hope there are no misunderstandings and misinterpretations.\u201d\u201cIf you have any misunderstandings and misinterpretations\u2026!\u201d\u201cThe press conference hosted by the Black Dragon Guild will end here today.\u201dThe Witch stood up from her seat.\u201cI would like to sincerely thank everyone again for all your interest and support. This has been the Guild Leader of Black Dragon, the Black Dragon Witch. I wish you all a good day.\u201dThe reporters all jumped to their feet.\u201cBlac-, Black Dragon Witch-nim! How can you just leave like this?!\u201d\u201cPlease give us a more detailed comment on what you just remarked!\u201d\u201cBlack Dragon Witch!\u201d\u201cDeath King-nim, what are your opinions on the statement just now?! Death King-nim!\u201dWow.The reporters clamored even as they shouted in hoarse voices. However, the Witch maintained her relaxed demeanor. As she guided me to the backstage, she chuckled lightly.\u201cLet\u2019s go quickly.\u201d\u201cUhh.\u201dI looked back at the press corps for a moment. Everyone was crying out.\u201c\u2026Are you going to just leave after putting out such a heated topic?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a woman who watches drama.\u201dThe Witch gently winked.A playful wink.\u201cOriginally, you have to set a fire at the end to leave a deep impression.\u201dHer words showed the dignity and authority of a guild master that reigned over the tower.3.Backstage.We walked all the way to a place we wouldn\u2019t attract people\u2019s attention. Only when we reached there, the Witch went \u201cPhewwwww!\u201d and exhaled deeply. Then she grabbed my hands.\u201cIt was perfect! Death King!\u201dThe Witch\u2019s eyes lit up brightly.I wondered if she was really the same person who managed her facial expressions calmly throughout the press conference.\u201cWhen did you even learn how to do an interview! Be proud!\u201d\u201cUhh\u2026\u201dI just did the opposite of what the Flame Emperor would have.\u201cYour humble attitude was a particular plus factor! People like heroes, but there are things they like more than that. Which is a hero who bows his head! Of course, your humility shouldn\u2019t be too overboard that it becomes servility\u2026 But you did just fine. Oh my gosh. The balance was exquisite!\u201dI just recited the opposite of what the Flame Emperor would\u2019ve said.\u201cI didn\u2019t know you even had a knack at dealing with the press. Ahhhh. What the hell has this child been doing all this while, to have only appeared now?! Besides clearing the tower, you even know how to create a good image, I feel like my shoulders have become 10 times lighter\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhat\u2019s this?My heart was uneasy as I saw her expressing her joy this much.I couldn\u2019t bring myself to say that I just imitated the psychopath the other way round.\u201cIf you have anything you want, tell me right away. Money? Fame? Authority? or, a lover? Don\u2019t worry about it. As long as it exists in the tower, I\u2019ll give you anything.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I kind of already have what I want\u2026Black Dragon Witch. The statement just says, more than a friend, less than a comrade-in-arms, what was that all about? I was taken by surprise inwardly.\u201d\u201cAh. That?\u201dThe Witch shrugged.An expression that seemed to say it was something trivial.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I sprayed some smoke screens on purpose.\u201d\u201cSmokescreen, you say?\u201d\u201cMmhmm. The media will be digging into a scandal that doesn\u2019t even exist anyways. That way, your image will only be damaged that much. That\u2019s why I\u2019d rather put a smokescreen so that they will focus their attention on me and you.\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026?\u201dI had never dealt with the media before, so I don\u2019t know if what she said was right or wrong.The Witch vaguely laughed.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Death King. It\u2019s already been several years since I shouldered all the public opinion by myself. Trust me entirely when it comes to this area. Leave special areas to the experts. Okay?\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dStrange.I don\u2019t know what it was, but it felt odd\u2026 That\u2019s right. It felt as if I was aiming for a monster on the hunting ground whose abilities were unknown. However, this was not the hunting grounds, but the first-floor city of Babylon. It was impossible for a monster to be here.Was it because of the mood?-Tsk tsk tsk.Bae Hu-ryeong clicked his tongue.\u2013 You\u2019re pathetic, Zombie. Since you have a head but not a brain, how can I not call you a Zombie? Even though you\u2019re a Hunter in name, you don\u2019t even know that you\u2019re heading towards your own deathbed (\u6b7b\u5730), my my my.\u2018Ah? What are you talking about again?\u2019-You\u2019re pathetic! Pathetic!Bae Hu-ryeong pounded his chest as if he was suffocated. Still, he was a nasty-looking man that was just like a gorilla pounding on his chest.It was at that time.\u201cWaaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201dOn the other side of the stage. From the direction of the plaza, came the sound of a loud shout. It held a different excitement than the cheers that were sent towards us.\u201cTen!\u201d\u201cNine!\u201d\u201cEight!\u201dIt was the countdown.The Witch and I stopped our conversation and looked up to the sky.[00: 00: 05]Before we knew, the time had come where the 21st floor stage was about to be opened.\u201cThree!\u201d\u201cTwo!\u201d\u201cOne!\u201dAnd.[00\uff1a00\uff1a00]The rays of light that formed numbers in the sky scattered in all directions. The cheers of the people became even greater. As if to answer back to the cheers, the rays of lights gathered again and formed the hologram of the Goddess.[Warriors.]Blue sky.The hologram of the Goddess parted her lips.[Those who climb the tower.][Congratulations on breaking through the shadows of the Devil King.]It was the moment when a new stage was about to open.People started making noise as if they were happy, perhaps because they had already witnessed the hologram of the Goddess.But I, who had experienced the tower in the past knew.-Hey Zombie.\u2018Yes.\u2019I nodded.\u2018It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not letting my guard down.\u2019Just like the tower, which was a tutorial up till the 10th floor, changed from the 11th floor onwards.The fact that the 21st floor would again have a completely different stage from the 20th floor.[The lot of you can stay on the first floor of the tower forever.]The hologram of the Goddess calmly announced that fact.[This is a refuge for those who have fled.][In return of giving up on the challenge, you could choose a \u2018snack\u2019.][But you all chose to clear from the 10th floors up to the 20th floors.]A voice resonated in the wide sky.[To witness the ending of this tower.][Then, it would be right to respond to your will.]Cwakkkkkk!White rays of light enveloped us without prior notice. It wasn\u2019t just the Witch and me. From the direction of the plaza, flustered sounds could be heard.\u201cWha-, what\u2019s happening?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything though\u2026\u201dThis was the biggest difference as compared to the last time.No one had even said \u201cTransmit\u201d, but the white light swallowed us up.The Witch looked down at her own feet with a confused look.\u201c\u2026 No way, is this a forced transfer?\u201dHer speculation was correct.[Those who climb the tower.][Those who are determined to climb the tower.][Those who are willing to receive a new name and become warriors of the tower.]The Goddess gathered her hands towards her chest.As if she was praying for someone.[From now on, only the chosen warriors will carry out the noble duty.]Suddenly, the white ray of lights completely covered us.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just like the soldiers that were struggling to climb the walls occupied by the enemy.In this regard, the tower was no different.\u201c\u2014Welcome!\u201dAs the white rays of light faded, I opened my eyes again.It wasn\u2019t the Goddess\u2019 voice that greeted us.\u201cWarriors that came from the Tower!\u201dIt was a child who I couldn\u2019t discern as a boy or a girl.The kid was wearing loose clothes.At first glance, the clothes resembled traditional oriental clothes.\u201cI have been waiting patiently for a day that felt like three autumns (\u4e00\u65e5\u5982\u4e09\u79cb)!\u201d[T/N: it\u2019s an idiom that means one day apart seems like three years.]But once I looked closely\u2026 It was completely different.Except for the long sleeves, there was nothing else that resembled an oriental attire. No, in fact, it was exceptional, starting from the sleeves. The cuffs were not long enough to be stretched more than 5m.\u201cBut it\u2019s okay! Life begins with encounters and ends with encounters. In the end, once you look back, the meaning of life isn\u2019t all about encountering people. Waiting is like a seasoning that deeply sweetens life!\u201dThere is a saying that the face completes fashion. No matter how special the clothes someone wore was, in the end, it depends greatly on who wears them.In that sense, the kid that was flapping his 5m long sleeves was definitely unique.\u201cOnce again, I\u2019d like to sincerely express my respect!\u201dAir.\u201cWelcome to the Great Library of all things!\u201dThe little kid was floating high up in the air.He looked down on us who had been summoned out of nowhere.[Librarian Bang Gu-seok welcomes you all!]A Constellation, Librarian(\u5716\u66f8\u9928\u9577) Bang Gu-seok.Those who manage the 21st floor up to the 30th floor.The representative of this world spread his arms wide and smiled.Unfortunately, no one accepted his greeting. Chattering chattering. The Hunters had yet to figure out what was going on and looked around in confusion.\u201cUhhh uhh, uhhhhh\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Why did we get transferred automatically all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cWhere is this?\u201dAt a glance, there were hundreds of people.The Hunters whispered around as they were confused. Most of them had just gathered in the plaza to do the countdown together.But, there were also people who were spending \u2018personal time\u2019 in places other than the plaza.\u201cKyaaaaaaaa!?\u201d\u201cHe-, don\u2019t look here!\u201dEmbarrassed screams came from here and there.A Hunter summoned during a shower. Lovers transferred here naked. Whether they were summoned while asleep, or even a person looking around with sleepy eyes. The unfortunate Hunters who had to face this unexpected situation popped out one after another.\u201cOh my.\u201dThe librarian, a Constellation, giggled.\u201cIt seems I have been a little lacking in consideration.\u201dAmid Hunters who were floundering around without knowing what to do, Thuckkk! The librarian flicked his finger. Then large bookcases flew around. Those bookcases that had holes for the head, arms, and legs, just like an outfit, went to the naked Hunters and suited up on its own.\u201cAh\u2026 .\u201d\u201cThank, thank god.\u201dThe Hunters who were watching sighed with relief. I was relieved too, as I was pretty flustered.\u201cWha-, what the hell is this shit\u2026\u201dActually, the people involved were fussing over the cardboard-made Gundam suit that looked as if it were worn inside out, but that was only a minority. A wave of embarrassment gushed over them just like that. The people barely regained their composure. One by one, they began to look up in the air.\u201c\u2026Who are you?\u201dOn behalf of the Hunters, the Witch opened her mouth.\u201cAnd this place is\u2026\u201d\u201cAh. I\u2019m just a small character who manages this slightly larger than normal library. Black Dragon Witch. Compared to you, I\u2019m just an existence close to an extra. Just treat me as a unimportant person.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe Witch frowned.How did he who she didn\u2019t even know, find out about her identity? It was suspicious to the point that she got an ominous feeling.It couldn\u2019t be helped.I had already gotten used to the Constellation to some extent, as I was able to put [Devil King of Fall Rain] and [Goddess of Protection] under my control. However, to the other Hunters, the Constellation was still an unknown existence.\u201c- Just a library that\u2019s a little bigger.\u201dWaiting for the timing when the Witch closed her mouth, I spoke out this time.\u201cI\u2019m not too sure about that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just at the level of \u2018a little big\u2019 though?\u201dThe 21st floor Stage.There was a Great Library here. Maybe, it wasn\u2019t enough to simply just call it huge. From the surrounding vicinity to the far horizon, from the floor we stepped on to the ceiling above, there were countless bookshelves filled with books.It would be better to call it \u2018A world made of libraries\u201d.\u201cHooooo.\u201dThe owner of this world stared at me.An innocent and simple gaze.Eyes as pure as an innocent child glistened.\u201cI see. You\u2019re the Death King.\u201dYes.\u201cAhhh, don\u2019t be so vigilant. Gentlemen. I don\u2019t mean any harm. I just want to welcome all of you. For me, the lot of you are no different from heroes of an epic story.\u201dHeroes in an epic story.The meaning of that word, after regressing 4,000 days, I knew what it was. Because this place wasn\u2019t an ordinary library. But I pretended not to know deliberately.\u201cWhat do you mean by heroes in an epic story?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like this.\u201dThuckkk!The librarian flicked his finger. Then, two hardcover books were picked out from countless bookshelves. The hardcover books flopped as they flew and hovered around the librarian.A title was written on the cover respectively.+[The Chronicles of the Aegim Empire][The Tale of Deungcheon City (\u767b\u5929\u90fd\u5e02).] [T/N: \u767b\u5929 means ascending to the heavens.]+The librarian smiled gently.\u201cReading books is my hobby. However, the books that are gathered in my library are by no means ordinary archives. The history of the lot of you. These are books that talk about the world where the tower is built.\u201dThe librarian touched the back of the book with his sturdy fingers.\u201cI know you all must be wondering why you were summoned among so many warriors. The reason is simple! Because in your world, only you all are a \u201ccharacter\u201d who have a name.\u201d\u201c\u2026A character\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cI suppose you all call it a Title (\u7570\u540d).\u201dThe librarian gently grinned and looked down towards us.\u201cThe 302 people gathered here. You are all warriors who carry a Title.\u201dThe Hunters were buzzing.\u201cOnly Hunters with Titles will be summoned?\u201d\u201cOth-, what about other people\u2026\u201d\u201cWait a minute. Don\u2019t tell me we\u2019re going to be the only one raiding the tower!?\u201dThat was right.Not the real name used in the outside world, but the name given by the Tower to the Hunters. Title. That was the entrance ticket needed from the 21st floor onwards.\u2018\u2026So that was why before I regressed in time, I couldn\u2019t even step in after the 20th floor.\u2019Front-runners with Titles.Latecomers who didn\u2019t receive a Title.\u2018The gap between the two groups will widen more and more.\u2019I fiddled with the hilt of the sword on my waist. It was something I relied on to calm down\u2026It was my own little ritual.\u2018The me now is different from who I was before.\u2019The failure that didn\u2019t have skills or a Title who couldn\u2019t even step in after the 20th floor, was no longer here. There was only the Hunter who held the 3rd rank in the newly updated rankings.\u2018I wouldn\u2019t have been able to participate, and would\u2019ve fallen behind.\u2019However, other than me, there were only a few Hunters who remained calm.The Witch was like that.Unable to hide her confusion, she muttered.\u201cWhat a load of nonsense. What do you mean by 300 people, raiding the tower with such a small number\u2026\u201d\u201cFret not!\u201dThe librarian grabbed the [Chronicles of the Aegim Empire] and chuckled.\u201cYou all protected the Aegim Empire with just three people. 300 people is a whopping 100 times that! You\u2019ll clear the stage I prepared without much difficulty. Have some confidence!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dMost of the Hunters looked at each other with anxious faces. In the middle of the Great Library that extended endlessly even beyond the horizon. There were over 300 Hunters present who looked like a handful of sand.I took the initiative before the restlessness spread any further.\u201cProceed quickly, sir librarian.\u201d\u201cOhhhooo?\u201d\u201cI know you are excited to meet someone that is alive, but we\u2019d like to climb the tower quickly. You haven\u2019t even given us a quest yet. I\u2019d like to request you to proceed quickly.\u201d\u201cOhhhooo, huhuhuh.\u201dThe librarian chuckled lightly.\u201cI see! I was too happy that I didn\u2019t even issue the quest. Mmm. However, it\u2019s not in my nature to explain things in great detail\u2026\u201dThud!Hundreds of books flew around.The hardcover books hovered around, with the librarian as the axis.\u201cLet\u2019s see. Which kind of project would most definitely be within your reach\u2026? This Apocalypse is too boring, and this is also too peaceful in terms of destruction\u2026.. Oh. That\u2019s right! This is the best.\u201dThe librarian grabbed a book.\u201cI warn you in advance.\u201dAnd the book flipped open.A white ray of light exuded from the open book.\u201cIt\u2019s just to give you a taste of what\u2019s coming, so don\u2019t be too surprised.\u201dShiiiinggggg!Waves of light gushed at us.5.All the Hunters were transferred somewhere.We didn\u2019t know where it was, but it was clear that it wasn\u2019t our world. It had an architecture style that was never before seen in our world. Buildings, as if they were a termites\u2019 nest that was enlarged hundreds of times, formed a forest of buildings.The Hunters, including me, were floating in the sky. We were high up, and on the dark ground below our feet, buildings that we had never seen or heard of before were lined up.\u201cEee, Eeeeekkkkkk!\u201dSomeone screamed. Was it someone who had acrophobia? Despite not plunging at all, the Hunters instinctively grabbed each other\u2019s sleeves.The librarian laughed as he looked at us.\u201cI am a librarian. But, as I said, the archives gathered in my library are not just ordinary history books or novels. They\u2019re a little more, no, it can be said that they are of a higher standard!\u201dThe Great Library of all things.A library where records of various worlds gathered.There, the worlds were kept in the form of books.\u201cThis is the world the lot of you will be raiding.\u201dThe librarian touched the hardcover book with the title of [The Chronicles of the Aegim Empire] written on it.\u201cAnd this is the world you will all be in!\u201dThere was also a book titled [The Tale of Deungcheon City].Besides those two, hundreds of books hovered around the librarian. The Constellation with the appearance of a young child, looked at the books in his possession, as if he couldn\u2019t hold in any more of his love for them.\u201cThese books are called many things. Some call it an epic story. Some call it a novel or a chronicle. Annals (\u5be6\u9304). Some even call it a Saga. Still, there is another expression that I prefer.\u201dThe librarian looked back at us.\u201cApocalypse.\u201dThe Constellation laughed.A bizarre sound of laughter resonated in the sky.\u201cYour apocalypse\u2026 Yes. According to the terminology I like to use, it\u2019s still in [Serialization]. After a long prologue, you are finally starting to climb the tower. It can be said that this is the section where the flavor of reading can be felt.\u201dIt was then.\u201cBut, not all Apocalypse are in [Serialization] as smoothly as your world.\u201dKeuuurururu-[T/N: a sound of something falling down.]Something started descending from the sky. No. The word descending was too gentle. That something was tearing through the sky.\u201cAlthough it is a pity.\u201dMeteor.\u201cThere was also an apocalypse that was [discontinued].\u201dCovered in flames, huge blocks of stones came falling down.A meteorite crashed on the buildings that looked like a termites\u2019 nest. Kaboooom! A deafening boom shook the world. Even the earth split under the torn sky. Even the city where an intelligent race different from ours lived was destroyed without a trace.The Hunters screamed.As the meteorite crash-landed, a cloud of dust rose up and covered us in an instant.\u201cThis is not the only one.\u201dIn the darkness where nothing could be seen, only the voice of the Constellation resonated.\u201cThere are many others.\u201dThud!I could hear the sound of a book flipping open somewhere. At the same time, the cloud of dust disappeared. The destroyed city disappeared. The split earth disappeared, and the torn sky disappeared.Instead, a new world unfolded underneath our feet.\u201cIf the Apocalypse\u2019s [Reason of Discontinuation] just now was stone-.\u201dTsunami.\u201cThe Reason of Discontinuation of this Apocalypse is water!\u201dThe tsunami, which filled up to the base of the sky, swallowed the city whole.It was too huge to call it a wave, and too overboard to say it was a tsunami. It was a disaster. As they watched the tsunami that came up all the way to the front of their nose, the Hunters screamed again.\u201cAhhhhhhh.\u201dThe Constellation sighed sadly.\u201cHow sad of a tragedy is this?\u201dA world in which all of mankind died of illness.A world where sand had covered the ground and was dried down to the last drops.A world where volcanoes erupted and smoke clouds covered the sky.Even a world where zombie viruses were rampant.\u201cThose people are humans just like you. They were alive, just like you. They were creating their own legacy the same way. But before it reached a proper ending, before it had an epic ending, it all ended due to unjust reasons.\u201dThe librarian covered the book.\u201cThough I call this discontinued serialization\u2026\u201dHundreds of books still circled around the Constellation.To you, it would simply be called \u2018Destruction\u2019.Suddenly.We were all back at the Great Library.\u201cUrgh, ughhhhhh\u2026\u201d\u201cUuuuweeeeckk!\u201d[T/N: Sound of vomiting.]Sounds of vomiting could be heard everywhere. We witnessed the destruction of dozens of worlds. Although there was no damage to the physical body, there were many Hunters who were mentally scarred.\u201cThe quest I will be giving to you gentlemen is simple.\u201dThe Constellation looked at us that were behaving like that from above.\u201cChoose eight series from the discontinued Apocalypse.\u201dChoose eight series out of the worlds that were destroyed.\u201cI want to finish reading the Apocalypse which was discontinued!\u201dWanting to continue reading the tales of the destroyed world.\u201cYou will all personally enter the eight books of Apocalypse,\u201dEntering directly into the eight worlds.\u201cSave the Apocalypses from the crisis of discontinuation!\u201dPrevent the destruction.\u201cThat\u2019s the quest that I will give to you all.\u201dThat was the quest given from the 22nd floor to the 29th floor.While the vomiting in the library didn\u2019t stop, a single voice rang in the heads of the Hunters.[The quest for the 22nd floor has been given.]Messages appeared in front of my eyes.+[Remake The World. Volume 1.]Difficulty: To be determined (\u672a\u5b9a)Mission Objective: As there are countless worlds, there are also countless destructions. The Constellation \u2018Librarian Bang Gu-seok\u2019 describes this as a Discontinued Serialization. Librarian Bang Gu-seok wants the world that was discontinued for unjust reasons to continue their stories again.First, choose one of the discontinued Apocalypse!If you succeed in saving the world, that world will be registered as your 22nd floor.\u203bHowever, if the mission fails, the 22nd floor will not be opened.+That\u2019s right.That Constellation was nothing else but a book fanatic (\u8b80\u66f8\u72c2) who was obsessed with the worlds.\u201cSo\u2026\u201dI slowly opened my mouth.\u201cYou didn\u2019t like the ending, so instead, you want us to re-write that book?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s exactly right!\u201dThe librarian smiled brightly.\u201cI hope that you will satisfy my reading preferences!\u201dWe had to [Remake] the endings of the world for this book fanatic.That was our mission.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 \u2013 Bibliomania (1)Translator: WH Editor: Sasha1.There was silence in the Great Library.Hunters with weak stomachs felt nauseous. Hunters with strong stomachs, thought prudently while staring at the quest that jumped out in front of their eyes.Only the Constellation.\u201cAh.\u201dOnly the librarian opened his mouth while fluttering his 5m long sleeves.\u201cPlease clean the vomit yourself. Isn\u2019t that just basic manners? The hygiene of the library can only be maintained if all the users work hard.\u201dClap!The librarian clapped lightly. On the backside of the bookshelf. From the dark corners of the shadow, unknown things came close. It might\u2019ve seemed human at first glance in terms of running limbs\u2026The Witch squinted her eyebrows.\u201c\u2026 Bookmarks?\u201dThe unidentified things had bookmarks as their bodies.There was even a strange picture in the middle of the bookmark. Servant clothes? Maid clothes? Anyway, the clothes that were worn by maids of the old were engraved as pictures.\u201cOhh. You pointed it out exactly. These are bookmark maids!\u201dThe librarian went \u2018Ehem\u2019, and assumed the hands-on-hips pose.\u201cThey will be looking over the lot of you until you clear the 30th floor.\u201dThe bookmarks that had maids engraved on it, bowed down.\u201cWhen you want to eat or go to the bathroom, tell the bookmark maids. Though they look like that, they are still quite capable.\u201d\u201cMonster\u2026..right? For starters?\u201dThe librarian covered his mouth with his sleeves.The Constellation\u2019s eyes were smiling.\u201cYou can think of it that way.\u201dThe librarian\u2019s eyes were grinning, but his voice didn\u2019t have the same feel. The Hunters flinched. The voice of the Constellation, which had been consistently bright, was cold for the first time.\u201cEveryone, you should be mindful of a few things while staying here.\u201dThe librarian said.\u201cFirst. Never touch a book without the great me\u2019s permission. Just don\u2019t touch it. These are all hard-earned books that I shed blood and sweat for. These are the one and only Apocalypses in this universe. Bastards who don\u2019t even ask the consent of the owner and touch these books carelessly\u2026\u201d\u201cFuck.\u201dAt that time, a Hunter cursed out.\u201cWhat a load of bullshit? In the end, aren\u2019t you the boss monster, you bastard?!\u201d\u201c\u2026 Hmm.\u201d\u201cHey! You guys arm yourselves! The quest is a whole load of shit, we just have to kill that guy and we\u2019ll be able to clear up to the 30th floor. \u2018Great me\u2019 my ass! If 300 people attack him together, we\u2019ll be able to beat him anyways!\u201dEveryone became noisy.The librarian didn\u2019t particularly stop the instigators. He just smiled and watched silently. Upon seeing the silence of the Constellation, the Hunters became more amped up.\u201cUs too, we can beat that little kid! Even a greenhorn such as the Death King or what not cleared the 20th floor alone.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dWere they trying to win me over?\u201cIs there anything we can\u2019t do?! Huhhh!?\u201dWhen the instigator pointed at me, several people looked towards my direction. Everyone was of different ethnicity. The colors of their eyes were also different. However, the glare in their eyes and the colors of their emotions were the same.Envy. Jealously. Greed.They were all the feelings that I was very familiar with.\u201cYou all, leave me out of this! No, all the top 5 guilds should stand down!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just me, the Hunter also shouted at the Witch and Sword Saint. He even shouted at Heretic Questioner, Count, and other top guild leaders.\u201cI didn\u2019t like the fact that the lot of you monopolized the attack from the 11th floor onwards. Huh? Like only you guys are the representative of the tower. Then you dragged a greenhorn from somewhere and then you framed him up as a new hero or something. You think we don\u2019t know the bullshit you guys are making up?\u201dThe Witch was infuriated.\u201cWho do you think you are talking to now\u2026?!\u201dKuuuuuk.[T/N: Sound of grabbing something.]I grabbed the Witch\u2019s wrist.\u201cBear with it.\u201d\u201cBut, Death King. If you leave those kind of people alone\u2026\u201d\u201cBut for now, bear with it.\u201dI whispered to the Witch.\u201cThis now. Everything is being \u2018live broadcasted\u2019.\u201dThe Witch batted her eyes.\u201cA live broadcast? What are you talking about.\u201d\u201cThey are projecting via hologram videos on Babylon Square.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dIn the past, I couldn\u2019t even step foot on the 21st floor because I didn\u2019t receive a Title. Nevertheless, I knew in detail how the stage was going to be carried out, and what the quest would be about.\u201cIt\u2019s like a television program. People in the plaza are seeing everything we do. Live.\u201d\u201cWhy is that kind of thing\u2026?\u201d\u201cThat Constellation said so. We\u2019re no different from [Characters].\u201dI said softly.\u201cOf course there would be [Viewers] who\u2019d be watching the characters.\u201dThat\u2019s right.I also saw it from the plaza in the past. I watched. Although I couldn\u2019t participate in the raid\u2026 I watched the whole process of how the Hunters with Titles cleared the 21st to the 30th floor.\u2018There will still be a hologram shown in the plaza now.\u2019Every move the people gathered here made would be broadcasted live.The lines we say, and the actions we make.All of it is being watched live by hundreds of thousands of viewers.In the truest sense, we were on the Stage.\u201cDon\u2019t let your guard down just because there\u2019s no one looking. Black Dragon Witch.\u201d\u201cIf you say strange things or show a bad image here, they will remain in the memories of others forever.\u201dThe guild master in front of me immediately understood.How scary it was.\u201c\u2026 Indeed. It isn\u2019t important whether we clear this Stage or not.\u201dI nodded.\u201cYes. \u2018How\u2019 we clear the stage is the most important thing.\u201dDon\u2019t do anything that would cause yourself to be blamed and caught later, even if you actually did it. People, no. In the eyes of our viewers, we really were like the heroes that came out of a book, so we have to act the part and calm ourselves down.\u201cWe are already in the series called [The Great Library].\u201dIt was at that moment.After the quest popped up, I heard a notification that should\u2019ve been heard.Not the voice of the Witch, nor the voice of the librarian, but the voice of the tower.{Welcome, Death King.]I smiled inwardly.[The 20th floor clear reward is being given.]The me yesterday protected the Aegim Empire and the continent.The time had come for me to receive it.2.The tower was harsh on its latecomers.However, as much as it was harsh, it gave a high price to the front-runners.[Normal Stage reward.][Blessing, the grace of the Goddess of Beauty(\u7f8e\u795e) is coming down!][You can observe the favourability of the characters from the 21st to the 30th floor.]The reward didn\u2019t end at that.The returns for completing the hidden quest still remained.[Hidden Stage reward.][Blessing, the grace of the Goddess of Vitality (\u80fd\u795e) is coming down!][You can observe the psyche of the characters from the 21st to the 30th floor.]\u2018Fantastic!\u2019These were perfect bonuses.In this quest, the key was how well you perform with the role you were given.\u2018These bonuses are exactly what I need right now!\u2019To perform a role, it wasn\u2019t enough to be good alone. People other than me. I had to be able to see through the mentality of other characters too.Performing is always about team play, and not solo play.\u2018Status window.\u2019Before fully working on the quest, I checked my status.+Name: Death King(\u6b7b\u738b)Rank: D-ClassSkill (5/6)1.

Only then did I realize that I was still holding on to the Witch\u2019s wrist. While I tried to let go of her wrist as naturally as possible, I recited some decent instructions in my mind.\u2018Character window.\u2019Softly!A hologram popped up in front of my eyes.And I saw a status window for the first time in my life.+Name: Black Dragon Witch(\u9ed1\u8272\u9b54\uc19f)Favorability: 82Favorite Genre: [Romance]Unfavourable Genre: [History]Favorite Characters:[Prince on White Horse], [Young Man], [Wolf Man], [Dazzling Man]Unfavourable Characters: [Psychopath], [Soldier], [Politician], [Incompetent Female Lead]Preferred Plots: [Repay], [Sacrifice for the greater good]Undesired Plots: [Oblivion], [Betrayal], [Delusion of the Female Lead]Psychological State: \u2018If whatever we do is broadcasted at Babylon\u2026 We\u2019ll have to act as a noble figure in the future. Stage Clear is a secondary goal. Mmm. I\u2019m going to have to make some thorough political calculations. After that, the wisest tactic is\u2026\u2019+Uhh.While I was confused and lost my words, the Witch\u2019s expression hardened. She was probably nervous thinking about what to do if some kind of trouble came looking for me.\u2018What is it? Did something happen?\u201d\u201cUhhh. No, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Then I\u2019m glad. If you have any other information I need to know, please tell me quickly. I\u2019m still working on countermeasures in my head.\u201d\u201cYes, got it.\u201dThe Witch turned her head and was deep in thought again.With a very serious look.As I looked at the Witch\u2019s side profile, some kind of emotion hit me.\u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019What was this unidentified sense of guilt?\u2018This feels like\u2026. I had secretly stolen someone\u2019s diary\u2026\u2019-Puhahahaha!Bae Hu-ryeong, who shared my consciousness, was already rolling around.He kicked the air with his feet and burst into laughter.\u2013 White, the prince on a white horse! Prince on a white horse\u2026! Keu! A person who grew up, and maintained the youth of her face, at that age, a prince on a white horse! Hey Zombie! Get a nice horse from somewhere and ride it! You look just like a warrior! Doesn\u2019t a warrior who wears a crown become a prince? Wow, you\u2019ll be soul mates!\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI blatantly glared at Bae Hu-ryeong.\u2013 Hmm? What? Those eyes. Why do you look like you\u2019re looking for a fight?I muttered quietly in my mind.\u2018\u2026Character window.\u2019-Uh? Huh? Hey, Kim Zombie! What are you trying to do right now!? You bastard! HEY!Bae Hu-ryeong was flustered and shook his hands around.But, shaking his hand couldn\u2019t stop the command.In my eyes, the character window of Bae Hu-ryeong was clearly in view.+Name: Sword Emperor (\u528d\u5e1d)Favorability: 59Favorite Genre: [Martial Arts]Unfavourable Genre: [Everything except Martial Arts]Favorite Characters: [Macho], [Rival], [Mother]Unfavourable Characters: [Weak Guys], [Pushovers]Prefered Plot: [Victory], [Cider]Undesired Plot: [Defeat], [Sweet potato]Psychological State: \u2018Fuck!

Mr. Sword Emperor, I didn\u2019t see you that way, but don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re a mamaboy\u2026\u2019-I\u2019ll kill you!Bae Hu-ryeong glared angrily. It wasn\u2019t just a glare, he was completely furious. He desperately struggled. He swung his limbs around and started rampaging.\u2013 I\u2019ll kill you! Fuck! Turn it off right this instant! Forget it! Erase it from your brain, fucker! If you don\u2019t erase it right now, I\u2019ll blow your head away! I will really kill you! I\u2019ll really end our relationship, you hear me, bastard!?It had been a long time since I\u2019ve met Bae Hu-ryeong, but it was the first time I saw him this flustered. Usually, the more disadvantaged someone was, the louder they got. Unlike Bae Hu-ryeong, I was completely relaxed.\u201cNo small talks until the 30th floor, and bow to me. Otherwise, I will open up your Psychological Window whenever I have spare time.\u2019-Hiiikkk\u2026!Bae Hu-ryeong huffed. The snort was great. But no matter how epic his snort was, what could he do? Bae Hu-ryeong could never hit me, and he couldn\u2019t block my abilities too.-Watch out! Someday you\u2019ll suffer badly!\u2018Keukeu.\u2019I wasn\u2019t the least bit scared of the man who asked me to watch out.While I tried out my new bonus, the Hunters continued to split into two different factions.On one side was a radical group that followed the instigator and tried to deal with the [Boss Monster] together. On the other side, including me and the Witch, was a cautious faction who wanted to wait and see what would happen.uThe radical group had about 100 radicals.The cautious faction had about 200 people.\u201cFoolish people.\u201dSword Saint, who had been quiet all this while, opened his mouth.The Old Detective was looking at the radical faction pathetically.\u201cHave you already forgotten that the Constellation just showed you worlds themselves perishing? If he wanted to, that Constellation could throw us into such a world, and slip out leisurely. And still, you\u2019re going to fight with such a being. You\u2019re crazy I see.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a group suicide, I won\u2019t stop you.\u201dWith one comment from the Sword Saint, half of them deserted the radical faction.About 50 Hunters remained in the radical faction.\u201cHey! Don\u2019t be scared!\u201dThe first person who instigated the Hunters shouted.\u201cDeath King also cleared the 10th floor by himself! The 20th floor was also a solo play by him! Originally, all boss monsters were just like that, but the top guilds are doing this to monopolize the profits. If you\u2019re going to live your life shaking your tails at the top 5 guilds, then fuck off!\u201dThat instigator seemed to be a pretty high ranking Hunter.Seeing that there were still 50 people that listened to that Hunter\u2019s words.\u2018Maybe not to the extent of a top guild, but he\u2019s probably a pretty reliable guild master of a small medium-sized guild.\u201dBut the crucial point was that I couldn\u2019t remember the instigator\u2019s face or Title. Flame Emperor, Alchemy Master, Witch, Sword Saint, and more. This came from me, who obsessively remembered all the top rankers.If even I couldn\u2019t remember.\u201cHmm-.\u201dThere was a reason for everything.\u201c-Is all the traffic control done and over with?\u201dThe librarian looked down at the 50 Hunters from the radical faction.Hundreds of books were revolving around the librarian, just like planets revolving around the sun.\u201cOkay then! Fucking boss monster! Fifty of us are enough for a kid like you\u2026!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t really prefer Clich\u00e9s.\u201dThud!The librarian grabbed a book.The title [Epic Tales of the Sealed World] was written on the cover.\u2018Let\u2019s just get it over with quickly.\u201dShiingggg!When the book flipped open, a white light emanated out again. However, this time, the light didn\u2019t stop shining. Somber arms. Countless tentacles oozed out,They swooped up the Hunters from the radical faction.The Hunters let out a scream.\u201cWhat, what\u2019s this!?\u201d\u201cIn this particular Apocalypse, mankind went extinct, and only one wizard survived.\u201dOne person. Two people. Three people.The Hunters from the radical faction were caught by the monster\u2019s tentacles and dragged around into the air.\u201cWell, after going through various adversities, the wizard became more like a tentacle monster than a human. The main character was someone the great me was very fond of. It\u2019s on a higher number among my favorite characters.\u201d\u201cKyaaaaaaaaaakkk!\u201dThe Hunters who were dragged around in the air were soon swallowed up into the book.\u201cSav-, save me!\u201dThe Hunters who luckily managed to avoid the tentacles began to run away, but to no avail. Slurrkkk! Tentacles ten times more than before oozed out from the book. Some Hunters had their wrists, some Hunters had their waist, and some Hunter had their ankles caught by the tentacles.\u201cThis wizard. Basically, the great me\u2019s favorite character specializes in sealing magic. Should I say its a customer and owner relationship? In exchange for the [Materials] I hand over occasionally, the wizard is willing to accept my request.\u201dIn an instant, 50 Hunters were eaten up by the book.The librarian giggled brightly.\u201cJust like right now.\u201dThuckk.Thuckkkkk. Thukkkk. Hututukkk. Tukk tukkk.[T/N: Sound of something falling from the sky, (in this case, the book)]The book that swallowed up the Hunters began to spew something out.Binge eating and vomiting.We held our breaths and looked at the scene unfolding before our eyes. I couldn\u2019t see if from here\u2026 The hundreds of thousands of people gathered in Babylon Square was probably holding their breath just like we did.\u201cOh yeah.\u201dWhat the book spewed out was a huge bookmark.As tall and big as a person.Bookmarks with limbs.\u201cThe wizard\u2019s hobby is to make the products that he made wear maid clothes.\u201dIn the middle of the bookmark, maid clothes were engraved.\u201cI know it\u2019s a little bit perverted.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell what could he have done? All mankind had perished except for himself. If he stayed sane, it would be weirder.\u201d.The Hunters looked around fearfully.50 bookmark maids stood there silently.If we looked around the library a little more widely, it wasn\u2019t just 50, but hundreds. Thousands of bookmarks were doing work while holding mops and tablewares.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Hunters went silent.Counting those in their line of sight was the extent of what they could do.This Great Library stretched beyond the horizon.If we could look at the library as a whole, exactly how many bookmarks would be walking around?\u201cMmmm. It became cleaner. The useless extras have been taken care of.\u201dThud!The librarian closed the book.\u201cNow would you all be more willing to become the main characters?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 \u2013 Bibliomania. (2)Translator: WH Editor: Sasha3.Hunters sat around in the library.\u201cUm\u2026\u201dThe Hunters were sitting in a wide circle. In the middle of it, hundreds of [Apocalypse] were piled up. From now on, they had to choose one from all those books, but no one hastily approached the pile.That was a given. Just a moment ago, their companions were eaten up by the book. And it was 50 people. Everyone was afraid or depressed.If anyone could laugh energetically in this situation, wouldn\u2019t it be likely that they were some kind of nut job?\u201cHahahaha!\u201dSurprisingly, there was such a nut job present.\u201cI can\u2019t believe 50 people got eliminated as soon as we started. This is a big hit from the get-go. \u201dA blonde-haired boy. A certified, top of all nut jobs in our world. Heretic Questioner stroked his chin.\u201cBut there is always a sacrifice needed to go forward. Let\u2019s not forget their sacrifice! We\u2019ll have to work harder to clear the tower!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s cheer up! We\u2019re lucky we\u2019ve only lost 50 people so far when it could\u2019ve almost been 100 people. Instead of grieving for what was lost, we should be happy for what remained!\u201dThe more Heretic Questioner opened his mouth, the more severe the mood became.Bookmark maids still roamed around us. They served hot coffee and black tea that we had no idea about where it came from, and out of 250 hunters, only the Heretic Questioner said, \u201cAh! Thank you!\u201d and accepted it at once.\u201cHmm?\u201dHeretic Questioner sipped the black tea and tilted his head.\u201cEveryone, are you all not going to drink? It\u2019s very delicious though?\u201d\u201cFirst\u2026\u201dI cut off the Heretic Questioner.There was nothing good about letting a psychopath talk for a long time.\u201cHeretic Questioner, please keep your mouth shut for a bit.\u201d\u201cHuh? Why should I?\u201d\u201cThe more you talk, the lower our morale becomes. We\u2019re losing motivation. It\u2019ll be big trouble if our morale drops any more from here on, so please shut up until I say it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cOh. If that happens, it\u2019ll be a big problem.\u201dHeretic Questioner gave me a broad smile.\u201cOkay, Death King! I\u2019ll happily shut up!\u201dThe Hunters stared at the Heretic Questioner and me with a puzzled look.Don\u2019t look at me like that. I just figured out how to deal with that nut job.\u201cNow.\u201dI purposely raised my voice to change the mood.\u201cEveryone. I\u2019m sure you all know now. You can\u2019t just go against that Constellation recklessly. Right now, we have no choice but to behave ourselves and follow the quest that the librarian gave us.\u201dThe Hunters\u2019 eyes slowly gathered on me.Instinctively, I felt a burden, but I swallowed hard.\u2018I\u2019m 3rd rank now.\u2019The third strongest hunter here with the right to speak!I had to get used to getting people\u2019s attention as if I was breathing.I opened my mouth while putting up my best poker face.\u201cBut just because we\u2019re following the quest doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re at a disadvantage. Everyone, please take a look at the quest window.\u201dThe Hunters\u2019 gazes were stuck in the air along with my words.The same hologram I saw would\u2019ve also been reflected in their eyes.+[Remake The World. Volume 1.]Difficulty: To be determined (\u672a\u5b9a)Mission Objective: As there are countless worlds, there is also countless destruction happening. The Constellation \u2018Librarian Bang Gu-seok\u2019 describes this as a Discontinued Serialization. Librarian Bang Gu-seok wants for the worlds that were discontinued for unjust reasons to continue their stories again.First, choose one of the discontinued Apocalypse!If you succeed in saving the world, that world will be registered as your 22nd floor.\u203bHowever, if the mission fails, the 22nd floor will not be opened.+\u201cYou\u2019ve read all of it, right?\u201dThe Hunters nodded. Some of them even answered \u201cYes.\u201d Was it an effect from making the Heretic Questioner shut up? For the time being, no Hunter looked like they would challenge my authority.\u201cThe most important thing here is the last part. [If you succeed in saving the world, that world will be registered as your 22nd floor.] Do you all know what this means?\u201dThe Hunters were puzzled.They still didn\u2019t know how big of a reward this was.I said.\u201cThe rewards will change depending on what kind of world you save. Well, let\u2019s say we saved a world packed full of diamonds! Then, that world becomes our 22nd floor.\u201d\u2018\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe Hunters\u2019 faces began to change drastically.\u201cDiamond is just an example. For people who live in the tower like us, there\u2019s no need to pick that piece of crap. But what if it\u2019s a world buried with an abundance of food, water, and all kinds of ore?\u201d\u201cSelf-sufficiency\u2026\u201dThe Witch murmured.\u201cThen being self-sufficient would really be possible.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s exactly it.\u201dI stood up from my seat. And a pile of books in the middle. I walked towards the Apocalypses that the librarian told us to \u2018Pick from these books\u2019.\u201cHe-, hey now! Death King!\u201dCame the Venomous Snake\u2019s shout from behind my back.\u201cIf you touch that recklessly, then the tentacle monster\u2026!\u201dI picked up a random book from the pile. Hukkk! The Hunters screamed and shut their eyes. There was even a Hunter who ran away because he was afraid that the tentacle monster would pop out again.But even after one, two, and three seconds passed, nothing happened.The Apocalypse laid obediently still in my hands as if it were an ordinary book.\u201cUh, huhhhhhh?\u201dVenomous Snake\u2019s eye silently went wide.\u201cNothing\u2019s happening\u2026?\u201d\u201cHur hur.\u201dThe librarian, who was floating in the air, laughed.\u201cThat\u2019s right! As long as the great me doesn\u2019t activate my powers, the Apocalypses are just plain old books. Of course, there are forbidden books (\u7981\u66f8) that could prove to be dangerous just by touching them. Those books are sealed somewhere secluded, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI nodded.And when I opened the book in my hand, another hologram popped up.It was information about the book.+[Tales of Sormewin Academy]Genre: Romance, FantasyDifficulty Level: D ClassPlayer Limit: 4 to 5 people\u203bThe Serialization is currently suspended.Introduction: Sormewin is a historical magic academy. It\u2019s an ordinary academy where friendship and competition, love, and jealousy comes and goes. This Apocalypse could have remained as an ordinary academy. If only it wasn\u2019t for the World Destruction-class artefact that was sealed in the academy\u2019s basement of all things!Reason for Discontinuation: The evil lady lost her fianc\u00e9 (Crown Prince) to a schoolgirl who was reincarnated twice. She then changed for the worse, and unsealed the artefact, liberating the Great Devils and causing the world to be destroyed.+The reason for discontinuation, in short, the cause of the world\u2019s destruction, was very pitiful.It would\u2019ve been better if the world was destroyed because of meteorites or tsunamis.\u2018What a pity. The world was destroyed because of the children\u2019s love quarrels.\u2019It was obvious why the librarian got angry.Let\u2019s think about it.******(ED/N: Dear readers this is definitely SSS-Class Suicide Hunter, please don\u2019t be confused and keep on reading)\u201cAhhhh.\u201dLike a crack in a blue jewel, the ice-cold eyes of the Crown Prince began to gain an understanding.The long misunderstanding that had driven a wedge between the two of them all this while had finally melted and collapsed after the second life.\u201cMy half was here. Dear Silvia. She was my half.\u201dThe Crown Prince, muttering, let out a sigh and knelt on one knee. Silvia sobbed silently as if holding her breath.The two of them unwittingly realized that they would never forget this moment until they died.At that very moment.With a bang, the Crown Prince burst entirely.\u201cEeeek?\u201dThe next moment, Silvia burst.What came to the consciousness of Silvia as she was blown away, was a flurry of screams.\u201cKyaaaaaaak!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Devil! The Devil has appeared!\u201d\u201cWhat bad luck.\u201dThe world.It was the moment where everything came to an end.******Imagine that the romance novel that you had been reading was discontinued because of something like this. Any reader would\u2019ve been pissed off.It was like that even in a novel, so it would\u2019ve been worse if it was the real world.\u2018Anyways.\u2019This wasn\u2019t important right now.\u201cEveryone! Come here and take a look at this book.\u201dI yelled at the Hunters.\u201cEvery book has a different difficulty level and content. There are levels that we can clear more easily among these books. We have to choose the books that will benefit us the most among these!\u201dSeveral Hunters stood up from their seats.But still, the majority just stared at each other.-Stupid. They\u2019re like that because you\u2019re using honorifics. You still don\u2019t understand how hard it takes for these Hunter bastards to listen?Bae Hu-ryeong said.-There are 250 Hunters you have to deal with right now. 250 people. You\u2019ll have to drop the honorifics to at least make them listen.\u2018Really?\u2019-Every time you level up, you hear [Your presence has become clearer], right. Do you know what that means? It\u2019s [Your pride has grown stronger]. By nature, the higher the level a Hunter has, the stronger their pride will be. They\u2019d never listen to you.Indeed.I gave a declamatory speech that was filled with my aura.\u201cThere are hundreds of Apocalypses here, how can I read them all by myself?! Come and read!\u201dFlinching.Only then did the heavy hips of the Hunters picked themselves up.\u201cListen, everybody!\u201dI continued ordering without a break.\u201cLet\u2019s split into groups. Those that have read some novels or history books, to the left! Those that really don\u2019t know anything about novels or history, to the right! Come on now! Quickly!\u201dTheir steps quickened.Thump thump thump!The people were divided into two sides.\u201cPeople who have read books, divide according to your favourite genres! Romance lovers to the romance group! Fantasy lovers to the fantasy group! If you\u2019re a mystery novel lover, to the mystery novel group! Chop, chop, get to it now!\u201dAt last, the atmosphere of the library became a little busy.Hunters under my command began to go around.\u201cNow. From now on, we\u2019re all going to read!\u201dI picked up an Apocalypse and tapped on it.\u201cWe will divide the hundreds of books into genres. [Romance] group reads romance books. Other groups too, read the books according to your genre! Read the book, and decide for yourself if it\u2019s a hit or a flop.\u201d\u201cHup! Hup!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner shook his arm hard.He was still keeping his mouth shut and following my orders.\u201c\u2026Yes, you can speak.\u201d\u201cDeath King! I don\u2019t know what a flop is! Please tell me the standard! If the story is good, it\u2019s a hit, if the story is bad, is it a flop?\u201d\u201cNo. That\u2019s not it at all.\u201dI opened up an Apocalypse and showed it to him.\u201cFor example, this is a flop.\u201d+[Survive the Volcano!]Genre: Survival, RomanceDifficulty Level: D ClassPlayer Limit: 2 people\u203bThe Serialization is currently suspended.Introduction: This world has been devastated by nuclear warfare. But the vitality of humanity is amazing! Even on the ground where the nuclear warfare broke out, the main character and his lover survived. After overcoming all the adversities and hardships, the main character couple vow to be the new Adam and Eve.Reason for Discontinuation: Of all places, the main character couple had to spend the last night in the active volcano zone. The volcano erupted during the night. The main character and the main character\u2019s lover were smashed to death by a rock that flew from a volcano. Humanity thus perished.+I spoke in a wretched tone.\u201cIt\u2019s not just a common flop, it\u2019s a shitty flop.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dHeretic Questioner tilted his head.\u201cNew Adam and Eve. Isn\u2019t it romantic and nice?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s useless saving this world. It\u2019s a world where there\u2019s already nuclear warfare.\u201dI sighed and closed the book.\u201cWhat can we do if we get a world full of radiation as the 22nd floor? Do you want us all to die of radiation contamination?\u201d\u201cAha.\u201dFor instance, in the past, the Flame Emperor had cleared the Great Library in an amazing way.From the 22nd to 29th floors, he only targeted worlds that had [Lava] or [Volcano].\u2018What a crazy bastard.\u2019The Flame Emperor was immune to fire. Even in a disastrous world where there was flowing lava and volcanic eruptions, he could leisurely take a stroll.He chose the Apocalypses based solely on the criteria of [how easily he can attack].He really didn\u2019t consider what kind of Apocalypse he should have saved so that it\u2019d be a benefit to all of us, not even a little.\u2018If he did well, there was a chance where he\u2019d be able to get eight treasure troves!\u2019At any rate, a man who feeds off his own pride wouldn\u2019t be of help.After all, it\u2019d be a loss to other people living in the tower.\u2018This time, I\u2019ll only pick out the best possible Apocalypses so that it\u2019d benefit us.\u2019Apocalypses where monsters sprang out which could help the Hunters gain combat experience, or an Apocalypses which was filled with rare minerals, or Apocalypses which were set in ruins full of treasures, or an Apocalypse, where seasoned chicken and sweet & sour pork run through the forest and shrimp fritters dance in the sea.No. Let\u2019s cancel the last one. It would be quite scary if it actually exists.Anyway!\u201cBear in mind! It doesn\u2019t matter whether the story is shit or not!\u201dI shouted while handing out books to Hunters.\u201cWhether the main character has cancer, or if the story\u2019s no fun, pay no heed to anything like that. Just read it! Read it from beginning to end, and evaluate whether saving this world will benefit all of us\u2026.\u201dPaused.I paused when I was handing out a book.One Hunter made eye contact with me.\u201c\u2026Excuse me. Black Dragon Witch?\u201d\u201cMmm. What\u2019s wrong?\u201dIt was the Witch.I slowly opened my mouth.\u201cThis is the [Mystery] group.\u201dA gathering of people who enjoyed reading mystery novels normally.For some reason, the Witch was sitting there proudly.This person, didn\u2019t it show that she was a romance fan when the Character Window popped up just now?\u201cI know.\u201dThe Witch nodded as if it was natural.\u201cWould I have sat here without knowing where I was?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026. Black Dragon Witch. Did you always like the mystery genre?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dSlurp.The Witch modestly drank some black coffee.\u201cI\u2019m an intelligent woman.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dCrazy.Why was this guild leader suddenly cosplaying as a normal person? She liked dramas. She liked romance. Anyone who knew her could tell she was an enthusiastic reader of nonsense romances even at a glance.\u2018No way.\u2019I realized something.\u2018Does she not want to let people around her know that she\u2019s obsessed with Romance\u2026?\u2019Come to think of it, the [Romance] group particularly had very few Hunters. There was not even a single man. On the other hand, for some reason, the [Martial Arts] group was full of men.I assure you, less than a handful among them actually read Martial Arts novels.\u2018Wow.\u2019My mind went blank.\u2018Are these people cosplaying even in this situation!?\u2019-I told you.Bae Hu-ryeong murmured sullenly.-High-level Hunters feed on their pride. Besides, they\u2019re all people who received a Title. They\u2019d rather die than lose face. Didn\u2019t you see? Just now, the 50 people that were doing a suicide special all at once? They\u2019re all crazy dudes.It drove me crazy.\u201cNo, Black Dragon Witch\u2026 No matter how much you want to\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean no matter what?\u201dThe Witch asked back calmly.Her calm face had the feel of an impregnable fortress.I thought desperately of what to say, and I spoke slowly.\u201cNo\u2026 I thought you were a pretty romantic person\u2026 That\u2019s what I thought. So to see that you aren\u2019t in the [Romance], but in the [Mystery] group, is a little surprising\u2026.\u201dThe hand with which she was drinking coffee paused mid-action.\u201cHmmm. Is that so?\u201dHer voice was exactly the same as usual.\u201cDo I look like someone who goes well with romance?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s why it\u2019s weird that you\u2019re not in the [Romance] group but somewhere else\u2026.It feels like you\u2019re wearing something that doesn\u2019t suit you\u2026.\u201d\u201cHaa.\u201dThe Witch put down the coffee cup and stood up.\u201cI can\u2019t help it if Death King says so. I\u2019ve never read romance novels in my life, but yes. Should I take this chance to get used to a new genre this time? It\u2019s the right attitude as a Hunter to challenge new things no matter what the task is.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just as you\u2019ve said\u2026.\u201d\u201cMmhmm. Got it.\u201dThe Witch headed for the [Romance] group with light steps.It was like a cowboy walking to the far side of the wilderness in a western movie.I couldn\u2019t help but to look at her back with a very subtle feeling.\u201cWell done, Death King!\u201dHeretic Questioner looked at me with sparkling eyes. He was sitting in the Mystery group too.\u201cWhen the Black Dragon Witch sits somewhere, she doesn\u2019t get up easily. Aha. For real, an incredible rookie showed up!\u201d\u201c\u2026Ten Thousand Temple Guild Leader. Do you read mystery novels, too?\u201dHeretic Questioner smiled like an angel.\u201cI know Sherlock Holmes!\u201d\u201cOh.

What\u2019s wrong, Death King?\u201dThe Crazy Psycho tilted his head.I was pondering over how to deal with it.Then I took out a pen and wrote down some letters on the back of the hand of the Heretic Questioner.[Fairy Tale]I said with a solemn expression.\u201cHeretic Questioner-nim.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re in the [Fairy Tale] group from now on.\u201d\u201cFairy Tale, you say!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Heretic Questioner-nim is the only person in this group. You have to verify and screen all the books that come into the group alone, Heretic Questioner-nim.\u201d\u201cOhhh! What a heavy responsibility!\u201dThe Crazy Psycho\u2019s eyes glistened.I nodded.\u201cYes, it\u2019s very important. So I\u2019ll leave it in your good hands.\u201d\u201cAhahaha. Don\u2019t worry! Death King. I\u2019ll screen it properly!\u201dThat\u2019s right.Out of the hundreds of Apocalypses, there was not a single fairy tale.I searched thoroughly to see if there was any other Hunter who tried to cosplay as an ordinary person. The result was unbelievable. Out of the 250 people, as many as 100 of them were lying about their taste.\u2019These crazy assholes\u2026.\u2019In the end, it took three hours just to split them into groups.As many as 112 cosplayers were sent to their rightful places.But even for him\u2026.As the last one, he couldn\u2019t help but keep silent.+Name: Venomous Snake (\u6bd2\u80fd)Favourability: 32Favourite Genres: [Otherworldly Fiction], [Strongest Fiction], [Destruction Fiction], [Harem Fiction] \u2026Unfavourable Genres: [Political Fiction], [Crime Fiction]Favourite Characters: [Older Sister], [Younger Sister], [Married Woman], [Pure], [Coy], [Girlish Youths] \u2026Unfavourable Character: [Mafia], [Gangsters], [Blonde-haired and tanned bully]Preferred Plots: [I\u2019ve been summoned to this world, and it turns out that I have the blood of the world\u2019s strongest Dragon and the Devil Realms strongest Empress, I\u2019m going to show you what a purely peerless cheat character is, but something seems to be the problem?], [I think my younger sister became a God of Creation for me, but I just want to be an ordinary high school student who just wants to have a quiet day, and it is only troubling me] and as follows [Cheat], [Peerless], [Harem], [Well well, it seems I have no choice but to come forward]Undesired Plots: [NTR]Psychological status: \u2018Wow, fuck.

Continue reading\u2026.\u201c\u201cOkay.\u201dI turned my back and walked feebly.I realized for sure when I came to the 21st floor this time.The top-ranking Hunters were all crazy.And I had to carry these crazy madmen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 \u2013 Bibliomania. (3)Translator: WH Editor: Sasha4.Find a book that has high chances of having a popular plot.This was what I had instructed the Hunters to do.\u201cDo you all understand?\u201dI roamed among the Hunters and said,\u201cIf the difficulty is too hard, it won\u2019t do. But then it shouldn\u2019t be too easy, too. An Apocalypse with a suitable difficulty! In addition to that, choose one that will give us a suitable reward.\u201dFollowing my instructions, 250 Hunters began reading the Apocalypses.As if it documented the imprints of the world itself, the volume of each Apocalypse was so extensive. Even when all of the Hunters were reading it, it was never-ending.\u201cDeath King, it\u2019s strange.\u201dThe only exception was the Heretic Questioner, who did not have a single book to read.On the back of the Crazy Psycho\u2019s hand, it still said \u2018Fairy Tale\u2019.\u201cWhat is?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the only one who doesn\u2019t have an apocalypse. Is fairy tale a minor genre?\u201d\u201cEyyy, no way. There may be people who have never read fantasy, and some may have never read romance, but I\u2019m sure everyone has heard of fairy tales. It\u2019s a majority even among the majorities.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. Hmm. But why isn\u2019t a single book coming to me\u2026.?\u201dCrazy Psycho tilted his head.\u2018Cause there\u2019s no fairy tale ending in the destroyed worlds. You Natural.\u2019[T/N: It\u2019s a short form for his small nickname that Death King gave, the full name is Natural Born Crazy Psycho (literally this was what he called him).]These words almost rose to the top of my throat, but I held it in.And pretended to know nothing.\u201cWho knows? Just wait a little longer. Out of all these books, there should at least be one that has fairy-tales as it\u2019s genre.\u201d\u201cHmm. That\u2019s certainly true. I guess I\u2019m a little impatient. I\u2019ll wait calmly!\u201dCrazy Psycho walked to a corner and sat there. I knew that the day when he would be given a fairy tale book would never come, the Witch also knew, and all the other Hunters knew too.\u201cHey, religious brat.\u201dLet\u2019s correct it.It seemed that the Emperor of Light Novel did not know.\u201cYes, Chen Mu-mun Master? Did you call me?\u201d\u201cThis seems to be a fairy tale. There was a book mixed into the Martial Arts group.\u201d\u201cOh hooo! Thank you!\u201dHeretic Questioner received an Apocalypse from the Venomous Snake. A bright smile, as if it had been made by grinding angels and saints together, hung around his lips.It was a little scary.\u201cThen Death King, I\u2019ll get to reading too! Ahhaa, I wonder what kind of Apocalypse this will be!\u201d\u201cAhhh, yes\u2026..That, what\u2019s the title of that Apocalypse?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s called [Me and Our Scapegoat]!\u201dThe title was also a little scary.In the end, all the groups received books. And they started reading.Some time passed and then it was mealtime.\u201cUghhh.\u201d\u201cEy-, I think my eyes are going to fall apart.\u201dAnguished groans were coming from here and there.It was to the extent that everyone just took and ate the sandwiches and black tea that the bookmarks maids prepared without a single complaint this time.\u201cDeath King\u2026\u201dThe Witch in charge of the [Romance] group was no exception.\u201cI, I can understand how that Constellation feels.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m talking about these Apocalypses. They all got discontinued at the climax scene.\u201dThe Witch looked exhausted.\u201cAs soon as the Female Lead confesses to the Male Lead, the meteor comes falling down. As soon as they held hands and kissed each other, aliens suddenly invaded. It\u2019s all messed up! Let\u2019s disregard the meteors, but why the hell are there alien invasions in a court romance comedy?\u201d\u201cFurthermore,\u201d said the Witch.\u201cIt\u2019s even worse because up until it gets discontinued, it\u2019s so interesting. The main character is charming and even the story is interesting\u2026 It\u2019s just the ending is rubbish! It\u2019s a perfect course meal, but when I cut the cutlet from the main dish, it feels like something would pop out\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to tell me what\u2019s going to pop out. Can\u2019t you see I\u2019m eating a tonkatsu sandwich right now?\u201d[T/N: Tonkatsu is basically pork cutlet]\u201cAhh, I\u2019m sorry. Death King. You\u2019re right, sorry for not being careful with my words while you were eating\u2026. No, but, I must tell you, what this feeling is!\u201d\u201cThis is all being broadcasted live. Witch-nim, live broadcast, okay?\u201dThe Witch laughed and shut her mouth. This person really, even when she tried to make eye contact with the one-eyed giant zombie a while back, she always lost her temper at strange moments.Anyway, it was a relief as the moment I finished the last bite of the Tonkatsu sandwich, the Witch looked around and brought her lips closer to my ear.\u201cWhat this feeling is\u2026\u2026\u201dWill the viewers in the middle of Babylon Square hold their breath, while watching the Witch whisper in my ear?I could hardly breathe when I heard her whispering. It was something that made me not want to look at the Tonkatsu sandwich for at least a month.Oh, Dear God. Please save me\u2026\u2026.[Shiny is giving her best effort to save you.]I wished that the Goddess, who couldn\u2019t even save her own world, would just stay silent\u2026\u2026.Of course, the God of the Great Library did not save me either. Instead, Bang Gu-seok, the librarian, smiled as he floated around in the air.\u201cFinally, you lot seem to understand the pain the great me had suffered.\u201dThe appearance of the librarian was that of a child. But the laughter on the face of the Constellation now was not childlike at all. It was a smile of a gourmet who lost his taste because he couldn\u2019t overcome the sweet and salty combination of life.\u201cI wont hide it any longer. These 683 volumes of Apocalypses which I have allowed you to touch. Even in my Great Library, they\u2019re Magic Grimoires(\u9b54\u529f\u66f8) that boast a particularly destructive power.\u201d\u201cMagic Grimoires?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. While being extremely exciting they\u2019re so interesting, that the readers cannot help but love these books.\u201dThe librarian\u2019s laughter resonated gloomily.\u201cBut that\u2019s all there is to it! Even though it\u2019s so interesting, you lot will never be happy with it. No, it\u2019s even more unfortunate as it\u2019s so interesting! Because all these Magic Grimoires have a shitty ending!\u201dThe Witch swallowed her saliva.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you chose only those kinds of books on purpose? To inflict the same pain on us\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou may think of it that way.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the only thing I can think of.\u2026\u201d\u201cNow then! I hope you lot fall into this hell of discontinued books and struggle with eternal pain like the great me! Come on! Hurry and suffer!\u201dThe librarian laughed.Some Hunters trembled with fear.\u201cAre you perhaps a demon?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe you purposely let us read only the masterpieces that got discontinued. You\u2019re crazy.\u201d\u201cThis deserves heavenly punishment\u2026!\u201dLater, it turned out that they all originally had the hobby of reading novels. I didn\u2019t really know, but for novel lovers, the librarian\u2019s remarks were very frightening.It was then.\u201cAhh. Hun-, Hunter-nim.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dI heard a familiar voice from somewhere.As I turned my head, one of the members of the [Fantasy] group was waving his hand. For a while, I wondered who that woman was waving at, and soon after I recalled her face.\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Aren\u2019t you Sajang-nim?\u201d[T/N: Sajang-nim refers to boss/president.]A Hunter, who would later grow to become the Ministry of Alchemy Master.The Alchemist who made me an elixir was here.\u201cDid Sajang-nim also receive a Title too?\u201d\u201cit-, It happened by chance. Though it\u2019s a tasteless Title such as \u2018Alchemist\u2019\u2026. Ehehe.\u201dThe alchemist who became an \u2018Alchemist\u2019 smiled awkwardly.I was a little surprised.\u2018The Ministry of Alchemy Master already received her Title?\u2019No matter how great of a Hunter she was, the woman in front of her had been wandering around the slums until recently. \u2018Title\u2019. It was a little early for her to have made an admirable achievement.Even me, who was armed with fraud skills, I only managed to get a \u2018Title\u2019 after doing crazy things repeatedly, as expected, as the twig is bent, so grows the tree?[T/N: as the twig is bent, so grows the tree is an idiom that means a promising person that stands out even when they\u2019re young.]\u201cYou\u2019re really amazing, Sajang-nim. How did you get a Title in such a short time? As expected, my eyes are never wrong. At first glance, I knew that Sajang-nim would succeed. I did a profitable investment.\u201d\u201cN-, no! I\u2019m not amazing at all!\u201dThe Alchemist shook her dry right hand.\u201cI\u2019m serious. I\u2019m not being modest or anything\u2026 All I did was stay still and I got a Title.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI-, I also don\u2019t know what happened. A few days ago, I suddenly heard a sound, [The item you produced has helped save the world], and I was given a Title. Ugh. I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re probably really baffled right\u2026?\u201d\u2018Ahhh.\u2019The Alchemist looked like she didn\u2019t know what she was talking about even after she said it. But I was different. I realized the truth of the situation upon hearing her words.\u201cIt\u2019s because of the elixir you made for me!\u201dThe cause was the elixir I took when I was fighting the Devil King.In my bloody fight with the Devil King, I properly felt the effects of the elixir. Thanks to it maximizing my senses, I was able to watch the Devil King swinging his sword in slow-motion.\u2018What the? Then\u2026.\u2019In other words.\u2018Have I been carrying her all this while?\u2019[T/N: Carry in this context is like the gaming term, in other words, our MC carried her by using the item she made, that was why she could get a Title.]It was like giving someone a bus ride unintentionally.The Alchemist wriggled his fingers as she didn\u2019t know that.\u201cRe-, Really what\u2019s amazing is not me, but you, Hunter-nim! Ah. I should call you the Death King now\u2026Death King-nim is indeed the awesome one. Up till a few days ago, you were out of the rankings, but you went up to 3rd rank at once! It\u2019s such a great, great honour for me to get to know someone like you, Death King-nim! I really wanted to tell you this!\u201d\u201cEyyy, what do you mean? I just have good luck, that\u2019s all\u2026.\u201dAs she scratched the back of her head awkwardly, the Alchemist went \u201cEhehe.\u201d and clasped her hands behind her back.\u201cDeath King-nim, if you need anything, please tell me! As long as I can do it, I\u2019ll help you all I can!\u201dWow.What\u2019s this, this person?Perhaps she was an angel?-Hey Zombie. Can\u2019t you raise the hurdle a little bit higher for judging people as angels?\u2018Mr. Sword Emperor, I\u2019m just trusting people. No matter how much I get betrayed, I can\u2019t stop believing in people. It\u2019s not my sin for carrying such a warm heart.\u2019-You\u2019re speaking bullshit today as well. In English, it\u2019s called a hot-dog sound.[T/N: Literally, he said hot-dog sound.]Let\u2019s pretend I didn\u2019t hear the last bullshit.5.It\u2019s been four days since we started reading.We finally succeeded in reading every single volume of Apocalypses.Every Hunter announced that they had completed reading (\u5b8c\u8b80).\u201cIn [Romance] Group, we recommend a total of four books.\u201d\u201cThe [SF] Group recommends two books.\u201d\u201cIn the [Mystery] group\u2026.\u201dEach group announced their recommended masterpiece.Moderate difficulty. Adequate reward.Recommendations that fit these two criteria were listed.\u201cMy [Fairy Tale] group will recommend this!

But a special power source was required to maintain the Utopia. The power source needed were the screams of suffering of an innocent child who bears no crimes. Though it was a pity, for the perfect happiness of 17 million people, 1 innocent child should bear with it, right? Thanks to the meticulously developed torture techniques and life-saving treatments, about five years\u2019 worth of screams were able to be extracted from each child. Such efficiency!Reason for Discontinuation: 118,000 years had passed since the creation of Utopia. Eventually, all the innocent children were used up. The Utopia, which lost its power source, came to a stop.+I\u2019ll have to stop by that Apocalypse regardless of the level of difficulty or reward being given.However, there was a separate Apocalypse that caught the eye right now.\u201cThe [Martial Arts] group strongly recommends this masterpiece.\u201dThe Sword Saint said.Sword Saint was the team leader of the martial arts genre. Unlike someone who appeared as a martial arts lover but instead lived as an Emperor of Light Novel, the Sword Saint was indeed a connoisseur of martial arts.The old man flipped opens an Apocalypse.\u201cThis is the book.\u201d+[The Chronicles of Heavenly Demon(\u5929\u9b54)]Genre: Martial Arts, FusionDifficulty Level: B ClassPlayer Limit: 2 to 4 people\u203bThe Serialization is currently suspended.Introduction: Murim. A world of those who revere Mu, those who use Mu, those who strive to attain Mu! A Heavenly Demon descended here and tried to unify Murim. A Demonic Cult(\u9b54\u654e) brought together centering on the Heavenly Demon. The opposing forces who go against this Demonic Cult. Fighting over the control of the world\u2026would be what they would\u2019ve done.[T/N: Murim(\u6b66\u6797) is the Martial Arts World, Mu(\u6b66) is basically Martial Arts.]If it wasn\u2019t for the sudden super epidemic.Reason for Discontinuation: An unidentified epidemic went rampant in the world, causing the Heavenly Demon to die. The Demonic Cult was annihilated. The other forces were also destroyed. End.+[T/N: I know, it reminds us of a certain manhwa/novel. But I just had to!]\u201cThe reason I recommend [Chronicles of Heavenly Demon] is simple.\u201dSaid the Sword Saint.\u201cThere\u2019s a character called Heavenly Demon in this world. It is the Murim, where the strongest of strongest Martial Arts Scriptures are gathered at. Therefore, there will be a huge hidden treasury (\u79d8\u5eab) at the stronghold of the Demonic Cult. Well. In short, a library or something would\u2019ve been built.\u201dThe Sword Saint had an awkward look. It was because all the people who were not part of the [Martial Arts] group were saying in reaction, \u2018Martial Arts Scriptures? Hidden Treasury? What the hell is he talking about?\u2019 In the end, the Sword Saint gave up on using martial arts terminology and used words that were easier to understand.\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that the Martial Arts Scriptures are books that contain the secrets of a skill. If we succeed in saving this world, we will be able to get a library where the best skills in the world are stored. It\u2019s a chance for our Hunters to be a level stronger.\u201dThe Hunters\u2019 eyes glistened.\u201cMartial Arts huh.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean we can get new skills?\u201d\u201cWell. It\u2019s really rare to be able to learn skills\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to learn the way to be strong!\u201dEveryone\u2019s mood was pretty good. People who valued individual strength, just like the Sword Saint, responded particularly positively. Right now, our priority was to be strong. These claims were convincing.Of course, it was a good story for me, too.\u2018Isn\u2019t that pretty good?\u2019I stroked my chin.There must be a lot of Masters that fly around in Murim. If I die once by the hands of those Masters\u2026 Wow. Wouldn\u2019t there be an A-Class skill even if I picked poorly?\u2019-Hey Zombie. Are you afraid no one would know you\u2019re a Zombie, why are those screwed up thoughts all you have filled in your head?\u2018A world I want to destroy just appeared. But it\u2019s difficult with my current strength now.\u2019The Sword Emperor silently shut his mouth.Instead, another being spoke up.[Shiny notifies you that she sensed a vestige.]The sword on my waist was suddenly vibrating.\u2018What do you mean a vestige? What vestige?\u2019[Shiny says her sister is very close.]\u201cSister, you say?\u201dShiny\u2026 the so-called Constellation \u2018Goddess of Protection\u2019 was split and sealed within five swords. One of the swords was on my waist.Even Shiny doesn\u2019t know where the rest of the swords disappeared to.But to be able to sense the vestige of her sister swords nearby.\u2018Where? Where did you sense it?\u2019I looked around.The Great Library of All Things. The bookshelves(\u66f8\u67b6) that continued beyond the horizon. Each bookshelf was huge. Looking up, it was as high as a tower. Of course, I couldn\u2019t see anything besides books.[Shiny advises that you focus your eyes ahead instead of looking around the wrong place.]\u201cIn front of my eyes? There\u2019s only Sword Saint in front of my eyes\u2026\u2026 Wait a minute.\u2019Apocalypse.A book containing a world.\u2018Is it perhaps in there?\u2019The Holy Sword vibrated.[Shiny affirms and says \u201cYes, warrior.\u201d][Shiny says she feels her sister\u2019s presence from the book that the Sword Saint is holding!]At that moment, my next destination was decided.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 \u2013 Expedition Without Hopes Or Dreams (1)Translator: WH Editor: Sasha1.A bathroom had already been set up in the Great Library.\u201cOkay.\u201dAfter washing my face at the sink, I said.\u201cBefore we go to the Murim\u2026 Let\u2019s just start with dying once.\u201dSilence flowed around. There was no one else but me in the bathroom. But there was a ghost and a sword, and they responded to me.-What do you mean by okay?[Shiny doesn\u2019t understand your intentions.]Bae Hu-ryeong batted his eyes, and the Holy Sword\u2019s light glimmered.\u201cLefanta Aegim. The first Emperor of the Empire and the one who made the Goddess of Protection into Shiny.\u201d[Shiny pointed out that you were the one who named her \u201cShiny\u201d.\u2026.]\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of guy he is, but he could travel back and forth between the various worlds.\u201dI put on my overcoat. It was a custom-made suit gifted to me by the Witch before the press conference. Looking at my reflection in the mirror, it made me look like a fresh recruit who was ready to go to work.Strangely, this appearance gave me a sense of psychological stability.\u201cThink about it. Shiny, you were in the world of the Aegim Empire, right? But the other sword is in the Murim world. That means Lefanta Aegim had [The ability to cross-over worlds].\u201d-Hooooohhh.\u201cHe must be a munchkin-like dude.\u201dI touched the shaft of the Holy Sword on my waist.\u201cHe\u2019s capable enough to establish an Empire, and he\u2019s strong enough to split and seal a Constellation. He even has the ability to cross over into this world. It\u2019s not a good idea to blindly jump into the Murim without any plan to look for fragments of the Holy Sword.\u201dI needed to be a little more cautious.\u201cI\u2019m not invincible (\u7121\u6575) either.\u201dThat\u2019s right.In fact, lately\u2026 I was a little on edge.Should I say I was worried about my current self?I was worried that if I relaxed even a little bit, my \u2018confidence\u2019 would turn into \u2018arrogance\u2019.\u201cI rose to 3rd rank in the Hunter ranking. I almost single handedly defeated the Devil King. In the city, the people only talked about me, and now I\u2019m even giving orders to Hunters that carry Titles.\u201d-So what?\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll let my guard down if I make a blunder. \u201dThere were up to 100 floors in the tower.As of right now, I was just a Hunter who had only reached the 21st floor.It was too early to relax just because of the success I had right now.\u2018The Flame Emperor was also hunted by me because he let his guard down.\u2019Because he had a skill that \u2018revived\u2019 him even if he died, [Returners Clockwork Watch]. It was a crazy cheat skill that looked as if there was no way to subdue it. However, what happened to Yoo Soo-ha, the Flame Emperor who had such a crazy cheat ability?\u2018He died.\u2019What\u2019s more, after his death, he even danced a big round of Kozatsky dance in front of the world\u2019s army.It was a very good example that no matter how strong a Hunter was, he should not let his guard down.-No. That\u2019s because Zombie, you\u2019re quite the devilish bastard\u2026.\u201cAnyways, I\u2019m not going to jump into [Chronicles of Heavenly Demon] without any countermeasures. I need to know what kind of bastard Lefanta Aegim was. Right now, I really don\u2019t have any information about it.\u201dPreparedness averts peril.[T/N: It\u2019s an idiom\uc720\ube44\ubb34\ud658 (\u6709\u5907\u65e0\u60a3) which basically means, with all precautions taken, one would be safe. Or it could also mean better safe than sorry.]Why was there a fragment of the Holy Sword in Murim out of the blue, and not in the world of Aegim Continent? What was the munchkin named Lefanta Aegim even thinking, and for what purpose did he split and scatter the [Goddess of Protection]?I wanted to at least get the minimum amount of information before entering the next Stage.-Well, it\u2019s not a bad mindset to think before you leap.[T/N: it\u2019s \ub3cc\ub2e4\ub9ac\ub3c4 \ub450\ub4e4\uae30\uace0 \uac74\ub10c\ub2e4\ub294, a Korean Idiom that means to think carefully before you commit to your next action.]Bae Hu-ryeong tilted his head.-How exactly are you going to prepare? Just like you said, you don\u2019t know anything about the guy called Lefanta or whatever it is. There\u2019s also no way to find out.\u201cYou\u2019re right about me not knowing anything. But\u2026\u201dI tapped the Holy Sword with my finger.\u201cYou\u2019re wrong about there being no way to find out.\u201d-What?\u201cEven if it looks like this, this sword is the [Goddess of Protection]. Though it\u2019s been divided into five fragments, it\u2019s undoubtedly a Constellation.\u201dI grinned mischievously.\u201cA question now. If I stab myself with this sword, would that count as suicide? Or is it murder by the Constellation?\u201dBae Hu-ryeong\u2019s eyes widened.He looked as if it was something unthinkable.-Huh? Huhhhhhhh?\u201cIt could be suicide or murder. Let\u2019s say the odds are fifty-fifty, and I don\u2019t know which one it is yet, but\u2026 It\u2019s worth testing out.\u201dShashingggg.[T/N: the sound of pulling a sword out of its sheath.]I took the Holy Sword out of its sheath. Then I heard a desperate voice.[Shiny sincerely asks the warrior to reconsider once more.]\u201cWhy?\u201d[Shiny strongly asserts that it is embarrassing for her past to be seen by another person and that she would like to protect her privacy.]I raised the corners of my lips.\u201cEyyy, there\u2019s no such thing as privacy between us, right? I\u2019m also showing my personal life to you, broadcasted live 24 hours a day. You should be fair.\u201d[Shiny is begging you to stop\u2026\u2026]Shlickkkk!The Holy Sword pierced my body.The next moment, I was sure I succeeded in the fifty-fifty gamble.[You have died.][Your death has satisfied the skill condition.][Goddess of Protection\u2019s skill is currently sealed and cannot be acquired.]It was a bit disappointing that I couldn\u2019t copy her skills.But what I was trying to get right now was not a skill.[You are currently a D-Class Hunter.][You will receive a penalty due to your skill.][The trauma of your enemy is being reenacted.][The extremity is Moderate (\u4e2d). Vengeful Ghost Road.]Shinggggg!The scene I had hoped for unfolded before my eyes.\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022-Your long journey finally came to an end.I could hear a beautiful voice.-I knew you could do it. Warrior-nim.It was a woman I had never seen before. But somehow I realized right away who she was.The [Goddess of Protection] that wasn\u2019t sealed in the blade.It was a Constellation that could fully control her power.-Yes.A man. A silver-haired nobleman, probably whom the Goddess was referring to as a warrior, was sitting on a rustic jade throne. From the chin upwards, there was a hint of fatigue on his face. It was the Empire\u2019s first Emperor, Lefanta Aegim who replied to her.\u2018Is that dude Lefanta Aegim?\u2019The man opened his lips.-It seemed like it was just a few days ago that I was taken aback by the sudden summoning. Before I knew it, I\u2019ve become an Emperor that unified the Continent. Life is full of surprises.-Hurhur. I feel refreshed too. At first, you were a normal human who really didn\u2019t know anything. Now, you\u2019re stronger than me. No, most Gods wouldn\u2019t even be able to hold a candle against you\u2026.It was then.-Huh? What the-.Bae Hu-ryeong, who was looking at the trauma scene with me made a sound.-It feels like I\u2019ve seen that bastard before?\u2018Huh?\u2019-I mean that blonde-haired dude. Even at a glance, I can recognise, he\u2019s definitely the Constellation Killer (\u6bba\u5929\u661f).Bae Hu-ryeong muttered as if it was strange.I was surprised at the fact that Bae Hu-ryeong had met Lefanta Aegim before.\u2018What does Constellation Killer mean?\u2019-It\u2019s that bastard\u2019s Title. He got that Title because he was a crazy bastard that only went around looking for the Constellations and crushing them.Crushing the Constellations?\u2013 Don\u2019t you see? The tower is connected to the worlds. From the 50th floor, you have to compete with Hunters from all over the world.\u2018Oh, really?\u2019-Mmhmmm. And that [Constellation Killer] was a bastard that was cooped up on the 50th floor.Bae Hu-ryeong said.-He would never climb the tower, and just stayed locked up on the 50th floor all the time, and when the words of a Constellation being there came by, he\u2019d chase after them immediately. I\u2019m sure that there are at least a few hundred Constellations that were killed by him.\u2018\u2026\u2026then Lefanta Aegim is also a Hunter?\u2019-That\u2019s right. I was wondering what kind of world such a crazy madman was born in, that brat. So he\u2019s from Aegim.Bae Hy-ryeong murmured.-I never thought I\u2019d see an old connection in a place like this. Phew.\u2018Uhhhh. What was the relationship between the two of you\u2026?\u2019-What else could our relationship be? We had a proper fight, that\u2019s what our relationship was. He was strong, that I\u2019ll give him, but he couldn\u2019t dare match me.The trauma scene kept unfolding even in the midst of our chatter.The Goddess of Protection opened her mouth.-What do you plan to do from now on, Warrior-nim? There are no longer any Gods(\u795e\u9748) and Demons(\u60e1\u9748) that can block Warrior-nim\u2019s path. Your long journey is now\u2026-Constellation.-Yes?-It\u2019s neither God nor Demon. It\u2019s Constellation.Lefanta Aegim stood up from his jade throne.-The world belongs to humans, not to the Constellations.Lefanta Aegim looked back at the goddess.A dark red Aura blazed forth from the Emperor\u2019s body.\u2013 \u2026Warrior-nim? Why are you suddenly using your Aura\u2026.?With an exhausted look, the Founding Emperor of the Empire seemed to be agonizing.It wasn\u2019t for long.-I won\u2019t kill you. Because you\u2019ve been helping me up till now.A red Aura swoop over the goddess.-I will split and seal your existence. If I do that, you won\u2019t be able to regain your power again. And when the Constellation is gone\u2026\u2026.The latter part of his words couldn\u2019t be heard because of the piercing scream.The goddess\u2019s existence was being torn apart in front of us.-I\u2019m sorry.Lefanta Aegim said.-But this is the right way.After the goddess\u2019s scream faded away, the trauma moved away from us in a flash.[Trauma reenactment finished.][Confirming that the subject\u2019s psyche (\u81ea\u6211) is maintained.][The penalty is ending.]\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u201c\u2026\u2026What\u2019s this, this guy?\u201dAfter coming back to the day before, I mumbled in the bathroom that I came back to again.\u201cI thought I would see what kind of guy he was after getting a glimpse of the past through the trauma\u2026 Now I\u2019m confused even more after watching it. Hey, Shiny. Why did your old master seal you?\u201d[Shiny replied sullenly, saying she doesn\u2019t know either.]The Holy Sword glowed lightly.Was it because she was down?The light of the Holy Sword seemed unusually weak.[The Lefanta Aegim, who she remembers, was a man of few words, but he was a righteous warrior. Shiny expresses that she had no idea why he sealed her, and why he left behind the Empire that he founded.]The mystery only got worse.-I told you. The higher the levels of the Hunters are, the crazier they are, okay?Bae Hu-ryeong shrugged.-Don\u2019t try to understand those crazy madmen. If you peek into the abyss, you will fall into the abyss yourself. Become strong just like me, and crush all the fuckers you don\u2019t like, whether it is Constellation Killer or whoever!I sighed.\u201cWell. It\u2019s considered a harvest just by knowing his face.\u201dAnd I was certain of one fact.Lefanta Aegim. The so-called [Constellation Killer] would be hostile as soon as he saw me.Because I was carrying around the fragments of the Goddess of Protection that he sealed away.\u201cHmmmm.\u201dI wrinkled my forehead while looking in the mirror.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to meet on the 50th floor anyway, I\u2019d like to take care of it in advance\u2026.\u201d-Hold your horses. You\u2019re no match for him with your current ability! He\u2019s just weaker than me, but that guy is a master among masters too. Also, if you already have time to worry about the 50th floor, how about you clear the 22nd floor, you wimp!\u201cEhem.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t wrong, so I quietly repeated the same day.The next day. The Hunters picked out the \u201922nd floor\u2019 after reading all the Apocalypses. [Chronicles of Heavenly Demon] was chosen without difficulty because it was none other than the Sword Saint himself who recommended it.\u201cHoooh? I see you all chose Martial Arts as your first genre.\u201dThe librarian watched us make our decision and meaningfully laughed.\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad choice! Although it may not exactly be the same Murim you lot know of, it is the same in that there are martial arts and strong people. Depending on how you lead the story, you might even gain a Miraculous Encounter(\u5947\u7de3). Martial Arts that are priceless\u2026 According to the expression you lot use, you may even be able to learn \u2018Skills\u2019.\u201dOhhhhhhhhh, the Hunters got excited.Everyone was in high spirits and yet the librarian immediately sprayed ashes on the mood.[T/N: \u2018sprayed ashes\u2019 is a Korean slang for ruining a mood.]\u201cHowever, all things are high-risk, high-returns! That\u2019s how strong the \u2018enemy\u2019 characters are. Needless to say, but if you enter the Apocalypse and lose your life, you will actually die in reality. Of course, you won\u2019t be able to escape from the Apocalypse until you\u2019ve completed the \u2018ending\u2019 properly!\u201dThe Hunters shut their mouths.It was a given. Unless you had an unusual skill like me, death always had the power to shut people up.\u201c[Chronicles of Heavenly Demon] has a play limit of 2 to 4 people. Now! Who\u2019s going to be part of the characters of this Apocalypse?\u201dThe Hunters\u2019 eyes naturally turned towards the top rankers.Among them, I was the one who garnered the most attention. The reason was simple. It was because, over the past few days, I ordered and directed the Hunters around as if I was some sort of representative.With power comes great responsibility.\u201cI\u2019ll take part.\u201dAnd I had no intention of running away from my responsibilities.At my quick answer, the guild masters smiled delightfully, as if saying \u2018I knew he would do that\u2019 and the majority of the Hunter stared at me with a surprised look.\u201cI\u2019ll get in on the act too.\u201dThe Sword Saint followed up and said.\u201cYou can\u2019t leave out the person who recommended the Apocalypse.\u201dHe looked solemn, but there was a slight smile on the corner of his lips. I could plainly see his body was itching for excitement. Perhaps as a reader who loves Martial Arts, isn\u2019t the fact that he could enter the real Murim a pleasure in itself?\u201cI\u2019m glad. The minimum number of people has been met!\u201dThe librarian chuckled.\u201cWe can have two more characters coming with us here\u2026\u2026. How do you guys want to do it?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s one more reason why I recommended this Apocalypse.\u201dThe Sword Saint immediately opened his mouth with confidence.\u201cEveryone, look at all the reason for discontinuation.\u201d+[The Chronicles of Heavenly Demon(\u5929\u9b54)]Genre: Martial Arts, FusionDifficulty Level: B ClassPlayer Limit: 2 to 4 people\u203bThe Serialization is currently suspended.Introduction: Murim.

The Demonic Cult was annihilated. The other forces were also destroyed. End.+Looking at it again, the reason for discontinuation was ridiculous.It didn\u2019t even state exactly what the epidemic was.In the text of the Apocalypse, only this was written, [The Heavenly Demon suddenly died due to the unidentified epidemic, soon, all the other forces died too.]No one knew what happened specifically.\u2018We\u2019ll find out when we really enter this world.\u2019In any case, it was clear that the Murim was destroyed because of the unidentified epidemic.The Sword Saint nodded.\u201cAs you can see, the epidemic was what destroyed this world. Needless to say, we should not only take strong Hunters but also Hunters who have extensive knowledge about diseases. And I know who is the most educated when it comes to diseases.\u201dThe Sword Saint smiled brightly and called for someone from the [Martial Arts] group where he came from.\u201cMedicine King. Will you come out?\u201dA stubborn-looking elderly man walked out with his hands behind his back.This time again, the Sword Emperor pretended as if he knew.-Ahh! That guy!\u201cWhy? Who\u2019s that?\u201d-What do you mean why? You know that store right? The place where I tried to bring you to first, Zombie. He\u2019s the shop owner of Marcus grandpop\u2019s favourite Drugstore.Aha, really now.-That grandpop is good at making drugs. But, ummm\u2026 He\u2019s good at it, but\u2026\u2026.The Sword Emperor mumbled towards the end of his sentence.No one knew the reason better than I did.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will be the one mainly fighting, and Death King will help if I am not enough. And when this [Medicine King] resolves the matter regarding the disease, this Apocalypse will only be for the three us\u2026\u2026 Death King, is there anything you want to say?\u201dAs he spoke confidently, the Sword Saint stared at me with his hands raised.\u201cAhhh. Yes. There\u2019s one person I\u2019d like to bring with me.\u201dI lowered my hand and pointed to one Hunter.The Hunter, who was pointed out of nowhere, gasped for words.\u201cUhhh, huhhh? Are you talking about me\u2026?\u201dIt was the Alchemist.I nodded.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dThe Alchemist trembled as if she had been struck by lightning while walking down the street.\u201cDea-, Death King\u2026 It hasn\u2019t even been a week since I received my Title.

Yes\u2026?\u201d\u201cAnd you also said earlier.\u201d\u2018Death King-nim, if you need anything, please tell me!\u2019\u2018As long as I can do it, I\u2019ll help you all I can!\u2019I smiled widely.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t just empty talk, you\u2019ll help out. Right, Alchemist-nim?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Alchemist\u2019s eyes were in despair as if she was looking at the devil.\u2018Why? Didn\u2019t she get her Title thanks to me?\u2019If you got carried, you have to pay the price for being carried.[T/N: This was talked about in C58, but just in case, Carry in this context is like the gaming term, in other words, our MC carried her by using the item she made, that was why she could get a Title.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 \u2013 Expedition without hopes or dreams (2)Translator: WH Editor: Sasha2.The Hunters cheered.\u201cOhh, what\u2019s this. So all four spots are filled?\u201d\u201cBut who exactly is that woman?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to say. The elder, Medicine King, as you know\u2026.\u201dThe Sword Saint also had a puzzled look on his face.\u201cIsn\u2019t that the girl I saw last time?\u201d\u201cHikkkk\u2026\u201dThe Alchemist tried to hide herself behind me.Back when the Sword Saint mistook me as a mass-murderer, she had tried to stop the number 1 ranker alongside the Crusader. The pressure the Sword Saint had emitted that time was so chaotic that it looked like she was recalling the memory of that incident as soon as she was able to see him from up close.Perhaps the Sword Saint also was also thinking the same, so he cleared his throat.\u201cHmmm. You don\u2019t have to be so scared. The misunderstanding between me and the Death King has been resolved.\u201d\u201cIs-, is that so\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Well\u2026\u2026But just because of that\u2026.\u201dThe Sword Saint looked at me with an awkward face.\u201cDeath King. Where we\u2019re headed now is a very dangerous place. Didn\u2019t the Constellation also say so himself? If you die in the Apocalypse, you also die in reality. Is it okay to take that lady to such a dangerous place?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI nodded confidently.\u201cShe\u2019s the best alchemist I know.\u201dAt the same time, she was probably the greatest Alchemist in existence.-Ughhh\u2026\u2026Did the Sword Emperor also disagree?Even though they used the same ingredients, she produced 15 times the quantity than the store he had originally introduced me too, in other words, it was the store of the Medicine King or whatever that was standing over there.-That guy makes pretty good elixirs, but\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s not the best. Now. Since we have that lady\u2026\u2026.\u2018Yes.\u2019However, the Sword Saint eyes had a subtle feel in them.\u201cThe best alchemist you know\u2026\u2026\u201dI pulled up the character window to get a handle on the Sword Saint\u2019s psychological state.\u300cUmmmmm. It\u2019s a remarkable young man\u2019s recommendation so there must be something special, but there\u2019s a bigger ocean in the world\u2026\u2026. I see, Sword Emperor. It\u2019s been a long time since you said the right thing. Even a king carp who\u2019s been living in the open water all this while, when it goes to a river, it will find out that it isn\u2019t the smallest carp. Alright, I think we should take this opportunity to build a relationship with those two young people and the Medicine King.\u300d[T/N: bigger ocean in the world: it means that there are always people that are better or more skilled.]Wow.I\u2019ve built some connections all this while, and perhaps it was because Sword Saint had made a promise with himself, so he didn\u2019t say anything out loud, and I knew his words held good intentions behind them, but\u2026\u2026really, he still had an old-fashioned mindset.And he said, Sword Emperor, so it was probably the other Sword Emperor by the side of the Sword Saint, meaning that he also looked down on the Alchemist just like he did last time.Not surprising as there was another figure here that laid down his old-fashioned mindset brazenly, and spoke without any good intentions.\u201cHuh?! What do you mean the best you know?!\u201dIt was the Medicine King.\u201cThis is why they\u2019re greenhorns! Huhu, oh, my, my. It\u2019s laughable that you think you\u2019ve crossed a mountain when you have really just crossed a stone. Geez, I hate it because I have to feel like this youngling as my rival. Ugh.\u201dHoooooh.\u201cMedicine King, please be understanding. Death King is an outstanding man. It\u2019s just that his life experience is a bit\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat experience! That experience is what I\u2019m talking about! Experience is the most important thing! But you don\u2019t even know that and pretend you know the entire world. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s ashamed of it all. He\u2019s acting the same as when I earned about a billion dollars in Silicon Valley when I was in my 20s. The same rotten, corrupted mind! But you\u2019re the only one who doesn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cCalm down a little\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHuhu, my, my, my. I\u2019ve been calming myself down all this while. It\u2019s a sin to say and do whatever they want, even if they\u2019re just greenhorns, Marcus, I\u2019m holding myself back for your sake. And what? What did he say just before? He was saying he wants to bring along this low-key girl who turned up from nowhere. It\u2019s just like a young billionaire carrying a trophy around at the Silicon Valley.\u201d\u201cDeath King is not that kind of youngling\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean he\u2019s not? You brat! Look me in the eye and tell me! Are you sure he\u2019s not?!\u201dImpressive\u2026\u2026What was impressive was that there exists a man who could make THE Sword Saint flustered. It looked like it was a food chain of the oldie\u2019s version where an oldie was being dragged around by an even greater oldie.It was hard to shut up my brain which was thinking about the mysteries of this newly discovered ecosystemMaybe that was why I was not the one who talked back to that oldie of all oldies.\u201cI-, I don\u2019t mind you calling me a kid, but\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Alchemist grabbed my collar tightly and gritted her teeth.\u201cDea-, Death King-nim is absolutely not a greenhorn! He\u2019s an incredible man! Ro-, what do you mean a rotten mind.\u2026\u201d\u201cHuhu, see, Marcus. Doesn\u2019t it look like she\u2019s defending her own man? This is what it\u2019s like to be young. Eyyyh. When I was young, I thought that was what youth was all about\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWh-, what do you mean defending my own man.\u2026\u201dThe Alchemist puffed up her mouth. She had heard such absurd things that it seemed like her brain couldn\u2019t process it.Crusader took a step forward and defended the Alchemist.\u201cStop. \u2018Alchemist\u2019 is undoubtedly an excellent pharmacist. Although I learned of her existence because of the introduction from Death King, my Civil Militia has also received countless excellent medicine from the Alchemist.\u201dThe Medicine King snorted.\u201cOnly the Civil Militia standard would be able to accept that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What did you say?\u201d\u201cYou should say the right thing. Have you ever stopped by my pharmacy with your financial conditions? You think the ceiling is high because you don\u2019t know the sky. And you don\u2019t even know that it\u2019s a box lid, not a room ceiling. Even your ridiculous look is just like that of a young rival, tch tch\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Crusader bit her lips hard.Although it was listed as one of the top five guilds, the Civil Militia was always suffering from financial difficulties. She was brutally pricked in her sore spot.The Medicine King shook his hands like he was chasing away a junkie.\u201cEyyy, what\u2019s the point of talking? Let\u2019s just stop. You\u2019d just be tired of listening to me ramble.\u201dWell.That was right.\u2018Mr. Sword Emperor.\u2019-Uhuh.\u2018Is listening to this nonsense good enough?\u2019-More than enough. Why are you suffocating yourself?I glanced around the library.\u2018I\u2019m not suffocating myself.\u2019As I\u2019ve said many times, this scene was being broadcasted live to the hunters in Babylon Square.In other words, this timing was optimal for both [Debut] and [Retirement].I said to the Medicine King.\u201cWould you like to duke it out?\u201dIf what the Sword Saint had was an awkward look, then the Medicine King was literally on our throats.\u201cHuhhh! Look now. Marcus. Because he couldn\u2019t reason it out, he really immediately pointed his \u2018knife\u2019 at me, that, that rotten expression! It reminds me of when I became the boxing world champion in my 40s.\u201d\u201cNo, not with me.\u201dI took medicinal herbs out of my bag.\u201cI\u2019ll provide the medicinal herbs. You two can make one elixir with it. Then, we\u2019ll compare the performance with the elixirs you\u2019ve both made, then wouldn\u2019t we be sure?\u201d\u201cEeeeek\u2026\u2026.!\u201dThe Alchemist jumped.\u201cDea-, Death King-nim! That old man\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m very upset that he insulted Death King-nim, but\u2026St-,still he\u2019s a person called the Medicine King though? He\u2019s a big name that all the Hunters know about\u2026. In comparison, it\u2019s only been a week since I received my Title, -kyaaaat,\u201dThe Alchemist shuddered.I held her shoulders.\u201cAlchemist-sshi.\u201d\u201cHuh, ye- Yes!?\u201dWith her glasses in between, I made direct eye contact with her and said.\u201cI believe in you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Dea-, Death King-nim.\u201d\u201cSo you need to believe in yourself, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Alchemist took in a deep breath. Beyond the glasses, I could see that her shaking pupils had regained light.With clenched fists, she nodded vigorously.\u201cYes, Death King-nim! I\u2019ll do my best! No,\u201dShe immediately shook her head, and the Alchemist corrected her words.\u201cI\u2019ll win!\u201dThe Medicine King looked at us as if it was ridiculous.\u201cHuh.\u201dThe Medicine King shook his head.\u201cThere are always things like this. You have to dip it and try to see if it was ketchup or blood so that they\u2019d know their place. It\u2019s the same as when I was about three years old. Tch tch\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been blabbering for too long. Are you trying to run away?\u201d\u201cAlright. Youngin. Be prepared to see that girl shed tears. I don\u2019t know how to go easy on young people.\u201dMedicine King vs. Alchemist.An extraordinary match had begun.3.The Hunters\u2019 reactions were cynical when the match began.\u201cOf course the old man Medicine King will win.\u201d\u201cThat old man\u2019s drugstore is so expensive, but it still takes almost a month for reservations.\u201d\u201cDo the two of them really have something going on? No matter how much I look at it, Death King is being too irrational.\u201d\u201cDeath King and Medicine King. They\u2019re both Kings, but there\u2019s still a difference in the years of experience.\u201dIn a literal sense, their reactions were normal.\u201cNow, those that think Medicine King will win, come here! Those that think Alchemist will win, here!\u201dOn the other hand, there was also the Count, who didn\u2019t miss out on the chance to make money and opened a gambling table.Out of nowhere, two bookmark maids were holding a collection box.\u201cDeath King, will you be all right? The betting odds right now are 1.08 to 47.\u201dThe Witch came close and whispered to me.\u201cThat\u2019s great. Why do you think about making some pocket money and betting on the Alchemist\u2019s side so that the betting odds wouldn\u2019t drop too much?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Death King, this is all being broadcasted live. You were the one who said it.\u201dThe Witch looked as serious as she could be.\u201cIf that Alchemist you recommended breaks down horribly. If that happens\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll all be broadcasted live to Babylon and to the world. No, the viewers on the internet must really be in an uproar right now.\u201dIf it were me in the past, what comment would I have been writing?Something like I want to become like Medicine King too, would I be posting comments like that?While I was having such idle thoughts, the Witch touched her forehead.\u201cThat\u2019ll damage your reputation if it happens, Death King. \u2026\u2026Are you sure it\u2019ll be alright?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a little sorry for the old man Medicine King.\u201dNo. Honestly, I wasn\u2019t sorry at all.If you spouted rough words, you should take responsibility for your actions, right?Isn\u2019t that the true spirit and reason behind \u2018respect for seniority\u2019?The witch stared at me and the Alchemist in turn with an odd expression. I was wondering what she was thinking, so I was thinking of pulling up the psychology state window of the Witch to see. It was then.\u201cI\u2019m finished, greenhorn!\u201dMedicine King.He bellowed while lifting up the elixir he had made.\u201cBow your head before my great creation!\u201d+[Unique Recovery Potion]Rarity: UniqueProducer: Medicine KingDescription: Although it is a little bitter, drinking it will heal even the deadliest of wounds. Needless to say, as it\u2019s a recovery potion, it has to be taken in a safe location to take into consideration the aftereffects of healing. Anyway, it\u2019s an amazing feat to be able to produce a potion of this quality!+Cheers resonated throughout the library.\u201cIt\u2019s a Unique Recovery Potion!\u201d\u201cOh my God. Pulling out a Unique Recovery Potion. He\u2019s indeed the Medicine King. It really is \u2018A King Never Dies.\u2019 \u201d\u201cOld man Medicine King! Would you like to sell it to me?\u201d\u201cHow dare you cut in line! Medicine King-nim! I\u2019m at the top of the reservation list! I\u2019ll buy it!\u201dThe Medicine King raised his chin and looked at me and the Alchemist in turn. He had a face that was saying \u201cThe two of you dare to touch a tiger\u2019s nose, so now you will get to properly and completely know what it means to be humiliated.\u201d[T/N: Dare to touch a tiger\u2019s nose is like a slang that means to mess with the wrong person.]It was then.\u201cUhh\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m done making it, too.\u2026\u201dThe Alchemist showed everyone the elixir she had made.+[Soma Strawberry]Rarity: Quasi(\u6e96)-MythProducer: AlchemistDescription: Huh, it tastes like strawberries! Why does it taste like strawberries when there are no strawberries in it? And what\u2019s with this effect?! As long as the preservation state is good, it can graft the severed body parts without any aftereffects! What on earth was just made!?+Silence covered the library.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 \u2013 Expedition Without Hopes or Dreams (3)Translator: WH Editor: SashaThe two of them stared silently at the elixirs that they had individually made.The others were silent too. They had used the same exact material, but the items produced were so different that the people seeing it, looked as if they were enchanted.\u201cEhhhh.\u201dIt was the Alchemist who made a move first.She fiddled with her glasses with her dry knuckled fingers and tilted her head.\u201cIs this the elixir you made, Yonggam-nim\u2026?\u201d[T/N: Yonggam is basically a polite way of calling an old man.]The Medicine King was silent.The Alchemist picked up the Medicine King\u2019s potion and scanned all over it.\u201cHmmmmmm.\u201dEven looking at it from another angle,\u201cEhhhh.\u201dShe even tried to turn it upside down.Then, she returned the potion to the Medicine King\u2019s hand and fixed her glasses.\u201cIt\u2019s at this level, huh\u2026?\u201dMmhmm.\u2018Is this person the type of person who becomes infinitely stronger when she thinks she is in an advantageous position?\u2019In other words, like all other high-rank Hunters, she harbours the seeds of a freak?That can\u2019t be.It can\u2019t be\u2026\u2026.While my trust in humans was on the verge of collapsing, the Medicine King barely responded.\u201cUmmm\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe height difference between the two was huge.The woman\u2019s height was as bright and promising as she lived, and the old man\u2019s body was as short as he had lived.So the Alchemist looked down at the Medicine King, and the Medicine King looked up at the Alchemist.\u201cYonggam-nim, don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cGreenhorn, don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u2026\u201dBoth of them spoke at the same time.\u201cIs your ability at elixir-making just bad\u2026..?\u201d\u201cAre you just lucky\u2026\u2026?\u201dUhmm.\u201cHuh?\u201dAs the Alchemist tilted her head, the Medicine King nodded.\u201cIt was good luck.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cTchhh. This is why young people are like this. It reminds me of when I was in my thirties, I earned about $1.7 billion in 10 minutes on Wall Street. I thought it was all because of my skills.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Alchemist tilted her head. Her glasses also tilted along.A heartfelt voice came from the lips of the tilting Alchemist.\u201cWould you like to try again\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cIs that okay with you? The Goddess of Fortune doesn\u2019t smile twice. Tchhhh, young people are just\u2026\u2026\u201dThree minutes passed.\u201cYou\u2019re very lucky. But the Goddess of Fortune doesn\u2019t smile the third time. \u201cThis time, the difference in our years of experience will definitely\u2026\u201dThree more minutes passed.\u201cYou\u2019re extremely lucky. But the Goddess of Fortune doesn\u2019t smile the fourth time\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cStop\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the end, the Sword Saint gripped the Medicine King\u2019s shoulder.\u201cEnough, Medicine King\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cMarcus, what are you talking about?!\u201d\u201cYou- right now you look awfully disgraceful\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it! This time for sure! This time for sure, my skills! My experience will destroy that first-timer\u2019s luck! Can\u2019t you see?! This is my, Sean McCallister\u2019s Victory Road!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, miss. You\u2019re really the best alchemist. It\u2019s my bad that I didn\u2019t immediately trust and understand why the Death King was vouching for you.\u201dThe Sword Saint bowed and apologized.The Alchemist who was looking down at the Medicine King with her eyes as if she was looking at a bunch of fleas, pulled herself together.\u201cUmm\u2026\u2026It must be hard having a friend like him\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if he\u2019s acting like this, he\u2019s\u2026\u2026it\u2019s not like there\u2019s nothing good about him. Elixirs\u2026\u2026 Though he\u2019s not as good as you, he does make some pretty good ones\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026I feel like it\u2019s better than nothing\u2026\u2026. it\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t have any basic skill at all, so it\u2019s not like he can\u2019t be used as an assistant\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was at the moment when the Alchemist muttered as she fixed her glasses.\u201cYou!\u201dWith the nimbleness that greatly resembled a cat running towards a silver pine grass, Sangryun\u2019s Master, the Count, grabbed the Alchemist by her wrist to pull her over.\u201cA contract!\u201d\u201cHuh!?\u201d\u201cA contract! An immediate contract! Exclusive contract! A contract with me!\u201d\u201cUh, uh uhhhh\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll guarantee that you will receive the best treatment in the industry! I\u2019ll even let you touch the cat! No, I\u2019ll let you roll around in the cat field! How about it?! How about it?!\u201dThe Alchemist was perplexed and was unable to speak.But the Count pouncing upon her was only the beginning.\u201cMe too!\u201d\u201cAlchemist-nim! And since the Death King pointed you out, I\u2019ll call you Alchemist King-nim!\u201d\u201cNo, exclude the King, it\u2019s just Alchemist-nim!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the God of Medicine! Give us some elixirs too please!\u201dShe got the same treatment as I did when I had solo-cleared the 10th floor.The request for countless handshakes overwhelmed the Alchemist.4.\u201cFo-, for starters!\u201dThe Alchemist was flustered and pushed people away.\u201cTo those of you who want to trade with me, first of all, please ask permission from the Death King! Ah, of course, I\u2019ll still do trade with my previous customers\u2026\u2026 The-, Crusader-nim is alright! If not! I-, for now, I\u2019m only going to sell elixirs to people that Death King allows, so\u2026\u2026on the condition that they do not cause any trouble to Death King\u2026.\u2026\u201dHer words drew the eyes of the Hunters, including the Count towards me.Crusader quietly drowned in her victory, did a Hooray pose, and then quietly went off again.I grinned.\u201cFirst of all, let\u2019s think about it after breaking the Apocalypse.\u201d\u201cAh! Yes, yes!\u201dClimbing a tower always works for the Hunters.Even the Count backed away with a bitter feeling.\u2018Good.\u2019With this, the members are in place.For starters, we have Sword Saint.And we also have the Alchemist.Above all, there\u2019s me.\u201cNo. No way! This can\u2019t be happening! My experience! My years of experience can\u2019t be foiled by the luck of a mere greenhorn!\u201dI don\u2019t know if he was Medicine King or Emperor of Self-Deception\u2026. Though, just like what Alchemist said, he was better than nothing.\u201cWell! I guess all the characters have been decided.\u201dThe librarian, who had been watching our show so far, said cheerfully.\u201cI\u2019ll say it again. if you die inside the Apocalypse, you will die in reality. There\u2019s only one way to get out unscathed! Overcome the crisis of Serial Discontinuation in any way you can and then create a proper [Ending]!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s a proper ending?\u201d\u201cThat depends on your judgment.\u201dThe librarian grinned at my question.\u201cMaybe you can save Murim by eradicating the epidemic. Or by using the epidemic, you can possibly become the master of Murim yourself. The possibilities are practically limitless! Please think for yourself which will be [The Best Ending].\u201dIn short, it means that the choice would entirely be ours to make.I nodded.\u201cGood. Then please send us to [Chronicles of Heavenly Demon] right now\u2026.\u201d\u201cWait a minute!\u201dSomeone shouted.\u201cIsn\u2019t Sect Master-nim going?\u201d[T/N: It\u2019s just a short term for Chen Mu-mun.]\u201cI know right. Isn\u2019t a martial arts related Apocalypse a perfect opportunity for Sect Master-nim to actively take part in?\u201dChen Mu-mun.They were Hunters from the guild headed by Venomous Snake.The Venomous Snake, who was still holding his breath in the [Martial Arts] group, batted his eyes.\u201cHuh?\u201dTo the perplexed Venomous Snake, the guild members spouted out one word after another.\u201cNo matter how much I think about it, it\u2019s a world meant for the Sect Master-nim\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI think so too. Sect Master-nim. Doesn\u2019t a strong player\u2019s duty refer to our Sect Master-nim?\u201d\u201cI think so too, Master. Master should come forward.\u201dThe Venomous Snake frowned.And slowly put his arms together.Those thick eyebrows and the one-eye below them were full of manly determination.\u201cAlright. I was just about to step up. You bastards, you haven\u2019t forgotten me, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dI was speechless.That\u2019s strange. That person wouldn\u2019t be interested in the martial arts world though?Something was fishy, so when I pulled up the character window to read his psychological state\u2026 Sure enough.\u300cNo, you shitty disciples!\u300d\u300cWhy the hell are you trying to send me to that kind of village?\u300dThe Venomous Snake was crying inwardly.He was serious, but only on the outside. So the one-eyed prosecutor spoke calmly as if he had been waiting for his disciples to push his back with such encouraging remarks.\u201cThose who worship martial skills and chivalry. The world of martial artists and chivalrous fighters, that is the Murim! Even though I was born in a different hometown, I have long kept the Murim as my heart\u2019s hometown.\u201d\u300cThere won\u2019t be a flush toilet there. How much shitty trouble did I have to go through because of that in the Aegim Empire, this fucking\u2026\u300dHoly Crap.\u201cIt\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know why the clan I set up is called Chen Mu-mun.\u201d[With the cheat skill \u2018Cheon\u2019-ha-moo-sang I have, before I came to the tower, the fact that I was a 32-year-old \u2018Mu\u2019-jik who seemed to have painted a big picture, was there a \u2018Mun\u2019-je? Everyone knew it\u2019s Chen Mu-mun\u5929\u6b66\u9580 for short. That\u2019s how the sign-man made it too. I can\u2019t even explain this now that we\u2019ve come this far, damn it\u2026..\u300d[T/N: I decided to keep all the Korean words so that everyone would understand the meaning behind Chen Mu-mun. Basically Cheon-ha-moo-sang means unrivalled under the heavens, whereas Mu-jik means jobless, and Mun-je means problem. ]Holy Shit.\u201cI must go, by all means.\u201d\u300cI absolutely don\u2019t want to go!\u300dI was beyond speechless.Bae Hu-ryeong who shared consciousness with me seemed to have a similar reaction.[Shiny reports that she\u2019s also speechless.]There was an existence in front of me that made people, spectres, and Constellations alike, all speechless.\u201cUwoooohhhhhhhhh!\u201dSuch an existence actually garnered the cheers of the Hunters.The guild members of the Chen Mu-mun were particularly pleased.\u201cAs expected of Sect Master-nim!\u201d\u201cI knew you\u2019d step forward, Master-nim!\u201d\u201cOur idol! A true Hunter of this era!\u201d\u201cI will follow you forever! Sect Master!\u201dIf I didn\u2019t have the ability to read psychological states\u2026 Who knows, I might have also admired him too. No matter where you look, the Venomous Snake\u2019s appearance was that of a chivalrous fighter who devoted his life to the sword.Just like the Sword Saint.That Sword Saint folded his arms.\u201cUhummm\u2026. Venomous Snake, if it\u2019s you, you have all the right to feel like going.\u201c\u201cIf you say it like that, it feels like you\u2019re nagging.\u201d\u201cBut even so, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason for this man to make concessions.\u201dThe Sword Saint extended his Aura.It was a situation where the Venomous Snake was already exuding his force. The energies exuded by two swordsmen clashed. Paaangggg\u2026! With the sound of balloons bursting, the air around the colliding forces changed rapidly. The bookmark maids must have felt a sense of crisis, and either ran away quickly or were caught up in the clash of force and were sent flying.The Hunters were more excited.\u201cSword Saint and the Venomous Snake facing each other!\u201d\u201cThis is a battle of pride!\u201dIt was a rare sight in a literal sense.For me, who knew the psychological state of the Venomous Snake, it was a rare sight.At that instant, the sound of someone limping could be heard.\u201cSword Saint. Chen Mu-mun Master. Stop it.\u201dIt was the sound of the Crusader taking a step forward.The reason why a limping sound was heard was that Crusader was one of the few figures who bet money on the Alchemist during the bet earlier. Her purse, which had always been thin, was now packed full with 47 times the betting amount.The reason why the Crusader with the most serious expression seemed a little strange was because of the spell of her stuffed purse.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to start stabbing at each other here, right?\u201dRegardless of the purse, the voice of the Crusader was solemn. As had always been the case, the two\u2019s fight was mediated.As always\u2026\u2026?\u2018Wait, don\u2019t tell me, was it [Always] like this\u2026?\u2019-I know right, Zombie. If it was always like that, and it\u2019s just that we didn\u2019t know until now\u2026\u2026.\u2018This world seems to be full of forbidden knowledge that we really shouldn\u2019t know\u2026\u2026\u2019The Venomous Snake snorted.\u201cIf we have to dance with our swords, then we just have to do it. Fuck, I and the Sword Saint are martial artists, right? Why don\u2019t we just go at it and let the stronger one go?\u201d\u300cI need to lose on purpose!\u300d\u300cIt\u2019s embarrassing to just lose outright, so let\u2019s make it a close fight and lose!\u300d\u300cIf I lose to the Sword Saint, my disciples will understand. Probably.\u300dIt was a rare sight indeed.The Sword Saint, who didn\u2019t have a clue about such an inside story, wiped the sweat from his forehead.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but Venomous Snake\u2026Against a strong man like you, I will have no choice but to use my full power. As a result of that, you had lost one of your eyes in the last battle. I can\u2019t guarantee that the same thing won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\u201cRight back to you, old man. If you come at me thinking I\u2019m still the same me from those days, you\u2019ll be lying in a coffin after this.\u201d\u300cThis fucker! Fuck! Fuck fuckkkk!\u300dThe appearance of the Venomous Snake was that of a pompous warrior that lacked nothing.The Sword Emperor, who was floating beside me, also wiped the sweat off from his forehead like the Sword Saint.-Hey Zombie.\u2018Yes, Mr. Sword Emperor.\u2019-I said all the high-level hunters were crazy right. But then. Even then. Among them, that bastard, how do I say this\u2026.\u2018It\u2019s for [Real]\u2026.\u2019My forehead was full of sweat too.In fact, when it came to the \u2018sweating on the forehead\u2019 part, everyone present was in a similar state. All the Hunters who were watching this scene had sweat dripping from their foreheads.Those who had gathered in Babylon\u2019s Square and were watching the broadcast must be sweating too.The Crusader\u2019s forehead was full of sweat too. The sweat ran down her cheek and dripped on the purse full of gold coins.\u201cAt any rate, Venomous Snake, a man like you\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Venomous Snake gave off a wide smile.\u201cFor a warrior. There are moments when you just can\u2019t back down.\u201d\u300cCrusader! Do something about this!\u300dThe outcry from his desperate mind would never be said out loud, but the Crusader really did something about it.Specifically, she said this to the Sword Saint.\u201cSword Saint\u2026\u2026Can you please step down this time?\u201d\u300cWhy are you telling that side to back off?\u300d\u2018Why are you telling that side to back off?\u2019Oh, it overlapped.With that [Real], our thoughts overlapped\u2026\u2026.[Shiny trembles and pats the warrior\u2019s waist for comfort.]The Sword Emperor also touched my shoulder.While I was being comforted without words, the Crusader continued to speak toward the Sword Saint.\u201cI know you always want to be on the front line. But didn\u2019t you already join in the raid of the 12th to 19th floors with the Death King and the Witch? So, it would indeed be a shameless thing to do if you say you want to be the first to step foot into the 22nd floor\u2019s raid this time as well.\u201dA calm tone and a logical explanation. With a serious expression.The only thing that bothered me was the bulging purse that hung onto the side of her clothes.\u201cIn addition to that,\u201dThe Crusader pointed to Venomous Snake, and then to the members who suggested that Sect Master-nim should go.\u201cChen Mu-mun Master is the head of a group. Although he\u2019s not a man who cares about the face of his disciples, his position is different from you who plays solo. Can\u2019t you respect him a little?\u201d\u201cUhmmm\u2026\u201dSword Saint, Marcus Calenberry, was pondering.The hard-posed old man frowned. Then relaxed his tight brows. He went through these motions many times.Finally, he folded his arms.\u201cWhen have I ever cared about the honour of you five top guilds?\u201dThe Crusader gritted her teeth.\u201cSword Saint, you really\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cBut.\u201dThe Sword Saint, who had cut off the Crusader\u2019s words, turned his head to stare at me.No, why was he looking at me now\u2026\u2026?\u201cThese days, I\u2019ve been wondering if he\u2019s going to have some sense of honour.\u201dIt was a great sight. A stubborn old man had bent over his stubbornness. It was a beautiful sight and yet, the grumbling Medicine King still had a \u2018This can\u2019t be happening\u2019 look on his face beside me, and his body language seemed to convey that he did not want to follow the example of the person before him in the slightest.But why was I seeing that sight of him now\u2026?\u201cGot it.\u201dThe Sword Saint took a step back.He gazed at the Chronicles of Heavenly Demon full of regret, but the old man brushed it off his heart and said,\u201cVenomous Snake, this time I will yield to you.\u201dThe Venomous Snake raised his eyes. But that was only for a moment. The Venomous Snake released his force even more and grinned. He looked like a gambler who had won as he wanted.\u201cYou should have done that sooner. You should know that you\u2019ve just kept your life, old man.\u201d\u300cNo! What the shit, why are you making concessions all of a sudden!? Marcus Calenberry! You\u2019re not one to give up anything to anyone else! No, I don\u2019t want to go!\u300dThere was an indescribable scene happening that no one knew the insides about.As expected, the Crusader also looked at the Sword Saint with the same face, as if it was difficult to describe. Heretic Questioner, who was watching with a sparkling face, jumped and hugged the Crusader\u2019s arm.\u201cThat\u2019s amazing! You convinced the Sword Saint, Crusader!\u201d\u201cWell. No. It was the Sword Saint who has accepted my persuasion.\u201d\u201cAhaha, is that so! Then I\u2019ll have to hug the Sword Saint!\u201d\u201cI strongly refuse.\u201dThe Sword Saint immediately set up an iron wall. Of course, any random iron wall would not work for the Natural Born Psycho, so the Sword Saint had to be in trouble for a while.\u201cReally\u2026\u2026Everyone is growing little by little.\u201dThe Witch grinned with her mouth closed like a dot.In a mood as if a heartwarming story had been told, the three people who came to the expedition of Apocalypse [Chronicles of Heavenly Demon] were ready.\u201cTchhhh. If it\u2019s decided, go faster you bastards. I\u2019m going to lose it if I keep waiting. You\u2019re just the young me\u2026\u2026\u2026 It just can\u2019t be helped either. Ha, really. I should just leave, what can I do? I was defeated by the luck of that greenhorn earlier, but the one of a kind, widely renowned, all-time best alchemist is me, Medicine King.\u201d\u201cUghh, Death King. I\u2019m scared\u2026\u2026\u2026 is it really okay if someone like me follows? Oh, but of course, I\u2019m at least better than that Medicine King or something though? The outcome was as solid as Galileo Galilei\u2019s Geocentric theory, but the results are strangely unrecognized by that flea-like old man? Even then, is someone like me\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, non-combatants. Take care of yourself when there\u2019s a fight. It only takes a moment for a person\u2019s neck to fly off, you know?\u201d\u300cI don\u2019t want to go\u2026Swap with me\u2026 Sword Saint Grandpops, can you please swap with me, even if it\u2019s right now\u2026\u2026.\u300dI stared blankly at the expedition members who had come together.The Sword Emperor spoke in a soothing tone which was rare for him.-Don\u2019t worry, Zombie. If you don\u2019t think this is correct, just die! Whether you get sick or throw yourself from the ceiling, go back to one day before! This reset, I\u2019m going to acknowledge it for real from the bottom of my soul. Although all I have is a soul now.I nodded weakly.\u201cYes\u2026 \u2026let\u2019s go\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dThe librarian snapped his fingers. Tak! The Apocalypse which was in the hands of the Sword Saint flew by itself into the hands of the librarian. He had just lent it to us for a moment, but this book was originally his own, so the librarian flipped open the book with familiar hand gestures.\u201cDeath King, Venomous Snake, Medicine King, Alchemist.\u201dLight radiated from the book.\u201cI would like to name these four new characters in the [Chronicles of Heavenly Demon]. When you lot open your eyes there, it will still be a world ten days before the tragic serial discontinuation of the series.\u201dAnd the light enveloped us.\u201cI look forward to your wonderful ending.\u201dIt was the moment when an expedition team with no hopes or dreams was dispatched.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 \u2013 The Battle of Good and Evil (\u6b63\u90aa\u5927\u6230)\u00a0 (1)Translator: WH Editor: Sasha1.I had never read a martial arts novel before.Not only did I have no habit of reading books, but in our generation [Martial Arts] was already a declining genre. Sometimes old martial arts movies were posted on the Internet. However, the inferior CG technology would only cause it to become a laughing stock.It was an era that had come to mock all things considered serious and honorable in the past.There was no place to stand for Martial and Arts in the current time period.A declining genre.A declining world.In such a place, snow was softly falling.\u201cIt\u2019s cold!\u201dWe, the expedition with no dreams or hopes, safely entered the world of the Apocalypse where a vast snowfield (\u96ea\u539f)\u00a0 greeted our party. When our shoes stepped on the snow, they made cute squeaky sounds.But the coldness that hit us was not cute in the slightest.\u201cEveryone!\u201dI shouted hastily.\u201cRelease your Aura and protect your own body!\u201dIt was the bitter cold of a snowstorm (\u56b4\u51ac\u96ea\u5bd2).Even if we stayed still, our toes would freeze. As soon as he heard my cry, Venomous Snake immediately released his Aura. But the non-combatant, Alchemist and the Medicine King, failed to do so.\u201cI-, I-, I\u2026 I didn\u2019t learn how to use Aura\u2026\u201d\u201cAchooo! Ahhhh, chooooo! Aigoooo, this old man is dying! I\u2019m going to freeze to death!\u201dIt had only been 20 seconds since we had entered the world of this Apocalypse. Already, two people\u2019s complexions had so badly turned pale as if they were going to die. But then again, I did all sorts of things in order to learn Aura. How would Support-based Hunters know how to use Aura?\u201cTch.\u201dI dealt with it quickly.\u201cChen Mu-mun Master! Please take care of the Medicine King!\u201d\u201cAlrighty.\u201dThe Venomous Snake carried the Medicine King on his back. Regardless of whether he was the Emperor of Light Novels or a man who lived and died for his pride, the Venomous Snake was undoubtedly a top-ranked Martial Fighter-based Hunter.His purple Aura immediately surrounded the Medicine King\u2019s body.\u201cAigooo. I\u2019m finally able to breathe\u2026\u201dThe Medicine King sighed with relief. His face relaxed like that of an old man who had just entered an open-air hot spring. I nodded, and then took the Alchemist\u2019s hand.\u201cYou\u2019ll follow me, Sajang-nim.\u201d\u201cHuh, whatttt?\u201d\u201cGive me your hand.\u201dMy Aura flowed from my hand to the Alchemist\u2019s hand. A red Aura. The Aura, which had yet to be identified as a symbol of fire or blood, surrounded the Alchemist\u2019s body warmly.\u201cAh.\u201dThe Alchemist bowed.\u201cTha-, thank you. Death King-nim. But thi-, this tickles a little bit\u2026.\u201d\u201cI know you\u2019re shy. I\u2019m shy, too. But this is no time for such emotions.\u201dI looked around. The blizzard was as thick as mist. The problem of low body temperature was solved urgently, but that was all. I was at a loss on where this was and where we had to go.\u201cThe librarian is a Constellation so he could easily use the word [Masterpiece] and [Serialization]. But this is definitely another world. It\u2019s no ordinary book. We\u2019re here to save this world. You know that, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Alchemist raised her head.\u201c\u2026Yes. I do. I guess I thought of it too lightly. I-I\u2019ll try my best.\u201d\u201cAll you have to do is focus on your role. I\u2019m protecting you with my Aura now, but when you need to cure the epidemic, Sajang-nim and Medicine King will have to step forward. I\u2019ll leave it in your dependable hands.\u201d\u201cYes, Death King-nim.\u201d-Guooohhhh.The blizzard brushed past our ears. We tried somehow to grasp the surrounding geography with our eyes wide open. I recalled the last sentence of the Chronicles of Heavenly Demon.\u300cThe Heavenly Demon suddenly died because of the unidentified epidemic.\u00a0\u300d\u300cSoon, everyone else died, too.\u00a0\u300dA concise sentence.The sentence, which was less than 50 characters long, did not state \u2018skin-piercing cold\u2019 nor did it feature \u2018Snow that reached the calves and knees\u2019. It only stated the basic info on what sort of world we had fallen into.The rest, we had to figure out for ourselves from now on.What exactly happened that killed a strong character like the \u2018Heavenly Demon\u2019?What exactly was the \u2018unidentified epidemic\u2019 that caused the humanity of this world to go extinct?\u201cAh.\u201dThuckk.As the Alchemist held my right hand a little more tightly, she pointed to the other side of the snowstorm.\u201cLook over there, Death King! I think I just saw people there!\u201dWe all turned our heads in the direction pointed by the Alchemist.She was right. I couldn\u2019t see well because of the heavy snow\u2026 But there was a shadow of a person beyond the storm. There were countless shadows. It looked like there were dozens of people, not just one or two. Perhaps it was even more than a hundred.It was a forest of silhouettes (\u4eba\u5f71).\u201cOkay.\u201dI took the lead and walked ahead.\u201cLet\u2019s go over there for now!\u201dSnow flew around. It wasn\u2019t just falling from the sky; it was being swept away by the wind in all directions, lowering our visibility. When the snowstorm covered us, only our shadows could be seen. We walked close together so that we would not be separated from each other.-Hey Zombie.Bae Hu-ryeong spoke. He was looking around the surroundings, acting as my eyes.-Something\u2019s weird. I can\u2019t hear anything from that direction.\u2018Isn\u2019t it because the snowstorm is so bad that their voices are being covered up?\u2019-That may be the case.Bae Hu-ryeong looked at the forest of silhouettes with narrowed eyes.-But it\u2019s not just the voices that I can\u2019t hear\u2026 Those things, they\u2019re not moving at all. They\u2019re not moving an inch. They\u2019re more like statues, not humans though?Fortunately, the snowstorm soon subsided, and with it, our vision became clearer. But that was the only fortunate thing.We were speechless at the sight that had unfolded before our sight.\u201c\u2026What. What are these?\u201dThe Venomous Snake puffed out white breaths.\u201cWhy are all the humans frozen?\u201dIn the midst of the snowy field.Hundreds of humans were all frozen while standing.2.\u201c\u2026They\u2019re real humans.\u201dThe Alchemist looked at the frozen human and said.Wearing latex gloves, she ripped off the flesh of the corpse with tongs.\u201cAccording to my [Life Diagnosis] skill, it\u2019s already been two years and three months since they died. The cause of death was due to a contagion. After analysis by [Moving Hospital], it is still an unregistered disease.\u201dED/N: A contagion is a virus carrying agent, responsible for causing contagious diseases.\u201cThat\u2019s strange!\u201dThe Medicine King also took out his monocle and examined every corner of the frozen human corpse. Like a Martial Fighter-based Hunter who would use martial arts skills, they diagnosed the frozen humans with Support-based skills.\u201cThe causes of death are all the same. It\u2019s not death by hypothermia (\u51ac\u6b7b). He died from a disease, so they should have died lying on the ground\u2026 Aren\u2019t they all standing up? Hmmm, really now. It\u2019s spookily strange. When this kind of thing happened in Silicon Valley\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s highly likely someone moved them here on purpose.\u201dThe Alchemist cut off the Medicine King\u2019s words.The Alchemist\u2019s expression became serious, as if she had recalled my words from earlier.\u201cThough the cause of death is the same, the dates of death are all different. This guy was two years ago. That person died three years ago. I can only think that someone intentionally moved the body\u2026.\u201dI frowned.\u201cIs this some kind of grave?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dThe Venomous Snake stroked his chin.\u201cA grave huh. It also looks like a Terracotta Army from far.\u201dThe frozen humans all had a separate pose. Some looked up at the sky with open arms. And another had his mouth open like a beast.\u2018Character window.\u2019I looked at a frozen human that was the closest and chanted it in my mind.The letters popped up over the white snowfield.+Name: Jang Seong-pa (\u5f35\u6210\u6d3e)Favorability: Favorite Genre: \u2013Unfavourable Genre: \u2013Favorite Characters: \u2013Unfavourable Characters: \u2013Preferred Plots: \u2013Undesired Plots: \u2013Psychological state: \u2018Light.\u2019+\u2018\u2026\u2026.\u2019So this was how a dead person\u2019s character window looked like.Maybe the \u2018light\u2019 in his psychological state\u2026 was the last thought he had when he died. The corpse\u2019s mind looked like someone had inscribed a fixed phrase on a tombstone.The party chattered in the face of the mystery.\u201cA grave\u2026. If this was a cemetery, why was it made this way?\u201d\u201cWho knows. But they all have weapons hanging from their waist.\u201d\u201cIs there no good place to stay? It\u2019s a little warm thanks to the Aura, but\u2026.\u201dIt was at that moment.\u201c\u2014Euhahahaha!\u201dLaughter came from afar. Our party lowered our bodies reflexively. Perhaps the owner of the laugh did not notice us, as it looked like he was shouting at someone else.\u201cThe Heavenly Demon Sect (\u9b54\u9053\u5929\u4e0b) ends today!\u201d\u201cHa. Even a passing dog will turn over and laugh.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just one voice. There were two.\u201cAs long as I am alive and well, the Heavenly Demon Sect would remain alive and well. Bu Wol-sun (\u6d0b\u92b3\u4ed9) You\u2019re the one that should say your last goodbyes to the Righteous Sects.\u201dThe voices had become clearer.One was the voice of an old man and the other of a young woman.The old man shouted.\u201cBullshit! The Bloody Ghost Squad (\u8840\u9b3c\u968a) that your Demon Cult boasted about had their heads blown off by the blades of my axes. The rotten Demon (\u9b54\u982d) Elders also had their heads cut off and were sent to the Yellow River! There are 500 Martial Masters of the Righteous Sect that follow me. What sorcery can you use to stop this body?!\u201d\u201cPfft.\u201dThe woman laughed softly.\u201cWhat a long tongue this old man has. The Bloody Ghosts are just staying off the radar for a while after receiving my secret order. They\u2019re not weak enough to be killed by someone like you.\u201dI raised my finger and signalled to the others.\u201cShhhh.\u201dThey batted their eyes.\u2018Let\u2019s get closer quietly. Okay?\u2019The party nodded silently.We crept through the frozen human\u2019s cemetery and the forest of corpses. The voices of the two unknown individuals gradually grew closer. Soon after, their figures could be seen.\u201cBefore you worry about my subordinates, how about worrying about your own underlings, Wol-sun?!\u201dThe woman was wearing a black uniform.\u201cWhere did all the pillars of the state that you were so proud of fuck off to? The old monster, once revered as the Faction Leader of the Murim, has become ugly.\u201d\u201cHuh?!\u201dThe old man was wearing a white robe.\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business. They quickly spread to the whole world on my secret orders!\u201d\u201cI see that you all have quite a lot of secret orders too.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this it all because you screwed up the whole world, you bitch?! Ugh. If it weren\u2019t for the retarded Heavenly Demon Cult, the world wouldn\u2019t be this abnormal!\u201d\u201cIf we\u2019re idiots, what would that make you Righteous Sect people who got your asses handed to you by such idiots? It\u2019d be correct to call you idiots of all idiots.\u201d\u201cHuh, you bitch dare to!?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re mad, you can come at me anytime, Old man.\u201dA very low level fight was taking place.According to what they said, the elderly man dressed in a robe was a figure on the Righteous Sect (\u6b63\u6d3e). And the woman in the black uniform seemed to be on the Demon Sect (\u90aa\u6d3e) side. The old man of the Righteous Sect and the woman of the Demon Cult pointed their weapons at each other.\u201cI\u2019m done with this shit. I can\u2019t stand fucking Demon Heads like you anymore bitch! I\u2019ll split your head into two, and offer one to the Jade Emperor and the other to Yeomra!\u201d[T/N: Yeomra is the King of the Underworld/Hell.]\u201cHeh. I was hoping for a life-or-death situation. I\u2019ll finally cut off the last flesh and blood of the Righteous Sect today, and show that the Heavenly Demon Sect is alive and well.\u201dThough they spoke frivolously, it was a typical fight between two people of the Righteous and Demon sects.Now if the two people actually exert their force and started sword fighting, everything would have been perfect.But there was a serious problem.-Hey Zombie.Bae Hu-ryeong muttered dejectedly.\u2013What are they doing, holding a branch\u2026?That\u2019s right.The old man and the woman, the two powerful people, held a wooden stick as thin as a cane. That was the \u2019weapon\u2019 that the two had brought out. There were no brilliant weapons that could be seen that usually appeared in martial arts movies.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe two seemed to be embarrassed when they aimed at each other with wooden sticks. They exchanged awkward glances. The woman in black robes slowly opened her mouth.\u201c\u2026 \u2026Hey Bu Wol-sun. Where did you put the jade axe you bragged about that you are carrying a piece of wood? For being a trash of the Nangong Family, your only merit was that you wielded your axe valiantly\u2026\u201d\u201cSh-, shut up!\u201dThe old man\u2019s face became flushed.\u201cRight back at you, bitch! Where did you throw your Blood Weaving Demonic Sword (\u7e54\u8840\u9b54\u528d) that you treasured like a daughter, that you are holding such a cane?!\u201d\u201cEhem, what do you mean a cane?!\u201dThe woman averted her gaze.\u201cThat\u2019s too much. Even if it looks like this, this is a wooden sword that I personally carved and made. This sword contains the essence of the thousand-years-old Demon Sect, and I personally gave the name of Hundred Sky Splitting Sword to this weapon.\u201d\u201cDid you just stick the name Sky Splitting to a cane right now?\u201d\u201cHmmm, can\u2019t I do that\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dSilence.The old man said calmly.\u201cEhem. Even so, Hundred Sky Splitting Sword is just over the top. Why don\u2019t you use a trivial name such as\u00a0 Pyeontae (\u8f38\u7b54)?\u201d[T/N: Pyeontae is Hanja for Cane/Whip/Flog/Lash, and it\u2019s written as\u00a0\u97ad\u7b1e\u00a0and read in Hanja as bi\u0101nch\u012b.]\u201cThe word Pyeontae is not supposed to literally mean a cane\u2026\u201d\u201cThe word basically means cane, and it literally looks like a cane! You stupid!\u201dThe woman nodded sullenly.\u201cAlright then. If that\u2019s what you say, the name Demonic Pyeontae is good enough.\u201d\u201cYou and your Demon (\u9b54)! Demon!\u201dThe old man\u2019s white beard trembled.\u201cWhy are all the Demon Cult\u2019s people making a fuss with putting \u2018Demon\u2019 on their names? You and your subordinates and there\u2019s already four Demons: Bloody Demon (\u8840\u9b54),\u00a0 Sword Demon (\u528d\u9b54), Flame Ghost Demon (\u9b3c\u9b42\u708e\u9b54), Moon Shadow Demon Lord (\u6708\u5f71\u9b54\u541b)! Even their moniker is The Four Demon Lord (\u56db\u9b54\u541b)! You bastards, even before you learn the Thousand-Character Classics, do you all first memorize the word \u2018Demon\u2019?!\u201d\u201cHmm. Isn\u2019t there a refined feel to it\u2026?\u201d\u201cAghhh! I can\u2019t believe that you bitches were considered the strongest at one point in time!\u201dJust then.Dark clouds covered the sun. The snowy clouds were so thick that they quickly descended upon the snowfield. In an instant, the world darkened like it was dusk.\u201cHuh!?\u201dThe old man flinched.\u201cDem-, Demon Head. This is no time for us to fight amongst ourselves!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe two Murim people leaned against each other as if they never had an argument. A cold sweat broke out on the woman\u2019s forehead.\u201cDamn it. The Law of Heaven (\u5929\u7406) has been acting as it pleases nowadays\u2026\u201d\u201cYou bitch! Weren\u2019t you confident that the weather would be clear today?!\u201d\u201cThere are times when the divination is right and wrong. I had just sloppily learned the art of prediction of the Flame Ghost Demon. How can I see through heaven and earth?\u201d\u201cAigooo! Why don\u2019t I just get a Fortune-Teller from the street and make him the Religious Sect Leader?! I don\u2019t deserve the position anymore after being deceived by this bitch\u2019s words!\u201d\u201cShut up and get ready to fight, old man. I\u2019m losing more energy that I don\u2019t even have.\u201dOur party was puzzled.The Alchemist, who was close to me, whispered.\u201cWha-, what\u2019s happening all of a sudden\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t really\u2026.\u201dIt was at the moment when I was about to say that I didn\u2019t know too.-Grrrrrrrrrrrrr.Something wriggled.At first, I thought that someone in our party made a sound. But as growling sounds began to come from the left, right, front, back, I realized that my thoughts were firmly wrong.-Guooooo\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026-Kiiiikkk, grrrrrr.-Grrrrrrr.\u201cHiikkkkk!?\u201dThe Alchemist was startled and clung to my arm. Beyond her glasses, I could see that her complexion was as blue as a beetle.The faces of the Venomous Snake and Medicine King were not much different. Perhaps my face was now also blue.-Kiiiik!-Guooo, uooooooo.The frozen humans numbered thousands at a glance.The ones we considered to be just corpses\u2026 Moved their arms and legs slowly.-Uohhhh.The dead bodies\u2019 eyes, which had previously stood still, turned. The pupils were open, and the eyebrows were almost missing. Most of all, some of them had their eyes dug in as if worms had eaten through them. Nevertheless, one of those corpses zeroed in on us.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI made eye contact with one of them. As soon as I saw the dead body\u2019s eyes, I realized.\u201cThis fuckin-\u2026\u201dAn Apocalypse going by the name of Chronicles of Heavenly Demon.The book clearly said this.+[The Chronicles of Heavenly Demon(\u5929\u9b54)]Genre: Martial Arts, FusionDifficulty Level: B ClassPlayer Limit: 2 to 4 people\u203bThe Serialization is currently suspended.Introduction: The Righteous Sect. A world of those who revere the Mu, those who use Mu, those who strive to attain the Mu! A Heavenly Demon had descended here and tried to unify all the sects. A Demonic Cult (\u9b54\u654e) was brought together centering on the Heavenly Demon. The opposing forces would go against this Demonic Cult. Fighting over the control of the world\u2026would probably be what they would\u2019ve done.If it wasn\u2019t for the sudden super epidemic.Reason for Discontinuation: An unidentified epidemic went rampant in the world, causing the Heavenly Demon to die. The Demonic Cult was annihilated. The other forces were also destroyed. End.+The bodies, which we thought were frozen humans, moved slowly.Their movement was slow and sluggish, but the sight of the body moving was a horror in and of itself.I belatedly realized what the \u2018unidentified epidemic\u2019 was that brought this world to an end.\u201cWas the super epidemic a [Zombie Virus]?!\u201dThe dead body\u2019s mouth opened at the same time I shouted.-Uoohhhhhhh!The sun was covered by dark clouds.And a thousand zombies swooped upon us.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 \u2013 The Battle of Good and Evil (\u6b63\u9b54\u5927\u6230) (2)Translator: Cuties Editor: SashaThe Alchemist turned pale as she shuddered and tried to scream.\u201cHiiiik-.\u201d\u201cGruuooghhh!?\u201dEven after I stopped the Alchemist from making any sounds, one could still hear shouts. It was the Medicine King.Old enough to chew out the Sword Saint despite being his friend, this old man who seemed to think it was only acceptable to view young people as naive and immature, screamed like he lost his marbles.\u201cRun away! Run away! I\u2019ve never seen anything like that even in the Silicon Valley! Waaaah, We\u2019re going to die! The world is coming to an end!\u201d\u201cThis is a world that has already been destroyed you know?!\u201dI quickly took out the Holy Sword and cut off the nearest zombie. Unlike the martial arts genre , I had seen movies and drama of the zombie genre quite often, and so thanks to that, I was able to face my opponent(s) directly on the 13th floor. And now after all that experience, my blade instinctively flew towards the zombie\u2019s neck.-Keeeuuuugh!The zombie\u2019s head growled even as it soared into the air. The headless body also swung at me, swinging its arms and legs. Damn it. Is it a type of zombie that would only stop moving after its brain is destroyed? That was the worst case.\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here first!\u201d\u201cYo-You bastards who are you!?\u201dFinally, the two people we saw earlier noticed that we were there. The old man of the Righteous Sect and the woman of the Demonic Cult looked in our direction, and they were astonished upon glimpsing at our party, just like we were surprised to see the zombies.\u201c\u2026 Hey old fart. It seems that the eyes of the great me have turned up strangely. They see, not just one, but four living people. Is the King of the Underworld calling for the great me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s, that\u2019s what I see, too. Maybe because you\u2019ve provoked me first by calling me a retard, I feel as though I really have become retarded.\u201d\u201cYou should run away, too!\u201dI rushed to carry the Alchemist on my back.\u201cAnd please tell us where to run to while you\u2019re at it!\u201dBoth of them looked at each other.\u201cOh, my world. It really is a living person, old thing.\u201d\u201cMaybe we\u2019re already dead and looking at the scenery of the underworld\u2026?\u201d\u201cThen probably one of the two things happened, either you and the great me died and we went to paradise together or we fell into hell together.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think this body, which has served righteousness and honor as the Murim Lord, will go to hell, so it\u2019s probably paradise. However, there are no peach trees, no fairies, and there is an abundance of jiangshi in here. And above all, you are here too, aren\u2019t you? It\u2019ll be very odd if this is heaven.\u201d\u201cThen this must be reality, not a dream.\u201d\u201cSo these people are innocent?\u201d\u201cAt least the warmth of their bodies doesn\u2019t seem to resemble the cold of the jiangshi.\u201dMaybe they had figured out that we were already fleeing from the zombie infested area, the Venomous Snake took care of the old man of the Righteous Sect and I was carrying the woman of the Demonic Cult, while they went on chatting in peace.\u201cWhere the hell are you guys from?\u201dThe woman from the Demonic Cult looked up at me curiously.\u201cSo you\u2019re mastering the miraculous Footwork. Are you perhaps children of the Sae-Wae ? Are the orangs still alive in the periphery?\u201d\u201cWe are\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t understand exactly what Sae-Wae meant, but I had an inkling. She must be asking if we\u2019re from a place outside the control of the Righteous and Demon sects. When I was thinking about what to say, I heard a sound from the back that relieved my worries about giving an answer.-Kkikik, keeeek!-Ooohoohooh!They were zombies. They ran after us in full swing, probably after setting their bodies back in order.Wouldn\u2019t it be more accurate to say they were jumping?What kind of zombie was so lively that it skipped ten meters with every step? I should have said \u201cflying\u201d instead of \u201crunning.\u201d The sight of hundreds of zombies flying like a swarm of seagulls gave me both shock and horror.\u201cWh, what?!\u201dThe Venomous Snake was astonished as well.\u201cWhat kind of zombie flies in the sky?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a Qingong Skill invented by the great me. I borrowed it from the lowlives of the Land of Mystery and improved it.\u201dThe woman of the Demonic Cult trembled.\u201cLook at that. They\u2019ve gone beyond the Extreme Qingong Skill (\u8def\u96ea\u7121\u764c) and even reached the point of Walking the Air (\u9054\u7a7a\u865b\u9053)! Are they not the elite of the Demonic Cult who were taught by the great me? They are true demons because they have not forgotten their martial arts even in their death.\u201d\u201cHo-Hold on.\u201dI said, even if I only understood the approximate nuance of the sentence in a flurry of bizarre words, I still heard something that couldn\u2019t be overlooked.\u201cThey don\u2019t forget their martial arts even after they die?\u201d\u201cHuh? Perhaps you\u2019re in the dark about things because you\u2019re a child of the Sae-Wae.\u201dThe woman of the Demonic Cult tilted her head.\u201cIf a strong person becomes a jiangshi, their Martial Arts spread. Isn\u2019t it common sense?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of such a thing being common sense!\u201dOh, my God. Zombies who use martial arts!If it were a comedy, I\u2019d laugh it off, but now it was not a comedy genre, but the world of genuine martial arts genre . It wasn\u2019t the time for jokes.\u201cThose children are of the Demonic Cult, which have been taught directly by the great me. If you take lessons from the great me, your body will react to killing intent even when you go to bed. Huu. It\u2019s great to see the Qingong Skill being used even if it\u2019s by corpses.\u201d\u201cHuuuh! They\u2019re catching up! They\u2019ll catch up to us like this, you Munju idiot!\u201dThe Medicine King on the back of the Venomous Snake screamed. The Zombies, who rose into the air, descended like ferocious hawks, and the Medicine King almost tore his own hair apart from the tension.\u201cRun more! Can\u2019t you run faster?! If I get bitten and become a zombie, I\u2019ll bite you first!\u201d\u201cFuck, where is the brat who brought these oldies here, huh?!\u201dThe Venomous Snake squealed.\u201cAnd why am I surrounded by oldies behind and in front of me while you are surrounded by two women?!\u201d\u201cWe are about to be torn to shreds getting hit by the zombies\u2019 martial arts, does that matter now?!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re about to die. What else could matter more?\u201dShouted Bae Hu-Ryeong who was shielding the rear on my behalf.-They\u2019re Zombies! Zombies!What kind of bullshit was this?\u201cWeakness!\u201dI said to the woman of the Demonic Cult.\u201cDon\u2019t they have any weaknesses?\u201d\u201cIf you cut off their heads, they will stop moving.\u201d\u201cNot that, something easier to manage!\u201dIn fact, I was prepared to die at this moment. That would work on a normal zombie perhaps. But the story was very different if the world was full of zombies who were even able to use martial arts. Not only the Sword Saint, but it was also the same with the Witch and the Heretic Questioner, I was worried that I might not see a clear angle ever after handpicking all the star members we currently had.\u201cUm.\u201dThe woman of the Demonic Cult nodded her head.She raised her finger and pointed over my shoulder.\u201cWhen the sun shines, they stop.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dIndeed. It was simple when you think about it.The scene where zombies started to close in on us, and the scene where they flew in with a Qingong technique, were so shocking that I couldn\u2019t think around those facts.\u201cNameless maiden! And also the Alchemist!\u201d\u201cUm.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dThe witch-like woman answered in a nonchalant voice, and the Alchemist answered in a rattling voice. I focused the Aura on my arm.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ll cast you aside! Please land on your own!\u201d\u201cUm.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201dAnd threw the woman and the Alchemist as far away as possible, with all the might of a javelin finalist in the Olympic Games.The woman made no sound when she flew away. She just dropped headfirst on the snowy field with a thud. The Alchemist, on the other hand, fell with a piercing scream. The snowfield she fell into was engraved with a large (\u5927) embossed letter.\u201cSorry!\u201dI apologized one last time and then stopped.Looking back, hundreds of zombies were rushing in.-Keuuurgh!-Kiiiiik!-Oooooh!Keuooo!I got goosebumps all over.I have fought with zombies on the 13th floor before, but they were different from these ones flying like mosquitoes in the sky. To be honest, I was a little scared.-I\u2019m going to die!For some reason, Bae Hu-Ryeong was delighted.-I never thought I\u2019d see a zombie die because of a real zombie again! Ah, good! This is the moment when I check one wish off my bucket list!Did that old man make a bucket list even after he became a ghost?\u201cNot yet,\u201dIn the middle of the snowfield, I faced a group of zombies.\u201cI\u2019m not going to die just yet!\u201dI pulled the Holy Sword of the Goddess out of its sheath.Striking the teeth of a proud zombie nearest to me and looking at the flesh of the zombie who was previously frozen, I hurriedly spoke into my mind.\u201cShiny!\u201d[Shiny answers the call of the warrior.]\u2018Shine!\u2019Paaaaaaaaahhhh!Fragment of the Constellation. The Holy Sword; the first Idol I owned out of the five sister swords, radiated light. The snowfield reflected the light and everything shone brightly.And I realized that I had a talent for naming. It was indeed the right choice to give Shiny the name \u201cShiny\u201d.-Uhhhhhh!-Geuooo.Ooooohhhh\u2026They stopped.Zombies seeing the light of the Holy Sword stopped midair in unison. All of them fell to the ground like mosquitoes that were hit directly by a bug spray. Because they did not break the fall, the snow that covered the snowfield was drilled with holes like a honeycomb.\u201cheuoook!\u201dThe Medicine King, who had been caught by a zombie, groaned. The zombie hardened as it was gripping the Medicine King\u2019s white hair.\u201cA-Am I alive? Do I get to breathe again? If it weren\u2019t for that bastard Marcus, I wouldn\u2019t have come to the tower. Curse my fate\u2026\u201d\u201cIs everyone alright?\u201dI didn\u2019t let my guard down. It was not yet over. The dark clouds had not receded from the sky, and the ground was still dark.The only light around us was the brilliance being emitted from the Holy Sword of the Goddess.If the light goes out even for a moment, those fearsome Zombies would resume their activities.\u201cUh. Yes, my face hurts a little, but it\u2019s okay\u2026Thank you for saving me, Death King\u2026.\u201d\u201cFuck, the Medicine King, and this old fart too! I want to live my life while distancing myself from old people, please!\u201dThe Alchemist and the Venomous Snake informed us that they were safe in their own way.I nodded.\u201cGuild master of Chen Mu-mun. Please take care of the others while I kill the zombies.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to get rid of them while they\u2019re not moving.\u201dI aimed at a zombie with the Holy Sword.\u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time, but it\u2019s not hard work\u2026\u201d\u201cWait a moment. Child of the Sae-Wae.\u201dThe woman of the Demonic Cult rose from the snow.Slowly she brushed the snowflakes off her uniform.\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019d like to express my gratitude for saving the great me, who is a complete stranger. But if you\u2019re going to behead the jiangshi, then the great me will have to stop you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why?\u201dAll kinds of things came to my mind.Is there an unusual curse on a zombie if it is killed, will the curse be transmitted? In fact, few monsters are as abundant in variations as zombies. Depending on how it is set up in the world view, they can either become a trash-mob or a terrible disaster.But what the woman of the Demonic Cult told us was something we completely didn\u2019t expect.\u201cThose are all the Demonic Cult\u2019s followers.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re the disciples and subordinates of the great me.\u201dShe was serious.\u201cThe Great War, which was ignited by the Righteous Sect bastards, is on the horizon. We are in dire need of every individual. We can\u2019t lose more elites here when we\u2019re in a tight spot anyway.\u201dWhat kind of a crock of shit was this?Our party did not understand the woman\u2019s words. What Great War? The heaven and earth of this world were already on the verge of collapsing. There could not be any forces or men to wage war.The librarian had said this as he guided us to the Apocalypse.\u300cWhen you open your eyes, it will be the world 10 days before Chronicles of Heavenly Demon faces a discontinuation.\u300d\u300cI look forward to your wonderful ending.\u300dOnly ten days till utter destruction comes.I don\u2019t know how many survivors will remain in this world, but\u2026 After ten days, they\u2019ll all die anyway. Neither the woman of the Demonic Cult nor the old man of the Righteous Sect was an exception to this fate.The two Righteous and Demonic sect people were calm, perhaps it was because they knew of this future.\u201cThat old man\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Murim Lord, master of the Righteous Sect. He\u2019s called Bu Wol-sun.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve been in the Great War with that old man for three years. It\u2019s been 989 days since the war was declared. The great me and the old man swore on our respective names, and we could never get out of here until one of us concedes defeat.\u201dThe woman of the Demonic Cult gravely stated.\u201cAll of our sect disciples have been reduced to jiangshi, but if they use the martial arts of the Demonic Cult, they will soon be demons. They\u2019re the men the great me has to take care of. Don\u2019t kill them. If you want to kill, then only pick the ones wearing priest robes\u2026.\u201d\u201cBullshit! We painstakingly raked those Elites together from the prestigious Righteous Sect!\u201dThe old man of the Righteous Sect jumped up and down.\u201cDidn\u2019t you make a promise, Heavenly Demon? You and I will see the end of the Great War of Good and Evil without touching the jiangshi!\u201d\u201cPromises are made to be broken.\u201d\u201cYou wicked bitch! Then I\u2019ll also smash each of those demon jiangshi\u2019s heads!\u201d\u201cYou son of a bitch, the head of the Righteous Sect is going to break the bargain? You have finally revealed your true colors of being a hypocrite!\u201dJust as they did before the zombies started moving, the two looked as if they were going to have a life-or-death duel right away.I was dumbfounded.\u201c\u2026The world is destroyed, and you\u2019re saying that you\u2019re going to continue doing something like that?\u201d\u201cThe order is wrong.\u201dThe\u00a0 Demonic Cult woman called the Heavenly Demon shook her head.\u201cThe whole world was destroyed on its own while we were at war.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThat was to say,The Righteous Sect old man, the Righteous Sect Lord woman, and the Demonic Cult, and the Heavenly Demon fought while putting their fates on the line. There was no problem so far. However, the sudden outbreak of the virus turned all of their subordinates into zombies.Ordinary people would stop the war here, run away, or hide\u2014.\u201cBut you can\u2019t put off the game that you\u2019ve already started!\u201dThe Righteous and Demonic sects people were definitely not ordinary.The Murim Lord and the Heavenly Demon\u2026 Even though all their men were reduced to zombies, they had no intentions of stopping the war.Not only did they not stop, but the two still treated their men who had turned into Jiangshi as their own.That\u2019s why the world with the Zombie Apocalypse had been suffering through a war for three years.\u201cThe great me won\u2019t stop until we get a victory from that old man. There are still five hundred soldiers left to the great me. I will lead them and destroy him.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s for me to say, you Madu! I am joined by a group of martial artists who will fight against you bitches, even if they turn into vengeful spirits! I\u2019ll put an end to this tedious 989-day war!\u201dYes.It wasn\u2019t just our expedition which had no dreams and hopes.There was no dream or hope in this world itself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 \u2013 The Battle of Good and Evil (\u6b63\u9b54\u5927\u6230) (3)Translator: Cuties Editor: Sasha3.The world as they knew it was collapsing, yet the two\u00a0Righteous and Demonic sect\u00a0people had no intentions of stopping their war.This alone was enough to render me speechless, but\u2026 There was a separate scene that was even more shocking.It was the scene of the two fighting.\u201cThe scholar does not cover his brush, and the warrior does not cover his sword.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon said to the Murim Lord.The wooden stick was still in her hands.\u201cAlthough the great me is only holding a wooden stick upon forgetting to bring a sword, I can still send an old man like you beyond the yellow river.\u201d\u201cCome on then!\u201dThe Murim Lord\u00a0held his cane and shouted vehemently.\u201cLet\u2019s fight for the last time and determine who will lead the\u00a0Righteous and Demonic sects\u00a0once and for all!\u201dThus the two\u00a0Righteous and Demonic sect\u00a0people clashed.Perhaps the term \u201cconfrontation\u201d was a little too much.The two people\u2019s tactics were nothing more than mere drabbing.\u201cHeavenly Demon Limbo\u00a0 (\u5929\u9b54\u541b\u81e8\u6b65)!\u201d[T/N: Basically the leader of the demonic cult. Cheonma is the heavenly demon]\u201cHuh! Sky Piercing Yellow Moon!(\u9ec3M\u7834\u5929)!\u201dThe Heavenly Demon and the Murim Sect Lord faced off with fairly specious words. But that was all there was to it.What the two people had in their hands were only wooden canes, and the sound of them clashing was rhythmic and cheerful.Bam! Bam! Bam!Their canes broke even before the climax of their fight. Then the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord rushed at each other, with a fierce glare in their eyes. The Heavenly Demon caught the Murim Lord\u2019s beard, and the latter grabbed her by the hair.I was speechless.\u201cWhat the hell is this\u2026\u201dAnd then it got more interesting.With all of us dumbfounded,-Oh, that\u2019s weird.Bae Hu-ryeong gave an unusual response.-They\u2019ve got the right posture. Those guys.\u2018What?\u2019-They\u2019re breathing properly with correct movements. Even in my world, they\u2019d be considered masters.I looked at the duel again. The Murim Lord was about to poke the eyes of the Heavenly Demon, and the latter was hurriedly covering her face with both hands.\u2018Those two?\u2019-You don\u2019t know that fundamental principle? That Divine Dragon\u2019s claw poking the eyes is trying to steal the Vile Dragon\u2019s pearl can be called Two Dragons Fighting for a Pearl (\u96d9\u9f8d\u722d\u00a0\u73e0). And that one defending his face can be assimilated to Buddha covering the faces of the humankind and can be called Thousand Sound Observing (\u5343\u5f0f\u89aa\u97f3)\u2026[T/N: the first one refers to a Chinese myth where fairies were bathing in the heavenly pond and got attacked by demons but were rescued by 2 dragons. When the Queen heard of this she bestowed them a precious pearl that would grant them immortality and ultimate cultivation. None of the 2 Dragons ever gave up the pearl for the sake of the other and so they kept trying to snatch it from the other\u2019s claws eternally.The second is a Buddhist belief that Buddha Listens to the sufferings of 1 000 people at once and answers them by covering their eyes. The meaning of the closed eyes in Buddhist philosophy is a conception that one is not exposed to the evil around. Hence, one doesn\u2019t indulge in any kind of crime. One remains immune to villainous acts and thus protected from all kinds of misgivings and ill-fortunes as a result.(Face covering = closing eyes = relief from suffering) ]Thus went Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s explanation.I raised one hand to block the last of it.\u2018But why are they having a dog fight in such a sloppy manner?\u2019-That\u2019s why it\u2019s weird. If they\u2019ve reached that stage, they should follow the flow of qi, so they should be filled with righteousness.It\u2019s because they don\u2019t have any energy in their movements, that\u2019s why they cannot summon a single flex of Aura and were flailing their arms in that slovenly manner. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have been like that if their Dantians were crushed\u2026Seeing Bae Hu-ryeong constantly tilting his head, I thought of one possibility.Perhaps the only possibility.\u2018You\u2019re just making fun of me, Sword Emperor, aren\u2019t you?\u2019-Hey, you zombie. I\u2019m not some kind of a sicko, I don\u2019t joke around with stuff like this.The Sword Emperor smacked me.-No, damnit, can you really not see that? of all things I had to go into closed-doors cultivation and draw out my form and thought with my drained aura. Tsk tsk. well, I guess that\u2019s why I needed you in the first place\u2026Spending many years behind closed doors cultivation upon fighting the Devil King of Fall Rain was only natural. Anyway, the Sword Emperor was serious.And there was one more serious person.\u201cThat old woman\u2026 she\u2019s pretty good.\u201dThe Poisonous Snake was squinting his eyes.\u201cThat bite is following the principle of the Jiwangsa, and that arm strike follows the principle of Onwolyong.\u201d-Heeya, he says he\u2019s \u201creal,\u201d but I guess a warrior is still a warrior. Yes, like a giant snake biting the King of the Earth, and then going on with a dragon-like skin. Did you see that zombie? Unlike you, I have eyes that see through everything.I went through the Venomous Snake\u2019s thoughts silentlyChen Mu-mun Master was seriously thinking with his arms folded.\u300cIf I were to analyze it with my [Unrivaled under the heaven] skill\u2026 I\u2019d say it\u2019s right.\u300d\u300cThose movements could also be explained as [It\u2019s good to be born as a hell\u2018ji\u2019hound (Cerberus) and keep the gates of the Demon King\u2018wang\u2019 castle, but both sides were the rebirth \u2018sa\u2019 of the troublemakers and the class president, so I\u2019m the one stuck between them] And [the hero of the \u2018on\u2019line game, a male high school student along with his younger classmates who skipped a grade\u2018wol\u2019 and a popular cartoonist, has decided to be a true warrior\u2018yong\u2019]. I\u2019m sure.\u2019[ T/N: Jiwangsa and onwolyong appear in the hangul of the previous sentence]The Sword Emperor was dumbstruck.The unknown Alchemist tilted her head.\u201cIs\u2026 is that so, Lord? It just looks like a little fight between young kids\u2026\u201d\u201cFuck. If it could be clear to anyone then what\u2019s the difference between the master and the follower? It\u2019s only obvious to the eyes of people like me.\u201d\u300cOh, my God. Just how many skills do they hold? At this rate, those two are above the Sword Saint grandpa.\u00a0\u300d\u300cI feel like I\u2019m going to level up just by looking at them. I got things to teach my disciples when I go back\u300dEum.\u2018Sword Emperor.\u2019-Yes, zombie\u2026\u2018All rivers meet in the ocean, right? There\u2019s a lot of formulas to come up with the same answer. That\u2019s the point of martial arts.\u2019-Yes, thank you\u2026Fortunately, this strange scene in which the Murim Lord and the Heavenly Demon were having a dogfight, the Emperor of Light novels coming to a realization while watching that, and above all, this strange scene in which I consoled the Sword Emperor, did not last long.\u201cAchoo! Aigoo I\u2019m freezing to death!\u201dThe Medicine King screamed.\u201cHey, you bastard and wench! How long are you going to be fighting? Can\u2019t you see us in front of you? Tsk tsk, look look, what a narrow-sighted pair! You\u2019re just like young children, exactly like young children!\u201dThey stopped at the Medicine King\u2019s deafening roar.The Murim Lord scratched the back of his head with an embarrassed face.\u201cWell, we haven\u2019t had a visitor in a long while. Surely this is not the proper behavior to exhibit.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon also coughed awkwardly.\u201cFor now, I will guide you to the cave, where the great me is staying.\u201d4.It wasn\u2019t long before the dark clouds cleared up. I no longer needed Shiny to light the way.The zombies were again as hard as stone in the sun, and we were able to escape the snowfield safely.\u201cHuff, huff\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 haah\u2026!\u201dHowever, the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord. The poor physical strength of the two people was a hindrance.The two of them were obviously not ordinary\u00a0Righteous and Demonic sect\u00a0people, but the heads of the Demonic Cult and the Righteous Cult. They were the ones who had to show off that they had this world\u2019s most powerful martial arts. The Sword Emperor and Chen Mu-mun Master even guaranteed their military service through different arguments.And yet somehow\u2026 The two people were totally out of shape.They were gasping for breath even though they had only walked a little in the snow.\u201cUhm.\u201dI said discreetly because I couldn\u2019t stand seeing it.\u201cCan I give you a piggyback, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d\u201cPlea, please. It\u2019s not easy to practice Mind Control (\u5fc3\u6cd5) today.\u201dIn the end, as I did earlier, I carried the Heavenly Demon, and the Venomous Snake carried the Murim Lord.The Venomous Snake said solemnly.\u201cDeath King. That\u2019s not right.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThis is how it should be.\u201d\u201cIt is only right this way.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t have the strength to argue, so I decided to go along with it.It was then.\u2018Huh?\u2019I was seized by a strange feeling as I was carrying the Murim Lord and walking.\u2018It\u2019s strange.\u2019Bae Hu-ryeoung tilted its head.-What\u2019s weird?\u2018He feels warm.\u2019-Hm?\u2018\u2026His body feels very warm. But isn\u2019t the weather so cold now? If we don\u2019t use our Aura we\u2019ll freeze. But he\u2019s so warm.\u2019-\u2026\u2026.The Sword Emperor looked thoughtful and silent. I followed his example and was lost in thought.Is he protecting his body with his Aura just like we\u2019re doing? But why didn\u2019t I feel a single speck of internal energy from his attacks in the battle that just took place then?\u2018What is it? Things don\u2019t add up.\u2019Something was strange.But as I was failing to notice exactly what was strange, we crossed the snowfield.\u201cThis is the home of the great me.\u201dThe cave that the Heavenly Horse pointed at was not far from the snowfield.There was a wide hole in the ceiling, and the glow of the sunset poured in.\u201cWow\u2026.\u201dThe Alchemist\u2019s mouth was wide open with shock. Her eyes glistened over the frosted spectacles.\u201cI-It\u2019s a hot spring, isn\u2019t it?\u201dThere was an open-air bath in the cave.A deep pond had settled on the bottom of the cave. Water vapor rose from the surface of the pond. The natural hot spring was supposed to overcome the freezing cold and warm the surroundings with the consolation of sunset. With the hot spring flowing down, I thought it was a beautiful sight.\u201cThe great me had found it a long time ago.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon smiled like she was glad.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to welcome strangers from the Sae-Wae as guests. Wash first. I\u2019ll look for food to serve you in addition to drinking water with that oldie.\u201d\u201cHuh. Is there anything else we can serve other than energy bars?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I say let\u2019s go look for something? Old man, are your ears deafening as you age?\u201d\u201cOld man, old man, old man,\u2026 you always call me that, but if you look at it, there\u2019s not much age difference between you and me!\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re offended, then you should\u2019ve also grown some wisdom instead of getting old in vain.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord wobbled away to the other end of the cave.We stayed in the hot springs and looked at the two with curious eyes.\u201cTh, that\u2019s amazing. They were engaged in a life-or-death battle just a while ago\u2026\u201dThey had been fighting for three years. There must be some affection or respect they grew for each other while fighting.\u201dThe Medicine King grumbled.\u201cBut it\u2019s warm and nice around here. Eey. As soon as I came to this world, I was so embarrassed to hold a man\u2019s hand. Now get away from me a little, Chemu-mun Master.\u201d\u201cHow did the Sword Saint become friends with someone like you?\u201d\u201cOho! Get your facts right. I allowed Marcus to become friends with me!\u201d\u201cWhat the\u2026 Well, I guess you and the Sword Saint are both weirdos. Frick, you\u2019re two of a kind.\u201dSo we went into the open-air bath and took a rest.After we finished taking a bath, the two Righteous and Demonic sect people served us food.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think we have any other food to serve you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an energy seed. Eat lots.\u201dWhat the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord served us were kernel beads. It was Hwan (\u4e5d)./* T/N: Hwan is a round medicinal pill that is made from natural substances. */It looked like Cheongsimhwan, but the grain was a little bigger./* T/N: Cheongsimhwan is a medicine that clears a person\u2019s heart. */\u201cOnce upon a time, I could hunt prey like a wolf. These days, animals are so hard to see, let alone catch. I don\u2019t even know how the world came to be like this.\u201d\u201cNo, thanks for your hospitality.\u201dI received the plate politely. It had been three years since the world collapsed. There\u2019s no way there\u2019d be any other type of food around.Our party carefully nibbled at the Hwan.\u201cBlegh!\u201d\u201cUgh.\u201dThe Venomous Snake and the Medicine King had a constipated face on. I almost coughed, too. The old beans tasted raw. They could barely be considered as food.\u201cYou haven\u2019t really been surviving on this, have you\u2026?\u201dThe Alchemist picked up the Hwan and looked around as if she were amazed.\u201cAlmost so.\u201d\u201cFor, for how long?\u201d\u201cUhm.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon stared at the cave wall. The wall was inscribed with numerous calendar markings. Perhaps the two had kept track of the date one stroke a day when they began to live in this cave.\u201cIt\u2019s been more than two years since we\u2019ve been eating only the Hwan.\u201d\u201c2 years\u2026\u201dThe Alchemist was speechless. Two years\u2026 They said they had eaten only grains for two years.The Alchemist groaned as if it was difficult for her to understand this.\u201cTh-That\u2019s ridiculous. Then you won\u2019t be able to get proper nutrition. Without proper coordination of sugars and lipids, proteins, and vitamins and minerals, the human body\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm? I don\u2019t know what you mean, but it\u2019s still edible.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t stand it!\u201dThe Medicine King shouted back.Standing up suddenly, the Medicine King took something out of his pocket. He pulled out all sorts of things, like burners, meat, seafood, and so on.\u201cWatch and learn, you idiots! Tch tch, you don\u2019t even have the energy to cross the snowfield. You not thinking about your bodies is the same as when I was young. Is there any water?\u201d\u201cOh, the water, we melt snow and drink it, or once in a while, when the sun shines for a few days in a row, water runs through the stone in there\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s driving me crazy. It\u2019s driving me crazy. 70% of the human body is water, but you drink that kind of water occasionally. You need to drink water that is full of minerals\u2026\u201dThe Medicine King, who set fire to a burner, took out bottled water and poured it into the pot.The Alchemist was surprised to see the bottled water.\u201cYou\u2019re using Bling H2O, aren\u2019t you? That expensive thing\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s so expensive about this? It\u2019s good for cooking, so I just use it. When I was outside the tower, I couldn\u2019t even see water. Tch tch, if it weren\u2019t for Marcus\u2026\u201dThe Medicine King tilted his head over the cooking pot that he pulled out of nowhere.-Hey zombie. What\u2019s a Bling H2O?\u2018Well, maybe it\u2019s like Evian.\u2019-What is Evian? Is that some kind of Elixir of Life?\u2018What\u2019s an Elixir of Life?\u2019-There\u2019s this crazily expensive water.Then it must be similar.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65. <The Battle of Good and Evil. (4)>========================Translator: thursdays Editor: SashaWhile Bae Hu-ryeong and I chatted, the Medicine King boiled the Evian-like bottled water. Meanwhile, on the other side, he laid out a frying pan and a cutting board and started cooking.A savory smell filled the cave.\u201cHuff, hut.\u201dThe Medicine King\u2019s hands were quick. Mussel soup, white fish grilled to a crisp like a crusted steak and served on asparagus, a stir fry dish consisting of a mysterious fish and long clams garnished with parsley, a porridge-like dish with clams and chopped mushrooms, and even a lamb leg cooked whole\u2014all these dishes were cooked and served in just 15 minutes.\u201cHey, everyone! It\u2019s not much, but eat it. Young\u2019uns should eat a lot and be well. Tsk.\u201dSeeing the dishes lined up in front of him, the Murim Lord opened his eyes wide.\u201cOh, no, but I am over thousands of years old\u2026 \u201c\u201cWhat, did you eat something that gives you eternal youth? Ah, if it were Silicon Valley, I would have patented it! If you\u2019re old, eat as much as your age! That\u2019s how you stay strong.\u201dThe image of the Medicine King talking as he poured the mussel soup into a large bowl was similar to that of a foul-mouthed grandmother or grandfather.I also received a bowl of mussel soup. It smelled all right. Mussel soup was mussel soup, after all, but just as I thought that\u2014Oh my god.\u2018It\u2019s so delicious!?\u2019Was it because I\u2019ve only been eating scraps of food like a Breatharian or something?[2]First of all, there was no trace of the usual fishy odor. And the soup wasn\u2019t just boiled with water. The broth was red, as some crimson vegetables had been added to it, and it was a little sour and savory, so the broth alone was delicious. The mussel meat was also chewy, so it was fantastic to bite into it and let the juice burst in my mouth and create an exquisite mixture with the broth as it wrapped around my tongue and teeth.It was like the pinnacle of taste.Even after winning the Sangryun lottery, I had only limited myself to the luxury of a white mocha frappuccino venti quadra shot java chip half and half chocolate drizzle, which was enough of a shock to me.The Alchemist, who was rolling in the slum as she hadn\u2019t yet become famous, seemed to be in the same position as me. Her eyes widened.\u201cOh my god. It\u2019s delicious\u2026\u201dThe Alchemist savored the taste and went on to explain.\u201cThis shrimp. It\u2019s plump and solid. And even though it tastes like shrimp\u2026 There\u2019s no fish odor\u2026 H, how can shrimp taste like this? In addition, the mille-feuille served for this dessert tastes like the nobility of Nuneddine[1]. And not just regular nobility but a high ranking noble. The yogurt ice cream underneath is fresh and seems to be mixed with passion fruit juice, so it feels refreshingly sour\u2026 H, how does it taste this good?\u201dThe Medicine King\u2019s nose haughtily pointed upward.\u201cThat\u2019s because when I was in my 50s, I was awarded the three Michelin stars as the owner and chef of a restaurant! Ey. If I had a proper burner instead of something like this, I would have made something that would really fill up your stomachs.\u201dCould it be that the Medicine King wasn\u2019t just good at making some medicine but was actually a really amazing person?Was he not bluffing about Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and being a boxing champion?\u201cWhy did such a great man come to the tower?\u201dThe Venomous Snake also asked as if he was curious about it, with a mouthful of seafood porridge (the official name which seemed to be abalone truffle risotto).The Medicine King snorted.\u201cWhy? Is it forbidden for someone like me to enter the tower? That Marcus came to the Tower too!\u201dHe had a point.\u201cDid you know each other from outside?\u201d\u201cKnow? Ha. He was just a filthy, nasty guy born to a filthy rich conglomerate. Compared to a self-made man in Silicon Valley like me, he\u2019s just a lucky guy. That guy ran out of that luck in his final years, and he came to the tower with a sword\u2026\u201dHis words, which began with a snort, ended in a whisper.The Alchemist, the Venomous Snake, and I all looked at the Medicine King as if we were reconsidering our opinions of him. Maybe that gaze irritated him, as the Medicine King shook his ladle as if shaking off a bird.\u201cJust eat!\u201dSo we ate. It was really delicious.It was the moment when the culinary director of the Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon was decided.\u201cIt\u2019s really the best taste.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon, the protagonist of the Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon, said, as she constantly poured dishes into her mouth.\u201cAre you imperial guardians? Hmm, no. It\u2019s different from Chinese cuisine.\u201dThe Murim Lord sprayed his saliva while sucking on the cream pasta like a vacuum.\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I mean. I have eaten various dishes as a lord, but this is my first time eating something like this.\u201d\u201cSuch strange dishes, and the appearance of abundance\u2026 I wonder where you come from, and why you came here\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you find a new way to cure Jiangshi\u2019s disease?\u201dThe two martial artists\u2019 eyes lit up.It was natural. From their standpoint, we were the first humans they had met in many years. Of course they found us fascinating, and of course they wondered if we had a cure.I felt sorry for them, but I shook my head.\u201cWe haven\u2019t. We, too, are still looking for a cure.\u201d\u201cHmm. I guess it is like that\u2026\u201dWere they as disappointed as they had been expectant?Their complexions became grim.\u201cWell. All of Kang Ho\u2019s doctors and experts rushed and tried to fix the mysterious disease, but none of them succeeded.\u201d\u201cBecause even the experts of Jiangshi, the masters of the Mosan Sect, had been turned, the circumstances would not have been different even if they were here now\u2026\u201d\u201cIs there really no cure?\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019re not bragging. You just saw the results of our cooking. We have different knowledge from you. This Alchemist here, especially, is superior to anyone in curing diseases and making medicines.\u201dThe Alchemist, who was eating the lamb in big bites, blushed.The Medicine King\u2019s murmurs of \u2018She\u2019s just lucky\u2019 that sounded next to us were\u2026 Well, I did feel a little sorry for him after he gave us such delicious food.\u201cThis person over there is more than enough to assist the Alchemist. If you help us a little, we can develop a cure.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord looked at each other.\u201cCure\u2026 What are you saying\u2026?\u201d\u201cWell. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s no way\u2026\u201dThe Alchemist\u2019s face turned red.\u201cWhat, what is it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Wait here.\u201dAfter a while, the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord brought out a large coffin.When they opened the casket, there was a zombie lying there.-\u2026\u2026.Like the time when he talked about the warm body of the Murim Lord, the Sword Emperor sealed his lips tight and furrowed his brow.The zombie was as calm as if it were under the sun. Maybe it was because it was tightly tied with chains or because of the spiky acupuncture needles embedded in each joint, but the zombie was lying immobile.I raised my head.\u201cThis is\u2026?\u201d\u201cOne of the monks of the Righteous Sect,\u201d the Heavenly Demon said flatly.\u201cRight after being bitten by Jiangshi, he entrusted his body to us to study. But there is only one thing we figured out. It was to block the chi of the whole body with needles.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon reached into the coffin.\u201cBe careful.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon pulled out a large needle from the zombie\u2019s neck.-Ahhhhhh!!At that exact moment, the zombie, who was as quiet as if it were sleeping, opened its eyes.\u201cWoah!?\u201dThe Alchemist was startled and fell back. The zombie opened its mouth as if to bite the frightened Alchemist. Chul-kung! Chul-kung! Because of the chains, the zombie\u2019s attack ended in vain, but the Alchemist couldn\u2019t help but sweat.\u201cAs you can see.\u201dPuk!The Heavenly Demon stabbed the zombie\u2019s neck with the needle again. Then, the zombie slowly closed its eyes once more. The zombie\u2019s complexion relaxed, as if it had never even struggled. \u201cIf you block the chi flow between the brain and spinal cord, you can calm the Jiangshi. It\u2019s the point where the cervix meets the spinal column. However, this is a stopgap measure rather than a cure.\u201d\u201cAnyone who is bitten by the Jiangshi becomes stained with takgi that spreads through the blood and respiratory tract.\u201dTakgi, or murky energy.Did he mean the virus?\u201cThis takgi cannot be defeated no matter how much you meditate or try to starve it out. Even the demons, who cultivated magical power from the very beginning, and martial arts masters, who have clear spirits like streams, are finished once bitten. The whole body gets hot like a fire, and they soon become Jiangshi.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon slowly covered the coffin.\u201cThis Shaolin monk lasted the longest. Even though his arm was bitten by the Jiangshi, he kept his mind clear for a year. But that\u2019s one of the exceptions, and it\u2019s usually hard to last beyond 15 days, no matter how great one\u2019s mastery is.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon sighed.\u201cChildren of the outside world. Can you really find a cure?\u201d[3]\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Alchemist could not answer. Even the Medicine King, who had a bad temperament, was speechless.The Heavenly Demon smiled bitterly when none of us could respond.\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I thought there were only two people left in the world, the old man and me, but just seeing new people makes this old woman want to take care of you. Stay here for as long as you want.\u201dThe Murim Lord nodded.\u201cI\u2019ll set up some sleeping places for you, so let\u2019s end here today. Though I want to talk to you about many things, we can try to resolve it tomorrow.\u201dThe first day in the Apocalypse.We had to spend the night without accomplishing much.5.\u201cUmm\u2026 I can\u2019t eat anymore\u2026 \u201d\u201cMarcus, you bastard, if you leave like that I\u2019ll only be in second place my whole life\u2026\u201dMidnight. The party went to sleep while muttering and drooling.There was a bed near the open-air bath, so even though it was a little wet, I didn\u2019t have to worry about getting cold.-Zombie. Why aren\u2019t you sleeping?I looked up at the sky. The cave had an open ceiling, so I could see the black night sky well.\u2018I have something to check.\u2019Instead of asking me what I wanted to check, the Sword Emperor shut his mouth. He must have guessed it.That guess was probably the same as mine.I pulled the blanket up to my face. Then, I closed my eyes and pretended that I had fallen asleep.The night deepened.Srrk\u2014.I felt someone approaching. It wasn\u2019t just one presence. There were two. I quietly held my breath without opening my eyes. The two of them lingered around us and whispered in very small voices.\u201c\u2026Are they asleep?\u201d\u201c\u2026I believe so.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then let\u2019s do it now. Hurry up.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s right. Let\u2019s finish it quickly.\u201dThe voices of the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord.The sound gradually moved farther away from us. Splash. I heard the sounds of water. The two Murim people started taking a bath just after all of us fell asleep.\u2018It\u2019s now.\u2019Hwik!I got up in a flash and ran toward the open-air bath. Beyond the thick vapor. The Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord were wearing white mourning clothes in the bath. They were enjoying the hot spring with languid faces and were surprised to see me suddenly run in.\u201cHuh!?\u201dThe Murim Lord dunked himself in the bath. The old man could not hide his embarrassment.Of course.Looking at their bodies, I was convinced that my predictions were correct.\u201cWh, what?! You! I thought you were asleep!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon narrowed her eyes. She seemed to understand the situation a little faster than the old man. Sighing lightly, she looked at me quietly.\u201c\u2026This child is quick on the uptake. When did you realize it?\u201d\u201cI thought it was a bit weird from the first time I saw you.\u201dI opened my mouth.\u201cThe weather was so cold, but the two of you were dressed lightly. One was wearing only a martial arts uniform, and the other was wearing a small mourning outfit.\u201dThe weather outside was freezing.If you didn\u2019t use Aura, you couldn\u2019t survive at all.In such a powerfully cold climate, the Murim people in front of us had worn clothes that were no different from being naked.\u201cIt meant that you were protecting your bodies from the cold by circulating your life energy. In other words, it meant that you are highly skilled at manipulating your life energy\u2026 But how could such skilled people get tired from small fights or walking a little? It was strange.\u201dI said slowly,\u201cThere is only one explanation for this. The two of you are focusing all your efforts on other work.\u201d\u201cYou told us just a little while ago that once bitten by Jiangshi, a person\u2019s whole body will be stained with takgi.\u201dI looked straight through the water vapor at the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord.\u201cYou two have already been bitten, correct?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s like this. Heavenly Demon-nim and Murim Lord-nim. Both of you were infected by the Jiangshi a long time ago. But with your magic and martial arts, you\u2019re holding back the takgi with tremendous effort. Am I wrong?\u201dThe silence settled in the open-air bath.Splash.I heard the sound of water being shaken off, and soon, the Heavenly Demon stood up.\u201cMa, Madu. You\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Old man. Haven\u2019t we been completely figured out already?\u201dThe Heavenly Demon shook her head.\u201cChild of the outside world. Your words are right.\u201dShe turned her back toward me.The pure white back of the Heavenly Demon.\u201cThe old man and I were already bitten by the Jiangshi three years ago.\u201dThere was a scar that was rotting and purple.The Murim Lord also slowly showed the back of his neck.\u201cBut, strictly speaking, there is one part of your words that is wrong.\u201dLikewise, there was a rotting wound there.However, the wound stopped at the neck.\u201cWe\u2019re not suppressing the takgi.\u201dAbove the neck, there was a clean, human face.With that clean face, the Murim Lord said,\u201cWe blocked the takgi by blocking the cervical part of our spinal cord with our life energy.\u201dThe Sword Emperor clicked his tongue.-Insanity. It\u2019s telekinesis.\u2018Telekinesis?\u2019-Gongja. Do you know what the chi sword is?\u2018Yes, it\u2019s a technique to wrap a sword with life energy and make it fly\u2026 Could it be?\u2019There was no way\u2026..-That\u2019s right. Blocking the cervical spinal point means that the sensation under the neck disappears. Then, of course you can\u2019t move. In other words, they have become paralyzed, but the way they are moving now\u2026 . It\u2019s like using the chi sword to move your whole body with life energy.Bae Hu-ryeong said quietly.-Moving the heart.Making it beat.-Breathing through their lungs.Inhaling and exhaling air.-Moving their joints while extending one arm, and controlling their back, knees, ankles, and soles while extending their legs forward.In short, everything they need to live and move.-Those guys are controlling everything one by one with their life energy.To prevent the zombie virus from spreading through the spinal cord to their brains.The two martial artists closed off their own brains.I was silent.Chk.-It\u2019s the same as if they are using the chi sword 24/7. So even if they take a few steps, they lose strength. They\u2019re crazy\u2026The Heavenly Demon said, as if hearing Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s words,\u201cWe are carrying out the great battle of good and evil like this.\u201dThe Murim Lord picked up where she left off again.\u201cThree years have already passed since then.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66 <Heavenly Demon. (1)>==================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha-Heavenly Demon-nim.-It can\u2019t go on like this.-\u2026\u2026Heavenly Demon-nim. Half of the Blood Guard has been destroyed! The elders have scattered all over after saying they will enter the world of martial arts, but we\u2019ve already lost track of their locations. It\u2019s not the time to fight the idiots in the factions. It may be the biggest crisis our cult, no, maybe our world, has faced. With this vacancy, the bums are spreading rumors\u2026-\u2026\u2026Heavenly Demon-nim. As you ordered, we have made a pharmacy that does not distinguish between the sects. The leaders of the Tang Mun came, as did the masters of the Mosan Sect. I will catch some Jiangshi and get results as soon as possible\u2026.-\u2026\u2026Heavenly Demon-nim. The Wolyeong Cavalry and even the Blood Demon have been attacked. Even if we defeat a hundred Jiangshi today, a thousand new Jiangshi will be created tomorrow. I can\u2019t handle this mysterious disease! The pharmacy says that we can block the upper body with needles in order to block the Jiangshi, but this method is\u2026\u2026.-\u2026\u2026Heavenly Demon-nim. Please flee to Nakdo. If you block yourself off on the island, no matter how many Jiangshi are there, 1 million or 10 million, they will not be able to cross the sea. How could this place be the only group that practices martial arts? If we set up the banner of our cult, it will still be a part of the martial world\u2026-\u2026\u2026Heavenly Demon-nim. Why should you keep to the worthless promise? It was an oath made before the world became corrupt. The law of the heavens has changed, and a human\u2019s duties always change. Forget the oath you made with the Murim Lord, and please retreat to make a comeback later\u2026-Heavenly Demon-nim.-Heavenly Demon-nim.2.\u201c\u2014How did you endure it?\u201dAfter being silent for a while, the first question I asked was this.\u2018Just how did they endure this?\u2019The hellish world where people became corpses. Even they had become half a corpse. How did they endure three years with the danger of their heart stopping if the flow of his chi was blocked for even a moment?\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord couldn\u2019t answer right away. The two looked at each other. And after sharing a look that I couldn\u2019t understand, they nodded as one.\u201cFollow us.\u201dThe two left the cave.I followed them.When we left the cave, we were silent. We walked carefully so as not to wake up the other party by accident. So we were silent for a long time.As soon as we reached the end of the cave, the stillness broke.\u201cHumans all die someday.\u201dOutside, dawn was coming.\u201cThere is an interesting story told among Murim. There was once a high master who achieved both Thousand Poisons Immunity and Stone Durability. With the techniques, no poison could eat away at his insides, and no sword could injure his skin.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon let out a sigh.\u201cHe can be said to be almost invincible. Inside, he was invincible. Outside, he was invincible. How can one kill a person who can\u2019t be harmed with even the most brutal poison nor the sharpest sword?\u201dThe dawn sky became blue.At dawn, the world was just a pale shade of itself.\u201cBut there is one thing that the old stories could never tolerate. It is invincibility.\u201dThe world that became a shadow. The Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord walked in that place. Step by step. Slowly. Footprints could only touch the ground, never the sky. It was only with one\u2019s own steps that one could distinguish between heaven and earth.\u201cChildren of the outside world.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon glanced back.We left the cave and arrived at yesterday\u2019s fields of snow\u2026 We were walking to a place surrounded by zombies who knew martial arts.\u201cCan you guess how that high master died?\u201d\u201cHow did he die?\u201d\u201cHe died because of a succubus.\u201dThe corner of the Heavenly Demon\u2019s mouth rose.\u201cThe pleasure of uniting yin and yang is not poison. It\u2019s not a sword, either.\u201d\u201cUh. But isn\u2019t excessive pleasure also a poison?\u201d\u201cCorrect. Thus, the succubus did not offer a storm of pleasure from the beginning. She was clever. She calmly took her time. At first, she started with the most subtle pleasure\u2026 In the end, he indulged in even the most lethal of pleasures. Thus she, tamed and domesticated the master.\u201dThe dawn broke.The snowfield became a little white.The white puffs resembled the breath of the Heavenly Demon.\u201cAs he had intercourse with the succubus, he stopped thinking of her palms slapping him as pain. Her whip came to be recognized as a pleasure. The succubus\u2019 gestures, footsteps, and even small glances became a sort of happiness for the master.\u201dSweek.The Heavenly Demon raised her hand.\u201cAt the last moment.\u201dShe stroked her neck.\u201cLightly. The succubus just lightly choked the master and strangled him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThere was no need for strong martial arts. It didn\u2019t take much effort. Two hands. She choked his neck with her two hands. As he suffocated, unable to breathe, he was soaked with pleasure and smiled brightly. Even after death, his face was smiling happily.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon snickered.\u201cThe high master, who reached the climax, was literally killed during the climax. He was invincible inside and outside, but he was not invincible to happiness.\u201dIn the middle of the snowy field.We could see the corpses. Though they were dead, the corpses could move as if they were alive. Soaked in the light of dawn, they stiffened. The corpses didn\u2019t even move, so it looked like a forest of shadows.\u201cThe lesson of this story is simple.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t play around with succubi, obviously!\u201dThe Murim Lord grumbled.\u201cIt\u2019s not just an old story. It\u2019s something that really happened. Hmph! He was a master raised among jade and gold in the Tang Mun, but that bitch was secretly a succubus sent to assassinate him.\u201d\u201cHoho.\u201dZombies were scattered everywhere in the snowy field. Was it because they had chased our party yesterday? The Heavenly Demon approached the zombies.\u201cMost of the novices who set out to learn martial arts don\u2019t understand. They think the goal of martial artists is to become invincible, and that the reason for learning martial arts is to obtain immortality and eternal life.\u201dWith a quick breath, the Demon hoisted up a zombie.\u201cThey\u2019re wrong.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord. The two lifted and carried the zombies.\u201cAnyone who has achieved the Thousand Poisons Immunity will die from something other than poison. Those who achieve the Stone Durability will die by something other than a sword. Do you understand? Martial artists don\u2019t simply choose which martial arts to learn.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon arduously moved the zombies.\u201cIt\u2019s about choosing what kind of warrior you will live as, and also how you will die.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon\u2019s movement as he moved the zombies was sluggish and slow.Like a delivery man after dropping off a heavy load, the Demon put the zombies down mid-route, breathed deeply, and moved again.\u201cHumans all die someday.\u201dHe repeated those words.\u201cAs if we didn\u2019t know that already. How can we be bitter about the fact that we\u2019ll die?\u201dLast night the zombies seemed to have wandered about here and there. The scattered zombies were gathered again by the Demon and the Murim Lord.\u201c\u2014But I didn\u2019t want a death like this.\u201dIt took a long time.The two of them had poor physical strength, and there were too many bodies.\u201cAssassination is good. Poisoning is also good. It is also good to be attacked by an army, or be killed by one of the Shaolin monks. It is good to die, betrayed by a trusted subordinate, and it is perfectly good to die while doing something for the younger generation.\u201dMiddle of the sky.By the time the Demon and the Murim Lord put the zombies back in their place, the sun rose to the middle of the sky. Before we knew it, the footprints of the two people were captured in the snowy field.\u201cBut, a death like this is unacceptable.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon took a quick breath and looked at me.\u201cYou asked me how I endured it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWe just want to die the way we want.\u201dHundreds of corpses, the sect\u2019s elders, were lined up.Hundreds of corpses, the members of the Demonic Cult, were lined up as well.Thus, the zombies seemed like an army divided into two troops, as if they were about to run into battle.I suddenly thought this.\u300cEven though their cause of death is the same, they all died on different dates.\u300dWhen we fell into the world of Apocalypse and saw zombies for the first time.The conversation that our party had while observing the forest of corpses.\u300cIt looks like someone intentionally moved the bodies\u2026\u300d\u300cIs it some kind of tomb?\u300d\u300cIt\u2019s a grave. From a distance, they look like terracotta warriors.\u300dAt night, the zombies move freely.Nevertheless, as many as a thousand zombies were gathered in one place in the snow.If you thought about it, wasn\u2019t this in itself strange?\u201cHoo \u2026\u201d\u201cAhem.\u201dThat was right.Someone intentionally put the zombies in one place.\u201cNot a lot of them went far today.\u201dFive hundred people from the Demonic Cult.\u201cLast night, the moonlight was clear. Though not as much as sunlight, the moonlight can also stop the Jiangshi\u2026\u201dFive hundred people of the sect.The Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord each moved their own men. It was hard work that took a full day. However, the two moved silently.As if it was a normal routine.\u300cWe are carrying out the great war like this.\u300d\u300cThree years have already passed since then.\u300dIt snowed.\u201cThis Righteous Sect will never fall to the Jiangshi.\u201dPeople died.\u201cThe people of our cult will not be destroyed, eaten by mere corpses.\u201dEven if the Nine Great Schools and Five Noble Clans disappeared.\u201cSurely, if our sect is to be destroyed, it must be because of the wicked fingertips of Demonic Cult.\u201dEven if the martial arts texts became so dusty that it became impossible to read the words.\u201cIf this cult disappears from the world, it is only by the blade of that sect.\u201dThis world had not yet perished.Because these two people have to die in order for the world to end.Let\u2019s say that there are a billion people in the world, and 999,999,999 people die of infectious diseases. There\u2019s only one person left. And if the last person in the world takes his own life, then the destruction of the world won\u2019t be caused by an illness\u2014it\u2019ll be suicide.At least, that\u2019s what the Righteous Sect\u2019s leader and the Demonic Cult\u2019s god believed.\u201cMurim Lord. Namgung Family, Taesang Family Head. Namgung Un.\u201dThe old man took his stance.\u201cI am Bu Wol-sun, the Ax Saint.\u201d\u201cDemon lord. So Baek-hyang.\u201dThe woman took her stance.\u201cI am the Heavenly Demon.\u201dThe sun crossed the middle of the sky.Years had passed since there were only two people left in the world.During those years, their only job was to determine the cause of this world\u2019s apocalypse.\u201cI request our 990th battle.\u201dWould the Murim Lord destroy the Demonic Cult?\u201cTo surrender, or to the death?\u201dOr would the Heavenly Demon destroy the Righteous Sect?\u201cTo the death.\u201d\u201cI accept.\u201dThe two fighters began their battle.In the middle of the snowy field where five hundred Righteous Sect members and five hundred Demonic Cult\u2019s members stood, the Murim Lord and the Heavenly Demon rushed at each other.I still couldn\u2019t recognize the martial arts of the two. When I looked at them, they were barely stepping forward. It was hard. They could barely reach their arms out.Their foot movements were so slow that they wouldn\u2019t even be able to catch a child.Their hand movements were weak, and they would not be able to crush even a single tangerine.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dA decaying genre.A decaying world.They were slowly dying in this apocalypse, well into its 990th day.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dI opened my mouth.I watched their dances from afar and muttered unknowingly.\u201cIt can\u2019t go on like this.\u201dMy heart was beating.\u201cIt\u2019s absurd.\u201d-\u2026\u2026.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this.\u201dA fierce fight broke out in the snow. The Murim Lord and the Demon, who once demonstrated splendid martial arts while discussing the first people in the world, could now only fight on the level of a child. They rolled about in the snow. They tripped from taking a wrong step. They grabbed a beard and pulled their hair.\u201cIn the eyes of the Sword Emperor, that might look like a really great fight. Yes. I\u2019m just a beginner who just started swordsmanship. However, no matter how great the principle is, no matter how great the hidden reason is\u2026\u201dThe day had passed, and it became evening.The Murim Lord and the Heavenly Demon never stopped fighting.\u201cThis is an insult.\u201dThe sun went down.Even today, the match was not decided.\u201cIt\u2019s an insult to the two.\u201dA world in decline.In a world where there was no way to cure an epidemic, the two martial artists were strong enough to survive. However, they were too weak to take each other\u2019s lives.\u201cThis can\u2019t go on.\u201dThe world was cruel because you can\u2019t be born the way you want. So what was a world where you can\u2019t die the way you want?You couldn\u2019t even end it properly.Their lives had just been cut off in the middle.-What will you do?Bae Hu-ryeong said quietly.-Will you kill the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord in their stead? That\u2019s right. That can be a merciful gift, too. That\u2019s what I would do. But don\u2019t forget that you and I are nothing more than \u2018strangers.\u2019\u201cI know.\u201dThe two martial artists did not want to commit suicide.If they had to die, then they wanted their deaths to be at the hands of the other person.The Demonic cult would not perish due to a mysterious illness but be defeated by the Righteous Sect.The Righteous Sect would not succumb to an infectious disease, but be broken by the Demonic Cult.It was that kind of ending.The right ending.An acceptable death.If I intrude and kill the two, it will neither be the [end] nor the [conclusion]. It wouldn\u2019t be a merciful gift, either.That sort of thing would only be [graffiti] that a child adds to the back of a storybook.It shouldn\u2019t be that way.\u201cI am,\u201d I said to Bae Hu-ryeong. \u201cI am going to finish this world in my own way.\u201d-What is that way?I did not answer Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s question.The sun set.\u201cI, it\u2019s already night time. Old man.\u201d\u201cMaybe since it\u2019s winter\u2026 Huh. The day is short\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll defeat you tomorrow for sure.\u201d\u201cWho do you think\u2026\u201dThe evening deepened.The 990th day of the war naturally ended in a truce.The Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord shook hands, and they went back to the cave in a more exhausted way than yesterday.\u201cWhere have you been?\u201dThe party greeted us.The Venomous Snake stood guard at the entrance to the cave, and the Alchemist and the Medicine King were busy researching the zombie. It was the zombie of the faction leader who surprised us yesterday.\u201cWe were looking at the patient. We were too busy yesterday\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you make any progress?\u201dThe Medicine King and the Alchemist looked at each other. The Medicine King tsked first.\u201cNot yet.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 S, since this is the first virus of its kind.\u201dAs expected.The Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord walked to the other side of the cave, saying they would rest first. I noticed that the backs of the two fighters were moving away and turned to the Alchemist.\u201cBoss.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cPlease be honest. How long do you think it would take to make a cure?\u201d\u201cAh. Um, uh.\u201dThe Alchemist hesitated.\u201cTo be honest with you\u2026 At least 120 days.\u201d\u201cTwice that. It may take three times more. The schedule for this sort of thing should be more generous, usually. But even if you have a generous schedule, it isn\u2019t enough,\u201d the Medicine King added bluntly. The Alchemist drooped down her head.\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes, that is also right. It\u2019s really the worst case\u2026 .\u201dMm.\u201c100 days on the shorter end. And on the longer end, about 300 days?\u201d\u201cUh. that\u2026\u201dThe Alchemist dropped his head even lower.\u201cA, actually, we may not be able to make it at all. The facilities and the environment are also poor. At this point, I can\u2019t guarantee you anything. Death King-nim. I\u2019m sorry\u2026 You trusted me and brought me to such a stage\u2026 It is impossible to develop a cure within the time limit.\u201dThe time limit.The librarian said this when he sent us to this apocalypse:\u300cIf you open your eyes, it will be the world 10 days before the unfortunate serial interruption of the Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon.\u300d\u300cPlease, I look forward to the wonderful ending that you\u2019ll show me.\u300dIn other words, no matter what happened,The world would really end in the next 10 days.The Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord, who have survived so far, will also die.As the Alchemist said, ten days was the time limit.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201dI shook my head.\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d\u201cW, what?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry. Boss.\u201dA dagger at my waist.I touched its handle slowly.\u201cI will somehow solve the problem of time. Don\u2019t give up, and keep researching.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe words you heard when we first fell into this world yesterday. Do you remember them?\u201dThis was no ordinary book.This was an entire world.We were here to save the world.\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dThe Alchemist nodded carefully.The two of us shared a look.\u201c\u2026I, I remember. Of course I remember, Death King-nim\u2026\u201dI also nodded.\u201cMy words are the same as yesterday. The time limit is right in front of us. If we don\u2019t break this stage, we can never escape from the apocalypse. Please set aside any thoughts that will get in the way. I will do my best in my position, so please show me your best, too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll clear all my doubts\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. I promise you. All other issues will be handled on their own,\u201d I said to the person who will be called the Alchemy Lord in the future.\u201cPlease trust me and keep working.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67. <Heavenly Demon. (2)>==================Translator: thursdays Editor: SashaThe Alchemist gently closed her eyes.After a while, her lips opened.\u201c\u2026If it weren\u2019t for you, Death King, I would still be in the back alleys of the slum. All my equipment was stolen\u2026 Honestly, I can\u2019t imagine what would have happened.\u201dThe Alchemist slowly opened her eyes.Beyond her glasses, her eyes were much clearer than before.\u201cYes. I want to repay you for what you did for me. I\u2019ll devote myself solely to making the medicine without thinking\u2026 But I can\u2019t really see my surroundings when I\u2019m distracted by my work. I am not polite, either. I\u2019ll probably be very cocky. Still\u2026\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dI nodded.\u201cPlease show off your skills to your heart\u2019s content.\u201dNow was not the time to worry about fine manners.I just need good returns on my investment in the future.\u201c\u2026\u2026I understand.\u201dThe Alchemist fixed her glasses.She turned her head and looked at the Medicine King.\u201cSir.\u201d\u201cHmm? What.\u201d\u201cFrom now on, please support me with your full strength.\u201dThe Medicine King frowned. The old man\u2019s wrinkles were as thick as his stubbornness.\u201cSupport? Suppooort? Have you seen such a horrible thing? Yes, this. Even cold water has order to it! Top and bottom! How dare this greenhorn ask the Medicine King to support her\u2026\u201d\u201cSkill card open.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dCards sprang out from the Alchemist\u2019s hand.One golden card. Three silver cards.The Alchemist acquired four skills that were difficult to obtain for an ordinary hunter. Furthermore, she only had advanced skills that were B grade or higher.The Medicine King\u2019s eyes widened into circles.\u201cW, what is this? Are you trying to show off your skills to me? Hey. Young\u2019uns think that everything can be done with just skills. You don\u2019t know what true ability is\u2026\u201dThe Alchemist replied,\u201cYou can look at it.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou can look at what my skills are.\u201dThe Medicine King was embarrassed and couldn\u2019t respond right away.It was natural. Skills were secret weapons for Hunters. Any savvy Hunter knew that they should never let others learn their skills. Revealing skills was like confessing not only one\u2019s own strengths but also one\u2019s weaknesses.In a word, it was pure stupidity. A dumb and foolish act.\u201cOr should I just show it to you myself?\u201dHowever, the Alchemist did not hesitate.\u201cThis skill is called [Moving Hospital].\u201dShe turned the card over and showed it to the Medicine King.\u201cEverything from a blood test to an EEG test is possible in real time. I can also take out and use the drugs I store in advance. However, there is a 2% chance of a misdiagnosis. This is [Life Diagnosis]. It shows me a patient\u2019s condition in terms of genes. I can combine the two skills to minimize the probability of a misdiagnosis\u2026\u201d\u201cW, wait a moment! Wait just a minute!\u201dThe Medicine King belatedly caught up his thoughts.\u201cYou! Why are you showing me your skills!? What if I expose this to the Alchemy Castle or to my business partners!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I swore that I wouldn\u2019t care about such petty thoughts,\u201d the Alchemist said. \u201cIf you want to make it public, do it. But please support me this time until we make a treatment.\u201d\u201cNo, but why are you asking me\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause I need you to speed up development time, even if it\u2019s just by a day.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou hate looking at me, right?\u201dThe Alchemist looked at the Medicine King. It was a calm, cold look. The Alchemist used to be flustered often, but now her face was completely expressionless.\u201cAre you angry because this \u2018young\u2019un\u2019 doesn\u2019t know about the topic? It must be annoying that someone like me has talent, right? You\u2019re annoyed like crazy because you know I\u2019m going to live longer than you and be admired by people for longer than you, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe human voice is often compared to that of a bird. But I bet the Alchemist\u2019s voice could not be imitated by any beast. To put it frankly, it was like this. Her voice reminded me of a bug.It was like the sizzle of a fire ant colony.\u201cIf you can help me with your utmost power this time.\u201dThe Alchemist fixed her glasses.\u201cThe medicine recipes I have made so far. I\u2019ll give you everything. I won\u2019t go anywhere or tell them they\u2019re my recipes. You can have them. Use them. Tell people that it\u2019s a recipe you invented\u2014\u201dAt that moment, the Alchemist\u2019s glasses slipped and fell to the floor.The old man had slapped her on the cheek.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Alchemist picked up her glasses. Then, she silently wiped the glasses with her sleeves. A red handprint remained on her left cheek. The Alchemist put on her glasses again, then silently looked at the old man.The old man trembled.\u201cYou wicked thing\u2026\u201d\u201cI will analyze the zombie virus.\u201d\u201cYou will learn that there is a sky above the sky.\u201d\u201cSir, please do the things I tell you to do.\u201d\u201cThe day will come when your pride will be crushed and you will exude a rotten odor.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll write down what I need and give it to you.\u201d\u201cSomeday you too\u2014\u201d\u201cAt that time, sir\u2014\u201dThe old man and the woman spoke at the same time.\u201cYou will meet someone better than you.\u201d\u201cFind it and give it to me.\u201dAnd the two Hunters fell silent.The Alchemist on the left and the Medicine King on the right sat on either side of the corpse of the faction leader. When the Alchemist muttered something, the Medicine King wrote it down. It was a neutral, muted atmosphere. The two, who became more of a still life art than a portrait, only conversed about business.\u201cDeath King-nim. I\u2019m sorry, but please leave,\u201d the Alchemist mumbled, cutting into the corpse\u2019s head with a surgical knife.\u201cThe sound of your breath is disturbing me. A lot. It\u2019s very, very disturbing.\u201d\u201cGo and catch six more zombies while you\u2019re out.\u201dThe Medicine King peered into the corpse\u2019s dark mouth. The Medicine King pinched the zombie\u2019s tongue, stained purple and black, with his tongs.\u201cI need more samples. A kid. A young adult. An old person. Each with a different gender. And if there are any medicinal herbs that I say I need, get them.I nodded.\u201cLeave it to me.\u201dFrom that day.We went into a state of war.Even eating was a waste of time. Washing one\u2019s body was a luxury. Even though there was an open-air bath right next to us, the Alchemist and the Medicine King did not take a bath. Whether it was night or day, the two Hunters only studied the zombies while cracking at the edge of the wall.\u201cUh-huh\u2026 The atmosphere has changed drastically.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon looked at our party as if she were curious.\u201cAre you trying to gain enlightenment? Young people sure are eager.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you cook the clam soup or risotto?\u201dThe Murim Lord coaxed the Medicine King.\u201cIt was so skillful that even the imperial family\u2019s chef would cry. If the world was fine, I would have appointed you as the chef of the Daenam palace.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m busy. Buzz off,\u201d the Medicine King replied without raising his head. He only put one hand in his subspace pocket and threw a water bottle.\u201cIf you\u2019re hungry, fill yourself up with water.\u201d\u201cKnngg.\u201dWas it that regrettable that he couldn\u2019t taste the Medicine King\u2019s dishes? The Murim Lord smacked his lips. Even so, he caught the Bling H20 thrown by the Medicine King and drank it all.\u201cOld man. Don\u2019t bother busy people. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cAll right, all right. Oh, I\u2019m having a hard time because my body doesn\u2019t listen to me these days.\u201dThe Murim Lord grumbled as if he was tired.\u201cToday again, how much have the Jiangshi scattered\u2026\u201d\u201cWould those who stray far away go to heaven? Stop talking and come out.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201dThe Murim Lord grumbled and left the cave with the Heavenly Demon.Like yesterday, they were trying to collect and line up zombies. To spend the 991th day of the great war.A day had passed.The day when this world would reach its end became one day closer.Another day had passed.Another day.Again, another day passed by.Countdown.Days just waiting for destruction.A world in a music box that just hadn\u2019t stopped yet.\u201cHmm.\u201dOne week.Just a week had passed since we fell into the Apocalypse.That day, the Heavenly Demon looked up at the ceiling of the cave.\u201c\u2026\u2026We can\u2019t go outside today.\u201dOutside, a blizzard was raging. The wind blew and blew again, so there was no distinction between the top and the bottom, and the sky and the earth.The world was a dark snowfield.This was the first time I learned that something white could become this dark.\u201cWell. Some days are just like this.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon just shrugged her shoulders, as if saying that it was no problem.\u201cRather, it was a fluke that the days were sunny for the past few days. In severe cases, it could be a complete whiteout for over 30 days. There was no sunlight, so we couldn\u2019t even take a step.\u201d\u201cThen, the Jiangshi will continue to move,\u201d I said.\u201cWill that be all right? If the Jiangshi go too far, you won\u2019t be able to recover them.\u201d\u201cIn that case, it can\u2019t be helped. We lose them.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon sighed.\u201cJust three years ago, our school\u2019s power reached 1,000. That\u2019s about the same amount of people that the old man brought into his sect. But as the years passed, there were Jiangshi that went so far that we couldn\u2019t find them at all.\u201dOf course.The missing corpses. No. Not missing, but lost bodies. Every time a blizzard struck in the sky, the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord would have lost some of their Jiangshi.\u201cThat must be the scariest thing.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cTo wake up and go to the snowfield just to discover that some Jiangshi had disappeared somewhere.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon looked at me quietly.\u201cDo you think that I would feel scared?\u201dThe woman\u2019s eyes were dark.Her hair as well. Even the clothes that she wore.Her appearance, which was only black, seemed to desperately resist this world that had become a pure white snowfield.\u201cYes. I think so.\u201d\u201cSurely the world has turned over a lot. Back then, the head of a man who talked like that would not be safe. Child of the outside world. You should consider yourself fortunate that the world is ruined.\u201d\u201cHeavenly Demon-nim and the Murim Lord are masters. You are so well-versed in the martial arts that it would be shameful to compare you with me.\u201dI quietly looked away.The Murim Lord was asleep by the hot spring.\u201cBut no matter how strong you are, your life energy is not infinite.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cWhen will your chi run out?\u201dStop.\u201cYou are blocking your spinal cord with your life energy. Your heart rate, breathing, and limb movements are all controlled with your life energy as well.\u201dIt was like using a chi sword all day, every day.I shook my head.\u201cNo matter how much life energy you have, you cannot continue this outrageous thing forever.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll ask again. When will your chi run out, Heavenly Demon-nim?\u201dThat woman had said a while ago.\u300cHumans all die someday.\u300dSomething resonated in those words. It was the sound of realization.There is only one way humans can realize something.They had to experience it themselves.\u201c\u2026\u2026Really.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon groaned.\u201cReally, this child is quick to notice.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have many days left, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll revise my words a little. This child is dirtily quick to notice.\u201dThis world.How does [The Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon] get destroyed?If you think about it, it was a surprisingly simple matter.\u201cIf your life energy falls, it becomes impossible for you two to move your bodies.\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon looked up at the sky.From the hole in the ceiling of the cave, a blizzard poured out of the sky as if it was raging.\u201cFirst, the tip of the toe and the fingertips will be destroyed. Then, the calves and wrists. Knees. Shoulders. Waist. One after the other, the life energy will not be able to sustain them, and the body that did not yield to the illness will finally rot.\u201dLiterally, it was necrosis.It was like a building that stopped operating one after another when fuel ran out.At some point, the two would become immobile.\u201cHeart. Lungs.\u201dThe woman touched the chest area of her shabby uniform.\u201cThe upper body.\u201dThen, she tapped her head.\u201cAll parts will rot, leaving only three parts. No. It\u2019s all right if the other parts rot.\u201d\u201c\u2026You already know.\u201d\u201cThe Shaolin monk endured a year altogether.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon smiled bitterly.\u201cHe went into hiding, ashamed that others might see him and think him unworthy as a monk. At the last minute, um. Except for his face, it wasn\u2019t much different from the Jiangshi. The whole body was rotting black\u2026 He couldn\u2019t even recite the Amitabha.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou asked if I was afraid. That\u2019s right. I\u2019m afraid.\u201dThe human voice is often compared to that of a bird.But I bet the Heavenly Demon\u2019s voice could not be imitated by any beast.\u201cI am afraid.\u201dA quiet murmur like the sound of a falling flower petal.\u201cI am afraid that my chi is exhausted. I am afraid that even my persistence will run out. I am afraid of the blizzard. I am afraid that the sunlight will not come out, and when the day is bright, I am afraid that my subordinates, those that used to be my subordinates, will disappear. Each time I breathe, I worry about how many more breaths I can breathe. Every time my heart beats, I\u2019m worried if I\u2019ll be able to feel the beating of my heart just a few more times in the future.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon sighed.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that I cannot kill the old man. I\u2019m afraid that the old man will not be able to kill me. I am afraid that the day will come when the old man and I will not be able to lie on the bed together. Lying on the bed, I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m just waiting for my life energy to run out.\u201dA meaningless death.Even if they struggled to the end, it was meaningless. They would die. In the dead, disappearing world, only snow falls and falls, leaving only achromatic landscape paintings.\u201cAh.\u201dThis is the end that [The Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon] will meet.It was the ending of this world.\u201cThis is why the world is so scared.\u201dAnother day passed.It was the eighth day after falling in the Apocalypse.There were two days left until the world would be destroyed.\u201cMadu,\u201d the Murim Lord muttered, lying on the bed. \u201cI can\u2019t move my body anymore.\u201dThe Murim Lord was smiling.And he was crying.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dA low noise.That was the sound of a world\u2019s downfall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68. <Heavenly Demon. (3)>==================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha3.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the Alchemist said. \u201cI can\u2019t cure him in his current state.\u201dShe was examining the Murim Lord. Throughout the examination, the Alchemist had a dim expression. She was like a doctor who already knew that the patient had no hope, but had to do an examination just to confirm it to the patient.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon silently looked down at the Murim Lord.They hadn\u2019t been expecting treatment anyway.Then, with an expressionless face, the Heavenly Demon opened her lips.\u201cStand up.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not trying to hear your apology. Stand up. Murim Lord, Ax Saint.\u201dThe cave was dark.The Heavenly Demon\u2019s breaths became quieter.There seemed to be a poisonous fragrance flowing from her mouth.\u201cDid you not make an agreement with the great me? Didn\u2019t you boast that you\u2019d challenge the Demonic Cult with your Righteous Sect? Didn\u2019t you try to fight by bringing together the Nine Great Schools and the Five Noble Clans? You can\u2019t just die in bed. You aren\u2019t allowed.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cStand up.\u201dThe smell of poison became a little thicker.\u201cStand up and grab your weapon. You don\u2019t even need to hold your tasteless ax. Use a wooden sword. Anything is fine. Use a spear, a whip, or even a wooden stick. Hold it. Grasp it and fight against the great me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cI told you to stand up.\u201d\u201cDemon lord.\u201dThe Murim Lord breathed.He had aged so much in just one night.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m weaker than you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI tried to hold on for one more day, but now, it is difficult. You must have felt it too. That I was already running out of my innate energy. My chi has run out. I\u2019m also tired. If it\u2019s you, you might still last another year\u2026 But this is it for me.\u201dThere was silence.\u201cI was weaker than you,\u201d the old man muttered while lying down.\u201cKill me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon\u2019s face distorted.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be like the Shaolin head monk. Kill me before my body rots and decomposes. When you become a Jiangshi, even if you see, you don\u2019t see, and even if you live, you aren\u2019t alive. So\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, you want me to kill your bedridden self?\u201dThe poison gas had reached its peak.\u201cIs that what you\u2019re talking about now?\u201dThe Heavenly Demon\u2019s body was small. From that small body, a black fire blazed. The chi took shape and burned fiercely.Killing intent.Her energy smelled of soot as it flared. It was an odor that told of the life she had lived and endured. The scent of the Heavenly Demon was potent, like crushed weeds.\u201cIs this the ending of the war you promised? This?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u201cWe ought to have taken each other down before. For what glory have we endured this so far? We should have ordered all the followers of the sect and the cult to die together. For what bright future did we act so stubbornly?\u201dThe Murim Lord could not answer. The traces of the tears that the old man shed hardened on his cheek.\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cNamgung Un. Since the days of Confucius, you have received the praise and jealousy of many strong men for being born with the Heavenly Body Constitution, and by the age of 20, you reached the zenith of your form. Even before you turned 30, you became the leader of the Namgung clan. When the demonic world gained power, you were chosen as the lord to fight for justice. The essence of the Righteous Sect lies in you, and the grudges of the righteous path stand on your shoulders. But. You passively bare your neck for my evil self?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cFine. I will kill you.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon stood up.\u201cBut you won\u2019t be able to die a good death.\u201dShe headed somewhere. Even after the woman left, the burnt smell of the soot remained. It was enough to choke someone. The Alchemist and the Medicine King, who had no skill in Aura, had particularly distressed expressions.After a while, the Heavenly Demon returned.There was an ax in her hand.\u201cOld man of Namgung. This is the oak halberd which you pampered so much. You haven\u2019t already forgotten it, have you?\u201d\u201cSo Baek-hyang\u2026\u201d\u201cSpeak.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon raised the ax.\u201cWar has forgotten chivalry, and chivalry has forgotten war.\u201d[1]\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf you say this, I will kill you as you wish.\u201dWar, mu (\u6b66), forgot about chivalry.Chivalry, hyup (\u4fe0), forgot about war.It meant that it was the end of the Righteous Sect.The master of the Demonic Cult said so. If the Murim Lord himself admitted to the ruin of the sect, if he could accept it, he would be able to give up his life. Then, with the love borne of battles and mutual respect, she would cut his throat.\u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t you say it?!\u201dThe old man\u2019s lips moved slightly. His mouth opened and he parted his teeth. But he couldn\u2019t go beyond that. His next words did not come out. The old man seemed to have lost his tongue. He opened and closed his mouth many times, but each time, he couldn\u2019t form the words.\u201cI can\u2019t do it,\u201d the old man coughed out. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t say\u2026\u201dTears shed again over the trail marks of the tears that fell before. On the wrinkles, his tear marks were like layers.The layers of hardened tears were difficult to distinguish from the crumpled skin of the old man. So the old man\u2019s flesh seemed to consist of his tears, and the tears seemed to flow from the flesh and not from his eyes.\u201cI can\u2019t say\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry, Baek-hyang\u2026\u201dThe Heavenly Demon swung the ax.The ax blade did not cut the neck of the Murim Lord.It just swung and pierced the ground.The ax was stamped right next to the face of the Murim Lord. The hard rock of the cave floor cracked easily like tofu. It was difficult for me to guess how much energy the Heavenly Demon, who found it hard to even lift a whip, had exhausted to split the stone.\u201cDid you say that when you become a Jiangshi, you aren\u2019t alive even if you live?\u201d the Heavenly Demon muttered.\u201cIt\u2019s all irrelevant, anyway. Even if you die now, you do not truly die. What is the difference between a life that is not life and a death that is not death? My great self cannot tell the difference. There\u2019s no point. It\u2019s meaningless\u2026\u201dShe turned around.\u201cThe whole world has become empty.\u201dThe next day.Namgung Un, the Murim Lord, died at dawn.His cause of death was the virus.4.It was the tenth day since we fell into the Apocalypse.The day had come for this world to perish.\u201c\u2026I got a valuable sample,\u201d the Alchemist said.\u201cThere is a limit to analyzing viruses from people who have been turned for two or three years already. Thanks to this sample, we could observe the infection\u2019s progress in real time. It was a big step forward.\u201dIn front of the Alchemist laid the Murim Lord.It was a body that didn\u2019t even move.The old man\u2019s body was tied up with chains.\u201cYou don\u2019t become a zombie immediately after you die\u2026 There seems to be a slight delay until the awakening. I guess it takes some time for the infectious agents to spread over to the brain.\u201d\u201cI have compiled the research results.\u201dThe Medicine King handed over the file.He tsked.\u201cThis kid may have skill in making medicine, but she has no skill in explaining the process to others. No skill at all. Really. Hmph, this is why prideful people are so\u2026\u201d\u201cI researched it with all that I had,\u201d the Alchemist said, not caring about the attack on her character. \u201cBut as expected, it was impossible to develop a cure.\u201d\u201cWas there not enough time?\u201d\u201cYes. I needed at least 90 more days. If possible, about 120 days\u2026\u201dClank!-Guuuhhh.As the chains crashed, they made an abrasive noise. We turned our heads at the same time. The corpse of the Murim lord was trembling.-Guuhhh\u2026 Ugh, ooh\u2026..!For a while, we silently looked at the Murim Lord\u2014no, we looked at what had once been the Murim Lord.It kept struggling against the chains with its mouth open.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt was then that the Heavenly Demon walked over.Tunk. Tunk.The woman approached with a quiet, tottering walk. The woman in black. The Heavenly Demon, who had black hair, black robes, and black eyes, was holding a black sword. Her sword was darker than her shadow.\u201c\u2014Pathetic.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon looked down at the corpse of the Murim Lord.\u201cDecades spent in vain, completely futile.\u201dWe instinctively stepped away from the Heavenly Demon.Her poisonous power was so intense that it was incomparable to yesterday.Her chi rose and covered her entire body.\u201cIn the end, this is what all humans are like underneath. There\u2019s no difference between one and a beast. Eat, eat, eat until the body can\u2019t move, only to disappear before long. War has forgotten chivalry, and chivalry has forgotten war.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon stretched out her left hand.\u201cEat.\u201dThe zombie opened its mouth and bit the hand.Slosh!Blood splattered.Her flesh was torn and her bones were crushed. The Heavenly Demon nonchalantly glanced down at the figure of the Murim Lord biting her left hand like a dog.\u201cH, hey.\u201dThe Venomous Snake took a step closer.\u201cLook here. W, what are you doing now? What if you end up becoming a Jiangshi\u2026?!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go any closer.\u201dI grabbed the Venomous Snake\u2019s shoulder and stopped him.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already over.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s over? What\u2026\u201dThe sound of flesh bursting echoed through the cave.Puk!All the members of the party shivered at the excessively vicious sound.Slowly looking over, we could see that the Heavenly Demon\u2019s left hand was in tatters.And there was also the Murim Lord, who had lost his senses.The Heavenly Demon blasted her chi inside the mouth of the Murim Lord and smashed his head.\u201cHuff.\u201dIn the midst of it all, we were all speechless.\u201cHuff, haha\u2026 Ahaha.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon opened her mouth and laughed.\u201cAhahaha! Hah! Ha, ahahahaha!\u201dShe was truly howling with laughter.The snowstorm continued to rage from the ceiling of the cave. However, the sound of the Heavenly Demon\u2019s laughter drowned out the noise of the blizzard until it was a trifling thing. Laughter filled the cave, pealed in the sky, and swallowed the world.-Zombie. Be careful.Bae Hu-ryeong spoke in a low tone.-She\u2019s in disharmony.At that moment.The Heavenly Demon turned her head and looked at us gently. Softly, alluringly, the woman smiled. A strange voice flowed from her open lips.\u201cHoho.\u201dThe hair on the nape of my neck stood on edge.\u201cAre you from the righteous path, coming to assassinate my great self?\u201dAlready, her eyes were not focused on us.\u201cHow delightful. Come on. Let us match our swords.\u201d\u201cEveryone run away!\u201dAt the same moment as my shout, the Heavenly Demon swung her sword.Chwaaaak!A fountain of blood spewed out. It was the blood of the Medicine King. Cut at his neck, the Medicine King couldn\u2019t even scream as he collapsed, knees twisting.It was an instant deathSeeing his colleague die in front of his nose, the Venomous Snake belatedly pulled his sword.\u201cThis, fuck\u2026!?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t read the pattern of the sword with his eyes. More than that, he couldn\u2019t even see its motion. He only knew that at the moment the Heavenly Demon swung her sword, the Medicine King\u2019s throat was sliced through. There wasn\u2019t even a moment\u2019s gap.-She\u2019s gone mad.Bae Hu-ryeong moaned.-Not even exorcism will work on her now. It\u2019s because she exhausted all her energy and will, but\u2026 Now, even if it\u2019s temporary, she has entered into a state of life or death. Even if I was to fight her in my prime, I would lose 4 out of 10 times.That was the Heavenly Demon.This was her ability before she was bitten by the Jiangshi and weakened.She was the first person who reigned over this world.\u201cThis is absurd.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon hummed to herself.\u201cHead monk of the Shaolin sect. Did you think you could kill the great me with that meager strength? You horse-faced Taoist. How arrogant for you to think that you could withstand this cult\u2019s power.\u201dStep after step, the Heavenly Demon approached us.\u201cMt. Song is flooded with the grief overflowing from the world.[2] The heaven and earth\u2019s grudge burns the mountain. The Demonic Cult is the peak of the Murim world, and I am the peak of the Demonic Cult. Are you qualified to deal with the god among gods?\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201dThe Venomous Snake raised his sword and rushed in.\u201cDeath King! Take the Alchemist and run away!\u201dEven without him saying it, I was already doing so.I grabbed the Alchemist and ran. It would be impossible to escape, but nonetheless, we fled. We did this to struggle until the very end. In order not to take this ending and this death for granted.\u201cYou shall not get away, lackeys of the righteous path!\u201dThe Heavenly Demon\u2019s laughter chased us from behind.\u201cNamgung Un!\u201dOnce, twice, three times.There were the sounds of two swords clashing.\u201cWhere is Namgung Un?!\u201dThen, the sounds of the swords stopped.Having endured three rounds against her, the Venomous Snake was at the edge of his strength.\u201cCall the Namgung family and the Taesang family! Summon the Murim Lord here! No matter how dense the forest is nor how vast the sky, there is only one person who will receive the sword of my great self under this heavenly world! Four Demon Lords! Bring Namgung Un in front of me!\u201dThe sound of laughter was tenacious as it came nearer to us.Even if we ran away one step, the sound approached us with ten. We couldn\u2019t match it. Eventually, when the sound of laughter caught up right behind my back, the Alchemist, held in my arms, opened her mouth.\u201cDeath King-nim.\u201dThe Alchemist looked up at me.\u201cI still believe in you.\u201dThen.Something cut the two of us.Pierced us.\u201c\u2014.\u201dThe sky tilted. The ground tilted. I lost my feet, the entire part of my body below my torso, and my upper body fell into the snow.That\u2019s right.The snowfield was white.We had escaped the cave.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dA little farther away, the Alchemist had also fallen. The field was red only in the spot where she fell. It was like shaved ice sprinkled with strawberry syrup, I thought in my darkening mind.\u201cAhaha. Ha, hahaha!\u201dThe snow drifted down.\u201cAhahahaha! Ha, ahahaha\u2026\u201dThere was no distinction between heaven and earth as it snowed. Dark white. I could only see a cool, pale shade.Someone was moving away, taking steps in the snow.The steps seemed to split apart the sky and the earth. However, the blizzard continued to rage, and even the last footprints were buried.Soundlessly.Without a trace.Not even leaving behind a smell.Even the world that charred its people. Even the people that were charred by the world. Thus, the black soot was buried and entombed so that only white snowfields remained. Let only the colorless, odorless, and silent blizzard fall forever.The world has perished.[You have died.]But, that was all.For me, the end was not the end.[You are regressing to 24 hours ago.]Now.It was time to save their world.~~~[1] War has forgotten chivalry, and chivalry has forgotten war.

    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69. <The World of Dead Constellations. (1)>=======================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha1.One winter day.So Baek-hyang followed her mother across a snowy field.It was cloudy. Snow poured out of the cloudy sky. In the pouring snowstorm, people were but shadows.Her mother\u2019s back, too, was a shadow-like haze.So Baek-hyang raised her voice.-Mother!So Baek-hyang suddenly became afraid. The sound of snow was too loud. Her voice was covered by the sound of the falling snow, so she could not cry very loudly.-Mother!Her mother\u2019s shadow was still far away.So Baek-hyang became impatient.She had to walk faster to chase after her mother. However, the further she walked, the more breathless she became. The more she walked, the smaller her voice. What should she do?-Uh\u2026Should she stop yelling and walk faster to catch up with her mother? Or should she stop walking and scream as loud as she can?The young Heavenly Demon did not know.While she was debating what to do, the shadow withdrew a little further away.-Mother!Eventually, So Baek-hyang stopped.-Mother!As she stopped, her voice became a little stronger. Until now, her energy had been focused on walking not on directing her voice. So Baek-hyang thought that finally her mother would turn her head and look at her, and the shadow would become clear.But what happened?The shadow got a little further away.While So Baek-hyang screamed, it had gained more distance.Before long, the shadow of her mother was buried in the blizzard and disappeared into the snowfield.-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.Did her mother abandon her?Had she intended to part ways with her while using the snowstorm as a pretext?Or did her mother really lose her by accident?So Baek-hyang did not know.She couldn\u2019t know.2.[You have died.]I let my eyes stay closed for a moment, then opened them.It was an endlessly dark space.[Your death has satisfied the skill condition.][So Baek-hyang\u2019s skills are being randomly copied.]My hell.[The skill cards are being created.]The cards floated before my eyes.But my immediate concern wasn\u2019t getting a skill card.I sighed and said to Bae Hu-ryeong,\u2018Sword Emperor. Did you memorize the file?\u2019-Yeah, to some extent.Bae Hu-ryeong scratched the back of his head.It was the folder in which the Alchemist and the Medicine King desperately wrote down their research results. That was the important thing. The Heavenly Demon was drowning in disharmony and causing turmoil, so I couldn\u2019t carefully memorize the contents of the file.-If we combine what you memorized and what I memorized, the pieces will somehow fit together. But we have to go back quickly before I forget\u2026\u2018Okay. Then, let\u2019s quickly choose a skill first.\u2019-Mhm.Bae Hu-ryeong moved in the air. He then looked at the back of the cards and read them out loud. The Heavenly Demon had quite a lot of skills, but there was one that caught our attention.+[Infernal Heavens Demonic Art (\u9b54\u5929\u795e\u529f)]Rank: A+Effect: The Demonic Cult. They hate the logic of the heavens. They curse it. And they did not stop at hating and cursing the heavens, but formed cults, eventually uniting under one doctrine. The Infernal Heavens Demonic Art is a martial art with the essence of that doctrine.Those who awaken the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art can tear up the heavens and crush the tall mountains! However, you must deeply understand the hatred and curses contained in the basic movements of this skill.The more you hate and curse the world, the more you overshadow the heavens. One who has mastered and reached the peak of the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art is the Heavenly Demon, the one who will overthrow the heavens.\u203bHowever, it becomes difficult to maintain your sense of self if you use this new skill.+Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.It was a terrible name, but I couldn\u2019t make fun of it.\u2018\u2026\u2026This must be the martial arts we saw earlier, right?\u2019Because it was really that powerful.She just swung her sword from a distance, but the Medicine King\u2019s head fell off. The Venomous Snake died without being able to withstand 3 strikes. Even I, who was confident in my training against [The Devil King of Fall Rain], could not outrun the sword path cut by the Heavenly Demon.The greatest skill that existed in this world.-Tsk. It\u2019s a typical demonic art.Bae Hu-ryeong frowned.-In the end, it\u2019s a matter of how you deal with the world, whether it\u2019s with strength or strategy.\u2018How I deal with the world?\u2019-Indeed. If you try to embrace the world with generosity, you usually end up in the Righteous Sect. If you try to ravage the world, that is the Demonic Cult. That is why the people of the Righteous Sect made their bodies into [vessels to accept the world], and the Demonic Cult\u2019s people made their bodies with [nails that can scratch the world]\u2026Bae Hu-ryeong hmphed and crossed his arms.-I\u2019ll give you the simplest example. A sword strike that cuts straight from the head to the bottom. In some schools, they call that the Tiger Fury because it is like [a tiger rushing].Hwik!Bae Hu-ryeong took a stance and swung his arms down as if he was wielding a sword with both hands.\u2018\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!\u2019It was only for an instant, but I flinched. I really felt the spirit of a wild beast charging at me.It was strong.His tone and behavior are so pathetic that I sometimes forget about it, but in front of my eyes was indeed the Sword Emperor Bae Hu-ryeong. He was a warrior who had nearly conquered the Tower with just a sword.-Well, it doesn\u2019t really matter whether it\u2019s a tiger or a bull. The specifics can vary depending on how the founder or the creator of the move gained enlightenment. Anyway, it\u2019s important to [imitate] a tiger or bull.Emulate it. Copy it.Thus, you make something of the world into your own.That\u2019s what Bae Hu-ryeong meant by vessels to [accept the world.]-But the demonic arts are different.Bae Hu-ryeong took a stance again.It was the same posture as when he previously swung his arms.-In the Demonic Sect, they say something like this when teaching initiates.Bae Hu-ryeong breathed in forcefully and stomped his foot.-Recall your rage, the soreness in your stomach, at the moment a thief stole one of yours.The empty air in the void split open.I unintentionally stepped back.The face.It was because of Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s countenance.His face was blank, but it still emanated an infinitely cold anger.It was as if he became a completely different person.-Recall the moment your younger sister was dragged away by the governor. Remember your weakness, your inability to do anything. You waited in front of the governor\u2019s house for the night to pass, but at dawn, your sister returned to you as a cold carcass. Remember her face, and paint it into your heart.Bae Hu-ryeong began to perform a sword dance.Even though his hands were empty, somehow I felt as if I could still see a sword. That sword was as black as the space in which we stood.-Recall when you buried your sister\u2019s body, alone. Was it winter? The ground was frozen and it was hard to dig. Did you dig at the stubborn soil with your fingertips? Did your fingernails crack? Did blood flow from your broken nails?\u2018\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2019-In the end, you couldn\u2019t even dig down to a foot. Did you put your sister\u2019s corpse into a pit? Did you bury her feet first? Did you put a pile of cold dirt over your younger sister\u2019s body? You couldn\u2019t bury her in the ground. In the end, did you sprinkle the dirt on her face, one handful at a time?I couldn\u2019t breathe.As Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s sword dance continued, the endless space which we were in seemed to narrow. It was enough to make my head spin a little. It was only the movement of his hands and arms, but Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s grudge resonated deeply.-Recall the texture of that grain of soil. Hold your sword with the hand that dug the earth. Swing your sword as you scattered the dirt over your younger sister. Lament your helplessness and blame the cruelty of the world.I muttered, though it was more like a moan.\u2018The nails that scratch the world\u2026\u2019-That\u2019s right.Bae Hu-ryeong stopped his arms.Only then could I breathe again.-Shall we say that it\u2019s a mental cultivation method that uses internal energy? It\u2019s literally a way to build and train your mind by pushing through adversity. Whether it\u2019s a strong person or a hunter, the outcome will be different depending on how well they use internal energy or Aura.Bae Hu-ryeong shrugged as if it didn\u2019t matter.-In simpler terms, it\u2019s a battle of wills. The demonic arts are a little heavy on the spirit.\u2018\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u2019-Anyway, Zombie, this isn\u2019t something you need to learn.I quietly looked at the silver skill card.-Really, you don\u2019t need to learn other martial arts. Don\u2019t you know who I am? Am I not the Sword Emperor? I\u2019m the greatest martial artist in this universe. You may not know this, but you\u2019re slowly becoming proficient at my supreme techniques! Infernal Heavens Demonic Art or whatnot, compared to my martial arts, it\u2019s like trash\u2026\u2018I want to learn it.\u2019-\u2026\u2026Huh?Bae Hu-ryeong blinked.\u2018I\u2019m going to learn it. This. Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.\u2019-Uh, uh\u2026 Uuuhhh\u2026Blink. Blink.It was after about 3 seconds that Bae Hu-ryeong recovered his voice.-Why?!\u2018Because I want to.\u2019-Compared to my martial arts, this is total crap!Bae Hu-ryeong began to go wild.-No way. Zombie, did you fall for the Heavenly Demon\u2019s swordplay?! The fuck. I\u2019m gonna go nuts. That only looked impressive because she entered the state of life or death, leaking her energy! It sucks. It literally sucks out your energy! Zombie. A traditional warrior should not get drunk and waste one\u2019s energy!I grinned.\u2018Are you mad because I\u2019m trying to learn someone else\u2019s martial arts?\u2019-Whaaat?\u2018No need to worry. In any case, our Sword Emperor\u2019s martial arts are the strongest in the universe. Do you think I\u2019m trying to learn the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art because I don\u2019t know that?\u2019-Um\u2026Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s nose twitched.Still, his pride seemed to have been satisfied since I flattered him a bit. This ghost was really easy to handle.-Well. I am, as you say, the strongest. \u2026But then, why are you trying to learn the demonic arts?\u2018It\u2019s so I can fully conquer this stage.\u2019In other words, it was to bring the correct ending to this world.\u2018Say that a cure is made. If so, it\u2019s over after we save two people, the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord. All other humans have been dead for over two years\u2026 And treatment doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ll survive. Isn\u2019t that right?\u2019-Hmm.Bae Hu-ryeong furrowed his brows.-You\u2019re right about that.\u2018Then how will the ending turn out? In the reborn new world, the Murim Lord and the Heavenly Demon become [Adam and Eve]? Sword Emperor. Does that look like a good ending to you?\u2019-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s face looked like he was chewing shit.He was probably imagining the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord as a couple.-No, that\u2019s kind of\u2026 That\u2019s really wrong. I can\u2019t imagine a scene where the two become a sweet couple. It gives off a bad mood\u2026\u2018Right?\u2019I looked straight ahead.[Please select a skill card.]Whoosh! Whooooosh!The cards chaotically danced about in the air. But I only had one card in my sight. My gaze did not leave the silver card.\u2018Creating a cure is just the first condition necessary to make a [good ending]. In the end, a great ending depends on whether the characters in the work can really be satisfied\u2026\u2019I stretched out my arm and grabbed the card.\u2018I want to present a perfectly satisfying ending to the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord.\u2019[Selection complete.][The skill is being copied.]Of course, it didn\u2019t end there.[Your current hunter class is D Class.][There is a penalty from your skill.]The Heavenly Demon\u2019s trauma.The bitter grudge in her heart.Another hell that I had to cross.[The trauma of the enemy who killed you is being reenacted.][The severity of the penalty is moderate.]However, this wasn\u2019t the first hell I\u2019d run through. It wouldn\u2019t be the last, either.[The penalty is the Hungry Ghost Road.]Will I have the chance to talk calmly about the hellish landscape that I\u2019ll cross?3.After returning to a day earlier.I committed eight more suicides.It was to return to the \u2018first day\u2019 we fell into the Apocalypse.\u201c\u2014It\u2019s cold!\u201dSame as the last time, the Venomous Snake shouted in surprise. The Alchemist and the Medicine King also instinctively hugged themselves. The dreadful coldness overtook our party.Guuoooh!The blizzard raged, shouting its ire. Achoo! The Alchemist already started sneezing and coughing.\u201cW, why is it so cold? Wasn\u2019t this a martial arts novel?\u201d\u201cBrrr. It\u2019s like the Siberian wilderness\u2026\u201dIt was a white field of snow.For me, I had become used to the sight over the past ten days.However, the rest of the party was flustered, and I wordlessly grabbed the Alchemist\u2019s hand.\u201cAh.\u201dThe Alchemist carefully bowed her head.\u201cTh, thank you. Death King-nim.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dSome memories from not too long ago struck my mind.\u300cI still believe in you.\u300dThe torso of the Alchemist that had dropped onto the snow. The red-stained snowfield. All of these images emerged one after another. My heart was pounding a bit.I spoke calmly, however, not letting any sign of my nervousness appear on my facet.\u201cIt\u2019s natural, I guess. Chen Mu-mun master, please take care of the Medicine King.\u201d\u201cAll right!\u201d\u201cAlso, I think I just saw a human shadow over there.\u201dUnlike the last run-through, I led the party this time. Soon, the snowstorm died down, and before us, the forest of silhouettes\u2014no, the forest of corpses\u2014stretched out.The Venomous Snake was confused.\u201c\u2026What. What are these? Why are all the humans frozen?\u201d\u201cIt seems like they\u2019re zombies.\u201dI touched the face of one of the corpses.\u201cHuh? Zombie?\u201d\u201cYes. Look at this.\u201dI pointed to the mouth of the zombie. Specifically, I pointed to its teeth.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of flesh scraps in between the teeth. People here may not have the habit of brushing their teeth after eating, but even then, this is a bit severe. It\u2019s like he bit things like a beast\u2026\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dUpon hearing my words, the Alchemist\u2019s expression changed.She examined the corpse\u2019s mouth with a more serious look. After a while, she seemed surprised.\u201c\u2026He\u2019s right. The flesh and DNA in this mouth and the owner of this body are inconsistent. They are completely different from each other.\u201d\u201cD-Doesn\u2019t that mean he just ate human flesh?\u201dThe Medicine King was disgusted.\u201cWhy? People in the past also ate human flesh. It isn\u2019t a zombie\u2026\u201d\u201cThe dates of death don\u2019t match.\u201dThe Alchemist adjusted her glasses.\u201cThis body died about three years ago. On the other hand, the owner of the flesh that was eaten died two years ago. That would be impossible if the eater had died and not moved for a whole year. It\u2019s hard to believe, but\u2026 Yes. As Death King-nim said, it must be a zombie-like creature.\u201d\u201cI, I hate monsters and horror movies! Do something about this!\u201d\u201cErm. Sir. Even if you tell me to do something about this\u2026\u201dThe Alchemist looked embarrassed.\u2018Okay.\u2019The progress was much quicker than last time.Even if the zombies started to move, we wouldn\u2019t be caught off guard like before. The anticipation of a situation alone can change people\u2019s reactions completely.Above all.\u201cMm.\u201dIn my head, I remembered the results of the last few days of research.\u201cBoss. Medicine King.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cI have a strange skill, though I can\u2019t tell you what the skill is. According to my skill\u2019s analysis..\u201dI explained the results of their research step by step.My memory wasn\u2019t perfect. I couldn\u2019t memorize the entire file at once. However, when the Heavenly Demon killed me and I went back 24 hours, I had more time to memorize the file carefully.Bae Hu-ryung also memorized it with me.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dUpon hearing my explanation, the Alchemist fell in deep thought.\u201c\u2026That\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s a flawless research method. I can\u2019t find any fault with it. It\u2019s almost like something I would do\u2026 But the terminology used is completely different from mine. No, it\u2019s really really awesome. What an amazing skill, Death King-nim\u2026?\u201dThe Alchemist looked at me with admiration.From my point of view, the Alchemist was praising herself.Perhaps\u2026 The boss was evaluating herself as a \u2018really, really awesome\u2019 person. In this desolate world, wasn\u2019t that confidence the most amazing thing? Or that\u2019s what I thought, at least.\u201cHm. It\u2019s good that our research time will be shortened,\u201d the Medicine King said easily.\u201cAnyway, I want to get away from the zombies. Ugh. It would be nice if there was a place to stay warm\u2026\u201dAt that moment.\u201c\u2014Ahahaha!\u201dWe heard the sound of laughter.In the last run-through, I didn\u2019t know who was the one laughing. But not this time. The Murim Lord. The Namgung clan and Taesang family\u2019s old man was the one who burst into laughter.\u201cThe Demonic Cult ends today!\u201d\u201cHa.\u201dThen.\u201cEven a passing dog will turn over and laugh.\u201dThe voice of the Heavenly Demon, of course, could be heard.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dI held my breath and went in the direction of the voices.Crunch.The snowflakes were trampled under my shoes. The closer the voice got closer, the more clearly I recalled the scene when the Heavenly Demon admitted her emotions.\u300cI am afraid.\u300d\u201cAs long as I am alive and well, the Demonic Cult remains strong.\u201d\u300cThis is why the world is so scared.\u300d\u201cAx saint. You\u2019re the one that should say your last goodbyes to the Righteous Sect.\u201d\u300cWhere is Namgung Un! Call the Namgung family and the Taesang family! Summon the Murim Lord here!\u300dThe country\u2019s greatest.The most powerful person in the world.That\u2019s why this woman survived until the last moment.In an infinitely sad sense, the warrior who realized the egotism of the heaven and the earth.\u201cPhew.\u201dThe warrior was still smiling.She was standing up to the world in the middle of this snowy field, still smiling toughly.She was like a single dot stamped on a white sheet of paper.\u201cWhat a long tongue this old man has. The Bloody Ghosts are just staying off the radar for a while after receiving my secret order\u2026 Hm?\u201dI just.I just hoped that the lone dot would connect to a line.\u201cYou guys are\u2026?\u201dThe Heavenly Demon\u2019s eyes widened. She looked at me as if she couldn\u2019t believe it. It was worth it. From her point of view, I was the first new person she had met in years.\u201cUh, uhhh. Is my great self seeing things now? It looks like a living person is moving\u2026\u201d\u201cHeavenly Demon-nim.\u201dI arrived in front of the woman.Then, I slowly knelt down.The cool snow field gently sank under my weight.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cFrom a world far away, I heard of the majesty of the Heavenly Demon and came to find you. For a long time, I have deeply admired the stories of the greatest person of all time.\u201dI didn\u2019t know how much time it will take from now on.But I was determined. I faced the Heavenly demon and shouted.\u201cPlease accept me as your disciple, Heavenly Demon-nim!\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon dropped her jaws as if she had seen a ghost.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70. <The World of Dead Constellations. (2)>=======================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha4.\u2018It\u2019s cold.\u2019So Baek-hyang thought in the middle of a snowy field.Buried in white snow, the world was colorless, odorless, and silent.The world was just a cold, blank sheet of paper.\u2018It\u2019s cold\u2026\u2019Her flesh was cold. Her bones were cold. Even her blood was also cold.So Baek-hyang thought.\u2018My stomach is numb.\u2019\u2018Mother?\u2019\u2018I think my internal organs are filled with ice.\u2019\u2018Mother.\u2019\u2018It\u2019s too cold here.\u2019She thought and thought. As she continued to think, her insides became increasingly frozen. Eventually, her thoughts and even her head became cold.Cold.Another cold world.Her mother\u2019s silhouette.How much time had passed?-\u2026\u2026Uh-huh.The silence broke.-It\u2019s weird. How strange.The smell returned.-It\u2019s already been 10 days since it snowed here. The snow is at least 5 feet deep. How is it that this child is still breathing?Finally, even the colorless landscape broke apart.So Baek-hyang looked ahead with young, childish eyes. There was an old man standing in front of her. He had dug up the snowfield and made a noise. When he grabbed her wrist, he smelled like an old man. The eyes of the old man looking at her were black.-You\u2019re not an ordinary child.That old man was an old master of magic.-You were born of ice and snow. The coldness of the world will soon be a part of your energy. Curiouser and curiouser. A young kid spends ten days buried in a snowfield and emerges like this\u2026 It\u2019s like something out of a book!-\u2026\u2026.-Child. What is your name?So Baek-hyang parted her lips.-I don\u2019t know.She couldn\u2019t recall her name.-How old are you?-I don\u2019t know.-How did you end up in this snowfield?-I don\u2019t know.-\u2026\u2026.She couldn\u2019t remember anything.It was cold. Her thoughts froze, her head and ability to think froze, and all the words in her head and heart seemed to be frozen.-Poor thing. A young one already sent to the elements\u2026The old master groaned.-However, you are the perfect vessel for learning martial arts. The Master of the North Sea will take you even if he has to pay a billion gold pieces. What wonderful fate! But for what purpose? Will our school be a gift to you, or will you be a gift to our school? It\u2019s very difficult to assess with my old eyes.So Baek-hyang did not understand. From before, she could hardly understand what the old man was saying. The person in front of her was using words that were too difficult for her.Brush.The old man smoothed So Baek-hyang\u2019s hair.-Child. Will you follow me?-\u2026\u2026.-I will feed you and get you a place to sleep.These words were easy to understand.As she nodded slowly, the old man spoke again.-You don\u2019t smell of anything. Since you don\u2019t have a name and don\u2019t know your birthplace, you are probably a child born from the snow. I will give you my last name. And I will call you Baek-hyang, the scent of the white snow.The scent of the snow.-From now on, you are a student of the Demonic Sect, So Baek-hyang.So Baek-hyang remained quiet for a while.Then, she spoke.-Where am I going?The old master smiled.-It is a place where children like you gather.5.\u201c\u2014It\u2019s impossible!\u201d the Heavenly Demon said.\u201cI have never had a disciple in my life. Even though the world has become twisted, my rules remain unchanged. A disciple?! Absolute nonsense!\u201dThe cave with the hot spring.We had left the snowy field and were in the stronghold of the last survivors of this world. The Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord said, \u2018To think there were still survivors\u2026\u2019\u00a0 They were surprised, but they gladly welcomed us as guests.However, they only accepted us only as guests.It seemed that the Heavenly Demon had no intention of accepting me as a disciple.\u201cHey. Demon lord. Why are you being so stingy?\u201dFrom the side, the Murim Lord chewed on an energy bar.\u201cI\u2019m glad that the children of the outside have survived. And not only did they survive, but they also came through rough conditions to be taught by you. That\u2019s meritorious and quite charming. What are you still being so stiff for?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s meritorious and charming.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon hmmed and snorted.\u201cEven so, the rules for accepting a disciple are strict! At our school, we do not senselessly accept all people. Only children who have been abandoned by their parents and abandoned by the world can enter the Demonic Cult.\u201d\u201cTsk, tsk. You always call me an outdated old fart, but you\u2019re more discriminatory than me.\u201dThe Murim Lord shook his head.\u201cChild. That\u2019s what she said. Why don\u2019t you let go of this petty, Demonic Cult junk and take me as your teacher? I am Namgung Un. I am from the great Namgung clan and am the head of the Taesang family, as well as the leader of the Righteous Sect. If you become my disciple, I will treat you with great affection\u2014\u201d\u201cWhy are you saying you can\u2019t accept me as a disciple, Heavenly Demon-nim?\u201dI asked, ignoring the old man. The Murim Lord was a little shocked, exclaiming, \u2018What! Could it be that my name isn\u2019t well known in the outside world\u2026?!\u2019 It was a little pitiful, but I left it alone.The Heavenly Demon furrowed her brows.\u201cDidn\u2019t I just say it? Only children who are abandoned by the world can enter the school.\u201d\u201cThe world has changed,\u201d I replied.\u201cPeople have turned into Jiangshi because of a mysterious disease. The Murim world\u2019s sects and families have all been destroyed. Since the world has abandoned humans, we are all abandoned by the world. Whether you like it or not.\u201d\u201cHeavenly Demon-nim. Haven\u2019t the conditions for admission been automatically satisfied?\u201dThe Heavenly Demon closed her mouth.Probably because I was right.And more than that\u2026 I was a hunter. I was also an orphan who abandoned the world outside and committed myself to climbing the tower. It was a little embarrassing to say that I was abandoned by the world, but I could say that I had abandoned the world. The [admission conditions] that the Heavenly Demon spoke of would be more than satisfied.\u201c\u2026\u2026Fine.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon stood up from her seat.\u201cIf you\u2019re confident, show me your Three Calamities Swordsmanship.\u201d[1]She glanced down at me.\u201cI shall check with my own eyes if you are entitled to inherit the teachings of our school. It\u2019s obvious that you\u2019re just all talk and no skill, anyway.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI also got up from my seat.\u201cThank you for the opportunity.\u201dI pulled out the Holy Sword.Shiiing!The sound of a sword being drawn echoed in the wide cave. People were looking in my direction. They were quietly waiting to see the kind of swordsmanship I would demonstrate.Of course, I had no intention of showing off the Three Calamities Swordsmanship.[Your skill is being activated.]Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.After all, there was a skill that I learned for this very moment.\u201c\u2026Hwooo.\u201dWhen the skill was activated, countless movements were drawn in my head.Weird and strange sword forms.However, seeing the road in front of me and driving on it were completely different matters. I didn\u2019t have a deep understanding of the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art yet. If I tried to show off the swordsmanship like this, my body would only tear like a crow-tit chasing a stork.\u2018If it\u2019ll be torn anyway.\u2019Therefore, this came to mind.\u2018It should be torn properly.\u2019The scenes of the [traumas] that I experienced so far.I swung my sword while painting them in my mind, one after another.To open the path to the demonic arts.I\u2019d witnessed groans and screams while climbing the tower thus far. The moaning and the screaming were always raw and vivid. I remembered these sounds as if I had just heard them a moment ago. Their voices colored my heart.\u300cSave me.\u300d\u300cSave me, please. I\u2019m so hungry. Please give me something to eat.\u300d\u2019The basement of the mansion.I recalled the voices of children who were trapped and tortured.\u300cI want to live.\u300dThe children had been bound in chains. When the mansion was caught on fire and burned, the children stared at the flames in front of their eyes. Trapped in the chains, they could not escape. They had to patiently wait until they were thoroughly burned.\u300cI wanted to play a little longer.\u300dWith the children\u2019s screams in my heart, I swung my sword.\u201cMa, Madu! That swordsmanship\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dNearby, I heard the Murim Lord exclaiming in bewilderment. But I ignored it. He wasn\u2019t what I had to focus on right now.Slowly, not hurrying, step by step.I swung my sword, thinking of what I had to think.\u300cBurn her!\u300d\u300cBurn the witch\u2019s nest!\u300dI remembered the voice of a demon who tried to save the sick at the edge of a continent.\u300cWhy?\u300d\u300cYou are all humans.\u300dThe demon had shed black tears from her eyes. The paradise she made. The small village was burning. The sight of a man burning another man was engraved in the demon\u2019s eyes.\u300cYou know about the beauty and tears of life, so why?! Just why?!\u300d\u300cYou called us monsters. That\u2019s why you didn\u2019t hesitate to burn us!\u300d\u300cAre we not also human?!\u300dWith the screams of the demon in my heart, I swung my sword.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dMy sword moved faster and faster. The Infernal Heavens Demonic Art that I gained from my death took shape. The trauma that had been transplanted after I died pulsed with anticipation. I felt like I would get lost in the middle of this, but then, I called forth my Aura and forced myself to continue the sword forms.-Look at this kid\u2026?Bae Hu-ryeong said that the demonic arts were nails that scratched the world.However, as I practiced the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art, my mind changed a little.Perhaps it is more of a scream than a nail.-Wow.The path of my sword continued and continued, then finally became a sword dance.-Now I see that if you were born in the Murim world, you\u2019d have entered the Demonic Cult.In the end, my sword dance was not beautiful. It was immature. It was clumsy. There was no scent of flowers, only the smell of fire. If swordsmanship had a face, my sword was the face of a person with a burn scar.It was only a scream.No matter how admirable yin and yang were, the world born from them was only full of grief.No matter how clever the script of the Three Character Classics was, it could not overcome a single scream of a lowly human.The sword containing the grief of the world was sharper than the sword of yin and yang.A sword that wielded a single scream was stronger than a sword that moved according to a wise saying.The deeper the grief, the coarser the scream, the stronger the sword.That was why we were strong.Survival of the fittest.That was the doctrine of the Demonic Sect.\u300cSpeak.\u300d\u300cWar has forgotten chivalry, and chivalry has forgotten war. Say it.\u300d\u300cIf you say this, I will kill you as you want.\u300dThe Heavenly Demon was the epitome of this doctrine.The highest sky.The Heavenly Demon knew of all the screams of her sect members and knew how to release them all with a sword. The sword form that the Heavenly Demon used must be a scream that faced the world, move by move.It was proof that somewhere in this world, there were those who had screamed and yelled in agony.\u300cThe whole world has become empty.\u300d\u300cDecades spent in vain, completely futile.\u300dShe was that sort of sky.Even the Heavenly Demon screamed in the final moment.\u300cAhaha. Ha, hahaha!\u300dShe laughed madly.\u300cAhahahaha! Ha, ahahaha\u2026\u300dWith that laughter in my heart, I swung my sword.\u201cStop.\u201dI swung my sword.\u201cStop it.\u201dI swung my sword.\u201cDid I not tell you to stop?!\u201dSuddenly, my sword stopped.I didn\u2019t stop because I wanted to stop. There was a cane. The Heavenly Demon lifted a wooden stick and stopped my blade. Her dark inner energy echoed on the cane.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d the Heavenly Demon muttered in a low voice.\u201cWhere did you learn the skills of our school?\u201dHer eyes were pitch black.\u201cYou can\u2019t fool my eyes! No matter how messed up and inexperienced your forms are, what you\u2019ve done right now was definitely the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art. In this world, only the members of the Demonic Sect can learn this skill, but I, the head of the cult, have never seen your face.\u201d\u201cSpeak. From where did you steal it?!\u201dI realized then that I was more tired than I thought. I had run out of breath. My whole body was wet with sweat. The Holy Sword in my right hand felt as heavy as a rock.I looked around. The Murim Lord was, of course, but even the other people in the party were watching me with bated breath. From the open ceiling of the cave, the starlight of the night sky was pouring down. Maybe more time had passed than I thought.\u201cI\u2026\u201dI forced my mouth to open.\u201cAm I worthy enough?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo I have the qualifications to be Heavenly Demon-nim\u2019s disciple?\u201dThe Heavenly Demon was silent.After being silent for a while, the woman turned her back. She walked to the dark side of the cave. Her back was refusing everyone, so nobody could chase after her.If I had a little more energy, I might have followed her\u2026\u201cD, Death King-nim?\u201dSlump.My knees collapsed.\u201cDeath King-nim! Are you okay, Death King-nim?!\u201dEverything was hazy. I thought it must be because I consumed too much Aura at once, and my head blanked. I would probably pass out and stay like this overnight.I tried to smile at the Alchemist to reassure her, but even that was difficult. The scene in front of my eyes was already dark.-Tsk, tsk.Just before I fainted. I heard Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s voice.-You pushed yourself to the verge of death by using martial arts above your level. Little crow-tit. That\u2019s why people keep saying you have to build up from the basics.Bae Hu-ryeong sighed.-Well, anyway\u2026Then.-It wasn\u2019t too bad, crow-tit. You\u2019re an admirable bastard.I lost consciousness.~~~[1] Three Calamities Swordsmanship \u2013 A clich\u00e9 name in martial arts novels for the most basic skills in swordsmanship, which are typically cutting vertically, cutting horizontally, and stabbing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71. <The World of Dead Constellations. (3) >=======================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha6.Winter.So Baek-hyang entered the mountain.She was 11 years old.-Child.-No one will force you to do anything.The headquarters of the Demonic Cult.The place that the old man took her to was like heaven. Even when she didn\u2019t do anything, she was still given food in the morning and evening. She was given a warm futon. There wasn\u2019t even anybody to discipline them.-Eat when you want to. Sleep when you want to sleep. Play when you want to play.-\u2026\u2026.-Baek-hyang. Just live the way you want to live.Sobaekhyang was dazed.This place might have been the Paradise she heard of in the legends.-All the adults here are so nice!Children her age grinned broadly.-They don\u2019t make us do anything.-Are they trying to raise us as slaves?-Idiot! It\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been here, and they haven\u2019t done anything like that.There were many orphans in heaven besides her. Very many. Even at a glance, there were more than 2,000 of them. Furthermore, one or two children entered the mountain every day. Once, during a famine, dozens of them had entered in one day.Were there so many orphans in the world?-\u2026\u2026You guys.So Baek-hyang parted her lips.-How did you guys get here?There was silence.The children stared at her.Then, in an instant, they opened their mouths.-The farming was too bad!-My mother worked in the Red Light district\u2026-I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Why do I have to tell you?-Mm. At night, thieves with swords attacked the town!-The villagers all suddenly got sick.-They kept hitting me. I ran away.Hunger. Mission. Illegitimate child. Bandits. Pandemics. Abuse.Each time the children opened their mouths, poison flowed.-\u2026\u2026.So Baek-hyang was dizzy. The poison drenched with hunger was bitter. The poison with resentment for one\u2019s calling was burning. The poison of an illegitimate child was fierce. The poison of being stabbed by bandits was cold. The poison that grew from the plague was nasty. The poison salted with abuse and beatings was rotten.-You guys\u2026Were there so many poisons in the world? Have all the bitterness, heat, pain, and rot from the world gathered here? Then, what was this place? How could this be heaven?So Baek-hyang remembered.-Are you guys happy now?It was a Jar of Solitude.-Are you okay now?Put toads, vipers, tarantulas, centipedes, fire ants, wasps, and all kinds of poisonous insects into the jar. Then, seal the lid. The viper bites the toad, the toad eats the tarantula, and the venom eats each other until finally, only one survives.Let it rest.To make the ultimate poison.-Yeah!The children laughed brightly.-Because I can eat rice every day.-I don\u2019t have to work for my mother.-I\u2019m always fine.-Yup. There are no thieves here, right?-Even if it hurts, the doctor will fix it.-Nobody hits me. I like it.Toad. Viper. Tarantula. Centipede. Fire ant. Wasp.The children opened their mouths and laughed, but in So Baek-hyang\u2019s eyes, her peers looked just like poisonous beasts and bugs. That was right. This place wasn\u2019t like heaven. It was just a jar to nurture the loneliness of one person.-\u2026\u2026.So Baek-hyang quietly put her hand on her chest.It was cold.It wasn\u2019t something that could be warmed with a warm morning\u2019s porridge, evening\u2019s soup, or a thick blanket. Ice that would never heat up was buried in the middle of her heart. That was her heart.Her mother was leaving.The snow was drifting down.Her mother didn\u2019t stop walking away.Like her, the snow did not stop.-\u2026\u2026.From that day on.So Baek-hyang didn\u2019t get along with her peers.\u300cEat when you want to.\u300dEvery morning and evening, the food she ate lessened.\u300cSleep when you want to sleep.\u300dShe went to bed early and got up even earlier.\u300cPlay when you want to play.\u300dShe didn\u2019t play. While the children laughed and played around, neutralizing their poison with laughter, So Baek-hyang did not socialize with them.The children murmured.-Baek-hyang is strange\u2026-She\u2019s always playing with the farmers!-Weird.-Yup. She didn\u2019t eat rice\u2014on purpose!-Why does she hang out with the farmers?-I don\u2019t know.She ignored it.\u300cJust live the way you want to live.\u300dTime passed.One day, an old man came. It was the old master of the Demonic Sect who had brought her here. Although time had passed, the old man had not changed from that winter day.-It\u2019s been a long time since we saw each other, Baek-hyang.-Yes. It\u2019s been a while.-I have something to ask you.Thud. Thud.The old master hit the ground with his staff.-I hear you don\u2019t fit in with children your age.-Yes.-I hear you help the farmers grow the food you eat and harvest it.-Yes.-I hear that you make all the clothes you wear and the blankets you use.-Yes.-Why?The old man tilted his head.-If you want, you can live in abundance, even if it is not luxurious. This is a Peach Blossom Spring.[1] Grown-ups farm and pick fruits for you. You are just a child, so why do you work so hard?So Baek-hyang parted her lips.-The Mo family, who farms on the lower part of the mountain, had their two daughters taken away by the governor.-Hmm?-Mr. Choi, who works in the orchard, was called to build a wall, and his second son died while he was gone. He brought up this unfairness to the governor, but he was accused of conspiracy, and even his firstborn was killed. After burying the bodies of their two sons in their hometown, Choi and his wife devoted themselves to this place.-\u2026\u2026.So Baek-hyang listed all these out, one by one.The farmers who bring crops to the orphans were all injured by the world. There isn\u2019t a single person among them who doesn\u2019t have a painful story. Not even one.-This is not heaven.So Baek-hyang said after scrutinizing the farmers\u2019 circumstances.-They don\u2019t feed and dress us for free because they\u2019re dumb.-Then?The old man asked back.-Why do you think you eat and sleep for free?-Because they want us to take revenge for them.-Because of regret and resentment. Because they could not forgive the governor and towns that ruined their lives. They want to get revenge, but they don\u2019t have the power to get revenge.So Baek-hyang said.-I heard it. They say you have to learn and master martial arts from a very young age to succeed. Those farmers, the people who feed us and dress us, are too old to deepen their understanding of martial arts.But.-But, they can farm for [children who can learn martial arts].-We don\u2019t eat and sleep for free.That was what paradise was.-It is to take revenge on the world on their behalf.It was the headquarters of the Demonic Cult.The old man was silent.After being silent for a while, the old master asked.-Baek-hyang.-Yes.-Do you have anything to say to the world?So Baek-hyang nodded.-Yes.About the cold.About a winter\u2019s blizzard. About that day, following a mother and crossing a snowy field. About the mother who continued to walk away while hearing her child scream. About the child left behind. About the cold.About someone\u2019s heart.-I do.About hunger. About a child born in the Red Light district. About illegitimate children. About the child who lost his family to the thieves. About a child whose village disappeared due to the plague. About a child who was abused and beaten.About their poison.-I have a lot to say.The world was wide.-Very many things.What had to be said was infinite.The old master quietly closed his eyes.-Is that so\u2026 I suppose you do.It was quiet.-If so, the world will have to listen to you.The old man opened his eyes.-I am one of the Demonic Sect\u2019s Seven Elders. I am known as the Demonic Buddha.-Is there a Buddha in hell?-If there is no Buddha in hell, what use does he have?Even though So Baek-hyang called this place hell, the old man did not reproach her. Rather, he responded as if it were natural. Only then did So Baek-hyang know that she had chosen the right path.-Baek-hyang, you passed the admission test. You did not lose your self even with the abundance of food and a comfortable bed. Thus, your poison will be sharp. Take me as your teacher, and call me Master.Master.-In the future, your sword will ring in place of countless screams.The old man raised his cane.Then, he placed it on the shoulders of the young Heavenly Demon.-Bow. You are my disciple from now on.That day.So Baek-hyang entered the sect.She was 13 years old.7.\u201cGet up.\u201dIt was early dawn when I woke up.There was a voice that seemed to whisper in my ear.When I opened my eyes, the Heavenly Demon\u2019s face was right in front of my nose.\u201cOho. You already can\u2019t stand up?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dShe was really right in front of me. She was so close that I could see each of her eyelashes. When she blinked, her eyelashes opened and closed like black curtains.I was lying on the floor. The Heavenly Demon stared down at me in that position.\u201cThere. Heavenly Demon-nim.\u201dWas it because I just woke up? My mouth felt so stuffy that I couldn\u2019t speak properly.\u201cIf you\u2019re still there\u2026 I want to get up, but I can\u2019t. It feels like my head will bump into you?\u201d\u201cHmm. Seeing how you\u2019re so eloquent after waking up, your body must be fine.The Heavenly Demon straightened her back.\u201cGo into the hot spring and take a bath. Wash your mind and body with all your heart.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI shall be waiting at the entrance of the cave.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon swung around and walked away. I had nothing to say. The small back of the Heavenly Demon disappeared to the other side.I stayed in the cave, dumbstruck.The other sleeping party members were also there.\u201cNnng, oonyaang\u2026\u201d\u201cUh huh, hmm\u2026\u201d\u201cHooo\u2026\u201dWere they immersed in the virus research until late at night? Tools were scattered around the sleeping forms of the Alchemist and the Medicine King. The Venomous Snake was crossing his arms with a big smile, as if he was in a very pleasant dream.What kind of dream did he have to be able to sleep so sweetly?I opened up three psychological status windows at once.\u300cYes, I am right. No, why should I even explain this simple thing? You wouldn\u2019t understand it even if I did explain it. Anyway, I\u2019m right, so do what I tell you to do. You\u2019re driving me nuts. You\u2019re as dumb as a water flea, you idiots\u2026 N, no, that wasn\u2019t what I meant, but\u2026 If you just mull it over in your noggin, if you just think a little more, you can understand this simple logic\u2026 Ah, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u300d\u300cHa, this is my 100th victory, Marcus\u2026 Also, I won 999,999 times against that youngster who\u2019s an alchemist of something. Oho, is there really no one standing in the way of Sean McCallister\u2019s road to victory? It\u2019s sad to realize just how much superior I am in this world\u2026\u300d\u300cMwahahahaha! Pfft hee hee hee sjfklasjklfsjd huhaha!\u300dOkay.\u2018I shouldn\u2019t wake them up.\u2019I especially thought that I shouldn\u2019t touch the last one.I washed my body carefully and went out. Shiny and Bae Hu-ryeong were holding their breaths the whole time. The white sky loomed over us as the dawn mixed with the snow on the horizon\u20268.Upon exiting the cave, I saw a snow-covered world.The Heavenly Demon stood in the middle of a snowy field. Arms crossed, she looked at me up and down from head to toe.\u201cDid you wash up everywhere?\u201d\u201cYes. I cleaned until I felt that even my mind was cleansed.\u201d\u201cI hate people who speak well.\u201dThe woman frowned, furrowing her eyebrows as if she found me dissatisfactory.\u201cAnd you are too good at talking. Your tongue is much too light. I worry if your temperament is more of a scammer than that of a good man.\u201d\u201cUh.\u201dWas that so?I\u2019ve never really thought that I had a talent for speaking. However, the Witch, who was second place in the rankings, also told me off, saying that I was \u2018good at talking.\u2019 Was I born with a talent that I hadn\u2019t known about?As I was locked in these thoughts, the Heavenly Demon narrowed her eyes at me, displeased.I also opened her psychological status window.\u300cDespite his silver tongue, his face is still dumb after he washed up, so he\u2019s not cute at all. He\u2019s the very picture of a member of the Hao Munju.\u300dWhat was Hao Munju?[2]\u201cFollow me.\u201dI followed the Heavenly Demon, keeping her in my sight.As we crossed the snowfield, the Heavenly Demon said,\u201cIf you want to wear the clothes of the Demonic Cult, you have to pass numerous tests. Although you have proved your qualifications, that doesn\u2019t mean you have passed the test. Our first exam is\u2026\u201d\u201cIs it [the test of comfort]?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThud.Maybe I was imagining it, but the Heavenly Demon\u2019s steps seemed to falter.\u201cYou take in children, raise them, and feed them for free. Children who settle and are complacent with this are raised by the farmers, craftsmen, and others on the auxiliary side of the sect. They would grow up and support the Demonic Cult.\u201cBut it\u2019s different if you pass [test of comfort]. Then, you are recognized as a disciple of the cult. These are the children who officially learn the demonic arts. At this time, they say that they have truly entered the Demonic Cult.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026How do you know that?\u201dI was killed by you in the last run-through, and I saw your trauma.I couldn\u2019t say that though, so I just smiled.\u201cI know quite a lot.\u201d\u201cAh. How indifferent the heavens are! The last connection that I\u2019ll make, and they brought me a sly thing like you. Must I really accept this Hao Mun-like wretch into the sect\u2026?\u201dBae Hu-ryeong nodded from the side.-Yup. Zombie does look like a Hao Mun scrub! Because it\u2019s the Heavenly Demon, she has a good eye for people.\u2018Uh. What are you talking about\u2026?\u2019-Well, if you were just a scrub, you\u2019d lose interest in things too quickly. But when you\u2019re being weird, you just don\u2019t quit. So it\u2019s even worse!Was this a compliment? Or was it an insult? Whenever I wondered if someone was complimenting me or cursing me, I would just interpret it as a compliment.There were desolate times. Today, people are too stingy with praise. Shouldn\u2019t I, at least, receive people\u2019s words in good faith? That\u2019s right. Even if the other person was a weird, eccentric, and negative ghost like Bae Hu-ryeong\u2026-I\u2019m saying that that part of you is like a scrub! You crow-tit!I had no idea what he meant. Really.\u201c\u2014This place should be good enough.\u201dThere was a pit in the place that the Heavenly Demon led me to. A huge pit. The center was hollow, shaped a little like the Colosseum, but it was as dark as midnight because the dawn\u2019s light could not reach it.\u201cBe joyous.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon turned and looked at me.\u201cThis great self is willing to accept you as a disciple. The world of the Demonic Sect! The heavens won\u2019t reject a member if he is well qualified.\u201d\u201cAh! Then\u2026\u201d\u201cBut, I can\u2019t accept you as a formal disciple yet.\u201dEh.\u201cNo. Heavenly Demon-nim, you\u2019re too much! I came from far away to become your disciple. I also showed you that I was qualified. But what do you mean that I\u2019m still not good enough to be your formal disciple?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026First of all, your words are very suspicious.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon stared at my face.\u201cIt\u2019s really suspicious that you came from beyond the Great Wall. I also doubt that you admired the great me for a long time. According to my senses, everything seems like a lie\u2026 But your nature does not seem too vile, so I\u2019m letting you go.\u201dSeriously.How does this person have such strong senses?\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s weird because you actually have a good heart. That\u2019s right. You are truly a freak. It\u2019s difficult to determine right now whether you will be an opportunity for me or if I will be an opportunity for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026What is the test?\u201d\u201cThere.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon pointed to the bottom of the pit.\u201cI threw a Jiangshi down there. He was once a well-known master in Gangho, one of the most promising people of our cult. Defeat that Jiangshi. Then, I will accept you as a disciple of the cult. But.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon gave me a clue, arms crossed.\u201cFight while you are hungry.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cJust as I said. Fight the Jiangshi, but with only hunger in your heart. Only the pain of hunger must be in that place. Do not let any other emotions or thoughts other penetrate your psyche.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon\u2019s voice echoed.\u201cCan you do it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThen, I realized.She already considered me her [disciple].Saying that I was not a formal disciple or a disciple at all, all of those words were nothing more than hot air. In the heart of the Heavenly Demon, I was a disciple who will be taught according to the teachings of the Demonic Cult. I was the one who would inherit the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.\u201cAll of your sword\u2019s movements must stem from hunger,\u201d the Heavenly Demon said.\u201cThink of the hungry voices and groans, the arm movements, and footsteps of starving people. Everything. Think about it and plant it in your mind. Make it into your will. By this will, crafted only from hunger, swing your sword.\u201d\u201cOnly then will the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art reveal its true power.\u201dI looked down the pit.-Guoooooh!A zombie was howling at the very bottom. A black uniform. It was old and worn out, but the zombie certainly wore the uniform of the Demonic Cult.A pit resembling hell.You could call that zombie my senior apprentice.\u201cIf\u2026\u201dI opened my mouth.\u201cIf I swing my sword only out of hunger, what will happen?\u201d\u201cYou will be able to cut a man who has never starved in one blow,\u201dThe Heavenly Demon spoke calmly.\u201cTherefore, you can fight half of the Righteous Sect members with one maneuver.\u201dThus, that was why this was said.Nails that scratch the world.\u201cFirst, learn the way of Asa, death by starvation. Then learn the way of Galsa, death by dehydration. Only by understanding thirst can you wield a sword to strike those who have never been parched and twisted. Next is death by drowning. You will master all nine sword techniques, and through these, you will overturn the world.\u201dI squeezed the hilt tightly.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dMy heart was beating.\u201cThat\u2019s quite appealing.\u201dThe end of the Heavenly Demon\u2019s mouth rose.I think it was the first time I saw her smile in this life.Perhaps she liked my fighting spirit.\u201cIf so, why are you hesitating? Hurry up, and don\u2019t fall into hell.\u201dWith that, I jumped into the zombie pit.~~~[1] Peach Blossom Spring: Like Shangri-La, a hidden utopia on Earth, untouched by the politics of the outside world.[2] Hao Munju: A group of thieves, pickpockets, low lives, etc., mostly without honor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72. <The One Who Gathers Death. (1)>====================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha1.What word in the world matched the least with [zombie]?I knew that it was a strange question.But this world was occupied by zombies. As I fought against zombies and practiced martial arts, I naturally had to worry about zombies. So I just realized which word was the worst combo with a zombie.-Guuuoh!That was [Hadouken].[1]-Uwaaa, aaaah!A zombie in a black robe gathered his hands and fired a Hadouken at me.I wasn\u2019t kidding. It was real.I\u2019ll say it again. This [zombie], who had lived as a person of the Murim world, screamed and fired [Hadouken] at me.\u201cThis is crazy\u2014.\u201dWhoosh!The Hadouken easily pushed me back. I flew through the air like a tossed wooden stick. What had happened so far already left me dumbfounded, but it didn\u2019t end there.-Wooooohh!The zombie kicked the ground with a tap. It was a strange technique for movement. He sleekly activated a lightness skill. As if his body was filled with helium, the zombie soared into the air. In a moment, the zombie flew all the way to right in front of my nose.Insanity.\u201cHey! Wait, this can\u2019t be real!\u201dI swung the Holy Sword urgently. But before I could wildly cut the zombie, a voice stopped me from swinging.\u201cWrong! Don\u2019t swing your sword randomly.\u201dIt was the voice of the Heavenly Demon.She was looking down at my fight from above the pit.\u201cDid I not say this? Think of the hunger, death by starvation. Think only of the gnawing in your stomach. If you just swing your sword, the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art is nothing more then a useless shell.\u201d\u201cB, but!\u201dThe zombie opened its mouth in front of my face. Crack! I barely managed to twist myself away and avoid the zombie\u2019s teeth. I didn\u2019t have the time to fall properly, so I just ended up on rolling on the ground. Was it more angry because I avoided it? The zombie roared and rushed at me again.\u201cI\u2019m not really hungry right now!\u201d\u201cFool.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon shouted as if she was frustrated.\u201cCan\u2019t you think of the color red in your mind even if it isn\u2019t in front of your eyes? Just because you\u2019re not hungry right now doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t remember the feeling of hunger.\u201d-Guuuoh!While the Heavenly Demon talked to me, the zombie continued to attack me with its nails. If I was scratched by those nails even once, it would be over for me. If I became infected with the zombie virus, I would become Kim Zombie in the truest sense of the word.Chaang! Clink!The zombie\u2019s nails struck my sword with a horrible sound. I couldn\u2019t attack, busy as I was with trying to defend myself. I could taste death.\u201cIf you can\u2019t do this, it is because you aren\u2019t yet used to the sense of hunger. Your stomach is too full. Those who learn the Infernal Heavens Demonic Arts must be able to freely recall their senses!\u201dA sense of hunger.Memory of hunger.\u201cRemember the longest time you were starved for. Go over your senses from back then. Where were you then? What did you want to eat the most? How long had you been hungry?!\u201d\u201cThe longest time I starved for was 3 to 4 days\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? Three to four days?\u201dThe Heavenly Demon was dumbfounded.\u201c\u2026You mean that the longest you\u2019ve ever starved was for only three days? That\u2019s ridiculous. It has been a long time since the world has become so turbulent, and the harvest has been bad. How could you only starve for three days, unless you\u2019re the child of a noble family?\u201d\u201cWell, the place beyond the walls were more abundant than the central regions\u2026\u201dOf course, the Tower, where people from all over the world gathered, was more abundant than the Murim world. Furthermore, it was also a place where you could enjoy modern civilization. There probably were quite a few Hunters who\u2019ve never starved for more than two days.\u201cOho. Huh. Tsk, tsk, tsk.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon sighed.\u201cI see that this isn\u2019t getting through to you. Hunger is the most pressing sensation. That is because it is a pain that cannot be skipped for even a day, a pain that no man can reject. People live to soothe their hunger. There is no difference between the hunger of an emperor and the hunger of the lowest caste. How can you awaken the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art if you don\u2019t even know this?\u201dNo, but\u2026I lived as an F-class hunter for over 10 years and have gone hungry quite often.When I bought tteokbokki while living outside the Tower, I counted how many rice cakes there were per serving and only bought from a shop that gave 4 more pieces.\u201cEnough.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon turned around.\u201cThis was my fault! For a moment, I had hope. As I thought, you are a man who\u2019s only talk.\u201dI was at the bottom of the huge pit. So, the Heavenly Demon\u2019s figure quickly disappeared from my view. Chaaang! Clink! Barely blocking the zombie\u2019s teeth and nails, I shouted at the already distant Heavenly Demon.\u201cHeavenly Demon-nim!\u201dThere was no answer.\u201cHeavenly Demon-nim?!\u201dAgain, there was no answer.The Heavenly Demon was a warrior who didn\u2019t look back.\u201cPlease wait! Oh my God, it\u2019s not like being hungry is something special! Does that make any sense that you can\u2019t learn martial arts because of that?! Huh?!\u201dThe Hadouken zombie opened its mouth wide again.Ah.\u201cOh fu\u2014\u201dChomp![You have died.][You are regressing to 24 hours ago.]\u201c\u2014ck!\u201dI regressed to a day ago and stomped my feet. As I returned, I saw the skill card of Hadouken Zombie, suffered trauma, and received system verification that my ego was maintained, but that wasn\u2019t important now.\u201cBut I also lived through a lot of hardships!\u201dI was fuming.Indignant. Wanting to win.Only those two emotions, like red and blue fireworks, burned in my heart. They went beyond just burning. They blazed.-Wow.Bae Hu-ryeong rested peacefully next to me.-She\u2019s educating you in a very traditional way. Well, she\u2019s teaching you an arcane art, so that\u2019s only right. Zombie. Humans have been eating more since olden times, so they become more simple\u2026\u201cFine. So she\u2019s coming at me like this, huh?\u201dI ignored Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s words and left the hot spring cave.\u201cIf you come out like that, do you think I\u2019ll cower and surrender? Am I supposed to be thankful? I\u2019m a man who has burned to death! I was scorched from my head down! Do you think I won\u2019t die from starvation?!\u201d-Uh\u2026Bae Hu-ryeong wore a rare, embarrassed expression.-Zombie? Why are you like this? Hey. Instead of this, learn swordsmanship only from me, not the Heavenly Demon woman or something. I\u2019m much more tolerant when it comes to being a teacher\u2026\u201cShe wants me to feel hungry? Then I\u2019ll starve!\u201d-Damn it.Bae Hu-ryeong muttered.-What a dilemma. This guy\u2019s completely gone nuts. Oh, he\u2019s a crazy kid who can\u2019t see anything in front of him when he gets mad\u2026 We\u2019ll lose out on so many days\u2026From that day on, I entered the road to hell.\u2018I\u2019m going to find the items needed to clear this stage.\u2019That\u2019s what I told the party. With that, I left.Alone, I went as far as I could from the hot spring cave and isolated myself on a snowy mountain.Doing nothing. I just stayed there.-You\u2019re crazy\u2026Did he even know what I was trying to do?Bae Hu-ryeong looked at me with judgemental eyes.-You\u2019re just going to stay here until you starve, right?\u201cYes. That\u2019s it.\u201d-Ah, man.Bae Hu-ryeong lamented.-Everyone else should have to know how dumb this guy is. Ah, poor me! I\u2019m the only one who knows this, alas. I regret becoming a ghost when I died. I regret it!He was noisy.-Zombie. No, Gonja. Please. I don\u2019t care that you\u2019re so crazy immersed in your training, but what did I do wrong that I have to keep watching you from the side? Huh?\u201cHey, I told you you\u2019re being noisy.\u201d-Let me ask one thing. How many days do you intend to do this?I sat in a small cave on a snowy mountain. It was different from the cave where the Heavenly Demon and the party stayed. Of course, there was no hot spring, and there were no grains or energy bars. It was just a dark and cold cave.\u201cI don\u2019t know. At least 112 days.\u201d-What?\u201cI saw it in the Heavenly Demon\u2019s trauma. She hadn\u2019t eaten anything for 111 days and endured with just air. So I\u2019ll hold on for 112 days.\u201d-You damn sashimi-like\u2026Bae Hu-ryreong continued to curse at me for over a minute. But it was pointless. No matter what he cursed at me, my mind was unaffected. I had already started to sit in a lotus position.-You can\u2019t last for more than 100 days, no matter how much you want to!Bae Hu-ryeong cried out.-Look at the weather now. It\u2019s cold! It\u2019s super cold! You\u2019d freeze right away if you didn\u2019t have Aura, but how are you going to keep circulating your aura for over 100 days? No matter how much you try, 20 days will be the limit.Seeing how I didn\u2019t respond to abusive language, he was now trying to speak persuasively.-Besides, Gongja. Enduring for more than 100 days is no longer in the realm of hunger. You\u2019ve never starved for more than 100 days, right? Since you haven\u2019t, stop talking.\u201cHave you ever starved like that?\u201d-Yup. I know it because I practiced fasting in my youth. I felt like I was going to die of hunger for a few days, but after a while, I didn\u2019t even feel hungry! It\u2019s not starvation, it\u2019s just mental discipline. Mental discipline!\u201cThen there\u2019s my answer,\u201d I replied flatly.\u201cI just need to fast for 15 days, then keep repeating the 15th day.\u201d-\u2026\u2026.Bae Hu-ryeong huffed.-What are you saying?\u201cI won\u2019t eat anything for 15 days. I\u2019ll hold on until my hunger peaks. Then I\u2019ll kill myself to stay on the 15th day. My hunger level won\u2019t change.\u201dI looked at Bae Hu-ryeong.\u201cI repeat until I have 112 days like that. How does it sound? I won\u2019t run out of Aura. I\u2019ll continue to feel hunger. It\u2019s the perfect solution.\u201d-You\u2026 Madman\u2026Bae Hu-ryeong was astonished.-Just learn from me\u2026 Don\u2019t take a strange master as your teacher. I told you, my martial arts is superior. If you really need a teacher, you can learn from me. What the hell is making you do such a crazy thing\u2026!\u201cI will learn the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art perfectly.\u201dMy heart was ablaze.\u201cDo you know why the Heavenly Demon lost hope in the world? Do you know why this world, [The Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon] ended? It\u2019s because she felt that it was meaningless to live longer.\u201dWhen the Murim Lord was lying in his sickbed.The Heavenly Demon muttered to herself.\u300cThe whole world has become empty.\u300dThat was the end. If the world was a book, that was the final sentence written on the last page.That it was all meaningless.Even if people continued to talk, none of their words mattered. Even if people moved, no matter where they went, no matter what they felt, none of it had any meaning. Even if there were hundreds of lines after that sentence. Even with thousands of lines of description. It was to no avail.It was the same as a white sheet of paper.Then, the novel dies, and the world dies.It would perish.That was what the Librarian meant by [serial discontinuation].-\u2026\u2026.But I didn\u2019t want this world to perish that way.I didn\u2019t want the Heavenly Demon to end like that.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s easy to live while avoiding things.\u201dI looked outside the cave. There was a white snowy field.\u201cLet\u2019s say I have a thug-like skill. I\u2019m the greatest. If I win, I win everything by skill. Hunters that are inferior to me are like that because they are idiots. I don\u2019t need to care about the idiots, so I just pick a stage that\u2019s comfortable for me to target. No matter what happens, I laugh at them. I look down on them, cynically\u2026\u201dI circulated the Aura all over my body, still in the lotus position.\u201cIt does look cool, I admit.\u201dThen, I began.\u201cAnd while cynicism isn\u2019t childish in itself, people who live while being cynical are childish.\u201dI started to starve myself.\u201cFairness is childish, but the people who live fairly are not childish.\u201dI starved for a day.\u201cI am a person too. I have to live.\u201dI starved for two days.\u201cThen, the answer is obvious as to how I should live.\u201dI starved for three days.I starved, and starved again.~~~[1] Hadouken: A move from Street Fighter, colloquially known as Fireball because of how it looks, though it doesn\u2019t always use fire.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73. <The One Who Gathers Death. (2)>====================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha2.Hunger.What is hunger?It had been a week since I started fasting.\u201cWell.\u201dThe first and second days were the most painful. After three days passed, the pain went away. My gut movements slowed down. My thoughts became slow. My life itself faded a little.If you compare a person\u2019s life to a river, in my case one could say that the current had shrunk and dried up like a river during a year of famine.A drought.It quietly faded and receded. The stream of water shrunk and shrunk again, and it persisted like that until one day, the stream of pain, the stream of thoughts, and the stream of life all dried up.Was this what [hunger] was?Did the Heavenly Demon want me to train like this?\u201c\u2026\u2026No.\u201dI got up from my cross-legged position.\u201cThis isn\u2019t what she meant,\u201d I muttered quietly. \u201cIf I just stay still, this will all be for nothing.\u201dI took out my sword. In my head, I pictured the movements of the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art, and I swung the sword according to that image. Thoughtlessly.-What are you doing?\u201cExercise.\u201dWinter was cold. I inhaled and exhaled the cold air. Was it because I drank snow for the past 7 days? My breath seemed to resemble a flurry of snow.\u201cI was thinking about this wrong. I\u2019m a little stupid\u2026 The [hunger] that the Heavenly Demon mentioned is not simply [not eating]. It\u2019s even worse to just fast in the lotus position.\u201dIt was the first time I moved my body in a week, and I immediately ran out of breath.My muscles were shaking. My respiratory tract was tight.\u201cHunger is when [you want to eat but cannot eat].Clumsily, I tried to do a sword dance.However, I was sweating. It was different from sitting silently. My body began to come alive. The amount of sweat dripping from my skin was probably equal to the amount of water I took in.\u201cThis week, I was thinking about a farmer. A hungry farmer.\u201dWhat is hunger?\u201cWhat sort of farmer wouldn\u2019t go out to the field because he was hungry? Whether he\u2019s hungry or not, whether he ate or not, he has to work. And even if he works hard, there\u2019s nothing to eat.\u201dWasn\u2019t that what hunger was?\u201cHe swings his pickax. He digs the ground. But it\u2019s a famine. It\u2019s been a grim time. No matter how much he works, the seeds don\u2019t sprout. The seeds really won\u2019t grow.\u201dI swung my sword.\u201cBecause there is nothing he can do\u2014\u201dI closed my eyes.The land.I imagined a land that was dry and arid.\u201c\u2014that\u2019s why he is hungry.\u201dA farmer strikes the dry ground with a pickax. Thud! The dirt would crumble. Like breaking a stale cookie.\u201cIt\u2019s been over half a year since it rained.\u201d-\u2026\u2026.The reservoir is empty. The well in the village is also dry. There isn\u2019t a single drop of water in the field. In broad daylight, an old man comes out and sits at the entrance of the village. He doesn\u2019t speak. The old man\u2019s wrinkled face is also dry.\u201cBecause it\u2019s a drought.\u201dThe sun is hot.Some villagers have already abandoned their farming work. Their fields were abandoned. Since they abandoned their work, there were fewer reasons for them to not abandon their homes. The villager took the children and left for the coast.\u201cBut this farmer hasn\u2019t let go yet.\u201d-Why?\u201cBecause the sea doesn\u2019t seem to be different. He doesn\u2019t know how to fish. People can only live by what they learn to steal, and the farmer only knows to steal from the earth. It was the same for his father, his father\u2019s father, and the father before that\u2026\u201dOne day passed.Two days.Three.The farmer goes out to the field. He goes to work even though there is no reward. In the evening, he climbs the mountain and peels off the bark of some surviving trees that he can eat.\u201cNow, there is hardly any bark left.\u201dAll the villagers had taken off.When he descended from the mountain and looked back, the trees were all white and bare. From a distance, it looked like a forest of birch trees.Hunger was what made the world white.\u201cBut.\u201dThe farmer swung his pickax on the bare ground.I swung my sword in the air.\u201cHe can\u2019t even eat the bark.\u201dHe has a family.\u201cIt\u2019s been more than a week since he\u2019s eaten anything resembling food.\u201dHe has a child.-So?Bae Hu-ryeong asked. The pickax swung repeatedly, as did my sword.-So what are you going to do?\u201cFirst, he\u2019ll go to the well in the village.\u201dHe barely scoops a bowl of water from the well, which you could see the floor of.\u201cThe water is used to prepare the bark. Put small leaves in the water\u2026 And then boil it.\u201dThe fresh smell of plants.The thick smell of the bark mixed with the water vapor and spread through the air.The farmer swallows his drool.\u2019I\u2019m hungry.\u2019I also gulped.\u2019I want to eat.\u2019He wants to bite off the bark.The bark was becoming sweeter. The bark retained the smell of the water and leaves. He thought it would be sweet. He wanted to tear the bark apart with his teeth. The thick juices would probably flow from where it was torn. There would be an earthy taste to it. A brown colored food.The bark was edible soil.\u2019I want to eat.\u2019But he had to be patient.\u2019I have to give it to my children\u2026 At least this. I have to give it to them.\u2019The children whined. They cried.The bark that their father brought. The children hated the bark that he brought and barely touched it. They screamed. They complained while eating.They flipped it.\u2019Ah.\u2019Without thinking, the farmer slapped his child on the cheek.Just like the farmer swinging his arm, I also swung my sword.\u201cThis isn\u2019t me.\u201dThe farmer turns his back on his children.\u2019This isn\u2019t who I am.\u2019\u2026He wasn\u2019t someone of the nature to beat his kids originally. He was not such a person. However, the famine was terrible. It had been so long since he\u2019d put proper food in his mouth, and his nerves were sharp. He became sensitive. It was too much\u2026\u2019My life isn\u2019t supposed to be like this.\u2019The farmer picks up the bark.What is hunger?There have been numerous famines since the world began.There were countless farmers.There was a lot of hunger.\u300cFight while you are hungry.\u300dCan you move despite the hunger?\u300cAll of your sword\u2019s movements must stem from hunger.\u300dThat was right.There was motion in hunger.\u300cThink of the hungry voices and groans, the arm movements and footsteps of starving people, everything.\u300dThe motion was that of a farmer slapping his child.The gesture was that of the farmer, angrily leaving the house and dumping the bark in the yard.The gesture was that of the farmer going back and handing the children the dirt-stained bark.\u300cThink about it and plant it in your mind.\u300dSince the world began, some farmers beat their children, while others touch their children\u2019s cheeks and whisper their apologies. Some farmers would even beat their children and kill them. Some farmers would survive until next year, while others die with their children.That was how it was, and that was how it would be.\u300cMake it into your will.\u300dThere were no gestures that did not come from hunger.\u300cBased on this will.\u300d\u300cCrafted only from hunger, swing your sword.\u300dWith the motion of indignation and resentment of hitting a child, I swung my sword.Throwing the bark on the ground, I swung my sword with a motion that meant abandoning life.With the gesture of handing the bark back to the children, I swung my sword.\u300cOnly then will the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art reveal its true power.\u300dInfernal Heavens Demonic Art.First form.Asa. The sword of starvation.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI slowly opened my eyes.The white daylight in the snowy field had turned into black night.My whole body was soaked with sweat. It was only when I was drenched with sweat that I felt hunger. I was hungry. A mad hunger gnawed at my stomach. My empty stomach seemed to have sprouted teeth and chewed on my intestines.\u2019This is hunger.\u2019It hurt.\u2019This is hunger.\u2019The demonic arts.The nails that scratch the world.The walls of the cave were scattered with scratches. Was there a storm of something? My sword strikes were clearly engraved on the stone wall. Stalactites and stalagmites were sliced through.The stone walls and pillars had been cut by a blade.Even though I had barely used any Aura.\u2019But\u2026 It\u2019s still not enough.\u2019I had just reached the edge of this new skill I had gained.I felt it clearly.With the sword paths drawn in my head. An image drawn in my heart. The unmistakable feeling and sensation of the two matching was at my fingertips.That\u2019s how I knew.\u201cIt\u2019s still clumsy.\u201dThe place where my fingertips softly touched.It wasn\u2019t the peak of the mountain, but its entrance at best.-Are you crazy\u2026Bae Hu-ryeong looked at me with a face that said he was tired.\u201cOi, why are you calling me crazy again? This time, I\u2019m training properly.\u201d-Properly? Even those who practice the seduction arts are training more properly than you.Bae Hu-ryeong sighed deeply.-That\u2019s why ignorant people are scarier. You little crow-tit. Even if I travelled the whole world I wouldn\u2019t find a guy as crazy as you. Your spirit is of the Righteous Sect, but your mind and methods have turned to the Demonic Cult and embraced it. Good grief.\u201cUh. I don\u2019t know the martial arts terms yet. So what about it?\u201d-Such an idiot\u2026Bae Hu-ryeong muttered.-This is bizarre, but this kid has no clue. Good grief. I\u2019m going nuts.\u201cTell me so I can understand. Come on.\u201d-In a word, a master of the Righteous Sect is using the demonic arts. You want me to be more precise? It\u2019s [a master of the Righteous Sect who only knows how to use the demonic arts]. You zombie. Are your nose and ears stuffed?\u201cWell.\u201dI raised my left hand to cover my nose.\u201cIt does feel a little clogged.\u201d-This guy has been starving for just over a week and then his mind goes nuts\u2026 No, it was like this from the beginning\u2026 Did I do something wrong in my previous life to have to deal with this idiot\u2026Bae Hu-ryeong lamented.-This guy\u2019s even making me disturbed in the mind. Wow. How am I supposed to teach this guy martial arts? I think it\u2019ll be fucked if I teach him the same way I taught Grandpa Marcus. What am I supposed to do\u2026Ah. I was hungry.I wanted to eat a Choco Pie.A Choco Pie that when you bite into it tastes like chocolate. A Choco Pie with a chewy white marshmallow inside. I wanted to eat just one piece of Choco Pie while drinking warm milk.What is hunger?Gongja says that hunger is a Choco Pie.A delicious and healthy chocolate pie\u2014-\u2026Hey. You\u2019re thinking of something else now, aren\u2019t you?\u201cNo? I\u2019m thinking about martial arts.\u201d-Don\u2019t lie. I can clearly see from your face that you\u2019re thinking something foolish.Why does this man know me so well? Was he a stalker? Technically, Bae Hu-ryeong was a ghost that always followed behind me. You can even say that he\u2019s a ghost stalker. My mood soured when I thought that.What a nasty stalker.\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth. The truthiest of truths. Were you frequently deceived when you were alive to be this doubtful?\u201d-Then tell me. What and how were you thinking about martial arts?The stalker nitpicked. Even the way that he hung onto the little things resembled the behavior of a stalker. Even though he was as large as a gorilla. Hurry up and enter Nirvana, Ghost Gorilla Stalker.I made a solemn expression.\u201cI thought I\u2019d go down the mountain for a while.\u201d-Descend the mountain? Why? Are you going to teach the Heavenly Demon a lesson this time?\u201cPsssh.\u201dI waved my hand in denial.\u201cI\u2019ve only just reached the start of the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art. What use is it if I commit suicide now and return to the Heavenly Demon? I\u2019ll only get the same reaction, like [Well, he has some potential].-Yeah? Why does that matter? You\u2019ll still get recognition from her.\u201cHow is that enough? That won\u2019t do at all.\u201dI left the cave.\u201cDo you know how frustrated and upset I was when the Heavenly Demon ignored me, saying that I\u2019d never really starved? I\u2019m a petty person. Just being recognized can\u2019t heal my wounds.\u201d-This guy is giving me a bad feeling\u2026\u201cThe response I want is [I\u2019m surprised].\u201dI wanted to see her surprised face.I wanted the Heavenly Demon to see me use the sword and be shocked.\u201c[Your talent is overflowing! It\u2019s explosive! I didn\u2019t realize that you were an opportunity for me. I\u2019m sorry, the eyes of the great me have sprained for a while.]\u201dYup.Just imagining it made me feel better.At that moment, the Heavenly Demon\u2019s face would be as satisfying as a Choco Pie.\u201cWell. How does this sound? Sword Emperor, you acknowledge it too, right?\u201d-Such a nasty asshole\u2026I came down the snowy mountain and headed for the snowfield.\u201cI felt something while using the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art. Ah. Compared to the people of this era, I have never been so starved. The farmer knows the bark, the exact tree that he would strip it from. He knows just how to prepare the bark. My imagination couldn\u2019t go that far.\u201dBecause I haven\u2019t tried it.\u201cThe clearer my mental image, the more powerful skill that will emerge. The reason that my martial arts is weak even though I\u2019ve learned the [Infernal Heavens Demonic Art] skill is because my image is inferior. So\u2026\u201dI stopped in the snow.\u201cFrom now on, I will fill the imagination that I lack.\u201d-What are you gonna do? Are you really going to eat bark?\u201cNo. There is a much better way.\u201dI laughed.\u201cHundred Ghosts Reincarnation.\u201dMoonlight shone. The snowfield was dyed silver.Suddenly, a cloud covered the moon. The clouds in the night sky became shadows on the snowfield. Little by little. Like bugs, the shadows swallowed the snowfield bit by bit.The moon was swallowed by the shadows.[Your skill is being activated.]After a while, the clouds receded.However, the shadows in the snowfield did not disappear. Even in the moonlight, the snowfield was no longer silver. As if the moon, once swallowed, could not return, there were numerous shadows in the snow.\u201cMy lord.\u201dOne of the shadows opened her mouth.\u201cDid you call us?\u201dThe demon knelt on one knee. Crunch. The snow was crushed by her knee and made a small sound. Thousands of skeletons stood behind her.\u201cYes.\u201dI nodded.\u201cDemon. I have a task for you.\u201d\u201cPlease give us our orders.\u201d\u201cThis is a world that is ending. All humans have become ghosts and corpses, wandering around the nine celestial bodies. Well. Maybe it\u2019s similar to the Aegim Empire that you once destroyed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe demon bowed a little lower.\u201cMy command is simple. Scatter. Scatter and gather the hungry corpses.\u201d\u201cThe hungry corpses\u2026 you say?\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201dI gazed upon the endlessly snowy night.\u201cThere will be towns and rural villages somewhere around here. Find them. And bring the corpses that you find to here. The corpses move, so they will resist, but you number over 4 thousand. Overwhelm them with quantity.\u201d\u201cHow many?\u201d The demon opened her mouth carefully.\u201cHow many corpses shall we retrieve\u2026?\u201d\u201c112.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHumans with the trauma of hunger. I will learn their hunger.And when I learn and master their hunger.I would be closer to the Heavenly Demon at last.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74. <The One Who Gathers Death. (3)>====================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha\u201cMilord\u2026.\u201dThe demon looked up at me carefully.\u201cExperiencing 112 deaths is excessive. Even now, you\u2019ve become so emaciated in the last few days that it\u2019s hard to recognize you\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh? Did you become so loyal that you\u2019re worried about my body?\u201dThe demon hesitated. She seemed to be agonizing over how to answer me.Would it be better to use flattery? Or should she reveal her innermost thoughts?\u201c\u2026When the lord disappears, I will disappear too.\u201dThe demon opened her mouth.\u201cI will no longer be able to live in my little paradise. My life, my memory, my meaning, and everything will disappear. Everything depends on you, milord. I am concerned about myself, so I am concerned about milord\u2019s body as well.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice, to be honest.\u201dThe corners of my mouth rose.\u201cHow about you? Are you living all right these days?\u201d\u201cExcuse me\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou ended up living in Estelle\u2019s village. The people whom you valued more than your life have also returned. So how are you doing?\u201dAfter gaining the right to monopolize the 20th floor, I released the demon to the village. Other than when I needed her to do something like right now, she would continue to stay in the village. It would be the same in the future as well.The demon replied with a nervous look.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m doing fine.\u201d\u201cAnything special?\u201d\u201cIf we\u2019re talking about something special\u2026 Ah.\u201dThe demon blinked.\u201cThere was a time when people called Hunters came in. They said that the secret to how the Death King suddenly became stronger and the five top guilds\u2019 secret treasure were hidden here\u2026 However, the Witch whom you brought in and the Hunters who follow her prevented it from becoming a big fuss.\u201dIndeed, it was the Black Dragon Guild. Their follow-up services are top-notch, for sure.\u201cThere are no more whispers from the minor lords of the neighboring kingdoms. They\u2019ve been contracting measles from the nomads they brought in to fight us\u2026 And even if that wasn\u2019t the case, both the empire and the temple declared my village a holy place. Sometimes the Lizardmen and elves come and give gifts\u2026\u201dIt seemed that things in that world were going according to order.\u201cWell, but\u2026 For me, the abilities that I used to possess have disappeared.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cThere are sick people who heard rumors about me and come to visit\u2026 In addition, after the village was declared a holy land, pilgrims who wish for a miracle have come together, and I\u2019m not sure what to do with them\u2026 For now, the Hunter priests who follow the Heretic Questioner whom milord introduced us to are taking care of them\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I have something in mind.\u201dSpecifically, I planned to build a new pharmacy for the Alchemist on the 20th floor.\u2018Since she said she would only take in new clients through me.\u2019After this expedition is completed, the Alchemist\u2019s position would be solidified.\u2018I have to make sure that the traffic is organized.\u2019As it was a place where patients constantly visit, she would be able to gain experience with various diseases.\u2018The Alchemist won\u2019t be able to handle the workload alone. Some staff would need to be hired. It would be okay to have the demon as an assistant, and it should be good to have pharmacist-wannabe hunters as her disciples. Then, the size of the pharmacy will naturally increase\u2026\u2019It wouldn\u2019t take a long time for the new pharmacy to be recognized as a branch of the Alchemy Castle, and then the branch will be converted to its headquarters.\u2018I have to take care of my people.\u2019I smiled.\u201cAnything else?\u201d\u201cOther than that\u2026 Oh, Dazena, Dazena is the head of the school in my village. I think she liked the tteokbokki that the hunters brought us. And Garchoff, the old man who takes care of the orchard, handed out the fruit grown by him to the Black Dragon Guild\u2019s hunters who stood guard in the village, and the Black Dragon Hunters gave him the fruit from milord\u2019s world\u2014\u201dThe wind blew.Snow fluttered, and the moonlight quietly faded with the scattering snowflakes. The voice of the demon flowed like snow. Under the moonlit night, I listened to the story that continued up until its end.The demon bowed her head.\u201c\u2014And that\u2019s the situation.\u201d\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re living well.\u201dThe demon replied carefully,\u201cYes. I\u2019m living well.\u201dI nodded.\u201cWe should improve the lives of people in this world as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cCome on, go and collect the bodies.\u201dGolden hair flowed down to her shoulders. The demon bowed again. A sound spilled from her lips.\u201cAs you command.\u201d3.There is a saying that goes: The right man for the right job.Summoning the demon and entrusting her to collect the bodies had very good results.She was one of the lower constellations. She had been called [The Devil King of Fall Rain] and had destroyed the world at least once. She knew how to reap death.\u201cI will start looking for a town or city where the government offices are located.\u201dThousands of skeletons moved at the devil\u2019s signal.\u201cBecause it is a workplace for officials, there should be a map. It will be just a clumsy map, but it should be enough to compare the geography. I\u2019d like to combine the fragmented maps to explore remote rural and fishing villages.\u201dThree days after the search began, the demon delivered the zombies to me. They were not the bodies of those who had learned martial arts. They were just ordinary farmers and peasants. They were that sort of bodies.\u201cI will bring back the corpse of a mother who hung herself because she could not bear to see her children go hungry.\u201dThe skeletons\u2019 bones were white. White bones lined up and brought over the corpses. In the middle of the snowy field, it was difficult to distinguish between the white of the bones and the white of the snow. So, from a distance\u2014It seemed like the bodies were moving on their own and gathering in front of me.\u201cThe children who opened their eyes in the morning to discover their mother\u2019s bodies. I will also bring the corpses of the children who died while crying beside their mother, withering like the wild grass.\u201dThe procession of corpses continued.The deaths were listed.\u201cThe people in the village who cursed the mother for dying, unable to fulfill the duties of a parent.\u201d\u201cThe one who hid in a well to avoid the epidemic, but couldn\u2019t escape from the well in the end.\u201d\u201cA prisoner who starved to death without even the chance to escape.\u201dThe demon carefully separated and chose the poor corpses.She was like a servant paying only the most precious tributes to the king.At the end of the week, the demon again knelt on one knee in the snow.\u201cI brought them. Milord.\u201dI looked at the snowfield.-Guoooh\u2026-Euh, wooahhh!-Kwooo\u2026Numerous deaths were arranged on the field.The zombies were struggling against the hold of the skeletons, who held onto their limbs. Some corpses looked old. Others were young. Hunger did not discriminate by age.\u201c\u2026\u2026Good.\u201dI untied my tie. I took off my suit and threw away my underwear. It was a dark night. With my bare skin exposed under the sky, I gave an order to the skeletons.\u201cLet them go.\u201dAt that moment.As soon as the corpses caught by the skeletons were released, 112 zombies rushed forward. It was their instinct telling them to come to the place with the strongest scent of flesh.Toward where I stood.\u201cCome.\u201dI smiled.\u201cAll of you, come!\u201dChomp!A young corpse jumped at me. It bit my calf. When terrible pain was about to rise up from my calf, the pain ended halfway. It was because an old corpse ripped off my thigh. The pain from the calf ended in the thigh, then, again, thickened and soared to my stomach.\u201c\u2014\u2013.\u201dPerhaps I screamed. But I couldn\u2019t hear the scream. Because a zombie tore off my ears.My lips were eaten. My tongue was eaten. I couldn\u2019t hear, couldn\u2019t speak. I just looked at the sight of the countless shadows burrowing into my body.[You have died.]I looked up at the night sky.The moon was white, as if it was a land where snow fell forever.[The trauma of the enemy who killed you is being reenacted.]The moon that the old man looked at before he died was exactly the same as it was now.All his life, he was a small-time fisherman at the river. When a Jiangshi bit his finger, the old man was not shocked. He drove the ferry calmly.-If I die in this boat, it won\u2019t cause discomfort to the rest of the world.The old man\u2019s wooden boat, within sight of the village, bobbed and shook in the river.The old man lay on his stomach. It was as comfortable as lying in a casket. It would be good to die as the boat was overturned by the waves. It would be good to die as if he was just falling asleep\u2026\u2026 The old man considered it happiness to be born on the river and die in the river.The last moon he looked up was peaceful.[The trauma of the enemy who killed you is being reenacted.]He didn\u2019t know how the world had changed so much.That was what the young viceroy thought as he strolled along the city walls at night. This wasn\u2019t even his hometown. He was once a student who just memorized a few lines in the writing room. However, the viceroy died, his people died, and the people\u2019s servants died.One death led to another like a polite request to be passed on. At the end of those requests, the one standing was himself.-Town leader-nim.A soldier approached him and spoke. He wasn\u2019t always a soldier. He had been a pimp at the inn. Even though he was testy, his head was put on right, and he was useful.-What is it?-The granary is empty. After half a month, there will be no millet in the warehouse. Fishermen sometimes catch fish, but they are not good enough. What will you\u2026?-Reduce the grain ration for the elderly.The young viceroy said.-There are countless Jiangshi. We have to save those who can still fight. Reduce the food that goes to the elderly and children by one-third.[The trauma of the enemy who killed you is being reenacted.]The viceroy in front of him was cold-blooded. Sometimes, it seemed like he was colder than the Jiangshi. The soldier was sometimes puzzled how this geek, who had only recited Confucius\u2019 teachings at the entrance of the village his whole life, gained such guts.-The backlash will not be small\u2026-Reduce the food you give to young people by half. There will be those whose reductions are greater than others, but so long as everyone is getting less, it will be bearable.-Still, won\u2019t they be dissatisfied and argue?-I will starve first.The viceroy said briefly.-I\u2019ll fast completely. If I, as the leader, do not eat anything, the complainers will lose their strength.-\u2026\u2026Is that alright?-I won\u2019t last long anyway. What difference does it make to me if I starve for a few days?The moon that he saw on top of the wall was lonesome.[The trauma of the enemy who killed you is being reenacted.]-We\u2019ll all starve like this!The kid shouted urgently. It was a young girl. As a beggar of the Everdirt, now that the distinction between the poor and the rich had disappeared, she had become the head of the children of her age.[1]-The town leader\u2019s telling us kids not to eat. He\u2019s telling us not to live!-Then, what should we do, Sister\u2026?-Even if we die, we should die with some food in our stomachs. That way, we can become colorful and charming Jiangshi.[2]The little kid fumed.-There is a recipe I learned in the Everdirt. It\u2019s called togwa. Literally, it\u2019s a snack made out of mud.-Mud snack\u2026?-It\u2019s a cookie that you can make as long as you have mud.Her eyes lit up.-Listen! Children who know how to swim should keep catching fish. Don\u2019t give it to adults unless they give something back, and we share it with each other. And the rest of you can go to the river and scoop soft mud.-What are we going to do?-I\u2019ll show you.[The trauma of the enemy who killed you is being reenacted.]The children scooped mud from the river. The mud was mixed with grains of sand. The children kept the mud in the scoop, then took out the gravel and sand several times.-Clump the mud together and spread it on a mat.The little boss eagerly moved her hands. She lumped the mud together like a ball and threw it on the mat. And, as if she was spreading plaster, she spread the mud wide over the mat.-Good. It\u2019s done!-What do you mean\u2026 it\u2019s done?-Just dry it in the sun like this. Then the mud cookies are made.The children were dumbfounded.-You\u2019re just baking the mud in the sun!-How are these snacks!?-Shut up. It\u2019s a recipe that\u2019s been handed down in Everdirt. Watch well.The little boss pulled something out of her pocket. It was a bag of salt. Even normally, salt was precious, but now that everything was being rationed, each grain was worth as much as gold. Little by little, the kid mixed the mud with salt.-There!After half a day, the mud dried up.-It\u2019s done now. Each of you can have one! But be careful when eating. If you eat a lot in one bite, it won\u2019t taste good! Savor it little by little.The children half-heartedly started to eat the mud cookies.[The trauma of the enemy who killed you is being reenacted.]-\u2026It\u2019s surprisingly all right?Some children scraped the mud cookies with their front teeth like a hamster.[The trauma of the enemy who killed you is being reenacted.]-I like it because it tastes salty.Some children licked the mud with their tongues. Their eyes were round. It was like they were eating ice cream. Because of the children\u2019s saliva, the fringes of the mud cookie got wet.[The trauma of the enemy who killed you is being reenacted.]-It tastes awful\u2026Some children just cried.The little boss laughed.-It\u2019s okay. It just needs to be edible. In the future, we have to take care of all of our food. Eat togwa every day, and if we catch fish, we\u2019ll eat fish as well. All right?-Yes, Sister\u2026The children soothed their hungry stomachs with mud.A person\u2019s mouth was sly. The children\u2019s throats accepted the salty mud as food.The salty taste was to trick the tongue for the mud to be swallowed. So, when the children were eating mud, they didn\u2019t bite it all at once. They tasted the salt while licking the mud with their tongues.-Don\u2019t lick too much! The taste will disappear. You have to eat pieces of it while licking.By the river, children kneaded the mud every day.-Yeah?At the riverside.-Look over there. It\u2019s a body.It was the same river where an old man had left on a boat.The old man who was born on the river died in the river. The old man regarded it as happiness. He thought that using a boat as a coffin and dying was a way to do no harm to the world.But there was something the old man didn\u2019t think about. Drowned corpses sometimes washed up on the shores.If it was the old man\u2019s happiness to die in the river, it was the old man\u2019s misfortune that his body had been pushed to this river, not the other side.And it was everyone\u2019s misfortune.-The old man must have drowned.-How sad\u2026-Is it a fisherman?The children approached the old corpse with fear and curiosity.-Huh?It was a dark dawn.-W, wait a moment!-Yeah?-It\u2019s a Jiangshi! It\u2019s not just a corpse!The corpse wriggled as it smelled the tender flesh of the children.-Run!There were some children who ran away.-Ah\u2026There was also a child who could not run away.[The trauma of the enemy who killed you is being reenacted.]That was it.[The trauma of the enemy who killed you is being reenacted.]The fortress along the river, which lost contact with the capital and the surrounding villages, was destroyed. The old man died. The last town leader died while fighting. A pawn soldier died trying to get past the town gates. The little boss died while holding her younger siblings.[The trauma of the enemy who killed you is being reenacted.]They tried to live.[The trauma of the enemy who killed you is being reenacted.]They struggled.[The trauma of the enemy who killed you is being reenacted.]Because they tried to live, they starved.[The trauma of the enemy who killed you is being reenacted.]The fingers of the children that they used to scoop up the wet mud by the river. Their hands spreading the mud dough on the mat. Their fingertips holding tightly onto the dried mud cookies.[The trauma of the enemy who killed you is being reenacted.]112 deaths.There was no gesture that did not come from hunger among them.[Trauma reenactment complete.][Confirming that the subject\u2019s psyche is maintained.][The penalty is ending.]I slowly opened my eyes.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe snowfield was deserted.On this quiet night. I softly talked to myself.\u201cI wanted to learn how to prepare the bark\u2026\u201dReality surpassed my imagination. Was the bark of a tree not traumatized in a world that was nearing destruction? Humans could even eat mud when they were cornered.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Things like that happen, too.\u201dI stood up and dug into the snow. I wrapped Aura in my bare hands. Digging in the snow and digging again, I reached the frozen ground underneath the perpetual snow.It was the first land I saw after falling into this world.\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026\u201dIt was not easy to dig into permafrost. I had to use Aura for this as well. I dug up a handful of earth, then heated it up as well as the snow with Aura. It was just like boiling soup. After a long time, the grains of dirt began to soften.It was mud.I picked out the grains of sand and gravel. I followed what I saw in my dream. The mud was kneaded into spheres. I took off my suit coat and used it as a mat, and I spread the dough on top of it.\u201cYup.\u201dTime passed. The mud cookies were baked in the morning by the broad daylight. I carefully held the mud cookie, which looked just like an ordinary sweet, with both hands.\u201c\u2026\u2026Thank you for the food.\u201dI cracked it with my teeth.A crunching sound echoed in my mouth.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI licked the edge of the mud cookie with my tongue. The texture became a little softer. However, it was only soft at the tip, so when I put it in my mouth, the grains of dirt stuck to the roof of my mouth. My whole mouth felt that unpleasant texture.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dA little later, I got the hang of it. This food was not supposed to be chewed with my molars. I had to gnaw it with my front teeth, then swallow it little by little. The warmth of the sun and the smell of the soil. I slowly ate the food that was made with those two treasures.Mm-hm.\u201c\u2026\u2026It really doesn\u2019t taste good.\u201dI bit into it.\u201cIt tastes bad.\u201dI ate it little by little.\u201cReally, it tastes bad.\u201dI swallowed.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dMy shoulders trembled.My heart trembled.An unspeakable emotion captured my whole body. Was it anger? Or was it sadness? Maybe it was hatred. Humans have probably come from the earth, so why can\u2019t we just eat the land? Why was the scent and texture of the soil so unpleasant?Why?\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dBefore I knew it, my right hand was clenched. Emotions that maybe anger, sadness, or even hate gathered in my hands. Then, I realized. The emotions that could not be expressed by words were originally expressed through one\u2019s hands.They weren\u2019t meant to be said; they were meant to be swung into motion.Martial arts were just the swinging of one\u2019s hands.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI should return.I pulled out the Holy Sword. I pointed the tip of the blade at my neck.I should return and show the Heavenly Demon my sword. No. It wasn\u2019t my sword. It was the sword of the old man who died without a name, the soldier, the viceroy, and the children.I hadn\u2019t read the texts on martial arts, so I didn\u2019t know the mysterious doctrine of yin and yang and the five elements. If there was any law to my martial arts, it was only their screams. If my blade followed any natural order, it was the gesture of the humans who were thrown away by the heavens.[3]Because it is full of resentment, it is infernal.Because we view the sky with our resentment, it is the infernal heavens.I stabbed the middle of my neck with the Holy Sword. With the deaths of 112 people in my heart, I regressed. What I had to do was no different from the last time.I asked the Heavenly Demon to accept me as a disciple.Like before, the Heavenly Demon pondered over it for one night.After one night, the Heavenly Demon presented me with a test.\u201cWhat is the test?\u201d\u201cThere.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon pointed to the bottom of the pit.\u201cI threw a Jiangshi down there. He was once a well-known master in Gangho, one of the most promising people of our cult. Defeat that Jiangshi. Then, I will accept you as a disciple of the cult.\u201dThen, the Heavenly Demon said, \u201cFight while you are hungry. Fight the Jiangshi, but with only hunger in your heart. Only the pain of hunger must be in that place. Do not let any other emotions or thoughts other penetrate your psyche. Can you do it?\u201dI didn\u2019t answer.There was no reason to answer what could not be said with words.Instead, I quietly jumped into the pit.-Guoooooh!One Jiangshi ran at me.I looked at the Jiangshi with indifferent eyes.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe scent of mud in my mouth.The texture of a lump of dirt in my hands.With only the children\u2019s hunger in my heart.Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.First form.Sword of Starvation.I swung my sword.With the first strike, I cut both his legs.The second strike, I cut off both arms.The third strike sliced off the Jiangshi\u2019s head.There was no gesture that did not come from hunger.The man who was supposed to be a high level master of the Demonic Sect was silenced in the bottom of the pit.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI looked up.The Heavenly Demon\u2019s mouth hung open. She was looking amazed, like when she first saw our party. Perhaps she was even more astonished. Her eyes shook. Seeing her eyes shake, I was sure that her heart would be swayed.The meaning of life, when she had thought that all was lost.It was because she saw it right before her eyes. A new beginning.Because it became visible.\u201cHeavenly Demon-nim.\u201dI slowly opened my mouth.\u201cWhat kind of death will we master next?\u201d~~~[1] Everdirt: Gaebang, or a self-governing body of beggars.[2] Colorful and charming Jiangshi: Referring to the idiom that states that a ghost who dies after eating has color and charm.[3] Natural order: The word used was chunri, or literally, heaven\u2019s laws. It\u2019s such a beautiful sentence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75========================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha1.\u201cThere are originally nine swords in the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art,\u201d the Heavenly Demon commented after seeing me in battle.\u201cThe Sword of Starvation, the sword that you showed, is just the first form. You know this.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAfter the way of starvation is the way of dehydration.\u201dThe way of dehydration.\u201cSo it\u2019s death from thirst.\u201d\u201cYes. Child of the outside world. You demonstrated the Sword of Starvation very well. So, if you devote yourself to training, you will get good\u2026\u201c\u201cWait just a moment.\u201dChuk.I raised my hand.\u201cPlease wait.\u201dI felt sorry, but I couldn\u2019t endure it without raising my hand. The person sitting cross-legged in front of me was about to go over a wall as if it were nothing, but the wall seemed very high to me.\u201c\u2026What is it?\u201d\u201cWhat did you say just now? [Good enough]?\u201dThe Heavenly Demon closed her mouth.\u201cHuh, that\u2019s weird. I thought I did pretty well. But it was barely good enough for the Heavenly Demon\u2026 Oh! I\u2019m sorry\u2026 Suddenly, my self-esteem is disappearing and I\u2019m losing my confidence. I think I\u2019m losing my nerve.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dThe Heavenly Demon\u2019s mouth wiggled.\u201c\u2026Fine, I\u2019ll admit it. You demonstrated the Sword of Starvation skillfully. Don\u2019t be impudent and go around saying that the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art isn\u2019t much.\u201d\u201cExcuse me? What did you say? I did it [skillfully]?\u201d\u201cAre you going to harass the great me with wordplay?!\u201d the Heavenly Demon said.\u201cIt seems like you will only be satisfied if I bow my head to you. You\u2019re truly a child who doesn\u2019t know when to stop! Why don\u2019t you be the teacher?! I myself will be your disciple.\u201dOkay. She nibbled.I acted casually like a fisherman.\u201cOh, does that mean you recognize me as a disciple, right? Heavenly Demon-nim? Not an outsider but an inside disciple of the sect. The real, authentic, best disciple.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon was again at a loss for words.One second. Two seconds.After a small pause, her mouth slowly opened.\u201cRefrain from making other sounds. Child. Since I will be teaching you from now on, you must concentrate.\u201dMm-hm.\u2018Just as I thought.\u2019The Heavenly Demon just forced herself to ignore my words. Force comes from stubbornness, and stubbornness comes from sincerity. I could tell where her sincerity stopped.\u2018She really won\u2019t admit that I\u2019m her disciple even if she were to die.\u2019The relationship between an older and younger member of the same sect.The Heavenly Demon had already marked me as a disciple. Nevertheless, adamantly, she never said these words [I shall accept you as the disciple of this master] out loud.Though the Sword Emperor and I bickered often, for the Heavenly Demon, that is, for most martial artists, the connection between a teacher and student was that heavy.\u2018A heavy connection\u2026 can sometimes turn into a terrifying connection.\u2019Therefore, the Demonic Cult woman did not declare me as her disciple.She was hesitating.What kind of person was I? Not only did she see me for the first time in her life, but I was also not from the central area of this Murim world. Could such a child, should such a child, be allowed into her heart?Can she have more hope in her life?So Baek-hyang, the master of the Demonic Cult and the Heavenly Demon, was conflicted, and so she was hesitant.\u201cListen carefully. If you have learned the Sword of Starvation to that level, you are at least entitled to listen and steal the teachings of the sect. But\u2026\u201dAlthough her outer appearance was being unreasonable, inside, it was perfect.\u2018Character window.\u2019The inner mind reflected in my eyes told a completely different story.+Name: So Baek-hyangFavorability: 51Favorite Genre: [Martial Arts]Hated Genres: [Classical], [Mythology], [History], [Fairy Tales]Favorite Characters: [Commoners], [Rival]Hated Characters: [Oppressor], [Deceiver], [Playboy]Favorite Plot: [All-out Match]Hated Plot: [Running Away], [Oblivion], [Meaningless Death]Psychological State: \u2018Is he a disciple? The time to make up my mind is also\u2026 Ah, no. It\u2019s a bad idea! I should be content by facing off with Namgung Un. It is too much to have a disciple now at the end of my life! It is an ugly desire.\u2019+That\u2019s right.I smiled in my heart.\u2018Please consider it more.\u2019The Heavenly Demon\u2019s troubles.They were like a green light for me.\u2018Please be more shaken.\u2019Because I was the one who presented her with a crossroads.Will the Murim Lord and she continue the War of Good and Evil without hope? Or will she take a disciple and take the measures to continue the doctrine of the Demonic Sect to the next generation?Which way would she escape the [meaningless death]?\u2018Please don\u2019t let go of your life like this.\u2019My words were light.They were in vain.Light words could only be responsible for light-hearted people.No, it was like they weren\u2019t taking responsibility at all.\u2018Please live.\u2019How empty those words were.\u2018Even if the world perishes and you are left alone in this world, I still want you to live. I wish you will survive.\u2019No matter how many words I pile up, they didn\u2019t carry any weight.\u2018I want to be your reason to live a little longer.\u2019Useless and vain words.I didn\u2019t say them out loud.I was sure that it was for the same reason that the Heavenly Demon didn\u2019t declare me as her disciple.The lightness of words is bound to be weighed down by the heaviness of one\u2019s actions. That way, it won\u2019t fly away like a whim.But the Heavenly Demon and I both still haven\u2019t tried hard enough to say what we wanted to say.\u300cIt\u2019s not the time to decide yet.\u300dThe Heavenly Demon thought in her heart.\u2018I haven\u2019t come up with a decision yet.\u2019I thought to myself.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon and I faced each other.\u201cChild of the outside world. You don\u2019t look focused. Are you listening to me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI was watching well.\u201cOf course I am focusing. What do you mean?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a joke. I\u2019m serious.\u201d\u201cOf course. I swear to anyone, whether it is the Jade Emperor or King Yeomra the Great.\u201dWe exchanged glances. Unlike her hands, her eyes were conflicted. They do say that the eyes are the windows to the soul.The Heavenly Demon opened her mouth after going back and forth several times.\u201cFine. Seeing that you are overflowing with confidence, you can take the next test right away.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon brushed away the snow and stood up.She started heading somewhere.\u201cDo not follow me. My feet are busy.\u201dSaying so, she left. The Heavenly Demon walked on the snowy field, but there were no footprints left in the snow. Only a thin shadow slid over the icy path. Extreme qigong skill\u2014Traceless Snow Road. The woman was demonstrating what she talked about on the first day after we fell into this world.Suddenly.-I want to fight her.Bae Hu-ryeong said abruptly.-I want to have a match with her, even if it\u2019s just one match. Really.I thoughtlessly turned to face him.\u2018What?\u2019-Did you get salt in your ear? I said I want to have a round with her. A contest.For me, it was the first time I had seen Bae Hu-ryeong look like that.-Fuck. Damn it, shit!The Sword Emperor was truly angry.-Know this, Zombie! In the Murim world where I was born, the Demonic Sect was extremely weak! The only use for those Demonic henchmen was to hit them! There was a guy who called himself the Heavenly Demon, but I planted his asshole in the ground and changed his nameplate to the Earthly Demon! Fuck! I challenged and changed the names of hundreds of so-called strong warriors. Agh! Really!Something was different.His current expression didn\u2019t resemble anything like the times when he lost a bet to me.Then, he writhed around, saying that he was angry\u2026 But the expression Bae Hu-ryeong was making right now was\u2014-I\u2019m really jealous of that Murim Lord bastard who was born here!\u2014It was much more intense.-What if it was me, huh? We\u2019d have a fight with our lives on the line! We\u2019d say, oh, will this be your death or mine? After that, we\u2019d climb up a snow peak and have a bowl of rice wine! Chewing on a segment of a tangerine, it\u2019d be satisfying! That\u2019s the perfect meaning that all warriors search for!Wanting to win. The spirit of victory. Fighting spirit.His face became as fresh as raw meat.-Ah, really! If only I wasn\u2019t a ghost!\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI silently kept my mouth shut.Without meaning to, I had also begun to worry. My head still down, I put my chin on my hand. My head was filled with thoughts, so I needed to support it with my hands.-Huh? Zombie. You look like a zombie that\u2019s wondering why nobody is calling them a zombie. You\u2019re sulking because I called you a crow-tit, huh. Hey, should I just call you a zom-tit?\u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s it.\u201d-Huh?\u201cI\u2019m saying that\u2019s it.\u201dI quickly raised my head.\u201cSay the boss makes a cure for the infection. Say that I\u2019m recognized as an official disciple of the Heavenly Demon. That\u2019s good. Everything is good, but\u2026 I felt that alone won\u2019t be enough. Can we call it a finale? But you just gave me the cherry on top.\u201d-Uh\u2026\u201cNice play. Good job, Sword Emperor.\u201dI laughed.For some reason, the Sword Emperor looked at me and stepped back.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d-Nothing\u2026 Just\u2026 Every time you put on that expression, it\u2019s like an ill omen for me. Should I say that it\u2019s unlucky? Because something will stain my face and stature.\u201cBut I respect Sword Emperor-nim so much, from the bottom of my heart. You know that, right?\u201d-Thank you. Are you trying to make me throw up on your face?\u201cHmm.\u201dI put my hands behind my back and stared at the faraway sky.\u201cThere was an unpaid debt between us.\u201d-\u2026\u2026.Bae Hu-ryeong hesitated.-\u2026Debt? What debt? I am a human being who has never lived in debt my entire life. Oi, this Gong-ja kid is trying to trick me with his gob again. Don\u2019t do that. Uh-huh! You\u2019ll get hurt like that!\u201c[Let\u2019s bet how many times I\u2019ll die when climbing up to the 19th floor].\u201d-\u2026\u2026.\u201cOur Sword Emperor-nim bet that I would die less than 100 times. I bet that I\u2019d die less than 99 times.\u201d-No\u2026\u201cRight?\u201dMy smile became a little kinder.-No, that was already a long time ago\u2026\u201cIf my memory is correct, then regarding this bet, the conclusion clearly ended with number 97?\u201d-\u2026\u2026.\u201cIf my calculations aren\u2019t off, 97 is less than 99. Right?\u201d-\u2026\u2026.\u201cSword Emperor-nim.\u201d-Why do you keep doing this to me\u2026?\u201cPlease listen to one request.\u201dBae Hu-ryeong looked as if he would cry.-Fine, you evil bastard. Beat me up or kill me yourself\u2026It was a complete surrender.2.The Heavenly Demon came back.She had left alone when she crossed the snowfield, but not when she returned. She carried a zombie on her back. Like the Hadouken zombie, this zombie wore a black uniform.\u201cIn our sect, there is a group of elite members called the Bloody Ghosts. It is the best combat unit made by collecting only the greatest swordsmen and lancers. They are people who exist only to fulfill my orders.\u201dIn other words, it was my second opponent.I readied my stance with the Holy Sword.\u201cThe last time it was a promising master, and this time, it\u2019s someone from an actual combat unit? The difficulty level is jumping higher.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I took care to bring a child that would suit your level.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon probably did go looking for [the perfect opponent for me]. She must have searched the snowfield. Going through hundreds of zombies, one by one.It was a thoughtful consideration.It was a heartfelt gesture.I gratefully accepted this as a kind of compliment.\u201cWhat you have to demonstrate is no different than from this morning. Fight the Jiangshi\u2026\u201d\u201cWith only thirst in my heart. Only the pain of thirst should be in that place.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon smiled.\u201cThat\u2019s right. No emotions or thoughts other than thirst are allowed in your psyche!\u201cAll right!\u201dI dashed forward, excited.\u201cI\u2019ll show you something amazing aga\u2014\u201d[You have died.][You are regressing to 24 hours ago.]\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculously strong! Damn it!\u201dI did show something.The fastest death scene in the universe.Aaagh.\u201cAlchemist. Medicine King. The research for the zombie virus treatment should proceed like this\u2026\u201d\u201cOh my god! It\u2019s just like my research! No, it\u2019s like my research was organized and arranged like a bouquet commissioned by an aristocrat. A-and it feels like it\u2019s been put in a formal dress like an earl!\u201d\u201cWhat is this? Death King or whoever you are, are you also from Silicon Valley? This is exactly the way I\u2019d arrange things\u2026\u201dFirst of all, we had to update the findings of the treatment research as we did every time.\u201cHundred Ghosts Reincarnation!\u201dThis time, I decided to shut myself in on top of a snowy mountain to do some closed training.Like last time, I ordered the demon and the skeletons to collect more deaths. Although it was different in that I told them to find corpses that died of thirst rather than hunger, the order was not very different.\u201cScatter. Scatter and gather thirsty corpses.\u201d\u201cYes, milord. As you command.\u201dHowever.\u201cI have one more thing to ask of you.\u201dThis is where it began to deviate from the last time.The demon tilted her head.\u201cIf it\u2019s an order\u2026\u201d\u201cThere will be Jiangshi that use martial arts in the vicinity that are alone.\u201dI wasn\u2019t referring to the \u2018forest of corpses\u2019 that we saw as soon as we fell into this world. During the last 3 years. The Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord fought their battles, and they lost bodies\u2014Jiangshi\u2014one by one during the war.When the blizzard blew for days without a break. When the day didn\u2019t come because the night was getting longer. At that time, the power of the Demonic Cult and the Righteous Sect gradually walked away and disappeared.These \u2018missing people\u2019 were the ones I was talking about right now.\u201cFind them,\u201dI said.\u201cFind the Demonic Cult members in their black uniforms. Find the chivalrous fighters in their white uniforms. Whether it\u2019s a hundred or three hundred li away, you must release the skeletons and find them\u2026 No. Make a map and put a mark wherever the Jiangshi are located.\u201dThe demon looked puzzled.\u201cWhat are you trying to save those lives for, milord\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a dying world, but there are two people who are still at war. They want the right conclusion to their fight and the world. Unfortunately, however I look at it, it\u2019s just a sad game of pretend to me.\u201dI looked up at the night sky.The moon was out.\u201cThey want to see a good conclusion, so I\u2019ll prepare for a real war.\u201d\u201cA real war?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dI smiled, the expression slipping out of me by itself.I felt like Santa preparing a Christmas present.\u201cI will prepare for a proper war between good and evil.\u201d~~~[TN] Hello, this is thursdays again!

    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76.========================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha QC: LightBrin3.When I first tried to learn the Sword of Starvation.\u300cWhat?\u300dThe Heavenly Demon was disappointed.\u300cYou mean that the longest you\u2019ve ever starved was for only three days?\u300dShe didn\u2019t notice my efforts. She gave up on me. She felt resigned. She only looked at me swing my sword for a little while. Then, she easily turned around and left.\u300cI see that this isn\u2019t getting through to you.\u300d\u300cHow can you awaken the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art if you don\u2019t even know this?\u300dThe Heavenly Demon tried to make me give up on my own.Because there was nothing she expected from this world anymore. Because she felt there shouldn\u2019t be.\u300cIt\u2019s fine.\u300d\u300cThis was my fault.\u300dThat\u2019s what happened when I was learning \u2018hunger.\u2019But when I started to learn \u2018thirst,\u2019 her attitude changed completely.4.\u201cYour sword is too simple,\u201d said the Heavenly Demon as she watched me fight the Jiangshi.I felt that the way her eyes looked at me was gradually changing. Sometimes I fumbled with my sword, and even though the Heavenly Demon frowned, she didn\u2019t turn her back on me. Rather, she gave me advice.\u201cI can\u2019t find a skillful use of it in your sword. There is no application. It\u2019s honest and upright, but it\u2019s just as vulnerable.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon was beginning to place her hopes on me as a human.\u201cIt\u2019s like your sword is not fighting against humans, but against the world. It is not a sword of our school, but a sword of the Righteous Sect. It\u2019s rather unexpected.\u201dAt first, I was also killed in a single blow by a martial-arts-knowing zombie.But as time passed, I was able to easily deal with the martial arts practitioner zombies. It was natural. Because every night, I was killed by the Jiangshi that the demon brought to me.The more I went through the trauma of the corpses who died of thirst, the stronger my sword became.\u201cI shall teach you the core of our simgyeol.\u201dWhen my sword became somewhat stronger, the Heavenly Demon finally began to teach me.\u201cSimgyeol? What\u2019s that?\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s a trade secret, the key to our methods. I see that it\u2019s not easy to talk to a child of the outside world.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon hemmed and cleared her throat.\u201cThink of the time when you learned the Sword of Starvation. What did you think of when you swung your sword?\u201d\u201cI thought of starvation.\u201d\u201cOf course you did. But it\u2019s not just that. You may not have realized it, but you\u2019ve already penetrated the essence of the demonic arts.\u201dThe essence of the demonic arts.\u201cI shall tell you what that is from now on.\u201dWe sat face to face in the snowfield.\u201cNow. Think of an [apple].\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s an apple\u2026 Like, an apple you can eat?\u201d[1]\u201cAn apple to eat.\u201dI imagined one apple as I was told.\u201cAre you thinking about it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow does the apple feel?\u201cWhat?\u201dThe Heavenly Demon\u2019s question was weird. How does the apple feel? I didn\u2019t really have an apple in my hand. How could I tell how it felt?I was puzzled. The Heavenly Demon looked closely at my face.\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cIf I force it, I can probably imagine\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine. If you don\u2019t know, say you don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cAh yes. I have no idea.\u201d\u201cHmm. Hm.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon smiled. The woman seemed to be rejoicing.\u201cYou\u2019re honest. Good! Now, think of [hunger].\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI thought.I thought of the pickax that the farmer relentlessly struck into the dry land. I remembered the gesture of him hitting his child. The children dug up the soft soil along the river and made togwa.\u201cDid you think of it?\u201d the Heavenly Demon whispered.\u201cYes. I recalled it.\u201d\u201cHow does the hunger feel?\u201dThe crackling dirt in my teeth as I ate the mud cookies. The flavor. The crunchy texture.\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s very dry.\u201d\u201cWhat is the scent of hunger?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the smell of soil.\u201d\u201cOho. What kind of soil is it? There are many types of soil. There is a separate soil for farming and a separate soil for making pottery. There is black soil and red soil. I\u2019m curious. What is the soil of hunger?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s mud,\u201d I said with my eyes closed. \u201cBut you can\u2019t just scoop any old mud. It has to be mud with little gravel and no sand.\u201d\u201cI see. I understand. How does hunger taste?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cChild.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon\u2019s voice softened.\u201cI asked what the taste of hunger was. Why haven\u2019t you answered right away?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Because it\u2019s sad,\u201d I said. \u201cThe kids dry the mud cookies in the sun. While they\u2019re drying up in the sun, there is nothing to do, so the kids stay by the mud. Waiting for the mud to dry\u2026\u201d\u201cThey are the children waiting for the sunlight.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cHunger is children waiting for the sun.\u201dThat\u2019s right. That was what happened.\u201cChild. That is your poem.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon\u2019s voice fell like the austere snow.\u201cWhen I asked you to describe the touch of an apple, you replied that you do not know. But when I asked you about hunger? You felt the mud. You could smell the mud. You chewed the mud and ate it! You have seen the flowing river, and you must have overheard the sounds of the river.\u201dAn old man\u2019s last voyage. The wooden boat. The night sky.A loner who tried not to cause trouble for the world but eventually became a nuisance nonetheless.\u201cAn apple has a form, but there is no hunger. An apple can be tasted, but it is void of hunger. But you talk well about hunger! Hunger for you is mud, sunlight, river water, and children.\u201d\u201cChild! That right there is your talent,\u201d the Heavenly Demon said. \u201cNow open your eyes.\u201dI opened them.The Heavenly Demon was moving her hands while sitting.\u201cThe reason you don\u2019t know the texture of an apple is simple. Because it did not stimulate your [memory].\u201dMy memory.\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever eaten an apple, you will know.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon moved her hand with a smile.In a moment, I was able to recognize it.The Heavenly Demon was pretending to cut an apple in half.\u201cApples have soft skin. It\u2019s shiny, but it\u2019s also a little bumpy. I myself usually like to eat apples with the skin, but it will be different for a child with a cold. I would cut it in half\u2026\u201dIt really seemed like an apple was in her hand.\u201cCarve it out with a spoon. Feed the apple scraped off with a spoon to the sick child.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHave you ever eaten scraped apples as a child?\u201dI had.I remembered a teacher at the orphanage doing that. The teacher made me lie down because I had a cold and fed me an apple scraped out with a spoon.\u201cWhat is the texture of the scraped apple?\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s a little grainy.\u201d\u201cCorrect! The originally crunchy apple has already been chewed on by the spoon, and it becomes grainy. But is that all? Has it become tasteless?\u201d\u201cNo. The yellow juice is filling up my mouth.\u201d\u201cYes! And is that all? If you scrape the peel, too, the remaining apple peel becomes ridiculously wrinkled. The hand of the mother who dug the apple for you also becomes yellow from the juice of the apple. But then, say, child. What among these feelings is the feeling of the apple?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI was stuck in my own thoughts.The Heavenly Demon asked me as if trying to make me hurry,\u201cIs it an apple as a whole? Is it an apple cut in half? Is it the scraped juice of a spoon? Is it the peel? Is it the mother\u2019s hand? What is your apple?\u201dWhat is my apple?\u201cI saw a mother who only ate the peel after giving all the flesh of the apple to her child.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cTo me, an apple is the leftover peels for the mother. It is a child with a cold. It is the mother\u2019s heart that has been sharpened one spoonful at a time.\u201dFor some reason, my heart became warm.Even though we were sitting in the middle of a snowy field.Maybe it was because the Heavenly Demon had smiled.\u201c\u2014And I also think of those young children whose mothers never carved an apple for them.\u201dBut the Heavenly Demon\u2019s smile did not last long.\u201cI think of a mother who cannot buy apples. I think a mother who would not buy one even though she has the means. I think of a child who has no one to care for him even though he is lying on his back. I think of a child who died because he could not be cared for.\u201dHer anger manifested in a poisonous gas.The Heavenly Demon\u2019s black eyes somehow looked even darker.\u201cThere is nowhere in this world that has not been touched by human memories, and thus, there is no place in this world without resentment!\u201dI felt sick.\u201cThere is no form in hunger. There is no taste. There is no scent. Wrong! Hunger is mud, a river, and a child. Even a single apple is hunger. Child! As you use mud for hunger, do so for thirst!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cFeel the pain of the thirst in your throat! Sense it. Fill yourself with its taste. Smell its scent. Eat it. Touch it. The demonic arts are memories! Memory is also a sense. This is the key to our sect\u2019s methods! The feeling of scooping out mud, the feeling that you capture in your hand, is your hunger, your Infernal Heavens Demonic Art!\u201dThe back of my neck was cold.Cool electricity flowed through my body.\u201cIf some folks have suffered unfair things, that\u2019s all. They can\u2019t speak. They can\u2019t let go. Unable to express themselves, the resentment continues to accumulate in the mind, and eventually, it solidifies into bitterness. However, the warriors of our Demonic Cult are different!\u201dThe Heavenly Demon looked at me.\u201cWe swing our swords!\u201dI grabbed the grip of the sword without thinking.\u201cAs a geisha sings and a scholar recites a poem, we swing our swords. What is the difference between a ruffian from a band of thieves and a warrior from our sect? They are swung by the sword. But we swing the sword! It\u2019s just that, and that difference is everything.\u201dMy training began.\u201cIf you just live, taking what you\u2019re given, how can you call that a life? That is death! Can you call a sword that swings you as you swing it a sword? It is a beast. Do you want to die? Do you want to become a beast?\u201cNo!\u201dI bit my molars firmly.\u201cI am a living human!\u201d\u201cIf so, become thirsty. Become thirsty as you did when you hungered!\u201dI had gathered 112 people who had died of starvation.Among them was a child who ate mud cookies.I bit a grain of dirt in my mouth.Suffering.Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.First form.Sword of Starvation.\u201cYou have found the mud of hunger. Now you will have to find something of thirst. For you, hunger was the children waiting for the sun. What is thirst for you?!\u201dI gathered 48 people who died of thirst.Among them, there was an old woman who drank seawater and kept drinking.Her innards were pickled in saltwater.Suffering.Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.Second form.Sword of Thirst.\u201cFor you, hunger was mud and thirst was the sea. But is thirst the only pain the sea brings about? There is also the pain of drowning in the seawater. There is the pain of drowning in the river. Child, what is water to you?\u201dI gathered 37 people who died from drowning.Among them was a father who gave his child his last breath.As he sank into the water, he shared his breath with his mouth.Suffering.Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.Third form.Sword of the Drowned.\u201cHunger is dirt. Thirst is a wave. For you, choking is a father\u2019s last breath! The land, the sea, and the air are already yours. Child of the outside world! What is winter for you?\u201dI gathered 96 people who died of the cold.Among them, there was a newborn child who was stuck to the body of an already dead mother, up until the very end.He held onto the body tightly until he froze.Suffering.Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.Fourth form.Sword of Freezing.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe dawn passed. The morning passed. Midday passed.While the world passed through a day, I had experienced 293 deaths.\u201cChild. Your sword\u2026\u201dThe Heavenly Demon slowly opened her lips.\u201cReally, it\u2019s ever-changing.\u201dThe way the Heavenly Demon looked at me had also changed.\u201cPeople have different tendencies. Martial arts comes out of the different tendencies in one\u2019s life. These habits that cannot be fixed. The Infernal Heavens Demonic Art is especially like that, but you\u2026 You are diverse. You\u2019re rich in different tendencies.\u201d\u201cAh. I often hear that I have a variety of styles.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Was that nonsense?\u201d\u201cNo. It was bullshit.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking a little bit seriously.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, it was a pile of bullshit.\u201dWas that so? Was it a pile of bullshit\u2014?If it\u2019s a pile of bullshit, I can\u2019t help it\u2014.\u201cIt is difficult for humans to know all the pain in the world. And even if they know it, to endure all the pain to its limits\u2026 It\u2019s very hard. But as I watch you learn the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art, it\u2019s\u2026Hm?\u201dThe Heavenly Demon furrowed her eyebrows. She turned her head.\u201c\u2026Someone is coming.\u201dSomeone was approaching from the direction of her gaze. It was still broad daylight, so it couldn\u2019t have been a zombie, and because it was a world that had already been destroyed, it couldn\u2019t be an unwelcome visitor. It was the Murim Lord and the Venomous Snake. The Venomous Snake was carrying the Murim Lord over the snowfield.\u201cHm.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon\u2019s nose twitched.\u201cWhat\u2019s this old dotard here for? In that pathetic way, no less? Ha. Did you finally accept that you\u2019re just an old fogey?\u201d\u201cShut up,\u201d the Murim Lord said while on the back of the Venomous Snake. \u201cI came because I was worried about you. Hmph!\u201d\u201cWorry? You were worried? Even a Jiangshi passing by would laugh. You\u2019re weaker than me, old fool, so don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the position to worry about\u2026\u201d\u201cMadu. You haven\u2019t even done the Ceremony of Nine Salutes yet, huh?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHaa. It\u2019s obvious, obvious! I knew you would be like this.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon closed her mouth tightly.In my mind, I was tilting my head confusedly.\u2018What is the Ceremony of Nine Salutes?\u2019-It\u2019s the ceremony used in formalizing a relationship between a master and disciple.Bae Hu-ryeong said.-The specifics are slightly different for each sect. There are places where you perform a deep bow 9 times and there are places where you bow only 3 times\u2026 I don\u2019t know how it is in the Demonic Cult. It\u2019s a secret and sacred ceremony.\u2018How was it at your sect?\u2019-Well, if you endure after being hit by the teacher 9 times, that was the Ceremony of Nine Salutes for us. I endured up to my 63rd hit, so it was the longest record in my sect\u2019s history. Isn\u2019t that awesome?I realized why Bae Hu-ryeong was such a crazy guy.His Righteous Sect just made a bunch of madmen.\u201c\u2026Shut up. I myself will decide who to accept as disciples and when,\u201d the Heavenly Demon said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter for you to interfere in.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re just talking vainly now. Of course I have to interfere!\u201dThe Murim Lord came down from the Venomous Snake\u2019s back with a thump. The old man stared at the Heavenly Demon fiercely.\u201cBecause the reason you don\u2019t take in disciples is that you feel sorry for me!\u201d\u201cHuuuh? What are you saying\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just the two of us left. You are the only one on the path of evil, and I am the only one on the path of righteousness. If you alone take in a disciple, the only young people will be in the Demonic Cult. So what is the conclusion? It\u2019s like you\u2019re winning the war between good and evil without even fighting!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou and I have agreed to end this ourselves. We swore. Because you feel bad about breaking our oath and you feel sorry for me, you\u2019re not accepting that young child as your disciple!\u201dHuh.\u2018\u2026I guess that\u2019s right. It could also be that sort of reason.\u2019They\u2019re in the same situation, but it would be weird if only one of them had a disciple.Looking at the feelings of the Heavenly Demons, it seemed that she did feel sorry for the Murim Lord.But.\u201cTsk, tsk. There\u2019s no need to be so uselessly loyal!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI thought you would do this, so I took the initiative.\u201dThe Murim Lord tapped the Venomous Snake on the shoulder.The Venomous Snake scratched his cheek with a bitter smile.\u201cWell. It ended up like this.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cO, old man\u2026 You couldn\u2019t possibly have, that kid\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! I made him my top disciple today!\u201d\u201cYou bastard, you think it\u2019s all right to do this to my great self?!\u201dThe Heavenly Demon rushed at him. Boom, boom! Two masters rolled around in the snow in a dogfight.\u201cDo you know what kind of heart I had, not going forth with the ceremony today?! But this old man ignored the young, devoted heart of my great self as if it was nothing\u2026!\u201d\u201cShuddup! If fate comes to find you, thank your departed parents in heaven and accept it! A person can\u2019t just ignore it because they\u2019re being too conscious of others!\u201d\u201cWhat about the Great Battle of Good and Evil?!\u201d\u201cDoes it have to be just the two of us for it to be the battle? If our disciples fight, it can also be considered as the great battle!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t accept it unless you\u2019re my opponent!\u201d\u201cFor a demon lord, you sure have some idiotic thoughts!\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?!\u201dThe woman grabbed the old man\u2019s neck.The old man, unwilling to lose, grabbed the woman\u2019s head and glared.\u201cAgh, you demon! You\u2019re always like this. If it\u2019s not one thing, it\u2019s the other. You rockhead! You think the world will split apart just because we split our positions?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what sort of world you see, but the landscape I see is ice! Anyway, it will split if you split it!\u201d\u201cThen melt it!\u201d\u201cThere is a fire called the Demonic path that will melt it! And the demonic cult members are the firewood!\u201d\u201cThen get one more log for the fire!\u201d\u201cAx saint, you\u2026! You hypocrite of the Righteous Path, you\u2019re just grabbing the ends of my words to fight me\u2026!\u201dThere was such an argument between the old man and the woman. Whenever the two traded blows, two different worlds clashed with each other with the sound of metal. Worlds were able to establish themselves even in this endless dog fight.Leaving the two worlds to fight, I looked at the Venomous Snake.\u201cIt\u2019s a little surprising.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dHow did someone like you, with your true self, take someone as a teacher? \u2014was not something that I could say to him right away.So I beat around the bush a little.\u201cAren\u2019t you the Chen Mu-mun master? Is it okay for the guildmaster to receive tutelage from a new teacher?\u201d\u201cFuck. If you have a place to do a sword dance, you do the sword dance, and if you have a teacher to learn from, you ask to learn. I can\u2019t just sit back for each of these things, picking at \u2018why\u2019.\u201dThe Venomous Snake smiled. The thick lines of his face held a manly kind of smile.Huh.\u201cVenomous Snake-nim.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you clearly. Being pushed into this position by force or by mere pity. You\u2019ll regret it if you were to be a disciple of the Murim Lord with such a half-hearted resolution.\u201dThe two worlds were still fighting loudly.It was different from the time that the Venomous Snake was pushed into the Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon by his pride and his followers.This was an insult to those two worlds.I couldn\u2019t forgive it.\u201c\u2026I really don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201dThe Venomous Snake scratched his cheek, then sharply raised his single eye.\u201cHey, why is the guy called the Death King rambling about this so much? If you want to confirm something, confirm it with your sword.\u201dWith that, the Venomous Snake raised his sword.\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy, though.\u201dBut there was an easy way to check. It would become apparent if I opened up the Venomous Snake\u2019s psychological status window.But instead of doing that, I said quietly, \u201cVenomous Snake-nim.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cHave you ever been hungry?\u201dThe Venomous Snake blinked.\u201cWhat?\u201dAt that moment, I ran forward.~~~[1] Apple: Gongja may be confused because the word for apple (\uc0ac\uacfc) is a homonym for the word for apology.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77.========================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha QC: LightBrin5.I rushed at him.I raised my sword.I stabbed and cut.Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.First form.Sword of Starvation.My body became that of a hungry farmer. My sword became a pickax. Struck by my blade, the air crumbled like dried mud.At the end of the smashed, shattered, and broken void was the head of the Venomous Snake.\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dThe Venomous Snake flinched. His gaze was stained with shock. The Venomous Snake\u2019s shoulder was about to move, but it stopped, and in the next moment, his hips moved. He had given up on a counterattack and was now trying to dodge.But there was no way that a farmer\u2019s pickax would not strike the land.My sword dug into the void. The Venomous Snake pulled himself back. The void sucked in his body\u2019s worth of air, breaking the atmosphere.Bang!The snow whirled around with the sound of the air cracking and bursting. It was winter. Every time the wind blew, the snow did too, and the air that scratched one\u2019s nostrils was extremely dry.\u201c\u2014Fuck.\u201dThe Venomous Snake raised his sword. Between the flurries of snow, the Venomous Snake\u2019s eye flashed. There was a shock in the lone eye of the Chen Mu-mun master.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dI rushed at him.Once again, I raised my sword.I stabbed and cut.\u201cHo\u2014\u201d The Venomous Snake again jumped back instead of blocking my sword. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d And with an explosive bang, ice pellets rose in the air. \u201cFuckin\u2014\u201d Whenever I cut, the Venomous Snake escaped. He had no choice but to avoid it. \u201cSon of a gun!\u201d A whirlwind burst in his place.\u201cMotherfucker!\u201dAs I ran at him again, I stopped.To be precise, my body came to a stop abruptly.I wasn\u2019t breathing. I hadn\u2019t realized it.\u201cHuff.\u201d As I inhaled, dry air hit my throat. There was a tornado raging in my lungs.\u201cHooo.\u201d I felt as if my intestines had flipped over.\u201cHaaah.\u201d Every time I breathed, my body hurt and I trembled.But I did not let go of my sword.One round.The battle was over in one round.\u201cInfection\u2026 it was obvious that you would get it\u2026\u201dThe Venomous Snake stared at me in a cold sweat.\u201cDeath King, I thought you were just talking shit\u2026 But your sword skills are also quite good. Fuck. Really, what the hell? These blows can be summed up as a [Petty Demonic Sword]!\u201d\u201cYes, disciple! That indeed is a sword where you can feel the force of the devil that freezes and shatters the world. It is the [Eternal Demon Sword]!\u201d cried the Murim Lord, who was grappling with the Heavenly Demon.There must be an insurmountable, 4th-dimensional wall that could not be crossed between the [Petty Demonic Sword] that the Venomous Snake said and the [Eternal Demon Sword] that the Murim Lord was talking about, but that wall could not be noticed unless one was a mind reader.[1]The Heavenly Demon also did not realize that the wall was there. She clicked her tongue.\u201cYou\u2019re pretty sharp for a guy with only one eye.\u201d\u201cOf course! It\u2019s unfortunate that he\u2019s a little old, but he has a \u2018true\u2019 eye that sees the essence of things. Otherwise, would this Ax Saint accept him as a disciple?\u201d the Murim Lord shouted, glancing at me.\u201cHmm. You\u2019ve also gotten a better disciple than you could have expected. It hasn\u2019t been long since he\u2019s been yours, and he\u2019s already using a terrifying demonic sword like that, haha. The Demon Lord\u2019s little seed is scary enough to surpass even the Four Demon Lords!\u201d\u201cI told you, I still haven\u2019t accepted him as a disciple\u2026\u201d\u201cConfound it! Are you still saying that sort of stuff?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon shut her mouth.\u2018That\u2019s right,\u2019 I thought, breathing wildly. \u2018This isn\u2019t a fight for me to beat the Venomous Snake, nor a fight for the Venomous Snake to beat me.\u2019The purpose of this match was\u2014\u2018To make the Heavenly Demon accept me.\u2019In this respect, the Murim Lord and I had the same purpose.We were both trying to give the Heavenly Demon, who was just waiting for destruction, a future.The Murim Lord grinned.\u201cDisciple!\u201d\u201cYes, Master!\u201dThe Murim Lord shouted at the Venomous Snake, who answered with good spirit.\u201cFrom now on, I\u2019ll give you some advice! Make sure you listen!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dThe Heavenly Demon\u2019s jaw dropped.\u201cO, old man! What are you doing now?!\u201d\u201cWhy? Do you have a problem? Didn\u2019t you say you weren\u2019t teaching that greenhorn demon?\u201d\u201cTh, that\u2019s true, but\u2026 I mean, you\u2019re giving advice during their competition! It\u2019s rude for someone to give a hand when playing baduk, but it\u2019s even more so when two martial artists are competing!\u201d[2]\u201cThese two are martial artists?\u201dThe Murim Lord laughed and stroked his beard.\u201cIn my eyes, I can only see the proud successor of the Righteous path and the newbie Demonic cultist. Since it\u2019s a young demon, it\u2019s okay no matter how we defeat him. So, there\u2019s no problem.\u201d\u201cThe more I see this old man, he really\u2026!\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201dThe Murim Lord shouted energetically,\u201cDisciple! That newbie demonic cultist, his blows may be pretty hard, but don\u2019t think he can keep up this momentum! Never get hit and keep avoiding it. Dodge, and wait for his strength to fall!\u201d\u201cOi oi, Master! It\u2019s true!\u201d The Venomous Snake grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve figured out that much a long time ago! Do you have any more practical advice?\u201d\u201cHey. Why is your disciple talking like that?!\u201d The Heavenly Demon ground her teeth. It was a face bursting with heat in various ways. \u201cIs that really the dignity of the last disciple of the Righteous Sect?\u201d\u201cOho. This demon\u2019s got a problem with the way he talks? Then, do you expect children from the outside world to talk the same way as we do? Or why not? Your disciple\u2026 Oh, you said he wasn\u2019t your disciple yet. Anyway, are you worried that the noob demon will be crushed by my student who speaks that way?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cDisciple! Use the Butterfly Sword and the Precept of Life and Death! You\u2019ll beat him in one round!\u201dThe Venomous Snake\u2019s thick eyebrows wriggled.Below it, in his one eye, there was a deep realization.\u201cSure. Is it the [Butterfly Sword] and the [Precept of Life and Death]?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! I\u2019d like you to also add the tricks of your everyday martial arts, but is it possible?\u201d\u201cFuck, of course it is possible! Master. I\u2019m the Venomous Snake, guildmaster of Chen Mu-mun!\u201dThe Venomous Snake blew his nose and gripped his sword with vigor.Meanwhile, I was finally able to control my breathing again.As I fixed my posture, the Venomous Snake whispered to me, \u201cDeath King.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou asked me if I had ever starved?\u201d\u201cI did. Venomous Snake-nim.\u201d\u201cIs that your martial arts?\u201dHis question was as sharp as a glance from his single eye.I replied evenly, \u201cIt\u2019s the imagery from the previous blow.\u201d\u201cI thought so.\u201dThe Venomous Snake smirked. Then, he turned his head and smiled.\u201cI\u2019ll ask it another way, Death King. What do you think is martial arts?\u201dThe leader of the Chen Mu-mun asked about martial arts.It was the same as the Heretic Questioner discussing God, the same as Sword Saint discussing the sword, and the distant future master of the Alchemy Castle discussing medicine, so it was something that I had to listen to properly.I would have done the same. If I didn\u2019t meet the Sword Emperor, didn\u2019t learn demonic arts from the Heavenly Demon, and above all, before I read the psychological state of the Sword Emperor.\u201cI\u2019ll answer it for you!\u201dThe Venomous Snake lowered his stance and raised his sword.Like a venomous viper ready to strike.\u201cLift your feet! Swing your arms! Make a fist!\u201dThen, he moved.No\u2014he flowed.It was as if the Venomous Snake himself had become liquid. Like water flowing from a high spot to a low spot, he flowed smoothly and gently. Right in front of me.He flowed like that, and in the next moment, bang\u2026!\u201cMartial arts means\u2014\u201dI barely blocked the blade that soared up from the bottom to the top.Immediately, the Venomous Snake twisted the blade. The blade ran up against my blade, creating sparks as it did. The Venomous Snake straightened his sword like that. As if piercing the sky, he stood upright and slightly bent his wrist. He tilted.Then, he yelled.\u201cYou beat up the little shit in front of you!\u201dThe strikes poured down like rain.\u201cThat\u2019s all! You little shit!\u201dA shower of blades rained on me.\u201cDamn it,\u201d Bang! As soon as I blocked it, \u201cAh,\u201d bang! The next blow went, \u201cOh!\u201d The next blow again, \u201cDamn,\u201d and the abruptly falling blade chewed down on my sword and bit it. In that instant, he widened the opening I had made. \u201cAch,\u201d then, swish\u2026! The burrowing blade scratched my cheek.\u201cThis\u2026!\u201dBlood spilled. I narrowly took a few steps back. But\u2014\u201cI won\u2019t miss!\u201dThe Venomous Snake literally followed me, curling up like a serpent.Again, a slash from the bottom to the top.\u201cAgh.\u201dAs soon as I blocked it, he rose and showered down more blows upon me.\u201cDamn it.\u201dDamn. He was definitely strong.He wasn\u2019t ranked highly among hunters for nothing. This Venomous Snake!\u201cOi oi, Death King! Is that all you have to show after drawing the first blood?\u201dThe Venomous Snake snorted.The burning feeling inside me burst out not from my mouth, but from someone else\u2019s.\u201cDamn it..!\u201dIt was the Heavenly Demon.\u201cYou!\u201dShe bitterly yelled at me.\u201cWhat are you doing? It\u2019s a shower! It\u2019s water! Doesn\u2019t that sword form resemble rainwater?\u201dThe Heavenly Demon, who had been provoked by the Murim Lord, finally couldn\u2019t keep it in any longer. The woman shouted at me with her fists clenched.\u201cWhat are you so afraid of? Receive it and drink!\u201dThe Heavenly Demon was acknowledging this match.She was acknowledging that it was between me, who had become the successor to the Demonic Cult, and the Venomous Snake, who had become the successor to the Righteous Sect. She was accepting the fight between the two of us. This was a confrontation between the Demonic Cult and the Righteous Sect, and we were both accepted as the \u2018proxies\u2019 of the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord.\u201cHa.\u201dI laughed.\u201cUnderstood!\u201dI lifted my stance while holding the sword in reverse.Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.Second form.Sword of Thirst.I blocked the pouring attacks of the Venomous Snake before it could start pouring. Then, as if I was drinking it upside down, I dragged it to my desired path. It spilled.It spilled to the ground.\u201cOh.\u201dThe Venomous Snake who had wasted a turn.And I, who had made him waste the turn.At the moment when our eyes crossed, the voices of the old man and the woman also crossed.\u201cDisciple! Use the Rotten Leaf Earth Technique! It\u2019s become wet soil\u2026\u201d\u201cHa! Then make it into a puddle!\u201dThe Venomous Snake crouched and took a defensive posture as I simultaneously twisted my sword.Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.Third form.Sword of the Drowned.Very slightly, at an angle.When it\u2019s nearly horizontal, bang! Attack, bang! Make it fly, bang! Matching the Venomous Snake\u2019s breath, bang! When he blinks, bang! With that.For the finale, in reverse,Oof, bang\u2026!!\u201cFuck\u2026!\u201dThe Venomous Snake ground his teeth as his flank was cut.The Murim Lord shouted,\u201cIt\u2019s strong! Fall back!\u201d\u201cFollow!\u201dthe Heavenly Demon yelled.The Venomous Snake retreated, following the Murim Lord\u2019s orders, and I advanced, following the voice of the Heavenly Demon.Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.Fourth form.Sword of Freezing.\u201cAaagh, you!\u201dThe Venomous Snake was angered.\u201cYou\u2019re a sucker for a fight, really!\u201d\u201cVenomous Snake-nim is also tough!\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019re really a sucker! Were you a lollipop in a previous life, Death King? How does it stick together like this?\u201d[3]\u201cThen was Venomous Snake-nim a dog in your previous life?\u201dAs we wondered about each other\u2019s past lives, the Venomous Snake and I clashed swords. A large amount of snow soared as the winter wind raged.The field became more heated, though.\u201cBreak off at a good point, disciple!\u201d\u201cHit him properly!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t block it! Avoid it, even if you have to use the Running Wave! After that, use the Aged Earth Counterstrike\u2026\u201d\u201cChild! You can\u2019t stop, either! Avoid it!\u201dThere were scars on our skins.They were increasing in number.Blood splattered, flesh flew away.Both the Venomous Snake and I had become caked in blood at some point. The open wounds were buried in the cold wind and quickly hardened into scars.\u201cOho, Madu, you bitch! Aren\u2019t you the one interfering in their match, now?\u201dThe Murim Lord was scolding her, but he was still laughing.\u201cYou\u2019re an old man with only sly serpents in your mind\u2026\u201dThe Heavenly Demon was telling him off, but she was laughing.Whenever the two laughs intersected, the Venomous Snake\u2019s sword clashed with mine.Neither I nor the Venomous Snake intended to kill each other. There was no intention to kill even in the war between the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord. Therefore, this was not life or death.It wasn\u2019t a fight to kill.But it was a fight that, if ended, would allow everyone to die.\u201cHuff, hooo! Haa!\u201dI became the sword of the Heavenly Demon. I fought with all my power in the place of the Heavenly Demon, whose body had become infected and could not fight without spilling her energy all over.This was the scene that she had lost.\u201cHaaa!\u201dThe Venomous Snake became the sword of the Murim Lord. He ran with all his power in the place of the Murim Lord, whose whole body was infected and who could not wield an ax without breaking his spirit.This was a dream that he couldn\u2019t dream of anymore.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAll scenes fade.No matter how brilliant a dream was, it would one day become discolored.Humans all decay.\u201cAgh\u2026\u201dAt some point.The Heavenly Demon stopped talking.The woman who was called the greatest of all time in the Murim world slowly covered her face.\u201cYou wicked\u2026 You wicked things\u2026\u201dA decaying genre.A decaying world.\u201cI threw it all away. I threw it away a long time ago, but it\u2019s starting again\u2026\u201dOnly people could abandon people.Only people could not abandon people.\u201cWhat do you want\u2026?\u201dHow much time had passed?When neither I nor the Venomous Snake had the strength to lift our swords, our match was over. There was no winner. There was no loser, either.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI put away my sword.Breathing harshly, I walked with arduous steps. I walked in the snowfield. I walked to the Heavenly Demon, who was standing with her face covered, and I kneeled on my throbbing knees.\u201cHeavenly Demon-nim.\u201dI touched the snowfield with trembling hands.\u201cI want to become your disciple.\u201dI want to be your scene.\u201cI would like to have Heavenly Demon-nim as my teacher.\u201dI want to be your dream that doesn\u2019t discolor.\u201cI am called the Death King.\u201dI hope your scene leads to my scene, your dream leads to my dream, and your life leads to my life.\u201cMy real name is Kim Gongja.\u201dIt was a period when all sincerity was mocked.I want to support you so no one can laugh at you.\u201cPlease accept me as your disciple.\u201dPlease keep living.That was what I said.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe sunset colored the sky.Snow was falling in the field.\u201cI am the Heavenly Demon, So Baek-hyang.\u201dSnowflakes fluttered in the wind for a long time before falling from the sky to the snowy field. There were countless snowflakes. And one snowflake came to rest on one woman\u2019s dark hair. The white melted in the black and flowed down.\u201cBow to me in the Ceremony of Nine Salutes.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon opened her lips.\u201cI will receive you as my last disciple.\u201d~~~[1] The \u201cPetty Demonic Sword\u201d and the \u201cEternal Demon Sword\u201d use different hanja, but they are pronounced the same way in Korean.[2] Baduk: A Korean board game, also known as \u201cgo\u201d in Japan and \u201cweiqi\u201d in China.[3] \uc5ff \uac19\ub124 is colloquial for \u201cit sucks,\u201d but its literal meaning is \u201cit\u2019s like hard taffy.\u201d The joke was translated to \u201clollipop\u201d because the pun worked out too well and I couldn\u2019t help myself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78. <The Scent of Snow. (1)>================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha QC: LightBrin1.\u2026Baraya, baraya, agabaraya\u2026\u2026The heart is a candle, so burn this place\u2026These were prayers that had been handed down since ancient times.As monks chanted Amitabha, the Demonic cultists chanted Baraya.\u2026Baraya, baraya, agabaraya\u2026\u2026The heart is a candle, so burn this place\u2026No one knew what \u2018baraya\u2019 meant. So Baek-hyang also didn\u2019t know. The old man who brought So Baek-hyang to the Demonic Cult didn\u2019t know. They memorized it without understanding.For So Baek-hyang, Baraya was a song of the people. It was a scream. Screams originally have no meaning. So, wasn\u2019t it natural that the song of the commoners also had no meaning?One could memorize it without understanding.Just like how people don\u2019t have to know much in order to scream.A person can be polite only when he learns etiquette, and he can practice justice only when he learns righteousness, but the exception is screaming. Even someone who has learned nothing could scream.\u2026Baraya\u2026\u2026Baraya\u2026\u2026Agabaraya\u2026Screaming was a commonality between people of all nations in the world.The world that So Baek-hyang looked at was screaming.-I have nothing more to teach you.The old man said.-It is time for you to make your appearance.-Where should I go?So Baek-hyang asked. A subdued voice. She had already become mature.The 11-year-old little kid was not here. Black hair, black eyes, black uniform. The woman was as dark as a well in the night.She wanted to be hell.To become the people\u2019s hell, the woman advanced that much.-Where do you want to go?-To the place where people starve.So Baek-hyang replied.-I want to go where the thirsty are, where there are those who are suffocating, where there are cold people, where the drug addicts are, where the ill people are, where people are punished by the government, where people burn.So Baek-hyang looked into the air.-That\u2019s where I want to go.-\u2026\u2026.Far, far away.The sound of prayer was heard outside the main hall. The Demonic cultists were bowing as they prayed. Their voices. Their trembling. Baraya, baraya, agabaraya\u2026 They vibrated and traveled through the wooden floor.-Then, Baek-hyang.The old man opened his mouth.-You can go anywhere in this world.So Baek-hyang. 21 years old.She appeared in the Murim world.That winter, 31 martial artists, 47 court officials in the court, and 55 members of powerful families in the provinces were killed.2.\u201cOur sect\u2019s traditions are special.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon quietly retreated from the others. She congratulated the Murim Lord and the Venomous Snake. Then, she started to lead me somewhere with just the two of us.\u201cDo you know how to do the Ceremony of Nine Salutes?\u201d\u201cNo. I don\u2019t know how.\u201d\u201cIn our sect, when a disciple greets his master, he bows nine times.\u201dThe place we headed for was a cave. A cave fogged up by a hot spring. I had become used to the caves like they were my own home, but I wasn\u2019t familiar with the spot that the Heavenly Demon took me to.It was a place our party had never been allowed to enter.The Heavenly Demon walked deep into the cave.\u201cHm.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon waved her hand. Her loose sleeve fluttered once, then candles lit up the darkness. Countless candles lit up the stalagmites and stalactites of the cave.\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t end with just bowing. The master decides whether or not to accept the nine bows. The master can demand the student to do the Ceremony of Nine Salutes as many times as they want, until they are satisfied.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon grinned.\u201cTo sum it up, it all depends on how I feel.\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026 Are there any other criteria?\u201d\u201cThere are.\u201dThe end of the tunnel.\u201cNaturally, the heart is more important than appearance. Child. The reason why the time and place are important to etiquette is simply that a person\u2019s heart is cunning and light.\u201dThere was a huge library.Every time the Heavenly Demon took a step, candles were lit on both sides of the step. The more the candles were lit, the clearer the library\u2019s true form became. A high cave ceiling. Books and bamboo poles were stacked up to reach the ceiling.\u201cIt is not easy to grasp the lightness of the heart.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon walked.A candle lit up by her ankle.\u201cTherefore, man chooses sacred times and sacred places. He relies on the time and place. It is to hold the light heart heavy by depending on the sky and the earth.\u201d\u201cHeavenly Demon-nim. This is\u2026?\u201d\u201cThis is the sect\u2019s secret martial arts storehouse,\u201d the Heavenly Demon said.\u201cAnd it\u2019s also the martial arts storehouse of the Five Noble Clans and the Nine Great Schools. I call this place Cheonmugwan.\u201d[1]Bae Hu-ryeong opened his mouth.-That\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s totally a treasure trove! Zombie, I\u2019m going to look at some martial arts books! Don\u2019t mind me and do whatever you have to do. If you can, drag it out until I can read it all!The martial arts-crazed Bae Hu-ryeong ran to the books.-Oh yeah! All the skills in the world are mine now! I\u2019ll get all the enlightenment, all of it! Kuhahaha!The Heavenly Demon was calm, unaware that there was a ghost running about in her library.\u201cWhen I was twenty-one, I entered the world of martial arts. Can you guess what my first thought was when I appeared in the Murim world?\u201d\u201cUh. I\u2019m going to destroy all the heads of the bastard do-gooders in the Righteous Sect?\u201d\u201cThat was my third thought.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll prove that the Demonic Cult is the best\u2026?\u201d\u201cThat was my second thought.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon winked with her left eye.\u201cWhat I said was this. Since I was young, I really hated the word Murim.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cMurim is a word that reveres mu, the martial artists. But how can there be only martial artists in our world? There are boatmen and farmers. Merchants live here, as do prostitutes. There are countless trees that make up a single forest. Each tree has a different name and a different grain, but the Nine Great Schools and the Five Noble Clans named the forest, above all things, after the mu.\u201dShe didn\u2019t like it.Quietly, the Heavenly Demon muttered.\u201cSo the great me decided to take away the mu from them.\u201d\u201cTo take away the mu?\u201d\u201cI robbed them of all the martial arts texts that they worshiped like a shrine!\u201dThe Heavenly Demon laughed raucously.The smile on her face was playful.\u201cHuhu. The face the Gonryun masters made are still clear in my head. They begged with their heads hung down for me to leave the book containing the wisdom of the Cloud Dragon! I am a great person. I just buried those taoists in the ground but left their heads sticking out. And while they were watching, I wrapped up the martial arts books and left!\u201dWow.My master has such a nice personality.\u201cIt has been decades since then. Now, this is Gonryun and the shamans. It is the 4,000 Tang Mun. It\u2019s the strongest family in the nation. It\u2019s the Mosan Sect. Since all the martial arts in the world form a forest here, this place truly deserves to be called Murim. I would\u2026\u201dThe Heavenly Demon slowly sat down.\u201cI would like to receive your bows here.\u201d\u201cWill you do it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to care about the appearance. Child of the outside world. Just bow as your body tells you to.\u201dI did.I took off my shoes and put them down. I got down on my knees. The moment that my forehead was about to touch the floor, the Heavenly Demon\u2019s voice flowed.\u201cBow nine times, but put a different heart in each bow.\u201dA different heart.\u201cThe first bow should contain the heart of hunger.\u201d\u201cDo you understand?\u201dWas that so?\u201cYes. I understand.\u201dThe relationship between the master and the disciple was truly precious.In the Demonic Sect, this ritual was not simply about bowing nine times.The Ceremony of Nine Salutes.It was no different from the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.\u201cHoo\u2026\u201dSlowly. I breathed in deeply.I drew a picture in the center of my heart.A farmer wielding a pickax. The riverside. Mud.\u300cHunger is children waiting for the sun.\u300dI bowed.The Heavenly Demon nodded. She accepted my first salute. There was no lie in my hunger, so there was no fault in my bow.\u201cThe stages of the Demonic Cult are largely divided into four.\u201dTo me, who would soon become a disciple, the Heavenly Demon gave an ancient lesson.\u201cThe first stage is \u2018ipma,\u2019 or rising demon. Rising demons are those who know how to talk about their pain. The cultists who enter our sect speak with a sword, not with words. Therefore, the rising demon is a person who knows how to speak of his pain with a sword.\u201dI bowed again.After hunger was thirst, and I pictured seawater in my heart.\u201cThe second stage is gukma, or extreme demon. The extreme demon is someone who knows how to speak of the pain of others. Therefore, the extreme demon refers to a person who can use a sword to deal with the pain of others.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon silently accepted my second salute.I bowed again, drawing the image of the drowned father in my heart.\u201cThe third stage is talma, or elusive demon.\u201dAgain, the Heavenly Demon nodded.She was willing to accept my third salute.\u201cThe elusive demon is someone who knows how to talk about the pain of everyone. The elusive demon can walk down the street and easily feel what makes the person passing by him suffer.\u201dI did the fourth salute.\u201cIt is extremely rare for anyone to reach this level! Even in the history of our sect, the number of elusive demons can be counted on one hand. The great me is an elusive demon.\u201dAgain, the Heavenly Demon accepted my bow.\u201cFinally, there is the stage of sinma, the demonic god. The demonic god knows not only the suffering of all men but the suffering of all things. It is said that he can speak of the pain of all things in creation. But this is a theoretical stage! So I will just skip over that stage. In fact, no one has ever reached the stage of a demonic god.\u201dIt was when I was trying to do the fifth salute.\u201cStop.\u201dI stopped.\u201cDo it again.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe fifth sword of the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art was the path of poison. They were the movements of those who died from poison and addiction. I hadn\u2019t mastered the fifth sword yet. The Heavenly Demon said softly, \u201cI told you to do it again.\u201dI bowed.\u201cDo it again.\u201dI bowed.\u201cDo it again.\u201dAgain. Again. Again. Again.There was sweat on my forehead. Cool sweat ran down my back.The Heavenly Demon\u2019s face remained calm.\u201cDo it again.\u201dNumber of times to bow with death by poisoning in my heart, 336.Number of times to bow with death by illness in my heart, 189.I had to bow 510 times with death by blunt impact in my heart before the Heavenly Demon accepted my salute.I was sweating.I silently knelt down and bent my back.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re a straightforward child.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon smiled.\u201cThere are children who are honest from birth. There are also children who are born with a bad omen but become honest by their own will. Child of the outside world, you are definitely the latter. I wonder what kind of life you\u2019ve led to come this far.\u201dHer smile was a little sad.\u201cWhat kind of life are you trying to lead, to become like this\u2026?\u201dThe candlelight flickered.The light shook and the shadows shook.As it swayed, the shadow of the Heavenly Demon and my shadow overlapped.\u201cIf the sun means life, then shadows mean pain.\u201dThe thin shadow opened its lips.\u201cThe outline of each human as they live their life is separate, but their pain overlaps again and again. Thus, humans are not one because they are alive, but because they feel pain.\u201dIt was the doctrine of the shadows.\u201cIf you say that you will share the pain with someone, you are saying that you will be with that person for a lifetime. Therefore, those who are hurt by everyone only want to be with everyone. Child.\u201dA doctrine with only one mouth that could share it, pass it on in this world.\u201cGongja.\u201dThat mouth was talking to me.\u201cPeople don\u2019t just decide who they leave scars on. They can also decide whose scars to wear. The common people you are trying to save will never be good. The crowd you have saved will never be honorable. The one you love will never be perfect,\u201d the shadow whispered.The whisper of the shadow carried the heat of the candle.\u201cEven so, if you want to be hurt by everyone. If you are willing to give them your bare skin. Think about how they scratch you with their fingernails, how they will hurt you even if they hug you too tightly.\u201d\u201cLife is pain. But that is only human suffering. Bara, bara. Agabaraya. This is your heart\u2019s meaning and fire. Burn it, and see the shade of others.\u201dThe candle wax dripped.\u201cThe eighth infernal heaven is death by fire.\u201dIt flowed down.\u201cGongja. Bow with a burning heart.\u201dI.\u300cBut you know that I\u2019m the Flame Emperor.\u300d\u300cThat\u2019s why you have to die for me.\u300d\u300cGoodbye.\u300d[2]I bowed again.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dDeeply.The shadow was silent.336 times for the poison. 189 to the illness. 510 for blunt impact.The words \u2018Do it again,\u2019 which rang in the cave 1035 times, was not heard this time. She seemed to be satisfied with my single bow for death by incineration.\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dThe traces where the candle wax flowed.A voice spread over the spot where that trace was made.\u201cThe infernal heavens\u2019 last sword form\u2026 It is not set. It is a free style. From generation to generation, the sect leader engraves their own death on the last sword. So, the ninth sword of the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art varies greatly from person to person.\u201dA place for one\u2019s own death.\u201cBow with your death.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI.While committing suicide 4090 times, I.My neck hurt.My neck, stabbed with a dagger, hurt. My hands trembled. My arms shook. I was afraid that the blade would go crooked or miss because of the trembling and shaking. I was afraid that the pain would be prolonged if I stabbed myself wrongly. So, I wrapped green tape on the handle of the dagger.The green tape wrapped around the hilt was also wrapped around my right and left hands. It was fixed there. That way, I wouldn\u2019t tremble. I had regressed 4050 days. But I died 4090 times. I had to die. I almost gave up on the way. I had ran away from it for several days.However, I couldn\u2019t forgive that person.I didn\u2019t have the confidence I could forgive him and keep living.I wrapped up the green tape again. The slower my death, the blurrier my determination became. The blurrier my determination, the more I had to die. I stopped thinking of these useless things. I disregarded my hesitant thoughts.I desperately wanted to live, so I died desperately.Suicide.I drew it as the last picture in my heart and bowed to the Heavenly Demon.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe shadow shook. It was the Heavenly Demon standing up from her seat. I realized it a bit late. When I realized it, the Heavenly Demon already put her hand on my shoulder.\u201cGongja.\u201dOur shadows overlapped in the cave.\u201cYou are my disciple.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cYou are my disciple.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care where you come from. Wherever you go, wherever you are, you are a disciple of the Heavenly Demon, So Baek-hyang. Our doctrine is in your heart. Even if society is destroyed and the world ends, as long as your heart still beats, the infernal heavens will continue.\u201dI opened my mouth.\u201c\u2014Yes, Master.\u201dMy neck hurt.Those were painful days.I finally knew it now.~~~[1] Cheonmugwan: Cheon as in heaven, mu as in martial arts, gwan as in storeroom.

    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79. <The Scent of Snow. (2) >================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha PR: LightBrin3.After a long while, the Heavenly Demon and I were able to return to the party.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe two of us were quiet.As we walked through the cave tunnel, the Heavenly Demon said only one thing.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s very dark ahead, so be careful where you step.\u201dI just answered, \u201cYes.\u201dWith that, our conversation ended. When I peeked at her face, it seemed to be submerged in apprehension.What was the Heavenly Demon, no.What was Master thinking about?\u2018Character window.\u2019There was a saying that a disciple should not step on even the shadow of their master, but it was hard to withstand my curiosity. Could it be that I had shown her too much of my weakness, and now Master had become cautious? That wasn\u2019t what I wanted, though.+Name: So Baek-hyangFavorability: 85Favorite Genre: [Martial Arts]Hated Genres: [Classical], [Mythology], [History], [Fairy Tales]Favorite Characters: [Commoners], [Rival], [Disciple]Hated Characters: [Oppressor], [Deceiver], [Playboy]Favorite Plot: [All-out Match]Hated Plot: [Running Away], [Oblivion], [Meaningless Death]Psychological State: \u2018Here. If I calculate my remaining energy\u2026 I can live for one year and six months more by being frugal. A year and a half! As I thought, it\u2019s difficult! Within a year and a half, I must pass down everything to Gongja\u2026\u2019+HmmHuh.My face tingled. I felt guilty for peeking into Master\u2019s heart\u2026 And not only that, I felt bashful. Also\u2026 a little touched. I wasn\u2019t sure what emotion it was, but my face felt very hot.Ah. Am I really weak against something like having people\u2019s favor and being recognized?I heard a snicker.-Zombie! Today is a really good day! It\u2019s a lucky day!Of course, my feelings of being moved did not last for long.A not-human ghost jerk shattered it all.-Well! No matter how different the world is, martial artists aren\u2019t that different from those in my Murim world. Still, it makes me feel good that I can read martial arts texts for the first time in a long time. Kyaah! Ah, by the way. Did your ceremony go well?\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d-Huh? What\u2019s that? That sour look. You already look ugly, Zombie, and you\u2019re making it uglier. You need to take care of your appearance.If my favorability rate could be shown right now, it would have immediately gone down by 10 points.Anyway, ghosts do not know about the human mind.[Shiny just barely stops sobbing and looks up at the warrior.]Shiny, who had been shivering since a while ago, finally stopped.As expected, a constellation knows the human mind and what it feels.My favorability for Shiny rose by 30.\u201cOh. You\u2019ve returned,\u201d the Venomous Snake said to us. His one eye soon looked at me. \u201cIs the ceremony over now?\u201d\u201cYes. I officially became a disciple of the Demonic Cult.\u201d\u201cCool. Congratulations.\u201d\u201cSo, how did Venomous Snake-nim become the Murim Lord\u2019s disciple?\u201dThe Venomous Snake smirked and folded his arms.\u201cWell, somehow, it just happened.\u201d\u201cYou said stuff like that earlier, too.\u201d\u201cWhat, do you want to hear all the details?\u201d\u201cIf possible.\u201dThe Venomous Snake looked at me with his arms crossed.He shook his head with an expression so guarded as if not even a needle could pierce him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s impossible,\u201d the Venomous Snake said casually.\u201cI just asked him to teach me. Nothing really happened.\u201dHuh.Since our spar was also over, I opened the Venomous Snake\u2019s psychological status window.\u300eSheesh. That nearly-dead old man\u2026 No. Now he\u2019s my master.Anyway, he says his life is short and wants to give the Heavenly Demon a reason to live. How could I refuse and say no?And he\u2019s skilled. He\u2019s superior to me\u2026\u300fI looked at the Venomous Snake, feeling as if I had been hit on the head.The Venomous Snake.He was a real \u2018man.\u2019\u300eWhoa~ Maybe it\u2019s because I lied, but I keep thinking about it.The Murim Lord and the Heavenly Demon sometimes spar against each other. I\u2019d been thinking that they\u2019re sort of awesome since seeing that.So, since the two of us were sitting together, we started talking about martial arts.Then the Murim Lord suddenly said, \u2018Whoa! Oi, you, is it true? How blessed is the outside world to have a genius like you?\u2019 He seemed very astonished.As for me, I scratched the back of my head, thinking, hmm, it\u2019s not that much\u2014Then the Medicine King stepped in, asking why he was making such a fuss over that little thing, saying,\u2018Ah, this guy, the Chen Mu-mun master, is a precious [peer] to me even though it looks like this. With his skill, character, and appearance, of course he is qualified to be one.\u2019The Alchemist also blushed, saying,\u2018Yes\u2026 Ch, Chen Mu-mun master is like an older bro..ther\u2026 N, nothing! I didn\u2019t say anything! Anyway, the Chen Mu-mun master is the top ranker in our world\u2026 H, he\u2019s even said to be an idol that people all over the world look up to! I think\u2026 Ahaha, ha, hahaha, I, I said something embarrassing\u2014!\u2019 And she clasped her hands to her cheeks.With the banquet of facts suddenly pouring out of them, I had no choice but to look at the distant mountains.Then the Murim Lord nodded as if everything made sense.\u2018Hey, I have a request! As the greatest genius, please be my last student!\u2019Haa~ This was so difficult.I just want to live quietly, but really, why is my life so\u2026\u300fOkay.That was enough.The Venomous Snake.He was a \u2018real man.\u2019\u201cDeath King. And Demonic Cult sect leader-ssi.\u201dThe best \u2018real man\u2019 of this time shrugged as he said, \u201cI have one good news and one sad news for you.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIt was successful.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t the Venomous Snake who answered my question. It was a more shaky voice, the voice of the Alchemist. The Alchemist was walking this way, wearing her thick glasses.\u201cThe cure. I developed it. It was a success, Death King-nim.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe reason I couldn\u2019t answer right away was not that I was impressed with the declaration that she completed it.The Alchemist was a genius. I had no doubt that she could develop a cure; it was only a matter of time.In the meantime, I spent a lot of time learning about the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art. If it was the Alchemist, especially with the help of the Medicine King, she would definitely be able to develop a cure.\u201cWhat? You made the medicine?\u201dMaster looked surprised.\u201cIs that really true? If you are lying, say it now. I am generous enough to overlook a single lie.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. It\u2019s the truth,\u201d the Alchemist said.\u201cActually, I developed it yesterday. I observed it for an additional day because I had to see the results of the clinical trial.\u201d\u201cClinical trial? What\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s to see if the cure works properly. The experimental subjects donated by Heavenly Demon-nim and Murim Lord-nim\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. The faction leader. I looked at his progress for a day.\u201dThe pharmacist seemed to be struggling to keep her face expressionless.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since he died, so I couldn\u2019t revive him. The zombie virus\u2026 I confirmed that the contagion was gone, and his body became an ordinary corpse. Yes. There is nothing wrong with the cure.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it a great occasion?\u201dMaster was delighted.\u201cThat\u2019s amazing! Even though the doctors and the taoists all worked together, they couldn\u2019t defeat the disease. To find a solution with only two people, that\u2019s something that goes beyond talent!\u201d\u201cNo. Thanks to the data provided by Death King-nim\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be modest. Heal the old man Ax Saint right now!\u201dMaster grabbed the Alchemist\u2019s hands.Master\u2019s joy could be vividly felt in her gestures and motion.\u201cThat guy pretends to be strong and proud, but he\u2019s trembling. He doesn\u2019t have many days left. He must have known that and so took in a child of the outside world as his disciple. It must be God\u2019s compassion that let you develop the cure before the old man passed away!\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 Of course, I\u2019ll treat him. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here\u2026\u201dThen, I opened my mouth.\u201cThere is a problem with the cure.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that so, boss?\u201dThe Alchemist hung her head. Her complexion was as dim as her voice. From the moment she said that she finished making the cure, the Alchemist hadn\u2019t made eye contact with me. I had started to feel anxious from that point.\u201cNo, there is no problem with the cure\u2026 After all, I\u2019m the one who made it. It\u2019s perfect. But\u2026\u201dBut.\u201cBut what?\u201d\u201cThere are harmful effects to the abdomen.\u201dPatter.We heard the sound of light footsteps.\u201cMadu. I also witnessed that horse-faced taoist\u2019s body return to normal. Just in case, I grabbed two more Jiangshi to look again, but the results were the same. There is no doubt about the efficacy of the medicine made by this maiden.\u201dThe Murim Lord, the Ax Saint.The old man in a white uniform slowly walked over to us.\u201cBut you know. The two of us are already half-corpses. Our bodies have become corpses long ago, but we\u2019ve been saving them by force.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dMaster\u2019s face hardened.The Murim Lord stroked his beard in a forlorn manner.\u201cWe skillfully defied the laws of heaven to survive. Now we must pay the price.\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s been a long time since both of you were infected with the Jiangshi disease.\u201dThe Alchemist opened her lips.\u201cIf you haven\u2019t been infected yet, or if you were just infected, the cure and prevention will end with just one vaccine, but the two of you\u2026\u201dThe Alchemist, with her head bowed, quickly moved her mouth.\u201cThere is no abnormality above the point where the cervix meets the spinal column. After taking the cure, you\u2019ll return to normal as it was before the disease spread. However, below that point, what you are talking about is the origin of the disease, the pathogenesis\u2026 So, it\u2019s impossible to distinguish the takgi.\u201dIn particular, the condition of the lower body was serious, the Alchemist said.\u201cThe passage through which your life energy moves is the same passage through which takgi spreads. In simple terms, you have to clean the hallway. The cure is not a meticulous tweezer but a dull broom. You can\u2019t separate the dust and grains of sand while sweeping the hallway with a broom. The hallway has so much dust piled up, especially, the lower part of the abdomen\u2026\u201dThe lower part of the abdomen was the place where life energy accumulated.For martial artists, it was as precious as life itself.\u201cThere, we have to clear everything.\u201d\u201c\u2026If you clear it up,\u201d Master said.\u201cWhat does it mean to clear it up?\u201d\u201cWe have to get rid of it.\u201dThe Alchemist\u2019s voice was tight.\u201cWe have to perform surgery.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you saying you\u2019re going to get rid of the tumor attached to the abdomen? That much is okay. There may be a loss in energy, but that can be recovered quickly.\u201d\u201cNo. I have to remove it completely.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to doubt the success of the surgery. This type of surgery has been done before. I\u2019m not a specialist, but the Medicine King is skilled. I, I am also capable of providing support. So\u2026\u201d\u201cShe has great skill in medical procedures,\u201d the Murim Lord said, interrupting. \u201cI don\u2019t know much, but the doctors of the outside world are more skilled than the ones within the walls. It\u2019s amazing to watch from the side. Madu. You should also look at it if you have the chance.\u201d\u201cNamgung Un.\u201d\u201cI am\u2014\u201d the Murim Lord coughed.\u201cI am going to have the procedure.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only a handful of energy that I\u2019ll lose anyway. There\u2019s nothing to be sad about. I have no regrets. I\u2019m glad that I can have a disciple in my old age. Even without my lower abdomen, I will have the mind to teach my pupil, and my disciple is a once-in-a-lifetime genius who understands ten things if I tell him one.\u201dThe Murim Lord looked at his longtime nemesis.\u201cWe are martial artists. Martial arts is in the heart. If the heart remains, martial arts remain. Isn\u2019t that so, Baek-hyang?\u201dMaster could not answer.Throughout the night, the Murim Lord underwent surgery. Around dawn, the Alchemist and the Medicine King informed us that the operation was over.The operation was a success.4.At dawn, the snowfield contained the color of the shade.\u201cMaster.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dMaster stood alone at the entrance to the cave, looking down at the shadowy world. Long black sleeves fluttered in the wind.The scenery was far away.But Master\u2019s back looked to be farther than the scenery.\u201cMaster.\u201d\u201c\u2026Did the result of the operation come out?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s safe.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dMaster\u2019s gaze, though focused, did not seem to be looking at anything in particular.\u201cDisciple.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI wanted to cut down all the coldness in the world,\u201d Master said. \u201cThat has been my wish since childhood. I resented the winter. The snow that fell in winter was something regretful for me. Why were there seasons in the world, and among the seasons, why did winter have to take people\u2019s lives?\u201dA world that had become covered by perpetual winter.The woman born with ice, snow, and shade hated the season that most resembled her.\u201cI was confident that I could punish those who froze the world, even if I could not cut down the coldness with one strike. I remember the days when I first appeared in the land of rivers and lakes. It was also midwinter then.\u201dI realized that something had changed about Master.Her sword.Master was holding a sword in her right hand. There was no guard. It was made only with a hilt and a blade. Unlike other swords that were transparent like mirrors, Master\u2019s sword was pitch black.It was a sword that refused to be transparent.It was my first time seeing it, but I could guess what the sword was.\u201cBloody Demonic Sword\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dMaster softly chanted,\u201cWhen I first appeared in the land of rivers and lakes, I tried something. It was the will of a young heart. I accepted the coldness of the world as a literal thing and wished to cut down the snowy mountains.\u201dMaster exhaled.The breath shed at dawn was white.In the white sky, high mountain peaks rose.\u201cI couldn\u2019t even cut off the hem of it during those days, but\u2014\u201dMaster raised her sword.\u201cWhat will happen now? I wonder.\u201dShe swung the sword.It was a sluggish gesture.Master\u2019s sleeves were long, so it took a long time for it to follow her hand movements. When the black sleeves fluttered in the air, the time in the world seemed to have stopped. In the frozen air, Master\u2019s sleeves moved freely.\u201cBarayeo,\u201d\u00a0wish.Sword dance.\u201cBarayeo,\u201d\u00a0wish.Sword life.[1]\u201cAgabarayeo,\u201d\u00a0I have a wish.The swordswoman was burned up as she performed her sword dance.\u201cMy heart is a candle.\u201dWith that.\u201cBurn this place.\u201dThe snowy mountain was cut.The snow peak, which did not bear trees nor reveal rocks, which had no meaning except for just being there, was cut.The screams of the snow-covered mountains resembled thunder. Following the echoing scream, a pure white explosion. The snowy mountain collapsed, starting from the peak, causing a wave of snow to fall, and the waves built upon each other and fell apart in layers. It continued to collapse. A blizzard created by a person, not the heavens, greeted the dawn.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dMaster was out of breath.\u201cI could only cut the peak. I cut the mountain with my heart, but killing it with just my spirit is a far-off dream. This is the last stage of the great me.\u201d\u201cDisciple.\u201dMaster looked back at me.One mountain was crumbling white.\u201cI will undergo the procedure.\u201d~~~[1] The pronunciation of \u201csword dance\u201d and \u201csword life\u201d are identical.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80. <The Scent of Snow. (3)>================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha PR: LightBrin5.Master did not undergo the surgery right away.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I, I just have to take a break\u2026\u201dIt was just after the Murim Lord\u2019s procedure ended. Both the Alchemist and the Medicine King were tired from performing the surgery. The Alchemist collapsed and fell asleep, and the Medicine King went to the hot springs with his jaw hanging loose, clearly out of it.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMaster frowned and looked down at the Murim Lord.\u201cOld man. I heard you lost your lower abdomen, so I came to see it myself.\u201d\u201cMy first visitor since I\u2019ve become a patient is incredible. Fine, come and feast your eyes.\u201d\u201cHow do you feel?\u201dThe Murim Lord, who was lying down on the mat, and cackled.\u201cI feel light. I feel like I just might ascend.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re full of shit. You can\u2019t even turn over a new leaf, let alone ascend\u2026\u201dThe Murim Lord smirked.\u201cWell, your mug looks lighter, too. Madu. Have you also decided to get the surgery?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dMaster sighed.\u201cI just spent a year\u2019s worth of energy while swinging my sword. It was the last time in my life that I could play with my chi like that.\u201d\u201cHoho!\u201dThe Murim Lord\u2019s eyes sparkled.\u201cIt must have been a magnificent sight. How regrettable that I couldn\u2019t see it while I was lying in bed. So? What did you do?\u201d\u201cI tried to cut the winter, but I could not. That stage of deathly desperation is far away for me.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s a shame. Well. Cheer up. Isn\u2019t that an unprecedented stage? If it were as easy as that, the world\u2019s history would have been upset at least six times.\u201dThe Murim Lord cackled again.Looking down at the old man\u2019s laughter, Master opened her lips.\u201cNamgung Un. You are\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t regret it at all.\u201dThe Murim Master flatly cut her off.\u201cThe world fell to pieces a long time ago, but we lasted for three years by a strange fate. It was a strange fate that the outside world\u2019s doctors could treat us. That I could have a final disciple, that the Righteous Sect that I thought would end would continue\u2014all of that is some strange act of fate! If all these strange coincidences overlap, isn\u2019t this what you call a miracle? I am merely feeling grateful for this miracle.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cHmm. The only thing that I regret is this. We\u2019ve never been able to conclude our War of Good and Evil, Madu. Well, there is no such thing as a perfect life. Our disciples will take care of it.\u201d\u201cYes. They will.\u201dMaster smiled a little. It was a lonely smile. However, Master\u2019s eyes as she looked at me held a strong faith in them.\u201cIf this is the end of my life, I shall accept it.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a happy acceptance. But it was close to it.No matter how sweet candy is, it must melt in your mouth before you can swallow it.Maybe Master was carefully thinking about the end of her life.\u201cHmm.\u201dI nodded.\u201cMaster. I have to go somewhere for a moment.\u201d\u201cHmm? Where in the world can you go with the outside in that state?\u201d\u201cThink about it as your disciple going out for some air. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201c\u2026I feel more worried because you said that.\u201dMaster quietly lowered her eyebrows.\u201cYou\u2019re not trying to get involved in something perilous, are you?\u201d\u201cI will definitely be back before Master\u2019s procedure is over.\u201dI covered my fist with a hand in front of me and bowed.The way my hands were probably looked quite awkward, but I put my heart into the action.\u201cPlease get treated comfortably, Master. When you open your eyes again, your unworthy disciple will be waiting.\u201dMaster accepted this.Now, it was time for me to give Master her life back.6.I exited the cave and crossed the snowy field.As I crossed the snowfield, I pictured how this world looked before it was destroyed. The Murim. A martial arts forest. Was there a thick forest over there? Gangho. Rivers and lakes. Did water flow over there?\u201cMilord.\u201dIt was the other side of the snowfield.\u201cI have executed the order.\u201dIn the middle of the snowfield, the place where the trees had grown and the river flowed, the demon was kneeling on one knee.\u201cDid you find them all?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d the demon said, her head bowed. White snow was like dirt on her hair. The snowflakes proved how long she had been kneeling.\u201cAs our lord ordered.\u201dI had ordered the demon to do something the other day.\u300cThere will be Jiangshi that can use martial arts in the vicinity who are alone.\u300d\u300cFind them.\u300d\u300cFind the Demonic Cult members in their black uniforms. Find the chivalrous fighters in their white uniforms.\u300dDuring the last three years of the great battle of good and evil, many Jiangshi have \u2018gone missing.\u2019The corpses of the warriors were swept away by the blizzard and the snow in the wind.\u201cThere were 439 Jiangshi from the Demonic Cult that were lost. From the Righteous Sect, 478 Jiangshi. In total, 917 people were missing.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t all.\u201c560 members of the Demonic Cult were not lost, but are in the vicinity. Members of the Righteous Sect that are in the vicinity, 521. In total, 1998. All of them.\u201dThe demon bowed a little deeper.Over her thin shoulder.\u201cI have gathered them here for you.\u201dJiangshi were lined up in the snowfield.My regiment of skeletons held the Jiangshi captive on both sides. It was morning. There was no way that the weak Jiangshi could move in the sunlight, but even if the clouds covered the sun, their battle formation would not fall apart.\u201cGood. You did well.\u201dI nodded.\u201cNow, bring the Jiangshi to me one by one.\u201d\u201cYes. As you command.\u201dThe skeletons dragged over the cold corpses. By the time the first one reached me, I was already holding the Holy Sword. Winter was cold. But my blade that sliced through the winter air was colder.\u2026Baraya\u2026The wind blew. Just as the rain was collected in a lake, the wind blew into the valley in a rage. As it was collected in the valley, the sound of the winds seemed to resemble human voices.\u2026Baraya\u2026Far away. The wind shouted the sutra.The sound, as it dropped down, resembled the sound of all humans.I heard the sound of the wind that was rolling down and swung my sword.\u2026Agabaraya\u2026And cut decisively.The Jiangshi\u2019s head split.\u201cHuff.\u201dI cut and cut the corpses.Without any rest.As the Jiangshi\u2019s heads burst, fragments and debris splattered all over.\u201cNext!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe skeletons quickly brought over the next corpse. The demon orchestrated the army of bones into moving in the way that was needed. As I fell into a steady pace, the demon quickly presented the corpses to me, and when I felt tired, she slowed down a bit.\u201cFaster! I\u2019ll finish them all before sunset today!\u201d\u201cYes, milord!\u201dLike the flowing wind, we continued our executions.A total of 1998 corpses.No matter how immobile or subordinate they were, it wasn\u2019t easy to cut them with a single strike.\u201cHuff, huff\u2026 hoo\u2026!\u201dI had been thinking about it all along.\u2018How can I reach the perfect ending?\u2019What kind of ending will ensure that Master is completely satisfied?\u2018How can a person\u2019s life become complete?\u2019I wanted to achieve it without a single lie.So, I came to a conclusion.\u2018It isn\u2019t enough for me to be her disciple.\u2019When Master goes crazy, that\u2019s the bad ending. Definitely a poor result. But, was it really a happy ending with just the [introduction of a disciple]?Would Master be happy and satisfied with this ending?\u2018No.\u2019Normal ending.[Introduction of a disciple] is by no means a complete ending. It barely satisfied the criterion of an ending.Even if I declared that it was over with this, the Librarian, the constellation, would probably accept it, and the 22nd floor would be cleared as it is\u2026\u201cHuff! Hoo\u2026!\u201dBut I would never be satisfied.\u201cMilord, please stay strong! There\u2019s only half of them left now!\u201d[Shiny cheers for the warrior\u2019s struggle at full power!]The sun went down.The sky turned red, and the snowfield was dyed violet.\u201cHoo\u2026 huff! Hoo\u2026!\u201dI don\u2019t know how long it took. Seven hours? Eight hours? It should have been about that much. Anyway, I swung my sword without stopping. My clothes were drenched with sweat and bits of corpses that I had cut down.\u201cThe last ten are coming! Milord!\u201d10 people.I looked in front of me. As expected, only 5 members each from the Demonic Cult and the Righteous Sect remained. I took a deep breath and clenched the hilt tightly.A little more.\u201cThere are five!\u201dA little bit more.\u201cLast! This is the last one!\u201dI smashed the head of a Demonic Cult member in a black uniform. The Jiangshi\u2019s frozen brain shattered like ice. Finally, after cutting down the 1998th Jiangshi, I gave way and my knees fell into the snow.\u201cHuff, huff\u2026! Huff, hooo\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard, milord! You have done a great amount of work!\u201dThe demon looked like she was ready to jump with joy. It was expected since she had also suffered alongside me for over half the day.Ever since I collected her as a part of my shadow, the demon had always been brusque. It was the first time I had seen such honest joy coming from her.\u201cWhat are you so happy about?\u201dI asked after my breathing had stabilized. Then, the demon realized that her face had been showing her emotions for a while and quickly returned to her normal cold expression.\u201c\u2026When I thought of the scene that milord would show, my heart naturally felt full. I haven\u2019t been able to see milord\u2019s master in person, but. I think she will be happy. And not just a simple joy, but\u2026 really, greatly.\u201d\u201cI guess.\u201dI smiled, stretching out in the snow.\u201cI hope she\u2019ll be pleased.\u201dThe cure was developed.I was recognized as Master\u2019s disciple.Finally, I even obtained permission from Bae Hu-ryeong.It wasn\u2019t easy getting all the way here.Finally\u2026 I was ready to see the ending of this world.7.A week had passed.\u201cHmm. I feel somewhat empty without the lower abdomen energy.\u201dFor a week, Master and the Murim Lord recuperated. Fortunately, there was no need to find a separate spot for that. The cave here with its open-air bath served as the best vacation resort for recovering.\u201cEven if I regulate my breath, my energy isn\u2019t piling up. It\u2019s quite uncomfortable not to have chi. Uh-huh, this is the pain of the desperate people who can\u2019t do martial arts\u2026\u201d\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m more comfortable now. Honestly, I didn\u2019t feel like I was alive even though I was living! I had to block the takgi every day, make sure my heart was still beating. Oh my, oh my.\u201dThe Murim Lord sighed, sinking further into the hot spring.\u201cBecause I can breathe without thinking, I feel like I\u2019m living a little now! And all this is thanks to the children of the outside world.\u201d\u201cY, you did well hanging in there for so long\u2026\u201dThe Alchemist hesitantly ended Master\u2019s examination.\u201cToday\u2019s treatment is over. Both of you are fine. We could even say that you\u2019re cured. E, even If the Jiangshi were to bite you again, you won\u2019t become infected\u2026\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dMaster raised her hand and stroked the Alchemist\u2019s head. Flinch. The Alchemist briefly cowered back.\u201cThat old man and I are obliged to you for saving our lives. It\u2019s not easy to help a stranger.\u201d\u201cOh, not at all\u2026 I only did what was natural\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that you think that was something natural. It is even more amazing that you went through and saw it till the end, what you thought was natural. Child. Even at your young age, you are great.\u201d\u201cAh. I mean, no, that is\u2026\u201dThe Alchemist couldn\u2019t move as Master continued to pat her head. Although she was very embarrassed, the Alchemist didn\u2019t seem to hate it. They looked like close sisters, and watching them made me feel happy.\u201cHmm.\u201dBut I couldn\u2019t be content with just this.\u201cBoss. Does this mean it\u2019s all right for both of them to move around now?\u201d\u201cAh. Y, yes! Just in case, I had them recuperate for a longer period. Even if they move around and exercise, there won\u2019t be a problem.\u201dOkay.\u201cMaster. Murim Lord-nim. Will you walk with me for a little while?\u201d\u201cA walk?\u201dMaster tilted her head.\u201cI\u2019m delighted that I can get some fresh air with my student\u2026 But why would you bring around this old coot? Gongja. Even a pleasant walkway becomes a filthy road if you go with that old man.\u201d\u201cWell. If it\u2019s a walk with the old demon and the young demon, it\u2019s me who would rather refuse. You dumb cultists can go by yourselves.\u201dTheir reaction was to be expected.\u201cNo.\u201dI shook my head quietly.\u201cBoth of you have to come.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201dMaster and the Murim Lord looked at each other. They seemed to have noticed that I wasn\u2019t suggesting a normal walk. Their expression showed that they didn\u2019t know what it was about but were interested.\u201cI understand. My disciple must have some secret plans. I don\u2019t want to walk with this old fool, but I\u2019m willing to be tricked by my dull-witted disciple.\u201d\u201cWell. Since a baby demon plotted it, it\u2019s probably no big deal. I don\u2019t expect much at all.\u201dWe left the cave.It was cold. Just like it was on the first day we fell into the [Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon], it was still winter.What was different from that day was that neither Master nor the Murim Lord could use their chi. They wouldn\u2019t be able to use it forever.With my right hand, I held Master\u2019s hand. With my left, I held the hand of the Murim Lord. That way, I could use Aura to warm them both.\u201cMaster.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cMurim Lord-nim.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cThe two of you had said this. The only regret you have is that you were unable to conclude your battle of good and evil. That it\u2019s unfortunate, but it\u2019s a problem that we who have become the disciples will have to resolve\u2026\u201dThe two leaned against my warmth and crossed the cold winter road.\u201cBut I thought of something else.\u201dWas it because it was the first time they were going out in a week? Or was it their bodies, which they had to use without their inner energy, that was unfamiliar? The steps of Master and the Murim Lord were a little clumsy.\u201cThe Great Battle of Good and Evil is the ritual between you two. Even if I and Chen Mu-mun master fight, it is just a normal spar; it can never be a great battle. Only a spar between the two of you can be the great battle. It is because it was you two who have held up the Demonic Sect and the Righteous Sect up to now.\u201d\u201cDisciple\u2026?\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dWe got to the snowfield.\u201cThank you for not giving up for 3 years.\u201dThe place where corpses were once spread like a forest. The forest of silhouettes. Now, this place was nothing more than a clear snowfield.\u201cThank you for coming to gather the Jiangshi again every morning. If you had given up, if they had been treated as mere corpses and left to disappear, I would never have been able to recover them.\u201dThe life that you both lost.The scenery you should enjoy.To return them, I slowly opened my mouth.\u201cHundred Ghosts Reincarnation.\u201dMy shadow spread over the snow.[Your skill is being activated.]In the shade, figures rose like snowmen. One, two, many. Some shadows wore black robes. Some shadows had their white sleeves fluttering. They gradually took shape in human forms and looked down at their hands, amazed.\u201cDisciple, just what\u2026\u201dHowever, none of them would be as surprised as Master and the Murim Lord.\u201cYou can think of it as a dream. It\u2019s okay to just look over it, saying that it\u2019s an aftereffect of losing the energy in your lower abdomen. It\u2019s all right to assume that I learned a strange martial art to recall the memories and bodies of the dead for a while and make them the same as before.\u201d\u201cMaster. Murim Lord-nim.\u201dThe Hundred Ghosts Reincarnation was complete.\u201cThe Demonic Cult is not over yet.\u201dElite members of the Demonic Cult. 1,000 people.\u201cWar has not yet forgotten chivalry, and chivalry has not forgotten war.\u201dElites of the Righteous Sect. 1,000 people.\u201cThe Demonic Cult will not end because of the Jiangshi, and the Righteous Sect too will not be eaten by mere corpses.\u201dThe true Great Battle of Good and Evil.That was what the two hoped for.\u201cIf the Demonic Cult disappears from the world, it is only by the blade of the Righteous Sect. If the sect is to be destroyed, it must be because of the wicked fingertips of the Demonic Sect.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAs the master of the Demonic Cult said and as the leader of the Righteous Sect desires.\u201dI smiled.Then, I covered my fist with a hand and bowed.\u201cFight to be the final master of this world.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81. <The World\u2019s Shabbiest. (1) >=========================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha QC: LightBrin1.Murmuring sounds flowed all over the snowfield.\u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m alive\u2026?\u201d\u201cIs this heaven\u2026?\u201dThe members of the Demonic Cult. The people of the Righteous Sect.The last thing they remembered was their own death. They may have memories of being bitten by Jiangshi, but they had no memories of turning into Jiangshi. From their point of view, years had passed in the blink of an eye.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dBut there were also people who had been fully aware of the past three years.Master stared at the snowfield blankly like she couldn\u2019t believe her eyes.\u201cDisciple\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not simply from beyond the walls, are you? No, you must be from a completely different world\u2026 This, this sort of thing is not the sort of sorcery that a mere human can do. It\u2019s an act out of some absurd legend. Or, did I perhaps die and arrive at Paradise without realizing it?\u201d\u201cNo. That\u2019s not the case.\u201dI shook my head quietly.\u201cThese people, like you, Master, can no longer use martial arts. They\u2019re very weak compared to when they were alive. However, this is not Paradise, and those people have memories of their lives.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cPlease go and check it for yourself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cPlease go now, Master.\u201dTap.Master stepped on to the snow. Tap, tap\u2026 Her footsteps were very light. They were the footsteps of a person whose lower abdomen chi was taken out. They were the footsteps of a martial artist who lost her inner energy. They were the footsteps of a woman who struggled against a disease for three years.The Heavenly Demon.My master.She approached the cultists with those light footsteps. The cultists were still trying to make sense of the situation.\u201cF, first we have to check the current situation. Everyone stay calm! Send a reconnaissance\u2026!\u201d\u201cBlood Guard Leader.\u201dThey stopped.The cultists flinched. A group of 12 or so cultists fell into silence. They then looked at Master, their leader, with a confused look.\u201cHeavenly Demon\u2026?\u201dMaster\u2019s breath thickened, becoming whiter.\u201cBlood Guard Leader.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt really is you.\u201dThe silence was contagious. At first, only ten or so were silent. But when ten people shut their mouths, the dozens of people around them shut their mouths, and the hundreds of people around those dozens shut their mouths as well in a cascade.The snowfield was silent.\u201cDemon Lord Wolyeong\u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cFlame Ghost Demon.\u201d\u201cYes, my liege.\u201d\u201cSword Demon\u2026\u201d\u201cAt your command.\u201dOne by one, Master began to call the names of the cultists. The cultists who were called did not ask any questions. They just immediately knelt down. Crunch. Crunch. As they all knelt down, the snow beneath them compressed.\u201cI had lost you all\u2026\u201dMaster reached out her hand.\u201cI lost you, again and again.\u201dMaster stroked one of the cultists\u2019 cheek. She patted it.\u201cMy children\u2026\u201dHer fingers trembled. Seeing their master tremble like so, the cultists hurriedly bowed their heads. This wasn\u2019t something that they should see. It was their way of showing their devotion to her. One thousand members of the cult all turned their gaze to the floor.It wasn\u2019t just the Demonic Cult members that were in shock, of course.\u201c\u2026Oho.\u201dThe old monk stroked his beard.\u201cI must have died in the cave and crossed the river. When I closed my eyes, there is no Nirvana, no grave, just this snowfield\u2026\u201d\u201cM, monk!\u201d\u201c\u2026And there is also this common man mixed in among us. Oho. Even if I close my eyes, I must still mix with this person. What does the Buddha want from this monk?\u201d\u201cSeeing how you\u2019re just talking bullshit\u2026 you really are the monk!\u201dThe Murim Lord ran and hugged the old man. I finally realized who the old man was. He was the Shaolin head monk, the one who endured the longest after Master and the Murim Lord.\u201cYou came back! You\u2019re alive! My friend, you came back to us!\u201d\u201cI am not your friend.\u201d\u201cAhh! This is undoubtedly a miracle from the Jade Emperor!\u201d\u201cI hear the sound of a dog eating grass.\u201dIn other words, it was complete and utter nonsense.\u201cDon\u2019t dirty the ears of this monk, commoner. In the first place, I should never have fallen for your temptation to fight against the Demonic Path. It\u2019s better to quietly join the temple.\u201d\u201cAhh! My happiness from seeing you cooled as soon as you talked. It really is the monk I know! I just want to punch you in the face!\u201dThe Demonic Cult members were quiet, and while the Righteous Sect\u2019s fighters were noisy with chatter.They were experiencing this reunion in their own way.Time passed.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dIt was Master who first turned her head to look at me. Master and I exchanged glances. Her eyes were dark. And in her eyes, her heart was reflected. My own heart was smeared, engraved with her feelings.\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2026\u201dMaster opened her mouth.Her mouth opened, and she spoke to the Murim Lord.\u201cI am So Baek-hyang of the Demonic Cult.\u201dThe Murim Lord, who was having a small discussion with his sect members, stopped. The Murim Lord let his peers go from his embrace and stared at Master from afar. Master bowed.\u201cI am the Heavenly Demon.\u201d\u201cMaybe today is the delusion of a blind man, but that is all right.\u201dIt was midday.\u201cIt\u2019s okay if I am just a sick patient who is daydreaming.\u201dThe snow in this field was not known as the perpetual snow because it did not melt in the sun. It was called that because even as it melted, more snow continued to build on top of it.\u201cIt\u2019s all right if this is just a dream as the world goes to sleep. After all, life is originally an illness that we live through, and the world is the dream that we all share.\u201dFor humans who wished to remain pure white under the blazing sun, it wasn\u2019t enough that they were born white. They had to endlessly spread the white color over the world. They needed the determination to break, be broken, and scattered over and over again.\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten the name of the disease I was trying to get. I haven\u2019t lost the fever of my dreams yet. So I haven\u2019t let go of any people yet, and I haven\u2019t let go of the world. Baraya! The name of the disease, not the martial arts, proves my place, and the fever of my dreams, not my internal energy, is proof of who I am.\u201dThe sound of breaking snow.\u201cI am here, and as long as I stay here I will continue to be me.\u201dEven if it melts, it falls again.\u201cI am the main seat of the Demonic Cult.\u201dMaster recited the declaration of war.\u201cI request our 990th battle.\u201dEverywhere, it was silent.The noisy Righteous Sect suddenly became quiet.The oldest of them and the youngest of them\u2014they were all last heroes of the Murim world. They came here thinking that it would be the last battle of the great war.How could they act rashly?If their last words were their wills and testaments, they wanted the words to be the will of the Righteous Sect.And the people of the righteous path turned to the one who represented the will of the sect.\u201cMurim Lord. Namgung family.\u201dThe old man bowed.\u201cTaesang Family Head. Namgung Un.\u201d \u201cI am the Ax Saint.\u201dOne thousand Demonic Cult members and one thousand Righteous Sect members faced each other.\u201cYour Demonic Cult made the screams of the common folk into your doctrine. The screams turned to revenge, and the revenge turned to genocide, painting the world red with blood. Blood-stained spirits, full of vengeance! You\u2019ve turned the heavens and the earth red, but you still pretend to be the weak.\u201dThe one who had risen as the lord of the Murim world, with his own voice, explained the difference between the demonic path and the righteous path.\u201cYou ceaselessly cry and grab at the hem of the Heavenly Demon. You beg her to take your place, to take on the evils of the world for you. And as you grabbed onto her sleeves, it became clear that you are weak and pitiful people!\u201dThe old lord bellowed.\u201cWrong! You too have hands and feet. How long will you dwell on the evils of the past? The Buddha said that if a tree wants to bear fruit, it must throw away its flowers. But what are you doing? You sell your pain like a florist sells flowers!\u201dIn response, a group from the Demonic Cult growled.The cultists grabbed the hilts of their swords. Their malice rose and killing intent bloomed. Standing against them was the Righteous Sect\u2019s fighters, ready to fight.Neither side would have any chi, but the air in the snowfield turned savage.\u201cWell.\u201dThe corner of Master\u2019s mouth tilted upward.\u201cI suppose this means you accept the challenge.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cTo surrender, or to the death?\u201d\u201cTo the death.\u201d\u201cI accept.\u201dThe two fighters broke their stances.Shiiing!At the same time, a thousand Demonic Cultists and a thousand Righteous Sect fighters drew their swords. It was midday. Two thousand blades shone brightly in the sunlight.\u201cChildren of the Demonic Cult!\u201dMaster clenched her fist.\u201cYou can think of today as a dream or a hallucination!\u201d\u201cBaraya!\u201dOne thousand cultists cried all at once.\u201cPerhaps this is all just a vain dream!\u201d\u201cBaraya!\u201d\u201cIf so, shouldn\u2019t we live like it\u2019s a dream?\u201d\u201cAgabaraya!\u201d\u201cOur hearts are candles!\u201d\u201cBurn this place!\u201d\u201cFor the Demonic Cult!\u201d\u201cFor the common man!\u201dMaster burst into laughter.\u201cKill them all!\u201dThe war began.One thousand cultists roared and ran like beasts. There was no clever footwork. There were no interesting techniques. They rushed like beasts and bit like beasts. It was their war according to their doctrine.\u201cYou hypocrites! I am Demon Lord Wolyeong, the first rank of the Four Demon Lords of our sect! Taste my blade!\u201dThe Demonic Cult\u2019s Shadow Corpse Squadron.Squadron leader.Demon Lord Wolyeong.\u201cI am Hyun Gong Jin, the faction leader of the Mudang Buddhists! I see there\u2019s no shortage of worthy opponents!\u201dMudang Buddhist Faction.Faction leader.Hyun Gong Jin.The two men clashed with each other as they yelled. The only courtesy between them was their self-introductions. The fight itself was brutal.\u201cHraaaap!\u201dDemon Lord Wolyeong punched Hyun Gong Jin with the hilt of his sword. Puk! Teeth. Blood. White shrapnel exploded and red liquid splattered.\u201cOoooh!\u201dHyun Gong Jin yelled, revealing his broken teeth. Then he lifted his fingers and stabbed Demon Lord Wolyeon\u2019s eyes. Puk! With the popping sound, \u201cHahahaha!\u201d Demon Lord Wolyeong was overcome with laughter. The Buddhist\u2019s cries and the cultist\u2019s laughter intertwined.Another pair of opposites was beside the two of them.\u201cOf the Four Demon Lords. First rank. Flame Ghost Demon. I will take your head.\u201dThe Demonic Cult\u2019s Memorial Squadron.Squadron leader.Flame Ghost Demon.\u201cMay Buddha have mercy. I am called Jomyeong.\u201dShaolin Temple.Chief monk.Monk Jomyeong.\u201cWith respect to the head monk, I, the first rank of the Four Demon Lords, will allow you to attack me three times first.\u201d\u201cThe Buddha will surely remember your respect!\u201dAt the words of the Flame Ghost Demon, Monk Jomyeong immediately attacked. He wrapped prayer beads around his fist and swung it. The Flame Ghost Demon, who said he would allow him three attacks, immediately ducked down and headbutted the monk\u2019s stomach. \u201cKuhh!\u201d Monk Jomyeong groaned, then scoffed.\u201cYou said you were yielding the first three hits.\u201d\u201cDid you really believe me?\u201d\u201cDo I look like I believed you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Drip. The sound of flowing blood interrupted his words. \u201cIt looks like you did.\u201dThe Flame Ghost Demon crumpled to the ground. His nose bone was broken. At the moment when the Flame Ghost Demon headbutted him, Monk Jomyeong lifted his knee up as if he had expected it to happen. Looking at the Flame Ghost Demon, whose face was stained from his nosebleed, Monk Jomyeong happily stroked his beard.\u201cMy acting skills have not gone rusty yet.\u201d\u201cYou piece of shit\u2026\u201d\u201cI still have two more hits to go!\u201dHolding both ears of the Flame Ghost Demon, Monk Jomyeong repeatedly struck him with his knee. Similarly, the Flame Ghost Demon hit the monk\u2019s knee with his forehead. Crack\u2026! It was the sound of the skull breaking a knee cartilage. \u201cKuhhhhh!\u201d Monk Jomyeong grabbed his knee in pain and hopped around.\u201cKuhahahaha! Th, those guys! They\u2019re fighting like common thugs without their chi! This is their skill! Amazing! The true faces of these Righteous Sect bastards are being exposed to the world. What a wonderful day!\u201dThe Demonic Cult\u2019s Assassination Squadron.Squadron leader.Sword Demon.\u201c\u2026\u2026You truly are vulgar.\u201dMt. Hwa Buddhist Faction.Elder.Thousand Sword Nanhwa.The two swordsmen clashed with their swords. Clang! As their swords hit, \u201cKuh!\u201d \u201cOoh!\u201d Both sides screamed at the same time and clasped their blades. Neither side could handle the impact caused by the collision of their blades.But neither let go of their swords.The Sword Demon grinned, baring his teeth.\u201cFuck\u2026 Stop being stubborn and just let go!\u201dThousand Sword Nanhwa replied through gritted teeth,\u201cThat\u2019s what I was going to say\u2026\u201dThe two looked each other in the eye and struck again. Clang! A breathless scream, then clang! The sound of swallowing unnecessary hope, clang! Hands and shoulders trembled. Both of them bled from where their grips had been torn. The blood that flowed from their lips and their grasps mixed together.But again, neither of them let go of their swords.The white uniform fluttered. The black robe shook. The sunlight fell over them, casting shadows on the field. Between the sun and the shadow, the Righteous Sect and the Demonic Cult clashed. Blood burst.\u201cFor the Demonic Cult! For the common man!\u201d\u201cAhhhhhhhhh! Die! All of you, die!\u201d\u201cYou phony bastards, come at me!\u201dA monochrome world.It was not splendid martial arts that flowed vividly there.It was only the red blood of humans.\u201cHuff, haha\u2026 Ahaha.\u201dAmong it was a particularly red smile.\u201cAhahaha! Hah! Ha, ahahahaha!\u201dShe was truly howling with laughter.\u201cThere really are a lot of Righteous Sect kids!\u201dMaster was shouting.\u201cGood. Come at me. Let us match our swords!\u201dA black shade ripped through the Righteous Sect\u2019s people. The sun seemed to rise and set at least ten times faster. The movement of the woman who suffered from disease for three years unable to use her chi stood out against the warriors who also could not use the same martial arts.\u201cThis is unfair!\u201dMaster laughed.\u201cHead monk of the Shaolin sect. Did you think you could kill the great me with that meager strength? You horse-faced Taoist. How arrogant to think you could withstand this cult\u2019s power.\u201dThese words were familiar to me.\u201cMt. Song is flooded with the grief overflowing from the world! The heaven and earth\u2019s grudge burns the mountain! The Demonic Cult is the peak of the Murim world, and I am the peak of the Demonic Cult! Are you qualified to deal with a god among gods?\u201dHowever, Master herself was unfamiliar with these words.\u201cYou shall not pass! Lackeys of the righteous path!\u201dMaster yelled.\u201cNamgung Un!\u201dSword clashed with sword and flesh bumped against flesh, but Master\u2019s cry pierced through all these sounds.\u201cWhere is Namgung Un?!\u201dMaster laughed and yelled again.\u201cCall the Namgung family and the Taesang family! Summon the Murim Lord here! No matter how dense the forest is nor how vast the sky, there is only one person who will receive the sword of my great self under this heavenly world! Four Demon Lords! Bring Namgung Un in front of me!\u201dThe sound of her laughter was red and ecstatic.\u201cHmm.\u201dThe old man walked step by step into a world that was turning redder.\u201cI remember the first day of the war.\u201dThe Murim Lord took off his shirt. The winter air was cold. The cold would be crushing because the Murim Lord could not use internal energy, but he seemed to embrace the cold. Muscles that were as dry as bones stiffened.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t come to a conclusion that day, so the great battle continued onto the second day. We couldn\u2019t finish it on the second day, so it was reserved for the third day. In the end, we started off wrong! When I think about it now, I should have used all my energy from the start.\u201dHoo.The Murim Lord took a deep breath.Then he straightened up and beckoned with his hand.\u201cCome on. Madu. Today, luck is on my side.\u201dThe Murim Alliance.Lord.Ax Saint.\u201cLuck, you say. Good.\u201dCrunch.Master stepped on the snow.\u201cYour luck today will be your doom.\u201dDemonic Cult.Cult leader.Heavenly Demon.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThey breathed in.The two stared at each other.A half breath.The two walked closer.When the two breaths met,Their hands attacked each other as well.\u201c\u2014\u2014.\u201dWhite.Flurries of snow whipped through the air.\u201c\u2014\u2014.\u201dBlack.Hair fluttered.Red.Blood splattered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82. <The World\u2019s Shabbiest. (2) >=========================Translator: thursdays QC: LightBrin\u201cAha!\u201dMaster laughed.\u201cAhahaha! Haha!\u201dHer nose bone was broken and bleeding. As she shed blood in the white snowfield, whoosh! Master swung her bare fist.\u201cHuhh?!\u201dThe fist hit the Murim Lord square on the chin. Master didn\u2019t miss a beat when the Murim Lord stumbled back. She ran. She rushed at him. She bit him.\u201cUgh!\u201dRip!\u201cKuggh, huff! Ugh\u2026! You\u2026 bastard\u2026!\u201dThe Murim Lord hurriedly pushed Master away, but his ears were already wet with blood. His flesh was ripped off with a squelching noise. \u201cKuhaa!\u201d A quiet scream rang through the snowfield.\u201cTch!\u201dMaster spat out the blood-stained ear in the snow. Master\u2019s mouth also tinged red. She smiled as if she was happy with the outcome of her hunt.A devil.She was like a bloodthirsty evil spirit.\u201cPfft! It tastes dirty! The Namgung family\u2019s lofty virtues do nothing to improve the taste of your flesh!\u201d\u201cOi, Madu. Heh. Seems like you don\u2019t enjoy human flesh anymore. Can you even call yourself a demon?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so old that you taste like rotten spinach. But there\u2019s some truth to what you said earlier.\u201dMaster wiped her mouth with the back of her hand.\u201cThe Great Battle of Good and Evil should have ended on the first day. Both you and I were holding back. I thought I was fighting with everything on the line, but in fact, I couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t really risk my life!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s fight is a second opportunity that nature wouldn\u2019t have allowed us.\u201dMaster looked at me.Her silent eyes contained warm and tender regard.\u201cWe can\u2019t foolishly repeat the same mistakes. Ax Saint. Today, I shall use up everything I have.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you going to use your true chi?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dInnate true chi.It was the energy that everyone has when they are first born. In other words, it was their life force. Unlike internal energy, true chi could not be artificially cultivated. If it was used, it was no more. And once it was used up, it was the end of the martial artist\u2019s \u2018life\u2019.They would die. Or become crippled.For martial artists, true chi was the last resort. It was a point of no return.\u201c\u2026\u2026Madu. You and I are weak anyway,\u201dThe Murim Lord said. Was it because he lost an ear? The Murim Lord frowned with a terrifying expression.\u201cIf we try to draw out your true chi now, we can only use it like a novice or a trainee, let alone as a master. Of course, there is no internal energy without our lower abdomen. It will be impossible to demonstrate our skills\u2026 Don\u2019t you know this?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cAre you intending to use up your true chi to show the martial arts of a trainee, at best?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dMaster smiled.\u201cDon\u2019t be angry, Namgung Un. I do not intend to throw away my life. I would never. I just hope that my inevitable last day happens to be today.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI now feel the full joy of being alive. I\u2019m grateful twice over. I\u2019m grateful to myself for surviving to this day, and I am grateful to fate that I may die today.\u201d\u201cEven though the world is destroyed?\u201d\u201cYes. I am grateful for all the connections I have made up to this very moment.\u201dMaster slowly got into a stance.Right hand forward. Left hand back.\u201cLooking back at it, I am truly happy as a warrior.\u201dHwaah!Snow flew through the air. It wasn\u2019t snow from the sky. A small maelstrom of snow swirled around Master. Her innate true chi had trickled out. The wind whipped around, centering on Master.\u201c\u2026\u2026I see. Is that so?\u201dThe Murim Lord accepted her wish with a clear face.\u201cAll right. I\u2019ve also longed for a day like today.\u201dThe wind flowed backward.\u201cLet\u2019s die together, Heavenly Demon.\u201dThe two ran toward each other.And as for me, I looked at the scenery as their life forces spilled onto the snowfield.Master smacked away the Murim Lord\u2019s hand. The Murim Lord stepped on Master\u2019s foot. Their arms crossed and their feet crossed, their true chi ceaselessly dripping from their bodies. It was a leakage that spilled their lives.The permanent snowfield that the sun couldn\u2019t melt mixed and melted into the lives of the two warriors.Master hit the Murim Lord\u2019s back. The wind blew. The wind flowed in the direction her fingertips pointed, and snow followed this path.In a world covered with snow, only the path through which the hands and feet of two people crossed slowly turned to the bare ground.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAnd that wasn\u2019t all.Little by little, rapidly, things that weren\u2019t white grew around the spot where Master and the Murim Lord fought. A weed. A bush. The ground elsewhere was still frozen with snow, but between the two fighters, the seasons bloomed.-They\u2019re being fed true chi.Bae Hu-ryeong said bluntly.-It\u2019s like a feast for the plants because it\u2019s the true chi of such masters. But even then, it\u2019s only temporary.Even if it was only a moment, the seasons were beautiful.The earth drank the true chi of the two people. Thus, heaven and earth briefly returned to what they were before they immersed in eternal winter.It was a forest of peach flowers.A peach tree grew and thickened as if time were accelerated. The peach trees resembled human fingers. The branches, crawling out from the ground, stretched their hands toward the sky like they were trying to grab something.Flowers bloomed.Through the petals of pink-colored flowers, through the cracks of the branches like fingers, Master and Murim Lord duelled.Their hands and feet moved with the intent to kill each other.However, covered by the petals, it looked like a dance, and as it took the lives of two people, it was an unnatural death.[1] Many things in the world are beautiful when covered by flower petals. Even killing intent. Even the poison of my master.-\u2026\u2026This is a rare event.The white snowfield.Red peach petals flew around.-Is it because one side was born with the ideal yin body and the other with a body for martial arts? The yin and yang have almost completely meshed together. Those two people are already in a world of their own\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen such a curious sight.The peach flowers bloomed and closed.Spring stayed, then passed again.\u201cMarch of the Heavenly Demon.\u201dMaster stepped forward. As the blizzard struck, the peach flowers scattered.\u201cDestruction of the Yellow Moon.\u201dThe Murim Lord grabbed her wrist and twisted it. The wind stopped, and the peach blossoms were in full bloom again.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe petals then were carried on the wind and buried my shoulder.It was only then that I knew.These red flowers were Master\u2019s blood. It was the blood of the Murim Lord as well.The petals bloomed from drinking the blood of these two people.\u201c\u2014I hate you and your people.\u201dWinter itself was bleeding.\u201cI hate you.\u201dMaster.\u201cI hate the Righteous Sect. I don\u2019t like \u2018heroes.\u2019 I don\u2019t like the Nine Great Schools. I hate the Five Noble Clans. You all are happy while the common man screams. So aloof. But it is not your happiness that I cannot forgive. Of course it wasn\u2019t.\u201dMaster.\u201cIt was that even people like you could be hurt.\u201dPeach blossoms bloomed and fell. The seasons passed. But the number of flowers that bloomed became fewer and the seasons became shorter and shorter.\u201cEven those like you said that things were painful. You made expressions of pain, spoke of pain, sought comfort and provided comfort. Like you were pretending to be human.\u201dMaster was dying.\u201cI am a detestable person.\u201dFlowers fell.\u201cSo why,\u201dThe seasons passed.\u201cWhy were you beastly to the others, but always human among yourselves?\u201dCountless peach blossoms covered the shadows of the two.In retrospect, it was a momentary dream, a quick scene in a book.The branches were dry. No more peach blossoms bloomed. The wind blew, and snow covered the ground again. Amid the fallen petals, Master and the Murim Lord stood tall.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dShake.\u201c\u2026\u2026Kk, euhp! Phew, haa\u2026!\u201dOver the red flower field, an even redder color was spewed.It was the blood of the Murim Lord.Master\u2019s tightly clenched fist had reached the chest of the Murim Lord. The old man stumbled like a mirage. Then, lightly, he fell. The red flowers rose up as if to accept the old man\u2019s body.Master stood still.\u201cMaster.\u201dNo answer came back when I called.\u201cMaster.\u201dI stepped toward her. I hastened. I ran, and I hugged Master\u2019s body that was still standing tall.It was cold.Her body was cold, like an ice field.\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d\u201cI won.\u201dMaster\u2019s voice was clear. The body heat that had disappeared from her body was still hanging onto her voice. But it was too light. Her fingers and body all became light in a moment as if she was rapidly aging.\u201cYes, you won. You won, Master.\u201d\u201cOriginally, I should have pierced his chest and grabbed his heart. But rather than piercing, I stopped at hitting. I showed my disciple a shameful face.\u201d\u201cNot at all. It wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d\u201cWell. My face is still in better shape than yours now. What sort of expression is that?\u201dI carefully laid down Master with my arms. I used Aura to cover her body. Even so, Master did not get any warmer. Pat. Even the fingertips that touched my cheek were as cold as icicles.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, disciple. I still have a bit of time before I die.\u201dTwo hours.\u201cIsn\u2019t that enough time to say goodbye?\u201dI only had two hours left to hear this person\u2019s voice and hear her breath.\u201c\u2026\u2026You\u2019re still crying.\u201dMaster looked sad.\u201cYou\u2019re making things difficult for your master. Well, I have also made things difficult for you. I wanted to take a long time to tell you everything, but this old lady\u2019s stubbornness prevented me from even that. I worry about what I will leave in your heart, what I will hand down to you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll leave a void in you,\u201d Master whispered, letting out a cold, bloody cough.\u201cI wish for you to remember me like one remembers the flower at the moment it bloomed\u2026\u201d\u201cDeath King-nim!\u201dI heard an urgent cry.It was the voice of the Alchemist. Maybe they just now realized that the Great Battle of Good and Evil had taken place in the snowfield, as the Alchemist and the party from the tower were running toward us.\u201cDeath King-nim, wh, what is this\u2026\u201d\u201cOi! Master!?\u201dThe Venomous Snake was surprised to discover the Murim Lord.\u201cAre you okay!? Hey, Master! Look at me! Open your eyes!\u201d\u201cThe old man is fine.\u201dMaster coughed again.\u201cThe last hit was shallow. It didn\u2019t go in deep. He was boasting that luck was on his side today\u2026 Being crippled is that fellow\u2019s luck.\u201d\u201cWh, what do you mean by crippled?\u201dThe Alchemist opened and closed her mouth again.\u201cI would never let him go in that condition\u2026 A-anyway we don\u2019t have time for this! Both of you need treatment!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. Take care of the old man.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026!\u201d\u201cI know my body the best. It\u2019s already over for me.And,\u201d said Master.\u201cI want to spend the last of my time with my only disciple.\u201d\u201cChild. Could you leave us two alone?\u201dThe Alchemist was both a pharmacist and a doctor. She approached and checked Master\u2019s pulse. She activated her skill to examine her patient\u2019s physical condition. The Alchemist\u2019s complexion turned dark.\u201c\u2026I have painkillers. Would you like some?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201dMaster smiled.\u201cThe winter wind is lovely. It\u2019s nice and cool for my heart. When I reach Nirvana, I want to feel this wind as it is now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Alchemist stood up. Her head drooped. She quietly bowed toward Master. The Medicine King, who was standing by without a word, beckoned and gathered the rest of the party. It wasn\u2019t long before they went back to the cave with the Murim Lord.They were being considerate of Master and me.\u201c\u2026\u2026Master.\u201d\u201cGongja.\u201dMaster held onto my hand.\u201cWhat shall we do with the remaining time? Did you want to hear about my childhood? Would you like to hear how beautiful the headquarters of our cult is?\u201d\u201cPlease.\u201dI, too, held Master\u2019s dry hand.There was still something left.Her life hadn\u2019t become perfect. There was still a missing puzzle piece, the one that would make sure that she enjoyed her greatest moments and would make a completely satisfying ending.\u201cI have a request.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cPlease have a match with me.\u201dMaster\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cHow unexpected. All disciples dream of surpassing their master, but as you can see, I cannot move any further. Gongja. What\u2019s the point of winning against a person who can\u2019t even move?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s not a match that involves the body.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cI want to compete against Master with words.\u201d\u201cA battle of wits, I see.\u201dA battle of wits.It was a match done not with the body but with one\u2019s mouth.One person starts by describing what skill they would use and how. When the other person counters the attack, they also explain how they would deal with it.Therefore, there was no need to move one\u2019s limbs. No internal energy was required.It was a fight that pitted two people\u2019s perception of martial arts.A confrontation of their knowledge.\u201cOho.\u201dMaster gently laughed.\u201cOur disciple is being quite arrogant. If we compete with our bodies, Gongja, you will be victorious, but your defeat will be inevitable in a battle of wits. I have many skills that I\u2019ve learned in my heyday, but you would fight with just the slight knowledge of the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art!\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201dI opened my mouth.\u201cI don\u2019t think that the match against the Murim Lord was your best, Master. You even said this. Originally, you would have pierced his chest and grabbed his heart\u2026 Even if it\u2019s just a verbal fight, I want Master to achieve the most satisfying match in the end.\u201dThe greatest fight with no regrets.That was the wish of all martial artists.\u201cGongja. Do you mean that you can show it to me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dMaster seemed to find my proposal interesting. Was she thinking that this was the childish thought process of her young student? She didn\u2019t seem to have any expectation that I could provide her with a satisfying match.\u201cAll right. However, I will not take mercy on you, even in a verbal match. I will allow you to go first, but don\u2019t resent your master too much if I end the match with one strike.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhen the match is over, I shall tell you the tales of when I was younger! Now, show this master the results of your training.\u201dMaster grinned.It was a smile that felt like a peach blossom.I looked down at Master\u2019s face and slowly turned to the man sitting across from me. I looked at the martial artist who had reached the peak not here, but in another world.-Hm.The Sword Emperor.-Is it my turn now?He was also someone who rose to be the greatest of all time in another world.Even though he could not fight with his body as a ghost, he could do a verbal spar by borrowing my mouth.\u2018Yes. Please fulfill the [promise] from when you lost the bet.\u2019-I will.Bae Hu-ryeong smirked.-I wanted to go up against the head of the Demonic Cult here anyway.He crossed his arms and sat on the snow.-I\u2019ll give her the greatest match of all time. Tell her that you will yield the first three moves.With me in the center, two godlike beings faced each other.~~~[1] Duel, dance, and unnatural death: \ube44\ubb34, \ube44\ubb34, and \ube44\uba85 respectively in Korean.

    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83. <Sword Dance. (1) >===============Translator: thursdays PR: LightBrin1.Heart\u2019s sword.So Baek-hyang stumbled over that stage after winter passed again and again, when she could no longer feel the cold of that winter.The sword of the heart.So Baek-hyang began to understand that stage when she was no longer referred to as \u2018the fragrance of snow,\u2019 but instead as the \u2018Heavenly Demon.\u2019\u201c\u2026\u2026I can see it\u2026\u2026\u201dSo Baek-hyang, the woman who became the Heavenly Demon, muttered.\u201c\u2026\u2026There is a stage ahead that no man has ever overcome\u2026\u2026It looks as far away as Nirvana, but\u2026\u2026Is there any place that you can\u2019t go if you can see it\u2026\u2026?\u201dThe Heavenly Demon\u2019s heart pounded.The heart\u2019s sword was a legendary stage that was only talked about. Killing someone with your mind. If you have the intent to kill, you hold these murderous intentions in your heart, and the person will soon die. There was no need for a sword. There was no need for words, either. And that stage finally presented itself in front of her.\u2026\u2026Heavenly Demon-nim\u2026\u2026If.\u2026\u2026.The greatest of us all\u2026\u2026If she was given time.If she had 60 years to focus solely on training.Really, if she had it.\u2026\u2026Release us from this pain\u2026\u2026The people prostrated themselves before her.\u2026\u2026The government told us to pay our tax with sable leather. My father went hunting for martens but didn\u2019t come back, so we couldn\u2019t pay the tax, and taxes are paid by the number of heads in our family. My grandmother told me that her days were short anyway, and to reduce the tax\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Heavenly Demon-nim\u2026\u2026In front of her, there were many backs stooped over in bows.\u2026\u2026There was a drought last year so we had nothing to eat, I had nothing to eat, but I was ordered to build a reservoir and a dam to prevent next year\u2019s drought, but how can one build with a starving body\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026They dragged my daughter away and she hasn\u2019t come back\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026Heavenly Demon-nim\u2026\u2026There were very many.The Heavenly Demon quietly looked up at the snowy mountain.Years to devote herself to training. If she only had 60 years, she would be able to rise to a stage that nobody in history had ever done. That was a clear, indisputable fact. However. Despite this.\u2026\u2026Guide us\u2026\u2026The Heavenly Demon stood up, holding her sword. The dark robe fluttered.\u2026\u2026There are many things that I must cut down\u2026\u2026Would she abandon the world? Or would she abandon herself?In the end, the Heavenly Demon simply abandoned her own desires.She stifled her desire for strength until she desired for nothing.Because that was how she had always lived.That day, too, she cut down those who froze the world.But she couldn\u2019t cut down winter.2.-Originally,Bae Hu-ryeong kneeled down.-It\u2019d be unspeakable for a martial artist to borrow someone else\u2019s mouth for a match. It\u2019s discourteous, and in terms of rudeness, it would go down in history and be ridiculed.It was my first time seeing Bae Hu-ryeong in such a posture. He was sitting politely on the snowfield. I realized that it was a courtesy that he was showing to an opponent he recognized as a [worthy rival].-But even though I know it\u2019s ridiculous, I have no choice but to ask for a match.The Sword Emperor looked straight at Master.-I am called the Sword Emperor. In the world of a thousand blades, I was officially recognized as its number one. It may be discourteous of me, but I request a verbal match between us.Then, he lowered his head.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDisciple\u2026?\u201dMaster blinked.\u201cCome on, describe your first move. The match has already begun.\u201dOf course, Master\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t see Bae Hu-ryeong. She couldn\u2019t hear his words, nor could she see his bow.\u201c\u2026\u2026Master.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cYou know that I can use some strange techniques.\u201d\u201cAre you referring to the technique that brought the Jiangshi of my children and the Righteous Path back to life?\u201dMaster laughed.Her laughter was quiet, as if it would soon disappear.\u201cI decided not to ask you anything. Silence is a virtue. Perhaps it\u2019s that you\u2019re an emissary sent by the Jade Emperor, who pitied me.\u201dMaster was smiling as her head rested on my thighs. When she laughed, her head shook a little. From that movement, I could tell that she was becoming lighter.\u201c\u2026There is another technique I can use.\u201dMaster\u2019s time was running out. I had to say things as concisely as possible.\u201cThe technique involves summoning ghosts.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cThe ghost next to me right now is a skilled martial artist. In another world, he was called the greatest.\u201d\u201cA-ha. The greatest martial artist in another world! How magnificent.\u201dMaster snickered. It seemed that she thought it was a funny joke.\u201cAll right. Since it\u2019s a ghost of the greatest fighter in another world that my student summoned, I\u2019ll pay attention. I\u2019ll happily accept you as my opponent for a battle of wits.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI looked at Bae Hu-ryeong.Bae Hu-ryeong continued to sit in silence.\u201cWell. What kind of move does the number one ghost have to offer?\u201d\u201c\u2026He said he would yield the move to Master.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cHe said that he would yield the first three moves to you, Master.\u201dA bit of the smile disappeared from Master\u2019s expression.\u201cWhat a maniac. My disciple would never say such a thing. It must be the ghost that does not know his place. Then, with the fifth blade of the Twelve Cloud Dragon Swords, the Outward Dragon Quick Sword, I pierce the water blood point.\u201dThe first move.-I shall use the sixth form of the Earth Dragon Style, Western River Cave Dragon, feinting and then retreating with the Floating Cloud Step.Bae Hu-ryeong responded without hesitation.I didn\u2019t know what the [Twelve Cloud Dragon Swords] nor the [Earth Dragon Style] was. The only thing I knew was the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art. I was just calmly communicating their fight with my mouth.\u201cHe used the sixth form of the Earth Dragon Style, Western River Cave Dragon, feinting, and then used the Floating Cloud Step to retreat.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dMaster furrowed her brows.\u201cThen I will blow him away with the seventh form of the Ultimate Mysterious Art, the expected reaction.\u201d-I shall avoid it and feint with the second move of the Six Boxing Attacks, Double Sheet Attack.Master\u2019s elegant eyebrows crinkled a little more.\u201cI will attack with the sixth form of Six Equal Grave Swords, Sword of Disinterment.\u201d-I use my Perching Duck Kick. I step back with the All Blossom Chaotic Step.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThree turns ended in an instant.I couldn\u2019t understand what kind of battle was unfolding between the two.However, Master was silent.-You.Bae Hu-ryeong calmly opened his mouth.-I can roughly imagine how you lived. After climbing to the top rank in your sect, you devoted yourself to your group without time for training. You could have entered the stage of life and death, but you didn\u2019t. Why? Because you were busy. 24 hours in a day is not enough to take care of a sect. You must have been busy taking care of your family, the members of your cult. What time would you have had for training?But, said Bae Hu-ryeong.-You know what\u2019s the most unfair part of this?The corner of his mouth twisted.-Even like this, you were still the strongest.You had no reason to aim higher.-Why? You\u2019re already at the top. It was enough to survive, and everyone acknowledged your strength. There was no need to try. Because you were literally their god.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d-Poor thing. Your misfortune is that you were the absolute strongest in this world.Bae Hu-ryeong crossed his arms.-Let me show you what a god among gods is like.I didn\u2019t repeat these words to her.I didn\u2019t feel like there was a need to.\u201cHm.\u201dMaster slowly raised her head.Her light body leaned on mine a little.With that, she sat up in the snow.\u201cYou\u2019re not just for show.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon.From the Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon.The strongest of all time.Demonic Cult.-Of course. Who do you think I am?Sword Emperor.From the World of a Thousand Blades.The strongest being under the heavens.Righteous Sect.\u201cFine. I shall take you seriously.\u201d-Come at me.A martial arts match.It began now.3.\u201cI use the first form of the Flaming Blood Dragon, Ascending Explosion to strike your chin.\u201d-You\u2019re suddenly acting like the Righteous Sect, for some reason. With the upward momentum, I\u2019ll continuously use the Eight Great Cloud Dragon Techniques for one second. While one hand was being gathered into a fist, the other hand struck.One turn.\u201cI\u2019ll use the third form of the Assassination Sword, the Scholar\u2019s Strike, to attack your fortune spring point and kill the momentum of your Ascending Explosion.\u201d-Oh, interesting. What should I do? Should I receive it, or\u2026 All right. I\u2019ll use the Precept of Life and Death along with Cove Surge Thread.Another turn.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs the battle of wits continued, Master started to run out of breath.The white breath of winter turned even whiter.Master closed her left hand and squeezed my knee tightly. With her right hand, she clenched my hand. She was trembling. Master\u2019s trembling passed on to me through her hands.\u201c\u2026How long are you going to keep your dirty foot over my fingers? I\u2019ll tear it off with Burning Leech Boss Plate, the second form of the Three Seeds Demonic Scriptures.\u201d-I was only matching your aura. What a ferocious temper you have! I\u2019ll immediately take my feet off and onto the air with Running Wave, simultaneously using the fourth form of Great Godly Chariot Rotation, Living Death, to hit the right giant bone, sun valley, and spirit home pressure points at the same time.\u201cI will take three steps back with Heavenly Demon Step!\u201dMaster was delighted.-Since you pretended to be the Righteous Sect, should I try to imitate the Demonic Cult\u2019s techniques, too? They responded with the other sect\u2019s moves.That was right.The Murim Lord, the Ax Saint, was never really Master\u2019s [rival].It was true that the Murim Lord was the strongest member of the Righteous Sect in this world. He was the only one who was able to stand against Master. But wasn\u2019t it proven in the final battle? When the two fought each other with all their power, it was Master who eventually won.The game had a fixed ending.Maybe that was why Master delayed the conclusion of the Battle of Good and Evil 990 times.She was like a child who cherished and savored a piece of candy as long as possible because she knew it would melt away.\u300cI\u2019m sorry.\u300dThat was why in the bad ending, the Murim Lord said those words to Master.\u300cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m weaker than you.\u300d\u300cI was weaker than you.\u300d\u300cKill me.\u300dClasp.Without realizing it, I tightened my grip.\u201cA foolish act! I attack your face with the second form of Assassination Sword!\u201d-You wish. I use the Iron Burning Plate to evade your attack, and this time, I use Ascending Explosion on your other side.\u201cAha.\u201dMaster finally smiled. It wasn\u2019t a sad smile, nor a smile that looked like it would evaporate away. It was a bright laugh, backed by the pounding of her heart.\u201cDisciple. The ghost you brought in is the best!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dNow I could fully understand the feelings of the Murim Lord.\u201cHe\u2019s probably the strongest person I know.\u201d\u201cWhere were you hiding these ghosts, and why are you only introducing them to me now?\u201dI was a little upset.\u201cI\u2019ve never met such a powerful martial artist before!\u201dNo.I was very upset.\u201cI twist your arm and stop your force. And I take four steps back with Heavenly Demon Step!\u201d-Hmm. You\u2019ve already gone back three steps, and now you\u2019re going another four. Are you running back with your tail between your legs? I go forward with the Floating Cloud Step and follow you, then use Sudden Midsummer Rain. I then carry it out with Sword Force.\u201cHa! Sword Force with Sudden Midsummer Rain? I guess you\u2019re tired of searching for me. Fine then. I use the Sword of Thirst to strike upward against you, then use the first three forms of Lower Sand to strike the heaven pillar, nape, and life pillar all in a row!\u201dFor me\u2026 The match between the two was incomprehensible.I couldn\u2019t even imagine the fight in my head.I understood the Sword of Thirst. However, I didn\u2019t know what [Lower Sand Dragon] was. I knew what Running Wave was. However, I didn\u2019t know what sort of form [Living Death of the Great Godly Chariot Rotation] was.It all kept going over my head, and I wasn\u2019t even allowed to hesitate while trying to picture it.I could not see the match between the two at all.-You have to attack like that. Great! I use the Butterfly Sword Style\u2019s Precept of Life and Death to dodge and step back, then use Ultimate Fertile Heaven Sword!\u201cNot bad. Not bad at all!\u201dAh\u2026If possible, I wanted to become her rival.If possible, I wanted to monopolize her hopes and be the one to grant her wishes.I wanted her to spend the last of her life happy because of me.But I couldn\u2019t see it.What I can see and hear, at best, was:\u201cGood. I\u2019ll use the \u25a0\u25a0 technique to get out of the way.\u201d-I\u2019ll respond with \u25a0\u25a0, the third form of\u00a0 \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Sword Style!Only something like this.I could not see the swords of the two masters.\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll counter with the second form, \u25a0\u25a0 of \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0.\u201d-I\u2019ll follow up with the \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 method of \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0!The words didn\u2019t make sense.\u201cFine. I\u2019ll stab your \u25a0\u25a0 and \u25a0\u25a0\u00a0 with \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u2019s \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Sword Style!\u201d-You sure are in a hurry. I\u2019ll dodge using \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0, then use \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 to aim at your neck.\u201cI\u2019ll deflect it, then use the tenth form of \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0, \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0, to attack your \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0!\u201d-With \u25a0\u25a0, I\u2019ll \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 and \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0. After counterattacking, I\u2019ll twist the \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 using \u25a0\u25a0 of \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 to \u25a0\u25a0.\u201c\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0, using \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 to \u25a0\u25a0 and \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u2014.\u201dIt was dark.I was far from reaching their playing field.\u201cAfter deflecting it\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was then.Master, who was breathless, looked back at me.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dSuddenly, time seemed to stop.Master\u2019s gaze.The silent gaze stayed on my face.\u201c\u2026\u2026Right.\u201dThere was a small smile on Master\u2019s lips.\u201cDisciple. The day is cold.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe season repeatedly falls into winter, and so this area is known as a permanent snowfield. The snowfield is a harsh battleground. When you step forward, you often fall into the snow, so you have to continue using movement skills.\u201dMaster touched the snowfield with her finger.The porous snow was smeared on Master\u2019s fingertips.\u201cSo a battle on the snowfield always focuses on breaking the other person\u2019s posture. Disciple. Do you understand? You don\u2019t have to stubbornly cut off the person\u2019s head or stab their back. It is enough to push them until they can\u2019t hold their movement skill.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why your ghost and I are trying to take over each other\u2019s space. If you steal their space, your opponent will have a smaller range of movement.\u201dMaster.\u201cThere\u2019s also a reason why we are using kicks. It isn\u2019t just to hit the other person. Kicks scatter the snow and obscured the other\u2019s sight. Mm. It\u2019s quite a frantic fight. Isn\u2019t it?\u201dMaster whispered in my ear.\u201cClose your eyes.\u201dMaster\u2019s left hand slowly covered my eyes.\u201cCan you picture your master\u2019s opponent?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cIt is a strong and noble master. He\u2019s a large man. He\u2019s nearly twice my size. Right?\u201dIn my head, I pictured Bae Hu-ryeong.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThe giant, bear-like master is breathing unevenly. He\u2019s urging you to attack and smiling confidently. There is a big difference in our physiques. Of course he\u2019s confident\u2026.\u201dThe more Master spoke, the clearer Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s figure became in my mind.\u201cHow can I overcome the difference in our natural physiques? I have to accept it. Accept it, but think of my own strengths. I am able to move faster than him. Most of all, I am more familiar with the snowfield. And I am more adept in using my skills than he is\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cPlay the long game. Do you understand, disciple? I am aiming for a drawn-out battle.\u201dMaster laughed, then said playfully,\u201cBut my opponent sees through my intentions. His movements become impatient. His sword cuts faster. He\u2019s running toward me like a wild boar\u2014.\u201dSoon.\u201cBut there is nothing to be scared of. I had already foreseen this. I step back, lightly, retreat back\u2014.\u201dMy eyes.\u201cI drag him in.\u201dThe landscape was drawn before my eyes.\u201cI keep walking backwards. My footsteps continue to be light. He acts like a wild boar, rushing in and throwing snow around in all directions\u2014.\u201dThe winter repeated, and the world turned into a permanent snowfield.Master stepped back.Bae Hu-ryeong rushed forward.\u201c\u2014Snowflakes fly away with each step we take.\u201dI, too, started to be able to see their swords.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84.\u00a0 < Sword Dance. (2) >===============Translator: thursdays PR: LightBrinWinter.\u201cIt\u2019s snowing.\u201dMaster\u2019s footsteps were light.\u201cIt has already been two days since our match began.\u201dShe stepped lightly, so lightly on the snowfield as if she would slip on the ice.A world covered in white.The black hem of Master\u2019s clothes flowed like a brush on white paper.-How long are you going to run away?There was another brush following after her.Its strokes were tougher, stronger, and more intense than Master\u2019s. It was a brush dipped heavily in ink and pressed hard on the paper.-If it\u2019s a movement skill, I won\u2019t lose to you.With heavy steps, Bae Hu-ryeong broke the ice under his feet, rushing forward where his gaze hit like a bulldozer.\u201cI am confident that I can keep running forever.\u201d-But there will still be an end to it.\u201cDon\u2019t you know? This world is an endless field of snow. There may be no place to go, but there is an infinite number of places to run.\u201d-I won\u2019t leave you be.Bae Hu-ryeong kicked the snow with a chwak, dashing forward.-If you were in your prime, maybe you could run away forever. But this match is between us as we are now. If we\u2019re counting the rest of your life, you don\u2019t even have two hours left. The sand in your glass is falling quickly. Are you still going to run away?\u201cOho. How unfair.\u201d-Life is unfair.Bae Hu-ryeong swung his sword.\u201cYou have a point.\u201dMaster turned her head and easily avoided the attack.\u201cI don\u2019t have much time left to live. I can\u2019t continue running away.\u201d-At some point, we have to end the match.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason that that point shouldn\u2019t be now.\u201d-Now you\u2019re talking my language.\u201cIf so.\u201d Master grabbed the hilt of her sword. \u201cI shall show you my maximum power.\u201dInfernal Heavens Demonic Art.First form.Sword of Starvation.\u201c\u2014Starvation, like parents exchanging their own child with their neighbors\u2019 to eat them.\u201dThe sword parted the winter wind with a scream.\u201cHave you heard the tale of an adult who baked the neighbor\u2019s child into jerky and buried them in the snow? Have you heard the rumors in the village? Did you hear that if you dig at the snow on the side of the village road, your shovel will discover young flesh at each plow?\u201d-How sad.Shiiing.Bae Hu-ryeong blocked Master\u2019s blade with his sword.-It must have been a famine year.\u201cThat\u2019s right. A famine is like an epidemic that always returns.\u201d-But that\u2019s just chance.Bae Hu-ryeong was hit by the cold gust, and swung his sword again.-Good harvests happen by chance, as do famines. It\u2019s nothing more than coincidence. Sect leader, if you mourn so much over accidental tragedies, you should celebrate accidental blessings just as much.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d-The depth of one\u2019s sadness should be equal to the height of one\u2019s happiness.Shiiing.The two swords clashed.A red plum flower fell.-So, I shall sing of the happy autumn harvest.Snowflakes descended like falling leaves.-There are days when I looked at the horizon as I walked down the street. It was a day when the golden sea of rice stalks stretched to the horizon. Young children played hide and seek among the rice paddies as tall as them. Laughter thundered and weaved in and out of the rows of rice plants.Autumn.The wind blew.The mountains and fields turned red with autumn leaves, and the horizon turned yellow with rice stalks.-You talk of children\u2019s flesh buried in the snow? Then I\u2019ll talk of the children\u2019s laughter as they play under the bountiful produce.It was a world full of crimson maple leaves fluttering to the ground.Bae Hu-ryeong swung the sword.-Either way, the days are both results of chance. If I have to put something into my heart as I swing my sword, I will think of the sound of laughter. When I think back on life before I die, I will think of the children playing hide and seek. It\u2019s an obvious choice.\u201cReally.\u201d Master sliced through the leaves. \u201cWhat a blessing!\u201dInfernal Heavens Demonic Art.Second form.Sword of Thirst.\u201cBoth cases are by chance, you say. Of course it is. But happiness does not kill a person. The suffering from starvation, the pain of thirst, can kill! And if you die, you\u2019re dead forever. It\u2019s the end.\u201dThe sun began to set.\u201cI shall sing of the people who died, unable to drink a sip of water!\u201dSummer.A heat wave covered the world.All the vegetation on the mountain dried up.Weeds turned yellow. Fruits shriveled up, the beetles crawled slowly, and hundreds, thousands, ten thousands of fish corpses were scattered along the side of the river. Flop. The fish\u2019s round eyeballs were desiccated.-Ah.Master\u2019s sword became sticky.Bae Hu-ryeong parried the sword, but Master did not back down. Rather, she clung to him even closer. It was close combat. They were so close to each other that they could feel the opponent\u2019s breath. Chaang! Shing! Sword quickly countered sword, so fast to make one\u2019s eyes dizzy.-If you wash and swim in the summer, it\u2019s really cool.Bae Hu-ryeong parried Master\u2019s quick sword.-You\u2019re teaching Gongja wrong.\u201c\u2026What?\u201d-Sorry. My words were a little harsh. Rather than teaching him wrong, you\u2019re teaching him too early.Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s sword flowed like water.-It\u2019s good to talk about the pain of the world. It\u2019s also good to look at other people\u2019s suffering. But that isn\u2019t something to be done forever.\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d-It\u2019s just that it gets tiring.Shiing!Red lily flowers bloomed.-This Gongja kid still hasn\u2019t tasted the wonders of the world.Suddenly, his fighting style changed.-He has to taste its delicacies. It\u2019s only when he tastes it he can further understand the sorrow of those who would never be able to feel the same. He needs to swim in the summer. He needs to swim in it so that he can feel the pain of those desiccated and weak. A human heart is like a candle. So long as it keeps burning, it will burn out one day.-Cult master, did you know? This kid still has never fallen in love! He\u2019s never been in a relationship!His attacks poured down like a waterfall.-But he already acts like he\u2019s carrying all the pain and sadness in the world. What an act! Ha. He shouldn\u2019t even dream of it. Even if your cult teaches kids young, he\u2019s way too young for this!It showered like rain.-I\u2019m going to teach this kid how to be happy.The rain poured.-I\u2019ll teach him how to laugh without a single lie. I\u2019ll teach him how to put his arm around someone\u2019s shoulders. He should be able to learn how to be happy with someone. Only then can he learn endless sadness!\u201cYou\u2026.\u201dThe rain poured over the dry earth. The river became fuller with the rainwater. As the river\u2019s level rose, it swallowed the corpses of the fish on the banks. Violet morning glories opened up to drink in the raindrops.The sound of frogs croaking.\u201cYou plan to be my disciple\u2019s master?!\u201dInfernal Heavens Demonic Art.Third form.Sword of the Drowned.-That\u2019s right!\u201cHow dare you!\u201dIt was like a ceaseless stream of rain.The sword struck again and again.\u201cWho do you think you are to covet my direct disciple?\u201dMidsummer.The monsoons caused many floods.Countless rose petals floated down the river.-Ha! Is this a joke? I\u2019d planned to be his master first!The reservoir collapsed, and the village was locked in the water. The water rose up to the feet of the mountains. On top of the rising water, Master and Bae Hu-ryeong kicked at each other. Splish. Splash! Waves erupted from where the two people stepped.-I was the one who taught this guy how to take the heads of orcs! I was also the one to teach him how to utilize Aura! I raised this brat with no talent in the martial arts until he could use it somewhat! And now, you\u2019re interfering and being a bad influence!\u201cYou\u2019re calling me a bad influence?!\u201d-Yeah! The Demonic Cult is a bad influence, duh!The two glided around on the surface of the water.One was chased.The waves bloomed at his feet with a splash.The other was chasing.Gently, her toes traipsed on the rose petals.The two cast shadows over the waves and petals.-Swinging a sword should be fun!The smell of water on a rainy day.The aroma of the flowers was thick.-Gongja is not ready for the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art! It\u2019s a sword that wields pain, understands pain! What\u2019s that supposed to be? It\u2019s too much of a demonic art! But he still needs to smell the flowers and feel joy under a summer shower!\u201cGongja is! My disciple! He was born to be the next master of this sect!\u201d-It\u2019s because you think so that I\u2019m calling you a bad influence! You second-rate master!Hundreds and millions of roses.Before long, the flooded river was no longer visible. There was no sign of the water. The rose petals had covered its entire surface.The world blazed red, becoming a flower garden.\u201c\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0, \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0. \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0.\u201d-\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0, \u25a0\u25a0, \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0. \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0!Spring.Flowers flowed.Red peonies bloomed and flew into the air.\u201c\u2014\u2014Governing Red Chaos Sword\u2019s sixth form, Sword of Balanced Chaos, to slice your neck.\u201dShiing!Two petals gave way to her blade.-I take two steps back with the Center Snow Step.I could see it.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll send you flying with the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art\u2019s seventh form, Sword of Blunt Impact.\u201dI could hear it.-I\u2019ll use the Ocean Blossom Strike Style\u2019s fourth form, Falling Harvest Moon, to confront you.I could see the two people\u2019s swords.I could see the pressed peonies underneath the two people\u2019s feet.The red peonies\u2019 aroma burst as they were stepped on.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI could see it at last.Master was\u2026 The Demonic Cult\u2019s headmaster, the Heavenly Demon, was losing.\u201c\u2026\u2026I will resist you with the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art\u2019s eighth form, Sword of Incineration.\u201dUnder the sky of peonies, Master\u2019s blood spilled.It was bloody.The difference between Master and Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s skill was clear. No matter how long she tried to perpetuate the battle, it was impossible for Master to outrun Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s pursuit. And from attempting the impossible, Master\u2019s arms, legs, and shoulders bled red.-Mm.Bae Hu-ryeong got into a pose.-I\u2019ll cut you off with the Old Remains Flower Sword\u2019s first technique, Sword of the Moonlit Night.The sound of Master\u2019s breathing became a little thin.Her chi was running out.It would be overambitious for her to try for mutual death by using her true chi.\u201cI\u2026\u2026.\u201dMaster opened her mouth.\u201cI originally couldn\u2019t complete the final form of the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art. This was for one reason. I had been set on using the death from my youth, death by freezing. Freezing to death after being left behind in a snowfield by my mother. That was what I considered to be the penultimate death.\u201dMaster raised up her sword high.\u201cBut.\u201dThe tip of her sword pointed to the sky like an hour hand at noon.\u201cParadoxically, I was able to complete the ninth form of the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art after the world had been destroyed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHeaven and earth, it was my ego.\u201d\u201cWhether I looked up at the sky or walked beneath it, I was alone. Baraya. Baraya. Agabaraya. The world is winter, and a lone candle burns. If I sing, it is the song of the whole world, and if I die, it is the death of everything. It\u2019s white. It\u2019s turning white, and whiter still.\u201dHer sword.It cut the heavens.\u201cMy infernal heaven is the testament of the snowfield.\u201dInfernal Heavens Demonic Art.Ninth form.Sword of Freezing.\u201c\u2014\u2014.\u201dThe winter cut through the spring.The red petalled sky split apart. And in its cracks, a white winter raged. It raged and descended. Petals turned to snow, and the hundreds of millions of peonies became hundreds of millions of snowflakes, freezing the world.It was a lonely sword.The attack sang of the Heavenly Demon\u2019s lonely death.-Of course.As the winter torrent struck him, Bae Hu-ryeong calmly looked up.-A lonely death. Is this the death the leader of the Demonic Cult chose? Fine. I\u2019ll accept it. It\u2019s the perfect attack for the last warrior of a fallen world.A lonesome smile hung on Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s mouth.-But when it comes to solitude, I know it better than you.Bae Hu-ryeong gripped the hilt of his sword.-How long did you last by yourself in this world? Three years? Two? No. You haven\u2019t lasted a single day. After all, that fellow called the Murim Lord was by your side. When the Murim Lord dies, you lose your mind.The tip of his sword moved.-I\u2019m sorry, but.Then.-I\u2019ve endured 130 years by myself.Martial arts.Void Form.First sword............The peony flowers were,......Winter, spring, summer, autumn,Autumn, winter, spring, summer,Summer, autumn, winter, spring,Spring, summer, autumn, winter,Plum blossoms and peonies and roses and lilies,Lilies and plums and peonies and roses,The petal, to petals, petal, because they were petals,Red, was red, became red, red,Winter was,Because it became red,Again the winter,The winter,Her breath,......Because it turned heavy,............\u201c\u2014\u2014.\u201dI regained my breath.\u201c\u2014-Aah!!\u201dI couldn\u2019t see.I couldn\u2019t hear.I couldn\u2019t understand the last attack at all.\u201cHaaa, huff, euahh\u2026! Haa, aa\u2026.\u201dHowever.There was something more important than understanding the sword right now.\u201cMas\u2026ter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cMaster, are you alright\u2026? How is your body?\u201dMaster stared wordlessly at the winter sky. Her eyes weren\u2019t focused. Thump. My heart leaped. I fumbled to hold Master\u2019s hand. Fumbling over and over again, until I could find her pulse.It was beating.She was alive.She was still alive.\u201cMaster.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dMaster slowly opened her lips.\u201cI see,\u201d Master said.\u201cSo it was like that.\u201dSaying so, Master looked into my eyes.\u201cDisciple.\u201dHer dark pupils.\u201cMy disciple. You\u2026 From the beginning, you were only thinking about how to help me.\u201d\u201cSaying that you came here from the outside world out of admiration for me\u2026 That was a lie. It was a bright red lie. Why didn\u2019t I see it before? My disciple isn\u2019t one to cross the world infatuated by a reputation\u2026\u2026\u201dHer voice.Master\u2019s voice kept becoming smaller.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDisciple. Were you happy that you met me?\u201dI nodded.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWill you remember me as the single petal of a flower?\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to know what type of flower it is.\u201d\u201cA peony\u2026\u2026\u201d I replied.I held Master\u2019s body.\u201cI\u2019ll remember you as a red peony, Master.\u201d\u201cOho.\u201dMaster smiled.\u201cHow pretty.\u201dShe brushed her hand against my cheek.\u201cHow pretty\u2026\u2026\u201dThen.With her other hand, Master beckoned to the heavens.It was a weak and light gesture, like a baby bird flapping its wings.\u201cMy disciple\u2026\u2026\u201dWithout a sound.Without a single sound, the snowy mountain was cut.The mountain, cut in two, remained there as if it had always been like that.Master exhaled a white breath.She must have been trying to dream a white dream.\u201cMaster\u2026\u2026\u201dI buried my face in Master\u2019s shoulder. In the stopped breath. In time. To the person who was born with the scent of snow.\u201cYou\u2019ve cut through winter. Master\u2026\u2026 You cut down the winter.\u201dThat day.The winter of one world was cut.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85. <A Reader\u2019s Mind. (1) >===================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha PR: LightBrinI held onto Master for a long time.Even if a person\u2019s breath ends, their body remains.Death was a cruel and merciless thing.\u201cSir.\u201dA long time later, I heard a voice calling me. The warriors in black uniforms, the elites of Demonic Cult, were surrounding me.Even as I silently held onto Master, the Battle of Good and Evil raged on. Eventually, the Demonic Cult won the war.\u201cSince we were in the middle of a fight, we couldn\u2019t confirm it, but\u2026 Several cult members overheard that our sect leader called you [disciple].\u201dThe warrior asked nervously,\u201cSir, are you the Heavenly Demon-nim\u2019s successor?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI looked around.All the Demonic Cult members who survived the battle were staring at me, including the ones that Master had called the Four Demon Lords. Some of them had nosebleeds, cut-up lips, arms that were chopped off. All of them, soaked in blood, waited for my answer with bated breath.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know if I am.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t our sect leader accept you as a disciple?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dI clung a little tighter to Master\u2019s cold body.\u201cI am Master\u2019s disciple.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe man\u2019s face hardened.\u201cIf our sect leader accepted you as her disciple, she must have taught you the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art. This request may be rude, but please. Sir. Demonstrate the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art in front of us.\u201dHis tone was polite, but he clearly meant that he couldn\u2019t believe I was the Heavenly Demon\u2019s disciple without evidence.\u2018I\u2019m being treated as an heir just by being Master\u2019s disciple.\u2019I realized then. Why did Master hesitate so much about taking me as a disciple? It was because being a direct disciple of the Heavenly Demon meant inheriting the leadership of the Demonic Cult.Now, as the last of Master\u2019s warmth left this world, the mantle of cult leader fell onto me.\u201c\u2026All right. Is it enough if I use the Sword of Starvation?\u201d\u201cYes. The sect leader said clearly that [if it is even slightly unsatisfactory, do not accept them as my successor]. We may not be renowned swordsmen, but we have enough skill to discern the skill of other individuals.\u201dThe other sect members began to whisper around us.\u201cHey. What\u2019s the Bloody Demon talking about?\u201d\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t understand? If you look at him do one technique of the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art, it\u2019ll be clear if he really is the Heavenly Demon\u2019s disciple.\u201d\u201cReally? But why is that bastard acting like our representative?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think we have anyone else who can act polite. He\u2019s from the Moyong family. Though he\u2019s an illegitimate child.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d That son of a bitch is from the Moyong family?\u201d\u201cHey. Why are you acting so surprised? I told you this dozens of times before\u2026.. Whatever. A river is a river, a mountain is a mountain, and a blockhead is still a blockhead no matter how much you try to educate him.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m saying that your cancerous existence is comparable to the Sichuan Tang clan\u2019s poisonous arts. Sword Demon. As evidence of that, I am currently suffering from cancer. You are an amazing being when you consider that I have mastered Thousand Poison Immunity.\u201d\u201cOh? Is that a compliment?\u201d\u201cFucking blockhead sonuvabitch.\u201d\u201cAhem.\u201dThe Bloody Demon coughed. Then, he eyed the cult members who were handing back. It was a very dignified look. He seemed to be quietly pressuring the others to shut up.However, the Sword Demon and the Flame Ghost Demon tilted their heads.\u201cWhat are you looking at? You wanna go?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re being rude. Go stare somewhere else. It feels gross.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Bloody Demon turned his head again and looked at me. His eyes seemed to say something like, [Nothing weird happened just now.]\u201cAha.\u201dI laughed a little.\u2018That\u2019s right. It was originally this sort of place.\u2019The Demonic Cult was made up of people who were mostly uneducated, falling back on the strength of their bodies. My Master was refined and graceful, but on the whole, the Demonic Cult members were naturally ignorant about etiquette and manners.\u201cHunger is\u2014\u201dI did not draw my sword. I didn\u2019t want to bear a weapon while I was holding Master\u2019s body. Instead, I coated my left hand in Aura and struck.The attack carved into the snowfield.\u201c\u2014children, waiting for the sun.\u201dFlinch.The Bloody Demon, who acted as the representative of the Demonic Cult, and the cult members who had been clamoring about all became silent. In the snowfield, my attack dug a deep valley into the ground that looked like a wound.I didn\u2019t finish with showing them just the first technique. Second form. Third form. Fourth form. All the techniques that I had learned to the extremes, I focused on my fingertips.Our surroundings became quiet.Was it thanks to glimpsing the desperate battle between Master and Bae Hu-ryeong? Suddenly, the power of my strikes were sharper than before. This was another thing that Master arranged.\u201cI haven\u2019t fully learned the other techniques yet. It would be embarrassing to show you.\u201d\u201cIs this much all right?\u201dCrunch!The Bloody Demon kneeled in the snow\u201cI greet the successor of the Demonic path. The new Heavenly Demon.\u201dBehind him, the Flame Ghost Demon, the Wolyeong Demon Lord, and the Sword Demon prostrated themselves, one after another. Crunch, crunch. Snow was crushed beneath their knees. All the cult members who survived the Battle of Good and Evil fell to their knees on the field.\u201cWe greet the successor of the Demonic path! Our sect leader!\u201dI slowly opened my mouth.\u201cThe title of Heavenly Demon is too much. I am already known as the Death King, and I would like Master\u2019s title to be forever in her name.\u201d\u201cHowever\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cCalling me the sect leader is also excessive.\u201dI turned my head. By my side, Bae Hu-ryeong was silent, arms folded and eyes closed. He was probably going over the match against Master in his mind. I looked at Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s face, then told the cult members,\u201cI\u2019m still lacking in many areas. I have nothing that I could teach you. How can I call myself the sect leader?[1: \uad50\uc8fc is the term, meaning literally \u201cschoolmaster\u201d] That would be a title just for the sake of having a title.\u201dThe Bloody Demon looked to be at a loss.\u201c\u2026Heavenly Demon-nim, in her entire life, never chose the wrong person. Since she has accepted you as her direct disciple, you are certainly fit to be the next sect leader.\u201d\u201cThank you. However, I judge myself as still insufficient to take on the mantle of the cult\u2019s leader.\u201dThe cult members began to murmur.\u201cW-well then, how should we address you? We can\u2019t continue calling you \u2018sir\u2019\u2026\u201d\u201cYoung master,\u201d someone suggested.\u201cCan\u2019t we call him \u2018Young Master\u2019?\u201dIt was the Flame Ghost Demon. He was the cultist who said he would yield three turns to the Shaolin monk. His nose was still broken, and dried tracks from his nosebleed were on his upper lip.\u201cCalling someone \u2018Young Lord\u2019 or \u2018Young Heir\u2019 is common enough. If you are just saying that you\u2019re lacking to become our cult\u2019s master and not that you\u2019re refusing the lord, it should be all right to call you \u2018Young Master.'\u201d\u201cHuh.\u201dI nodded. That much was acceptable.\u201cThat sounds fine.\u201dThe cultists sighed from relief. They looked at me with more comfortable expressions.\u201cYoung Master. I\u2019d like to thank you formally. I don\u2019t know what kind of technique you used, but we all remember being bitten by the Jiangshi. If it weren\u2019t for Young Master, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to finish the Battle of Good and Evil and show our allegiance to Heavenly Demon-nim!\u201dThe martial artist bowed.\u201cI am the first rank of the Four Demon Lords. Bloody Demon. I command all of the Blood Guard. On their behalf, I swear loyalty to Young Master.\u201dDozens of cultists bowed along with him.\u201cI am the first rank of the Four Demon Lords. Flame Ghost Demon. I command all members of the Memorial Squadron. I swear allegiance to Young Master.\u201d\u201cFirst of the Four Demon Lords. Demon Lord Wolyeong. The Shadow Corpse Squadron swears loyalty to Young Master.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the Sword Demon! With the Assassination Squad, I promise you our loyalty.\u201dDozens more.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI slowly placed Master down.Master looked like a flower blooming on the white snowfield.Placing down the single peony petal, I bowed to the Demonic Cult members.\u201cIt is my wish that as long as my life does not end, the doctrine of shadows will continue on.\u201dIt was at that moment.[Stages cleared.][You have cleared the quest, \u2018Remake the World. Volume 1\u2019!]How long had it been since I heard this voice?[Today, the 22nd floor Stage has been cleared.][Announcing to everyone again.][Today, the 22nd floor Stage has been cleared.]It really felt like a long time since I heard this.[Calculating challengers.][Calculation complete.]Not releasing my stance, I spoke.\u201cI have a request for everyone.

Death KingRank 2. AlchemistRank 3. Venomous SnakeRank 4. Medicine King+\u201cDon\u2019t make the funeral fancy. Master wouldn\u2019t want it that way. Master will be happy if you just stay where you are until the funeral ends. For Master, please\u2014.\u201dPlease. I didn\u2019t finish my sentence.I didn\u2019t have to, nor could I finish it.In the blink of an eye, I was no longer in the snowfield.\u201cWelcome. Death King-nim.\u201dThe Great Library of All Things.\u201cI\u2019ve been anxiously waiting for you!\u201dThe Constellation, the Librarian, smiled and looked at me.2.\u201cCongratulations!\u201dThe Librarian was floating in the air.His 5-meter-long sleeves fluttered like goldfish fins.\u201cHmm. The last word in [The Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon] was the word \u2018please.\u2019 Hmm. The word \u2018please\u2019 is a wish for someone. Wish, prayer. In the Demonic Sect, they memorized it as \u2018Baraya.\u2019 \u2018Please\u2019 and \u2018Baraya\u2019 can be regarded as synonyms. In that sense, it\u2019s a really suitable ending\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cJust a moment.\u201dI ended the Librarian\u2019s long lecture.I felt a sense of [discomfort].This was my second time coming to the Great Library. I stayed up several nights reading books. I had become quite familiar with this place.However, I could clearly see something different from last time.\u201c\u2026Why are all the other hunters passed out?\u201dThe Hunters who participated in the Apocalypse challenge.All 250 of them, Hunters who had titles and nicknames, were collapsed on the floor.\u201cHmm.\u201dThe Librarian raised the corner of his mouth.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I just put them to sleep for a while.\u201d\u201cPut them to sleep\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s a fragrance that\u2019s harmless to the human body.\u201dThe Librarian reached out his hand. Dozens of books floated around the Constellation. One of them was a book titled [The Story of Yeonhyang City].\u201cThere are many worlds like yours that communicate with words, but there are also worlds that communicate with songs and others still that communicate through scent. In this Apocalypse, people talk with the scent of anger, the scent of sorrow, and the scent of joy.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cOf course, there\u2019s also a scent of sleep.\u201dI was tense and alert.\u201cAh, please don\u2019t look at me with those eyes. I wanted to talk to Death King-nim, so I made the surroundings quiet for a while.\u201dA talk.\u201cWhat kind of thing are you going to tell me after making my colleagues faint?\u201d\u201cAh, [colleague]. As expected, Death King-nim! You can regard them as tiresome, useless luggage, but you say it so naturally that you think of them as colleagues. I have no choice but to shed another tear at the admirable heart of Death King-nim.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI could see every move that your party made from here. It was like a movie. It was a moving and exciting scene. Really. Everyone here would have welcomed you enthusiastically.\u201dThe Librarian giggled.\u201cBut if I let them, it would have been a long time before I could speak with you! Since my turn would be pushed back by a lot.\u201d The Librarian shrugged.\u201cI had to settle down the others for a moment so that I could talk with you. Don\u2019t worry. Even if it looks like this, I used the most moderate method to put them to sleep.\u201dIt was hard to believe.I looked around my surroundings. I saw the Witch. She was leaning against a bookshelf with her long hair hanging down. I approached the Witch and lightly searched for her pulse.Thump.Thump.Thank goodness.Her complexion looked fine and her breathing was normal.After checking that my colleague was safe, I looked back at the Librarian.\u201c\u2026If you have something to say, please say it quickly and wake everyone up.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you hurrying too much? I want to talk more slowly with the two of us. I deliberately left the other challengers to summon just you.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t finished everything on the 22nd floor yet. I also have to find a sword\u2026\u201d\u201cNext time.\u201dThe Librarian\u2019s eyes looked like an upside-down half moon.\u201cYou can investigate later.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe air was filled with tension.The Librarian was small, so some people may look down on him. However, he was someone who could summon strange monsters from another world at will. Didn\u2019t he swallow up 50 hunters at once last time?\u2018No matter how much I\u2019ve learned of the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art, I\u2019ll lose for certain if I fight him now.\u2019I swallowed my spit.\u201c\u2026What do you want to talk about?\u201dThe Librarian\u2019s smile deepened.\u201cIt\u2019s a very intimate story.\u201dFlutter.The Librarian fluttered his sleeves and landed on the floor. He approached me and pulled something out from his sleeves.\u201cMm.\u201dIt was a pair of scissors.\u201cWhy scissors, all of a sudden\u2026?\u201d\u201cYour hair is quite long. Death King-nim. I will trim it for you.\u201dThe Librarian tiptoed and started to cut my hair with a snip, snip. He didn\u2019t cut much. Maybe about half of the hair from the back of my head? The Librarian put the cut hair in a red silk pouch.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYour nails are long, too. It\u2019s a big problem if someone who claims to be a martial artist doesn\u2019t care for their nails. I\u2019ll clip them.\u201dThe Librarian pulled another object out of his sleeves.It was a nail clipper.The Librarian grabbed my right hand and cut my fingernails. He did all of them, from the pinky to the thumb. And each nail was put in a different silk pouch.Um.\u201cHey, Librarian-nim?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do with these?\u201d\u201cDeath King-nim.\u201dThe Librarian stooped his back. He kneeled on the floor. And, as if it were natural, he took off my shoes.\u201cSay that you really, really, really like someone. Really.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll try. Why?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you don\u2019t like about that person, from their toes to their head. It\u2019s love. It truly is a noble and pure love. But the problem is that the person doesn\u2019t exist in reality, but only on paper. It is a character that exists only in a novel.\u201dThe Librarian took off my socks.\u201cBut then, tada! What providence is this? My ideal novel character appeared in front of my eyes.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cNow. At this time, what do you think I feel about Death King-nim?\u201d the Librarian said seriously.As he held a toenail clipper.\u201cYes. That\u2019s what it is.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like that.\u201dWhat\u2019s like what?\u201cAh, ah! Don\u2019t move! What are you doing? If you move, my nail clippers may leave disgusting scars on your marble-like toe! That\u2019d be a big problem!!\u201d\u201cWhy are you getting angry at me?! Get away from me right now!\u201d\u201cWait a moment! Just a moment, please! I\u2019ll stop with just your pinky toe! Just one toenail! You can concede this much, right?\u201d\u201cWhy is a Constellation acting like such a pervert?!\u201d\u201cAh! Ah! If you don\u2019t want to give me your toenails, how about three eyebrow hairs?\u201dOnly then did I realize the source of my [discomfort].\u201cYou weren\u2019t the type to speak so politely before!\u201dThat\u2019s right.The Constellation, the Librarian, did not use honorifics like \u201c-nim.\u201d He used to speak while looking down on us. That was definitely how it used to be, but now, for some reason, he was using honorifics for me. This was why I felt something was off.\u201cUse your normal speech patterns!\u201dThe Librarian\u2019s lips wobbled.\u201cImpossible! H-how could I, a lowly creature, dare to speak down to the shining Gongja-nim?!\u201dThis was insane.[The Librarian wants your pinky toenail clipping.]Totally crazy.\u2018Character window!\u2019While I was struggling, determined to not give up my toenails to the Librarian, letters popped up in front of me.+Name: Chief LibrarianFavorability: 95Favorite Genres: [Fusion], [Romance], [Mystery], [Adventure], [Horror], [History], [War], [Sports], [SF], [Myth], [Fairy Tales]\u2026Disliked Genres: N/AFavorite characters: [Character], [Constellation Killer]Hated Characters: N/AFavorite Plot: [Story]Hated Plot: [Serial Discontinuation]Psychological State: \u2018Toenails!

A favorability rating of 95.And the scene of what happened when the favorability rating reached that high was unfolding in front of me right now.\u201cGlowja-nim! Until I met you, I was only the blind Shim Bongsa!\u201d the Librarian shouted, squatting as he grabbed the soles of my feet.[1]\u201cI was deaf until I heard you speak!\u201dThe Librarian\u2019s eyes seemed to sparkle as he tried to clip my little toenail.\u201cYou are my light! You are my music!\u201dHis eyes were scary.\u201cSince your name means Confucius, I\u2019ll gladly convert to Confucianism! I will be a scholar only for you! Ah, a king needs a friend-like retainer who shares his opinions! From today onwards, I am a Confucian scholar who supports Gongja-nim!\u201d\u201cHey. Just- Hey!\u201dWhat kind of demented scholar tries to collect someone\u2019s pinky toenail clippings?!I wanted to ask the Librarian that question, but I stopped when I saw his eyes and realized. He wasn\u2019t in his right mind. His eyes showed that no matter what I said, he would clearly ignore it. First of all, his breathing was ragged.\u201cIf you keep acting like this, I won\u2019t enter any more Apocalypses!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dPause. The Librarian let go of my feet. Creepily, his fingers still twitched even as he stopped manhandling my feet. Was he crazy?The Librarian pondered over his thoughts like a scholar in deep sorrow.\u201c\u2026\u2026Indeed. It\u2019s an effective threat.\u201dFor a moment, I was relieved that my words had worked.\u201cBut analyzing Gongja-nim\u2019s character, that\u2019ll never happen.\u201dWhat?Character analysis?\u201cIt\u2019s because Gongja-nim knows. There are many other characters like the Heavenly Demon who are withering away unjustly in the other Apocalypses. Considering Gongja-nim\u2019s personality, you won\u2019t be able to resist helping those people.\u201dThe Librarian smiled.\u201cDon\u2019t look down at a Gongja-maniac. I know Gongja-nim better than you know yourself! I can describe the energy bars that Gongja-nim ate on the first day you entered the Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon, what hand you used to do it, what sort of expression you had, all over two pages\u2026\u201dHe must be crazy, right? This is crazy. He\u2019s crazy.\u201cNow, Gongja-nim. Be obedient and give me what you should give me! I was being shockingly conscientious when I didn\u2019t force you to sleep with the scent.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also shocked by your conscience.\u201d\u201cGongja-nim can\u2019t understand. Nobody has ever understood me before. Ah, alas! How terrible is it that I\u2019ve never been understood in my life? How cold is such a human heart? Even so, if I understand Glowja-nim\u2026..\u201d\u201cStep away from me before I say [I hate you].\u201dThud.This time, the Librarian really stopped.\u201cTake five steps away from me. Otherwise, I\u2019ll really say it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Librarian meekly stepped back.\u201cPlease use your normal way of speaking. It\u2019s kind of gross. Seriously. And please return my hair and my nails.\u201d\u201cI cannot! Y-you\u2019re being completely unreasonable!\u201dHis old way of speaking had returned.The Librarian was crying while hugging the silk pouches tightly.\u201cI\u2019d rather that you cut my head off! No. Wait, just a moment. Gongja. Right now, that was a hyperbole. Please don\u2019t make that expression, like you\u2019re really deciding whether or not to cut off my head\u2026 That will seriously hurt my feelings\u2026..\u201dLike a disheartened hamster, the Librarian began to mutter.Eventually, I succeeded in calming him down.After burning up a silk pouch of unpleasant things (there was a terrible scream involved), the Librarian and I managed to start talking for real.\u201cIt was magnificent.\u201dFirst, the Librarian reviewed the newly completed [Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon].\u201cYour dedication to the Heavenly Demon was truly admirable! I could see the [ending] when you became her disciple. But you didn\u2019t stop there! The final Battle of Good and Evil\u2026. The greatest match\u2026 Yes, the Heavenly Demon must have felt like she was eating sweet chocolate ice cream.\u201d\u201cHas the world from the [Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon] been transferred to the 22nd floor?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe Librarian grinned.\u201cOther hunters will be able to enter the 22nd floor. They\u2019ll also be able to learn skills by looking at the texts stored in the Cheonmugwan. It\u2019s all thanks to your work, Gongja.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI put my hand on my chin.\u201cThere was something I was wondering about while we were in the Apocalypse. I want to ask you this\u2026.\u201d\u201cAsk me anything! I\u2019ll answer almost anything!\u201d\u201cStop trying to sneakily take off my shoes like there\u2019s nothing wrong. Why was [The Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon] an Apocalypse?\u201dThe Librarian cocked his head to the side. My question seemed to be unfamiliar to him.\u201cWhy? Hmm. Does a book need a specific reason to be an Apocalypse?\u201d\u201cI think so.\u201dI put my shoes back on.\u201cLibrarian-nim, do you like happy endings? Or do you prefer sad endings?\u201d\u201cBoth of them have their merits,\u201d the Librarian replied immediately.\u201cAn ending is like a port where the characters\u2019 lives come to a conclusion. Life can be happy, or it can be rough! A general reader wants the characters to be happy, but I also want to hug them tightly when they fail or are sad.\u201d\u201cWhich means that even unhappy endings are still proper conclusions.\u201d\u201cYes. Obviously.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I have more questions.\u201dI grabbed the Librarian\u2019s wrist, which was trying to go behind my back, and took away the scissors. The Librarian hopped up and down, trying to take back the scissors, but he wasn\u2019t tall enough.\u201cEven if I didn\u2019t interfere, the [Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon] would have a proper conclusion. Even if it is sad.\u201d\u201cMaster and the Murim Lord did their best up to the end. They continued making an effort. Even though the Murim Lord died first and Master went mad\u2026 Master still reached the conclusion.\u201dI looked into the Librarian\u2019s eyes.\u201cWhy was [The Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon] included as an Apocalypse? Library director-nim. Why didn\u2019t the Murim Lord\u2019s death and Master\u2019s madness count as a proper ending?\u201dIn fact, I was thinking about this question ever since I saw the fairy tale, \u2018Me and Our Scapegoat\u2019. Apart from whether or not I could accept the ending, the world looked like it had reached a logical conclusion.The Constellation was silent.In the library, there were only the quiet breaths of the knocked-out hunters. Saek, seeeek\u2026. Among the rising and falling of the Hunters\u2019 chests, the Librarian was expressionless.\u201cI wanted to see a happy ending for some reason. Would something like that reason not work?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t like the ending, Librarian-nim can fix it yourself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cLibrarian-nim is strong. In the eyes of a Hunter like me, you seem to be omnipotent and omniscient. But even so, instead of fixing the apocalypse, you sent us.\u201dIn other words, this Constellation was a \u2018reader\u2019.He was a reader who didn\u2019t want to intervene in the story but just receive it as it was. He had no desire to ever be a \u2018writer\u2019. He could correct the wrongs, but he refused to do so.A reader who would never intervene himself.The Chief Librarian.\u201cShall I do a character analysis, too? A thorough person like you would not call something an Apocalypse just because the ending was weird. The Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon and the other Apocalypse, too. In fact, there\u2019s another reason that the Apocalypses are classified as such.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah, you won\u2019t just let this go.\u201dThe Librarian smiled bitterly.\u201cFollow me.\u201dThe Librarian grabbed my hand. With the other hand, he picked up a book.The title of the book was the Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon.\u201c\u2014I will tell you the truth of the Apocalypses.\u201dThe Constellation opened the book.Then, my vision was covered with light.3.When I opened my eyes, we were in the world of snowfields.However, we did not need to walk on the snow. The Librarian was still holding my hand tightly, his long sleeves fluttering like the wings of wild geese in the winter sky.\u201cWhat if.\u201dOver the snowfield.\u201cWhat if the zombie virus was a disease that developed on its own in [The Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon]? If that was the case. As you said, I would never have called this place an apocalypse.\u201dWe crossed a snowy mountain.\u201cThat means\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe zombie virus did not originate here. It\u2019s a contagion that flowed from outside. It is as if the New World was invaded by external forces.\u201d[2]Haaa. The Librarian let out a white breath.\u201cOver there, you can see it.\u201dIt was a high mountain peak.The sacred mountain of this world.On top of the mountain, which reached up to the sky, there was something huge.[Shiny has detected an ominous energy.]The Holy Sword by my waist trembled.Noting that, the Librarian said,\u201cOho. It seems that your sword can feel it too. That\u2019s not unusual. Since your sword had originally been a whole Constellation. It is a given that one quickly recognizes others who are in similar positions to them.\u201d\u201cA similar position\u2026.\u201d\u201cGongja. Have you ever seen a Constellation\u2019s fallen form?\u201dFallen. The Devil King of Fall Rain. The demon.\u201cYes, I have.\u201d\u201cThen, have you ever seen the body left behind by the death of the constellation?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAs expected, you haven\u2019t.\u201dThe Librarian had a lonely smile.\u201cIt\u2019s quite the rare sight, so take advantage of this opportunity to see it.\u201d\u2018It\u2019 was a dragon.More precisely, it was the corpse of a dragon.A dragon lay dead at the mountain\u2019s peak.The leather, which once had been smooth like silk, was burned black. The horns on the dragon\u2019s head rustled like coal. Its magic pearl, broken into two, was buried in the snow.Also.[Shiny detects the presence of her sisters.]There was a sword embedded in the middle of its chest.[Shiny says that it is the Guardian Sword\u2019s second sister, the Sword of Compassion!]A black energy, takgi, flowed out of the sword.If we were talking about its characteristics, we could call it an Aura. However, it was not a normal Aura. It was similar to the one that covered the Devil King of Fall Rain. No, it was murkier than that. The surging takgi wrapped around the dragon and covered the top of the snowy mountain. When white snow fell on the mountain peak, the takgi immediately infected it and turned it black.-It hurts\u2026\u2026.Black snow.-It\u2019s painful\u2026\u2026.The dark eyes of the Black Dragon seemed to moan.-It hurts. It hurts, and\u2026\u2026.-It\u2019s agonizing.-It\u2019s painful. It stings. It\u2019s bitter. It hurts\u2026\u2026.For a moment, I was at a loss for words.\u201c\u2026Didn\u2019t you say that it was dead? Over there, that dragon is still alive even now.\u201d\u201cIt is already dead. What you see and hear is nothing more than a corpse\u2019s resentment. When an existence reaches the level of a Constellation, they cannot die graciously, even if they do die.\u201dThe two of us landed on the mountain peak.The black dragon was endlessly groaning on.Looking at the death of a Constellation, the Librarian\u2019s eyes seemed to be filled with regret.\u201cThe plague that your party called the zombie virus. The true nature of it is a curse.\u201d\u201cA curse\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. It is the curse left as the constellation of this martial arts world, [The Yellow Dragon who stays at the Dynasty Lake], died. It is a grudge of being unable to die even when dead. Even though they have already died, the corpse remains and must endure further agony. When they were infected with such a curse, the people of this world became Jiangshi.\u201dI looked up at the dragon\u2019s corpse.-It hurts\u2026\u2026.The host of the virus. The epicenter of the curse.The disease that destroyed this world began with that corpse.In the end, Master died because of the dragon\u2019s curse.\u201c\u2026If the Constellation didn\u2019t stab itself in the heart, it means someone else killed it.\u201d\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d\u201cWho is the culprit?\u201d\u201cYou already have a good idea of who did it.\u201dI ground my teeth.\u201cLefanta Aegim.\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201dThe Librarian nodded.\u201cHis nickname is the Constellation Killer. He is a person who crosses the boundaries of the world and kills Constellations.\u201dShiny said that a Constellation was like the representative of a world.\u201cAnd a world that has lost its Constellation is like a castle that has lost its ramparts. The likelihood that it will face an insolent destruction increases.\u201dApocalypse.A world where the representative died and all its inhabitants disappeared.\u201cWhy did he kill ordinary Constellations? He founded the Aegim Empire, so he should quietly act as the emperor of his own country. Why is he going around ruining worlds?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s something that I cannot answer.\u201dThe Librarian stared attentively at my face.\u201cI am only a reader. You pointed to me and called me omniscient and omnipotent, but this isn\u2019t true. I may be omniscient, but not omnipotent. I can know the truth of a world, but I cannot intervene there.\u201dThe Librarian, who had spoken self-deprecatingly, suddenly pointed at my waist.\u201cHowever, you are different.\u201dThe sword hanging by my side.\u201cYou, who can intervene, are intervening again. Whether you want to or not, you\u2019re fixing things that someone else has broken, one by one.\u201d\u201cOnce, it\u2019s a coincidence. Twice, it\u2019s a connection. But with the third time, it becomes an inevitability. You have saved an empire that had been abandoned by the Constellation Killer. You have taken the Constellation shattered by the Constellation Killer, and now, you have come to a world led to collapse by the Constellation Killer.\u201d said the Librarian.\u201cThe means of killing [The Yellow Dragon of Dynasty Lake] was both vicious and cruel. An ordinary person cannot even touch that sword. But you are able to. Gongja. You have created an inevitability with your coincidences and connections.\u201dI looked at the black dragon\u2019s corpse again.I muttered in my mind.\u2018Shiny.\u2019The Holy Sword trembled a little.[Shiny replies, \u201cYes, warrior.\u201d]\u2018How do I collect your sister sword?\u2019[Shiny says, \u201cYou just need to pull her out and touch the sister sword.\u201d]\u2018All right.\u2019I drew my sword.The winter air split.I struck the sword embedded in the black dragon\u2019s chest with my sword.[The Guardian Goddess absorbs a piece of herself.]In an instant, my sword was surrounded by light.~~~[1] Glowja-nim: A portmanteau of Gongja-nim and glowing.Shim Bongsa: A blind man in a traditional Korean tale.[2] New World: As in the Americas.

(3) >====================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha PR: LightBrinA light flowed from my sword and covered the black dragon.[The Compassion Sword resists the absorption!]However, there was a substantial amount of rebellious energy working against me. Srrung! A dark malice inundated me like a summer monsoon of sewage.

But how should I prove my worth?\u201dTakgi continued to leak from the black dragon\u2019s body. It was throbbing\u2026 The malice was incomparable to what was there before. And that malice took on a shape.A dark angel.It was an angel made up of sooty water from toe to head.[I am a fragment made out of the goddess\u2019s compassion.][If you want to prove that you can be someone\u2019s idol\u2014] [1][You must prove that you can be compassionate.]The expressionless angel spread its wings.Even those wings looked murky.Black spittle dripped from the two open wings.[I ask you to leave your mind and body to me for a little while.]\u201cWhy should I?\u201d[To peek into your memories.]The light emitted by the Holy Sword became a little brighter.[The Guardian Goddess cannot agree to this.

Even if it\u2019s the greatest sword in the world, I wouldn\u2019t be able to stand the uneasiness. Come! Come and look at my memories or whatever until you\u2019re satisfied.\u201dIt was the moment I opened my arms wide.[The Compassion Sword is testing your compassion.]The angel\u2019s two wings covered my sight.

The fragment of the Constellation was still expressionless. However, the black eyes under his dark brows could not hide his bewilderment.[You are\u2026\u2026.]\u201cI\u2019m not perfect.\u201dI spoke first.\u201cI\u2019m weak for other\u2019s goodwill. I want to gain their favor. I can be a little unreasonable because of that. I really love being praised, and I struggle because I want others to see me as a \u2018good person.\u2019 Maybe that\u2019s my weakness.\u201dThe Constellation fragment closed its mouth.\u201cAnd your former owner wasn\u2019t perfect, either.\u201d[\u2026\u2026.]\u201cI don\u2019t know what sort of magnificent vision Lefanta Aegim had to kill the Constellations. Not yet, at least. Maybe he\u2019s doing it for noble reasons. But even if he has a good reason, I\u2019m still going to say that he did something wrong.\u201dI lifted my sword and pointed it at the black angel.\u201cIf you think your old owner was perfect and never did anything wrong, don\u2019t follow me. I don\u2019t need such a sword.\u201dThe black angel slowly opened her mouth.[Do you intend to kill Lefanta Aegim?]\u201cIf he deserves to be killed.\u201d[Can you promise me that your personal feelings will not affect your judgment of him?]\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dI was speaking honestly.\u201cMy master died. The world is ruined. Too many people were hurt and killed, so I don\u2019t know. But I promise that I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d[\u2026\u2026.]\u201cSo if you think I\u2019ll stray from the right path, do your best to correct me. I\u2019ll do my best. And you can do yours. That\u2019s what it means to work together.\u201dThe black angel\u2019s wings were crumbled.[My ability is pain.][The one who is cut by me feels pain, but I do not leave a scar on their body nor kill them.][Suffering without injury is my ability.]The angel\u2019s form collapsed.It collapsed and became black water.[New master.][I swear to serve you as best as I can.]Chwaaaak!The black liquid swirled and flowed into the Holy Sword I was holding. It was like a violent flood. The Holy Sword drank in all the water like a thirsty fox in the desert.[The existence of the Guardian Goddess has become more pronounced.]The changes didn\u2019t stop there.-Oh, oh\u2026\u2026..It was the mythical beast that had been the Constellation of this world.The black dragon groaned as the blade stuck in its chest was absorbed into my sword.-Oohhh\u2026\u2026.The black dragon had been killed a long time ago. It was like it didn\u2019t have enough of a mind to express anything in words anymore. The black dragon just murmured as if it were an old woman, tired of life.-Ohhhh, oh\u2026\u2026.Finally, the corpse of the Black Dragon turned into essence and flowed away.Its horn crumbled and shattered. Its scales melted like a candle. The beast that reigned over a world met its end.And the winter gave way.The permanent snow cap on the mountain crumbled apart. It was an avalanche.From the top of the mountain, I could look down at the snow that broke under my feet and poured over into the world.\u201cWinter is the season of death.\u201dNext to me, the Librarian also looked down at the landscape.\u201cYou\u2019ve ended this lonely season.\u201dA white avalanche swept over the white world. But what was left behind after the avalanche had passed was no longer white.The brown dirt of the ground could be seen.Brown was the color of this world\u2019s flesh. The long winter finally came to an end, and the ground began to bare its skin.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHow was it that the spring breeze was so different from the gusts of winter?Would Master know where the scent of spring came from?\u201c\u2026Library director-nim.\u201d\u201cYou can speak.\u201d\u201cI have a benefit from clearing the previous stage, so I can see people\u2019s natures. I can see the person\u2019s favorite plots and character type.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dThe Librarian exhaled.The breaths that we let out were no longer frozen white.\u201cI am the one in charge from the 21st to the 30th floor. The perks that you received were also prepared by me. Mm. Since I was the one who gave it to you, of course I know.\u201d\u201cYour preferred character is [the Constellation Killer].\u201d\u201cIt is.\u201d\u201cWhy do you like the Constellation Killer? Lefanta Aegim is a human who kills Constellations. I could understand why you would hate him, but I don\u2019t see a reason to like him.\u201d\u201cAhem.\u201dThe Librarian closed his right eye.\u201cSince you asked, I\u2019ll give you a special answer. For a long time, I have had a dream.\u201d\u201cA dream, you say?\u201d\u201cExactly. It is to make an appearance in a novel that I enjoy!\u201dThe eyes of the Constellation shone innocently.I was puzzled.\u201cIf it\u2019s appearing in a novel\u2026 Can\u2019t you do that right now? You can freely travel through the Apocalypses.\u201d\u201cHuhu. You don\u2019t understand the reader\u2019s mind, I see. [Appearing] in a novel is a bit different from [intervening] with the novel. No, it\u2019s very different.\u201dThe Librarian laughed, covering his mouth with his sleeves.\u201cFrom the Apocalypses\u2019 perspective, I am no different than an alien matter. An alien matter, an invasive species\u2026 An existence that should not naturally occur in that world. The Constellation Killer, who killed the dragon in the Murim world, is on the same level as I am in terms of being a foreign body.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut I do not want to intervene in a novel as an outsider! Nope. That\u2019s not allowed. I want to appear as a respectable character who has been in the world from the beginning, just like the other characters! This is my dream as a reader of the world!\u201dI still didn\u2019t understand.The Librarian looked at my face and laughed.\u201cThen, this time, I\u2019ll ask. Gongja. Why didn\u2019t you kill the Heavenly Demon?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe Heavenly Demon mastered how to kill with her mind in her final moments. Even though she was no longer as strong as she was in her prime, you could have used the Hundred Ghost skill on her and make use of her memories. The Heavenly Demon thought well of you, so she would have been a strong ally and an excellent master. So why didn\u2019t you kill the Heavenly Demon?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s.\u201d\u201cShh.\u201dThe librarian raised his index finger and blocked my lips.\u201cIt\u2019s all right. You don\u2019t have to say it. I already understand.\u201dSoftly.His fingers pressed against my lips.\u201cYou did not want to interfere with the last moments that your Master achieved. It\u2019s the same for me. I don\u2019t want to directly intervene with the end of the world. Your heart and mine are not so different\u2026.\u201dSuddenly, the scenery over the horizon melted.The sun shone over the lake where the ice road had collapsed and exposed the surface of the water.\u201cI refuse to intervene. That means that there is only one way I can become a character in a story.\u201d\u201c\u2026What is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s simple if you think about it from the other point of view. I don\u2019t go up to the protagonist of the novel; the protagonist comes to find me.\u201dThe Librarian whispered.\u201cLefanta Aegim. The Constellation Killer tirelessly murders Constellations and moves back and forth between different worlds. One day, he\u2019ll come to visit my world, the greatest library of all time.\u201dThe Librarian smiled.\u201cTo kill me.\u201dThe Constellation pulled something out of his sleeves. It was a book that looked no different from the other Apocalypses. But it looked more worn out than the rest. Did he take it out and read it dozens, maybe hundreds of times? Like an old writer\u2019s notebook, the book\u2019s leather binding was weathered.[The Epic of Lefanta Aegim]The title was engraved with gold thread on the leather.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI am waiting. For the day that the Constellation Killer will visit the Grand Library. I look forward to seeing him stand in front of me one day, following his own story and his own will. That day. I will finally appear in the story of Lefanta Aegim.\u201d\u201cEven if the conclusion of that story is your own death?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dThe Librarian smiled.The Constellation looked over the landscape of melting snow.His sleeves fluttered like a dancing crane.\u201cIsn\u2019t dying at the hands of the protagonist the greatest epilogue?\u201d4.I had wanted to give a eulogy.\u201cOh, Young Master.\u201dBefore returning to the library, I stopped by the cult members. I wanted to make sure that Master\u2019s funeral was being taken care of properly.\u201cWelcome back!\u201d\u201cWelcome, Young Master.\u201dAs soon as the members of the cult saw me, they bowed and greeted me. However, I felt that they were flustered for some reason. It wasn\u2019t just one or two people, but all of them who were rushing away.I tilted my head.\u201cIs the funeral over already?\u201d\u201cN, no. Young Master.\u201d Well, the funeral is still\u2026.\u201d\u201cDid something happen?\u201dThe cult members exchanged looks.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe body of Heavenly Demon-nim has disappeared.\u201dThe Bloody Demon, one of the Four Demon Lords, said. He was the cultist that Master often called the leader of the Blood Guard.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll understand more quickly if you see it. Young Master.\u201dI hurriedly walked where the Bloody Demon led me.Shortly thereafter, I arrived at the place where I had let down Master\u2019s body.Then, I was at a loss for words.\u201cSuddenly, the snow all over the world began to melt. Heavenly Demon-nim\u2019s body also disappeared\u2026. I apologize. It was so sudden, in the blink of an eye, that we had no time to react.\u201dWhere the snow melted.Master\u2019s body was not there.I couldn\u2019t see it no matter where I looked.\u201cWe think that Heavenly Demon-nim\u2019s internal energy was so pure that as time passed, her body naturally melted and disappeared\u2026\u201dHowever, a red flower was blooming there.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dIn the last place Master had laid. Where her arm touched the ground. Where she planted her feet. Where her hair flowed. There, reddish peony flowers were in full bloom.-Amazing.Bae Hu-ryeong, who had been silent until now, muttered.-The Constellation of this world died and left only a curse, but your master died and left behind a flower. Your master is better than that empty Constellation.I approached the flower bed and bent down. I touched the peony petal with the tip of my finger. The petal trembled a little, staining my index finger red as I rubbed it.It was the first spring in this world.\u201cOf course, we\u2019re still preparing the funeral,\u201d the Bloody Demon said from behind me.\u201cWe had hoped that Young Master would be able to attend\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dI shook my head.\u201cIt\u2019s all right. Don\u2019t carry out the funeral.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThis is enough.\u201dI stood up.I turned my head to look back at the cult members.\u201cAlthough I received the mantle and became the young master, I\u2019m sure there are those of you who cannot accept it yet. We live by strength. It is customary for the strongest warrior to arise to the highest position of a sect.\u201d\u201cInstead of a trivial funeral, let\u2019s substitute it with a sword match. It\u2019s also probably customary to offer what is the most valuable object at a funeral. And do we not value our swords the most? So, let us offer our swords to Master.\u201dI laughed.\u201cCome at me.\u201dSpring was coming.Like all living people do.My next story would begin on a stage a little higher than the last.~~~[1] Idol in the religious aspect, as in a representation or symbol of an object of worship (definition courtesy of Merriam-Webster)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88. <Dead Ends are the Norm. (1) >======================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha PR: LightBrin1.\u201cI\u2019m moving the headquarters of the Chen Mu-mum to the 22nd floor,\u201d said the Venomous Snake.It was a few days after our group conquered the [Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon].\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI decided to move. We\u2019ll move the whole dojo. Just as you inherited the will of the Demonic Cult, I became the disciple of the Murim Lord, you know? And Chen Mu-mun is my guild. Therefore, it\u2019s only right that they follow me to the Murim alliance.\u201dThe Venomous Snake calmly read the novel.Like I saw last time, the Venomous Snake was a fan of reading. Although his hobbies were very lopsided, there were a lot of books here that satisfied his weird tastes.The Venomous Snake, wearing glasses (no frames, just for style, market value of 9800 won), turned the page of a book with a magic cover (a hero-grade item that can be put on any book and change the title and cover design at will, market value of 2000 gold).\u201cMy teacher is also half-disabled, but he still has his arms and legs. The Alchemist somehow made it possible for him to move around. Therefore, I intend to place him as the Taesang Hobeop.\u201d\u201cThe Murim Lord as the Taesang Hobeop\u2026.\u201d\u201cYeah. He\u2019s heartbroken because the Heavenly Demon died. When I see that, I get all depressed,\u201d the Venomous Snake said bluntly.The Hobeop was the bastion of a clan. Literally, it means someone who watches over traditions. Among them, the Taesang Hobeop was the highest. The Venomous Snake was actually trying to set up the Murim Lord as the most important elder.\u201cIn that case, it\u2019s better that he\u2019s distracted. Such as by being busy teaching the younger students. It\u2019ll also help our guild members become stronger.\u201dI was a little surprised. Wasn\u2019t that really thoughtful?The Venomous Snake\u2019s hand stopped turning the pages of the book as if he felt my gaze.\u201c\u2026Oi, Death King. Why are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not. I was just admiring that the heads of the top 5 guilds are definitely something else.\u201dI had wondered how this ridiculous otaku was so popular with his subordinates, but there was a reason. It was because he took care of his people.\u201cI-is that so?\u201dThe Venomous Snake blushed and scratched his nose.\u201cAhem. Hmm hmm. D-don\u2019t get me wrong! I just did something that should be done. The world gets too melancholy if you praise someone for doing what is reasonable. Hoo, the world shouldn\u2019t become sad just because of me.\u201d\u201cWhat a bad feeling\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201dAnyway, I felt troubled when I heard the Venomous Snake speak.Taking good care of your people. It was a problem I had been thinking about even before I entered the Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon.I also reached the 3rd place ranking as a Hunter. But was it enough just to have a high ranking and know some martial arts? Popularity. Virtue. Wasn\u2019t this the time when I should develop such a mindset?Let\u2019s see.A person who I can say is one of \u2018my people\u2019 here\u2026.-Ah, I want another sword match. I really want another damn match. The overwhelming and diabolic sword fight. I\u2019m so hungry for a match with my life on the line. Zombie, let\u2019s go to a martial arts novel for the next apocalypse. This time, let\u2019s go to a Murim world where instead of the Demonic Cult, the Evil Sect dominates! Let\u2019s go to an Evil Sect masteeeerrr!!Um.No.This man isn\u2019t really\u2026.\u201cGongja! With special consideration, the main office has made nail cutters tailored for your fingers and toes! If you feel my handiwork as I snip, snip your nails, you\u2019ll never want to clean your fingernails and toenails yourself again! Just three minutes! No, just two minutes! Please leave your hands and feet to me for 120 seconds!\u201dNot this perverted Constellation, either.I reject him even more.[Shiny sings today as well. The brilliant feats of the Warrior-nim. The figure of the manly warrior who spoke so eloquently at the fortress of the Aegim Empire The struggle of the warrior who was as beautiful as he was desperate in the Murim world. Oh, Shiny is so happy to see the hero\u2019s esteemed face even today. Long live the warrior! Hooray! Hooray!]\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHuh?Was it possible that\u2026\u2026 nobody around me was normal?Not at all?Was this for real?Strange. I was normal. I was a model student who tried to live normally. But why was I surrounded by only crazy ghosts, kooky Constellations, and ditzy swords?Thinking about it, all three of them weren\u2019t even \u2018human\u2019. This was nuts. Was this my destiny? If this was my destiny, wasn\u2019t it a bit like a dog? Was God perhaps a dog? This Siberian Husky-like\u2026. [1]\u201cAha, Death King! What are you thinking about?\u201d\u201cHeretic Questioner. I was thinking that it would be nice if you go to the 13th floor and negotiate with the priests of Aegim. It would be nice if newbie Hunters could take quests there.\u201d\u201cOh! I was thinking the same thing. Death King and I are on the same wavelength, thinking about how we can help everyone! I\u2019ll be back!\u201dAfter chasing out the blond corgi-bear like man, I became less and less confident in my companions.\u201cThere. D-Death King-nim.\u201dA savior appeared before my despairing eyes.\u201cI succeeded in mass-producing the zombie virus treatment. The medicinal components should also be commonly available. I-if people get vaccinations in advance, they won\u2019t have any problems going around the 22nd floor.\u201dThis is the person!\u201cBoss.\u201d\u201cY-yes. Death King-nim\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo you have any plans to move?\u201dAs I spoke about the plan I had right after the confrontation between the Alchemist and the Medicine King, the Alchemist blinked.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYour store is too small right now. Since you cleared this stage, the value of your name increased even more, so you\u2019ll have to expand it. You\u2019ll have a lot of orders. Would you be able to handle the demand with your store right now?\u201d\u201cAh. That. I was also thinking about expanding the store. The price of real estate on the first floor is\u2026. You know how it is. I have to get a big loan\u2026. The Count showed me some kind of contract, saying that he would pay for it all.\u201d\u201cNo, you should never sign that.\u201dWho does he think he is? He was a cat that put his paws on someone else\u2019s fish.\u201cThe real estate. If it\u2019s something like that, I\u2019ll give it all to you.\u201dI shouted loudly.\u201cIn addition, I\u2019ll pay for the moving costs and interior costs. I\u2019ll take care of everything, so please just bring yourself without worrying.\u201dThe Alchemist opened her mouth.\u201cEh. Uh. R-really\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes. Did you know that the 20th floor is my property? I\u2019ll arrange a nice spot for you. You just have to show up.\u201dThe Alchemist opened and closed her mouth again. She didn\u2019t seem to believe my proposition.But I was saying it sincerely.\u2018What good is land if I don\u2019t make use of it?\u2019It was not a waste to invest in a colleague who would become the master of the Alchemy Castle in the future.I smiled.\u201cIn exchange, please make the medicine or potions I ask for with a slightly higher priority. Does that sound good?\u201d\u201cO-of course! I\u2019m already doing that for you\u2026 Uh. Wh-what should I do? I\u2019m receiving too many things from Death King-nim\u2026.\u201dThe corner of the Alchemist\u2019s mouth trembled. She was saying this and that, but a good thing was a good thing. The Alchemist was embarrassed, but she couldn\u2019t hide her joy.Her tightly clasped hands seemed to shout, \u2018Score! Let\u2019s go!\u2019 on the inside.My mind was also pleased.\u2018Yeah. It feels rewarding to take care of people.\u2019At that moment.\u201cAhem. Hmm! A-he-hem. Ahem, khmph!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cUh huh. Kiddo. Did you forget something?\u201dThe Medicine King was standing there. I couldn\u2019t detect him at all until he was right behind me. Did this old man learn an interesting technique in the Murim world without me knowing\u2026? It was quite the skill.\u201cI wish I had some more land in my old age as well\u2026.\u201dHe glanced at me.\u201cOh, my store is so old these days that it smells stale. It often gets damp, too. It\u2019s so bad for my back! Because it is on the third floor, my knees squeak as I go up and down the stairs every day\u2026.\u201dAnother glance.\u201cIt would be great if a nice young man gave me a roughly 100,000-pyong place with good air\u2026.\u201d [2]\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Excuse my rude friend.\u201dThe Sword Saint approached and grabbed the back of the Medicine King. Like that, he dragged him away.While being dragged, the Medicine King raised his voice and screamed.\u201cJeez! In what country does a friend interfere instead of help with someone\u2019s business deals? Did they teach you that in Northern Europe?! Marcus, you bastard! You\u2019re from a prestigious chaebol family, but your business ethics are like a beggar\u2019s!\u201d\u201cMy friend. I know you\u2019re upset about being old, but you don\u2019t have to be indecent, too\u2026. You already make a lot of money.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a deficit, a deficit! The orders have stalled lately! Alchemist! You there, Alchemist kid! Last match I had given it away. In fact, I don\u2019t have the power to stand in the way of Sean McCallister\u2019s Victory Road. Just say something like this! Can\u2019t you just do that for me?!\u201dThe Hunters in the Great Library looked at the Medicine King. The Alchemist had seen the Medicine King through new eyes after doing the joint research and working on the surgery together, enough to call him her elder, but now, she regarded him again like he was a water flea\u2026. saying, \u2018Woah.\u2019The Venomous Snake, who had been quietly reading novels, grumbled.\u201cAh, frick. Why do the heroines always die in all the novels I read? Is this the trend these days?\u201dLike I thought, this group had no normal people.2.Opening a new pharmacy for the Alchemist on the 20th floor proceeded without difficulty. The cost of construction materials were adequately covered by the gold received from the lottery. There was no problem with manpower, either.\u201cLook here, Death King. I told you, I can reduce the cost of the construction materials. And that\u2019s not all. I can recruit more than enough people to build it. Just sign this contract along with the Alchemist\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, I said it\u2019s fine!\u201dAfter ditching the Count, who kept lingering like a cat on a laptop, I looked back at the Demon.\u201cIs everything going well?\u201d\u201cYes, milord. The construction progress is going smoothly.\u201dThe Demon, wearing a yellow helmet, a green armband, and a pink whistle in her mouth led the construction. The labor force to be used for the construction was replaced by skeletons that were called forth using the Hundred Ghosts Reincarnation.\u201cThis fucking\u2026! Shit! Hey! You bastard, beggar\u2019s foot bandage! What kinda grudge do you have against me?! Why am I stuck between some bones and have to move stones! Talk to me, fuckers!\u201dThere was one gap where there was a young man with a ponytail and an extraordinarily strong mouth, but the construction continued to progress without a problem as the vast majority of the construction workers were skeletons who moved in perfect order.In the middle of the smooth construction, the Alchemist, and the Chen Mu-mun master, and I signed an agreement.\u201cThere. I guess that\u2019s about done.\u201dThe contents of the agreement were as follows.\u201cThere are still many Jiangshi on the 22nd floor. Which means there are many mobs. And there are a lot of ruined channels everywhere. There are also many dungeons.\u201d\u201cYeah. So, our Chen Mu-mun will have our base right there\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Hunters who want to go to the 22nd floor, visit the 20th floor before\u2026\u2026 vaccinated at my new pharmacy\u2026\u2026 Is that it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. In the process, I get a commission\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s common sense.\u201dI, the owner of the 20th floor; the Alchemist, building a new nest on the 20th floor; and Chen Mu-Mun, who would move its headquarters to the 22nd floor, all benefited.\u2018Nice. I didn\u2019t think that the day would come when I would get commission from real estate.\u2019I felt very happy.However, when the pharmacy actually opened, it turned out that there was a problem with the plan. Specifically, too many people gathered on the 20th floor.\u201cMedicine God-nim!\u201d\u201cAlchemist King-nim!\u201d\u201cMedicine Emperor-nim!\u201d\u201cDear God of Alchemy! Please sell me some medicine!\u201dYou can go to and from the 20th floor without a title. Therefore, not only were Hunters trying to get vaccinations to go to the 22nd floor, but even more Hunters flooded the 20th floor.The procedure to produce the zombie vaccine was rather complicated. Generic drugs were being manufactured and sold in the midst of that, so the flow of human traffic was twisted. At first, the Alchemist tried to deal with it on her own before screaming.\u201cDeath King-nim, this can\u2019t go on!\u201dEventually, I had no choice but to call the last member of the 22nd floor attack team. The Venomous Snake put his arm around the Medicine King\u2019s shoulder and said,\u201cMedicine King. Your business is no fun these days, right? I\u2019ll give you a good spot at the 22nd floor\u2019s Chen Mu-mun headquarters. Would you like to come and act as an exclusive doctor?\u201d\u201cOho, Chen Mu-mun master! Who do you think this Sean McCallister is?\u201dThough he yelled so loudly, the Medicine King\u2019s business was going through a rough patch. The merit of the Medicine King\u2019s pharmacy was that it handled high-end medicine. However, as soon as the super-competent Alchemist appeared, the high-end strategy had become awkward.Everyone knew it, including the Medicine King. Eventually, when he was asked several times, the Medicine King groaned.\u201cAll right. For the time being, I\u2019ll give out vaccines on the 22nd floor and take care of emergencies for a fee.\u201d\u201cYes, please. \u2026\u2026I was in need of a doctor who could take care of Master exclusively.\u201d\u201cHmph. Well, that man is easier to talk to than Marcus. All right. I was also somewhat lonely.\u201dIn the meantime, the attacks continued.There were many Hunters besides us who were eager to take on the next stage.+21st floor: The Great Library of All Things22nd floor: Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon (Genre: Martial Arts, Fusion)23rd floor: Saga of the Iron Knights in Space (Genre: SF)24th Floor: Dawn Mountain Cabin Journal (Genre: Mystery, History)+\u201cExcellent. Truly, really excellent.\u201dThe Witch smiled contentedly.Before she knew it, she was commanding the Hunters, carefully deciding what Apocalypse to target and how many and who to attack.\u201cDeath King. Your cool conquering of the [Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon] had a great impact. The other Hunters\u2019 wills are burning, saying that they can\u2019t lose to you. These are people who don\u2019t listen well to what I say! Ah, it would have been great if things were like this in the past, too.\u201dThe Witch looked at me with affectionate eyes. Kind of like how one would look at a golden goose? She seemed like she was going to say that it was all thanks to me that this tower was built.\u201cIf we continue this momentum, we\u2019ll be able to break through the 30th floor before next month.\u201dUnfortunately, the Witch\u2019s prophecy was wrong.Two weeks after the Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon were cleared.[Today, the attack on the 25th floor stage has failed.]Hundreds of Hunters, including the Witch, stared blankly into the air.[Announcing to everyone again.][Today, the attack on the 25th floor stage has failed.]\u201cWhat, what\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Witch was bewildered. Shock permeated her black eyes.\u201cI planned and sent out the best team\u2026\u2026 Failure\u2026\u2026?\u201dA hologram floated in the air of the Grand Library. The attack\u2019s situation was broadcasted through the screen. On the holographic screen, countless demons giggled and slaughtered humans.There were familiar faces among the people being massacred.The 4th ranked Hunter. Count.The 9th ranked Hunter. Crusader.One was a Hunter who handled the gold in Babylon, and the other was a Hunter who handled the people. The people in charge of economy and public order. As the Witch muttered in surprise, it was the strongest hand that we had.But it was a failure.+[The Tale of Sormwyn Academy]Genre: Romance, FantasyDifficulty Level: D-ClassPlayer Limit: 2\u20135 people\u203bThe Serialization is currently suspended.Introduction: Sormwyn is a magic school with a long history. It is an ordinary academy where friendship, competition, love, and jealousy come and go. This Apocalypse could have stayed as an ordinary school. However, there was a world-class artifact sealed in the basement of the academy!Reason for Discontinuation: The villainess\u2019s fiance (the crown prince) was stolen by a girl who had reincarnated for the second time. The villainess turned around and unsealed the artifact, liberating the Great Devil and destroying the world.+The Apocalypse\u2019s difficulty was only D-class.The world was chosen because \u2018magic had been developed and it was rich in Mithril-like ores.\u2019\u201cAww. What a shame.\u201dThe Librarian looked down at the devastated Hunters.\u201cBut spilled water is spilled water! Maybe you can put back what was spilled, but I can\u2019t overlook an attack that has already failed. Gentlemen. Please understand my position.\u201dThe Librarian smiled with his eyes.In other words, if one had the ability to put back spilled water, he would make an exception.It was obvious whom the Librarian was referring to.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI headed to the bathroom in the library. I had stopped by here once before entering the Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon. A man with a stiff face was reflected in the mirror above the sink.\u201cDamn it. I\u2019ve never read a romance novel before.\u201d-Well, you haven\u2019t read martial arts novels before either, but you resolved things well. There probably won\u2019t be a problem?\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026.\u201dI grabbed my dagger with a sigh.\u201cI can\u2019t let the Count and Crusader die. And I don\u2019t think things will be cleared by sending someone else. As expected, I have to challenge this myself.\u201dSomeone may ask why I don\u2019t give up and take on another Apocalypse. Things weren\u2019t that simple.There was a reason I couldn\u2019t skip that Apocalypse.[Shiny cheers at the warrior\u2019s decision.]That was because the fragments of the Holy Sword were hidden there.\u201c\u2026\u2026Okay.\u201dI touched the handle of the dagger and made up my mind.\u201cLet\u2019s go back one more time!\u201dWith that, I returned to the day before the attack team was decided.It was that moment when my next stage was chosen to be [Romance].~~~[1] The word for \u201cdog\u201d in Korean is kind of like a soft \u201cfucking\u201d; it\u2019s used for emphasis and is usually bad.

    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89. <Dead Ends are the Norm. (2) >=======================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha PR: LightBrin3.As soon as I returned back to a few days ago, I spoke in front of the Hunters.\u201cThis stage. I\u2019ll take charge.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Hunters became mute.Among them were the Count and the Crusader. The two of them originally died while attacking the 25th floor, but I came back to the time before they entered the stage.Of course, the people involved did not know that.\u201cUm\u2026.\u201dThe Crusader looked confused.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Death King. I didn\u2019t know if you had an interest in romance.\u201d\u201cNot at all. There\u2019s nothing to be sorry for. I\u2019m an amateur at romance.\u201d\u201c\u2026But you still want to be in charge of this stage? Are you serious?\u201d\u201cYes. I really want to take command.\u201dThe Hunters muttered.I spoke calmly to keep up my momentum.\u201cIt would be good to select a Hunter who is knowledgeable in the romance genre. But that\u2019s not the only criterion. I\u2019ve never read martial arts novels. Even so, I cleared the Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, but\u2026.\u201d\u201cI have an ominous feeling about this stage. I think something bad will happen. Please let me be in charge.\u201dFlinch.There were a few Hunters who responded to the words [ominous feeling]. It was the Witch and the Sword Saint. The two believed that I had the power of prophecy.\u201c\u2026It should be fine, right? Death King has proven his skill many times.\u201d\u201cI also think we should listen to Death King.\u201dThe first and second place in the rankings supported my position, so things became easier. The other Hunters didn\u2019t even try to dissent against us. Like I had wanted, I took command.\u201cNow, I\u2019ll choose the attack team to enter the Apocalypse with me.\u201dI spoke with a firm heart.\u201cOnly the most elite members can go to this stage. Please don\u2019t resent me if I don\u2019t pick you.\u201d\u201cHmm. The most elite members.\u201dThe Witch glanced at me with an expressionless face.\u201cAll right. Then I have to go. I don\u2019t know much about romance, but if you really need me, I have to go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThough this is my first time encountering the romance genre. But romantic sensibility? Sensibility seems to fit me well. I\u2019m not claiming to be an expert on romance. Yup. I just think that I should be included since the most elite members are going.\u201dThe woman who introduced herself as a drama watcher seemed to be in poor condition.\u201cRomance and romance fantasy are somewhat different. If romance is macaron, romance fantasy is a chocolate mousse cake. Death King. I really do think we should bring along an expert\u2026.\u201dThe master who exuded a quiet, deep energy was the Crusader. However, in the last run-through, she had failed in the attack. I felt uncomfortable bringing the Crusader.\u201cIsn\u2019t love something that can be replaced by money? People who pay well are good at dating. Love is power, power is money. It\u2019s an unchangeable law. I need to be appointed here.\u201dThe Count unfolded a fan. Who the hell let that man enter a romance?\u201cHm.\u201dI looked around calmly. Finally, a figure entered my sight. That figure was drinking orange juice served by a bookmark maid.\u201cHeretic Questioner-nim.\u201dI called out to that person.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cHit up a romance with me.\u201d\u201cOho?\u201dThe Hunters nearby looked at us with astonishment.The Heretic Questioner. An iron-blooded slayer. A person who unconditionally tortured and executed people if there was a religious dispute, regardless of what happened. A true natural-born psycho who is treated like a madman even in this tower full of abnormal people.If there was a survey of who in the world was the least suitable for romance, that human would be ranked first. The man grinned like an innocent boy.\u201cYes! Of course! Aha, if it\u2019s Death King\u2019s request, I will be happy to do it!\u201dFor anyone who did not know the truth, it was really an angelic smile.\u201cDeath King. Are you crazy\u2026\u2026 ?\u201dIn other words, when a person who knew the truth saw it, it was no different than the smile of a devil. The Witch quickly came up and whispered to me.\u201cThe Heretic Questioner can\u2019t empathize with people! Objectively, he\u2019s a psychopath, and subjectively, he\u2019s a sociopath. How can we take a man like that into a romance novel?\u201d\u201cBlack Dragon master.\u201dI also answered with a whisper.\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know the laws of romance, I do know what\u2019s most important.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cAppearance.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cThe appearance.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI was serious.\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d\u201cFirst of all, you have to be handsome.\u201d\u201cNo, isn\u2019t that a little prejudiced\u2026? A lot of people in romance novels are described as looking ordinary.\u201d\u201cThey cheat with the cover image.\u201d\u201cAh, you shouldn\u2019t say that\u2026\u2026 You\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNow. Look at this. In terms of appearance, who looks the most angelic in the tower? It\u2019s the Heretic Questioner. Even I thought he was a real angel until I learned his true nature.\u201dWe glanced at the Heretic Questioner.In the distance, the Heretic Questioner smiled brightly.\u201cDo you agree?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes. His appearance is top quality. But it\u2019s a problem because his personality is inversely proportional. He\u2019s like a gangster.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, the Heretic Questioner is competent. He can use divine magic. Wouldn\u2019t he be able to respond to whatever happens? He also listens to me well.\u201dAbove all, the Heretic Questioner wasn\u2019t two-faced.What he said outwardly and thought inwardly were the same.He was of one heart.I thought that this too could be an advantage in romance.It could be charming to many people when one acted exactly as they thought.\u201c\u2014It might be a clever idea,\u201d someone said, eavesdropping on our conversation.It was the Crusader.She was slowly nodding her head. Her eyes shone with admiration.\u201cIn ropan, or romance fantasy, the more crazy guys there are, the fresher it is. The Heretic Questioner isn\u2019t so bad for ropan. It is unfortunate that he isn\u2019t obsessed with love, but there is room for him to develop into a madman-type character. I can see how it can be fun. Indeed, Death King\u2026. Even in romance, you have a demonic intuition\u2026.\u201dThe library became quiet.\u201cMm? Did I say something weird?\u201dAgain, the library was quiet.However, the Witch was thinking.\u300cThey have a point, but the Heretic Questioner doesn\u2019t look young like the Death King\u2014he looks too young\u2026\u2026.. Even if you look young, you have to look moderately boyish. A childish appearance isn\u2019t very popular\u2026\u2026.\u300dWhether fortunate or not, she never expressed her professional opinion.Thanks to that, I and the Heretic Questioner formed the two-member romance team.Seeing the determined attack team, the Librarian\u2019s eyes gleamed.\u201cOho. So you\u2019re trying to attack with a different combination. I can\u2019t wait to see what kind of story will unfold this time.\u201dThe Librarian reached out and grabbed [The Tale of Sormwyn Academy].\u201cThe season of love is here! The time to praise love has arrived! It is beautiful to win love by transcending status, lineage, nationality, and everything!\u201dThe sleeves of the Constellation were fluttering.\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why love has become so difficult. Love is not only an emotion but also attitude and posture because many people are obsessed with romance.\u201dThe Librarian laughed.\u201cIs it a romantic reality, or is it a realistic romance? Gongja, it will be very difficult for you to keep these in balance. Therefore, I have prepared a special clear privilege for you!\u201dClear privilege?\u201cIn fact, you cleared the hidden stage of [The Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon] in addition to the normal stage. The reward for the normal stage was the 22nd floor, but you haven\u2019t received the hidden stage reward yet. I will present that to you now.\u201d\u201cUh, what is it?\u201d\u201cCome here. My protagonist.\u201dI approached him.\u201cI will give you three cards.\u201dSaying tada~ the Librarian handed me the cards.On the cards, the following was written.+[Facial recognition barrier card][What a coincidence! Overhearing crucial secrets! card][Oops! I shouldn\u2019t have said this! I said something wrong! card]+\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dNice.Even the names are ominous.I didn\u2019t know what kind of effects they had, but I felt very suspicious.\u201cExcuse me. These\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAll of them will definitely be useful in romances. These cards will surely be your army and support. So don\u2019t worry!\u201dI could only worry.\u201cThis is not my only gift. I prepared one more thing for you. Once you enter the Apocalypse, you\u2019ll naturally come across the gift.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDeath King. Heretic Questioner.\u201dThe Librarian did not answer my question. Instead, he opened the book. Hwaaaak! Light emanated from the pages of the Apocalypse.\u201cI appoint these two as characters of [The Tale of Sormwyn Academy]. When you open your eyes, it will still be seven days before the unfortunate end of The Tale of Sormwyn Academy.\u201dLight enveloped the two of us.\u201cPlease. I look forward to the wonderful ending that you\u2019ll show me! Esteemed daughter! And the butler!\u201dEsteemed daughter?Butler?The moment I tried to ask what he meant, my vision turned completely white.4.I was never really into romance.I didn\u2019t have a habit of reading, and I didn\u2019t have any friends who were enthusiastic about [romance] around me. To be more honest, I had no friends. I also didn\u2019t want to talk about how many people I could now call my friends.However, when asked what is [the most frequent onomatopoeia] in the romance genre, even I, who was only an outsider, could easily answer.Slap!!The sound of hitting someone\u2019s cheek.\u201c\u2014lowly, impertinent thing!\u201dThe high-pitched voice reached the chandelier on the ceiling. Before the chandelier stopped shaking, slaaaapp!! The all-time number one sound in the romance genre resonated once again.As can be seen by how I was leisurely describing the sound, I wasn\u2019t the one being slapped.\u201c\u2026\u2026Haa?\u201dIt was the Heretic Questioner.The Heretic Questioner tilted his head. Both his left cheek and his right cheek. Even though both sides had turned red, the Heretic Questioner smiled brightly. At the person who had slapped his face.\u201cDid I do something wrong? Your hands are very strong!\u201dHis opponent\u2019s expression grew grim. Was she some noble daughter? She was wearing a dress embroidered with lilies in silver thread.For my convenience, I attached to her the name tag of \u2018Silver lily girl\u2019 in my head.\u201cHow dare you act so nonchalant\u2026\u2026! How vulgar! Do you not know shame?\u201d\u201cAha.\u201dAnd from here, things became more complicated.The silver lily girl wasn\u2019t the only one wearing a dress.\u201cIf I\u2019ve done something wrong, please explain it to me! I\u2019ll listen, and if your point is reasonable, I will correct myself immediately! It is better not to use violence!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner was also wearing a dress.Compared to the silver lily girl\u2019s dress, it was plainer. The color resembled the flesh of a lime. The dress that the Heretic Questioner wore was a division of the innocent yellow and the refreshing green.Childishness could easily be mistaken for innocence. Ignorance could also be seen as being refreshing. But he didn\u2019t need any of that. His face was the top. The natural-born thug whom I chose based on his appearance smiled brightly.\u201cNow! Person whom I don\u2019t know the name of. Let\u2019s talk!\u201dSlap!\u201cYou really\u2026 Really, you insult me to the end\u2026.\u201dThe silver lily girl seemed to squeeze her whole body while speaking. The curve of her twisted back seemed to be transmitted onto her voice.The person who did the hitting was the young lady and the one who was beaten was the Heretic Questioner, but as time went on, the lady\u2019s breath weakened.\u2018Hm.\u2019I overcame my confusion from entering the Apocalypse and started to grasp the situation.\u2018A social gathering? A ball? Anyway, it\u2019s during some event.\u2019The ballroom was cast with the light of a chandelier.Dozens of people in addition to us wore dresses and suits. They were far away, nervously looking in our direction. Their expressions of embarrassment and tenseness were striking.It was natural since the peaceful ball became a mess.\u2018The silver lily girl is the [Villainous Young Lady]\u2026.\u2019I looked at the young lady.\u2018Except for the imperial family, she is the highest-ranking person.\u2019She was also the one who would destroy this Apocalypse.\u201cCome, over, here!\u201dthe silver lily girl said as she staggered. She seemed to be chewing on each syllable before spitting it out. Her voice made my lungs hurt just by listening.\u201cYes, young lady,\u201d answered the servants dressed in black tailcoats.\u201cThese people\u2026 I hate looking at them. Take them away. Right now\u2026 Take them away from my sight!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe servants\u2019 answer was never loud. Their voices were quiet. People of lower status adjusted the volume of their voice depending on the constitution of their betters. Anybody could see that the silver lily girl was sickly. To her ears, loud voices were poison.\u201cAh.\u201dSo, the Heretic Questioner was incompatible with the silver lily girl.\u201cBy any chance, are you sick? That\u2019s a big problem! I\u2019ll help you!\u201d\u201cQuickly\u2026 Quickly clean up that master and servant and get them away from my sight\u2026 Lock them up\u2026\u2026\u201dBecause the Heretic Questioner was naturally loud and open.Servants in tailcoats surrounded us like a military unit.\u201cExcuse us.\u201d\u201cYou must follow us for a moment.\u201dThe words were archaically polite, but the actions weren\u2019t like that at all. The servants forced the two of us out.Over the ballroom and through the corridor, we were transported to a warehouse pale with moonlight.\u201cExcuse me?\u201dI said while being moved to the warehouse.For reference, I was wearing a tailcoat that looked just like the servants\u2019.\u201cWhere are you taking us now? Hmm?\u201dThere was no answer.\u201cExcuse me? Ducal servants, everyone?\u201dSlam.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner and I looked at each other. Soon after, click! The sound of a turning key resonated. We were imprisoned in a warehouse, who-knows-where.If my common sense wasn\u2019t wrong, if a warehouse was locked with a key, it became a prison.\u201cAha.\u201dAs the moonlight spilled through the iron bars, the Heretic Questioner opened his mouth.\u201cDeath King. Something big happened!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner was smiling wide as if it wasn\u2019t a big deal at all.\u201cI think I\u2019ve become the female protagonist!\u201dThat was right.And I was that young lady\u2019s butler.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90. <Dead Ends are the Norm. (3) >======================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha PR: LightBrin5.\u201cWhat a mess\u2026\u2026\u201dI muttered. It was nuts.In this old warehouse where the moonlight shined through large iron bars, the Heretic Questioner laughed. His face was seriously bright for a situation that was no different from being imprisoned.\u201cAh, when I was a child, I was often dressed up as a girl. I didn\u2019t know that I would really get the role of a young lady. This is another life experience!\u201d\u201cI want a bit of your limitless positive energy\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe world is beautiful. Death King! Think positively!\u201dDid this person ever stop smiling?Even if a meteorite fell in front of him, he\u2019d probably say, \u2018Oh, what a disaster! The world is ending! It can\u2019t be helped. We did our best!\u2019 Then, he would just laugh.\u201cWhat makes you so positive?\u201d\u201cThis, right now!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner wiggled his hands and made a hand seal. Then, he whispered quietly.\u201cSacred Technique, Transformation.\u201dLight spilled through his slender fingers. It was the patented sacred technique of the Heretic Questioner. Since he said transformation, it should be a technique that changed something\u2026 Firstly, I couldn\u2019t see any changes based on his appearance.But as soon as the Heretic Questioner opened his mouth, I realized just what the transformation was.\u201cHow is it?\u201dImmediately, I got goosebumps.\u201cDo I seem a bit like a young lady?\u201d\u201cYour voice is\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYes! I changed the structure of my vocal cords slightly.\u201dGrin.The Heretic Questioner smiled.\u201cPeople already tell me that my voice is androgynous. A little adjustment makes it more appropriate. Aha, but I can\u2019t judge my own voice objectively! So how is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful\u2026?\u201d\u00a0Honest admiration spilled out from my lips.\u00a0\u201cYou have the air of a dignified noble. Uh, well. If you just keep your mouth shut.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dI stroked my chin.Unexpectedly, we possessed the roles of the [female lead and her butler]. But the Heretic Questioner and I could cope with that. The Heretic Questioner had his holy techniques\u2026.And I had regression skills.\u2018Okay.\u2019We could challenge this.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner peeked up and looked at my face.\u201cYour expression has relaxed a little.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cSince you came back from the Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon, your face has been dark. Death King. You must have built up quite a lot of stress when you attacked the Apocalypse.\u201dFor a moment, I was at a loss for words.\u201cWell, of course\u2014you lost your beloved master! So I was also worried about this team. I was worried that Death King wouldn\u2019t be able to show his skills due to his sadness, but my worry was baseless.\u201d\u201c\u2026Anyway, are you saying you can guess someone\u2019s emotions by looking at their face?\u201d\u201cYes! I don\u2019t know how it feels to be depressed, but I can understand it conceptually! Haha. Machines creak when grease gets stuck. Stress may be humanity\u2019s grease. If it sticks around for a long time, it clumps together and becomes difficult to clean, so take care!\u201dHow fascinating. Was he trying to understand humans in his own way? He was a psycho, but he was a praiseworthy psycho.\u201cBy the way, Death King.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cSomething struck me as strange from earlier.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s strange?\u201d\u201cFrom my understanding, we\u2019re currently being imprisoned unlawfully. Our freedom of movement is suppressed.\u201d\u201cThat is also how I understand our situation.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad we see it the same way! And usually in this sort of case, guards are set up to monitor the prisoners. Otherwise, we can easily try to escape.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner tilted his head.\u201cNow, I can\u2019t feel any presence outside the door, but I do feel a presence at the window. Hmm. In this world, do they place guards at the windows, not in front of the doors?\u201dAt that moment.\u201cDamn it! Attack!\u201dShadows jumped in from the window as the iron bars fell out.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you kill the man! Just don\u2019t hurt the woman!\u201dThe shadows were wearing masks on their faces. Their outfit concept was too grim for them to be guests who had come to check on us out of worry. Anybody could see that it was a surprise attack by unwelcome gatecrashers.\u201cShiny!\u201d[Yes, warrior.]I pulled out the Holy Sword. Chaang! My sword clashed against the attacker\u2019s sword.The back-and-forth wasn\u2019t much different from the attack scenes shown in movies. The conversation could be summarized with: \u2018Who are you!\u2019 \u2018You don\u2019t need to know! But we have a powerful backer!\u2019 Both my opponent and I were busy swinging our swords.But I had a cheap trick up my sleeve.\u201cNow!\u201dFlash.The Holy Sword lit up.\u201cKeugh?!\u201dThe attacker, whose eyes had become accustomed to the darkness, closed his eyes tightly for an instant. In a battle of swords, an outcome could be decided in an instant.I blinked alternately with my left and right eyes to secure my sight, and then attacked my opponent\u2019s wrist.\u201c\u2014Eek\u2014!!\u201dA scream mixed into his voice like it was marbling.\u201cDeath King! You can\u2019t kill them all! We need to figure out the mastermind, so save some!\u201dI did as he said.The Heretic Questioner was also playing an active role as the hem of his dress fluttered.\u201cImpossible! T-this isn\u2019t an ordinary girl!\u201dThe attackers were astonished. They weren\u2019t particularly skilled. No, was it our skills that were too great? Small fry that couldn\u2019t even use Aura couldn\u2019t handle us.In the end, the four attackers were quickly overpowered. One of them was killed by the Heretic Questioner during the fight.\u201cAhem. Ahaha.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner smoothly wiped off the blood that had gotten on his face with the sleeve of his dress. The attackers looked up at that Heretic Questioner. Their faces were pale with fear.\u201cI heard she was a weak noble girl\u2026 How did this\u2026?\u201d\u201cEveryone, you have three options!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner beamed, holding a dagger.\u201cFirst, if you ask me to kill you right here, you\u2019ll just die! Second, I can torture you in turn and get you to reveal any important information! Third, you can obediently confess everything, and you won\u2019t be tortured or killed! Which option do you choose?\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026.\u201dThe person who seemed to be the oldest among the assailants scoffed. It was the man whose wrist I broke.\u201cCrazy bitch. I\u2019d rather die!\u201d\u201cYes! Understood!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe Heretic Questioner\u2019s dress turned a little redder.A dull, percussive sound rang through the warehouse.His head had fallen to the floor.\u201cHii, hiiik\u2026?!\u201dTwo attackers were left.\u201cEveryone, have you finished making your choice?\u201d\u201cP-please spare us. Young Miss. We were just hired to do this!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to survive in this world. I understand.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cBut just as I understand your situation, you must understand my position!\u00a0Please tell us why you attacked us. In exchange, I\u2019ll let you go alive. I think I\u2019m making a lot of concessions in this deal.\u201dThe attackers wavered.\u201cAh. You seem to be hesitating. I understand! I\u2019ll help you a little so you can make up your mind!\u201d\u201cThat. When you say help us\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll whip you into shape.\u201dAs always, the Heretic Questioner was smiling.\u201cPain is proof that you are alive. When one\u2019s pain reaches its maximum, one\u2019s survival instinct also peaks. All right. I\u2019ll maximize your desire to live.\u201d\u201cS, spare us!\u201d\u201cPlease save us!\u201dThis was insane.I intervened because the genre would change to an R19 romance at this rate.\u201cPlease wait a minute. Heretic Questioner.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do it like that. Please leave it to me.\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026?\u201dThe Heretic Questioner made a puzzled expression.\u201cDeath King, are you good at torture? Unless you\u2019re very skilled at it, I recommend that you let me handle this. I am an interrogation specialist.\u201d\u201cNo, there\u2019s no need to torture them. Also, please wipe your face.\u201dI handed a handkerchief to the Heretic Questioner and stood in front of our attackers.The attackers sighed in relief. I felt sorry for them, but I wasn\u2019t about to be generous to people who had attacked us first.\u201cMisters. Let me ask you something.\u201d\u201cW-what is it?\u201d\u201cYou came through the window when you attacked just now. The iron bars were cut too easily. Did you hear that we would be trapped here and cut the iron bars in advance?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe attackers did not respond. They only traded glances with each other. However, it didn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t a way to figure out the right answer just because they were keeping their mouths shut. \u2018Character window.\u2019I could see their psychological states.\u300cI heard that a woman would enter the warehouse.\u300d\u300cDamn it. I heard she was an ordinary girl, but it was a scam!\u300dAs expected.The attackers already knew we would be here.\u201cWhile you were attacking us, you yelled, [It doesn\u2019t matter if you kill the man, just don\u2019t hurt the woman]. Were you trying to kidnap this young lady here?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2026\u2026 That is\u2026\u2026\u201dThe attackers\u2019 eyes flickered.\u300cIt was a request to kidnap the woman here.\u300d\u300cThe client said firmly to never injure the girl. That\u2019s why we attacked in a group of four, to be safe.\u300dHmm.Yeah. I got it.\u201cHaa\u2026.\u201dI sighed. When I looked back, the Heretic Questioner was working hard to wipe his face with the handkerchief. He looked like a baby hamster gnawing on sunflower seeds.\u201cI think I know who the culprit is.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner\u2019s ears perked up.\u00a0\u201cOh? Do you really know it already?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI want to hear Death King\u2019s reasoning.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner\u2019s eyes were sparkling.I nodded and whispered,\u00a0\u201cTo start with, the culprit is someone very powerful. They need to be able to hire four assassins that can infiltrate the academy, which is impossible without knowing the academy\u2019s security system.\u201d\u201cOoh. It makes sense!\u201dHowever, the Heretic Questioner raised a counterpoint.\u201cDoes the culprit really need to be [someone very powerful]? It isn\u2019t the royal palace; it seems relatively easy to figure out the academy\u2019s security. Even someone with just a little bit of power to their name can do it!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a keen point, but\u2026\u201dI shook my head.\u201cThere is one more suspicious circumstance. Heretic Questioner. Do you remember what [Villainous Young Lady] shouted when she chased us out?\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner contemplated whether he should put the handkerchief in his sleeves or not.\u201cYes, I remember. She clearly said [Quickly clean up that master and servant and get them away from my sight. Lock them up]. Why do you ask?\u201d\u201cShe never mentioned where to lock us up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe villainous young lady just said to take us out of the ballroom. But these attackers knew where we were going to be locked, and they cut off the iron bars in advance. And the ones who brought us to this warehouse were the servants of the villainous lady.\u201d\u201cOho\u2026.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner\u2019s eyes narrowed, razor-thin.\u201cIndeed. It could be that the villainous young lady was the one who hired the attackers. All she had to do was tell the servants where to put us in advance and let the attackers know, too. Aha. And since she\u2019s the daughter of a duke, she has power.\u201d\u201cYes. But\u2014\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s too obvious.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner stroked his chin.\u201c[I] am the protagonist of this Apocalypse. I\u2019m a noble lady having a fling with the crown prince. If the villainous young lady chased me away and I was attacked at that location? Even as the duke\u2019s daughter, it\u2019ll be a tremendous scandal! The evil act has too much political burden.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner was definitely quick-witted.He understood this strange story very swiftly.\u201cIn other words, the villainous young lady is not the culprit. The true culprit is the one who wants that lady to appear [as if she were the culprit].\u201d\u201cI agree!\u201d\u201cAnd this real culprit cares so much about the Heretic Questioner that he told the attackers to [never hurt the woman]. But they didn\u2019t care whether I, as the male butler, died or not. Finally, the culprit is powerful enough to buy off the servants of a duke.\u201d\u201cAhaha.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner smiled with his eyes.\u201cI\u2019m starting to see who the real culprit is!\u201d\u201cYou probably think the same thing as I do.\u201d\u201cMm. I don\u2019t know the feeling of love. But I know about the habits of someone in love! If the real culprit actually cares about [me] as Death King speculated, these attackers can never tell us their personal information.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI nodded.\u201cThey must be waiting nearby so they can enter anytime.\u201dKwaang!It was then that the old door of the warehouse was broken. Dust rose up, and a group of knights poured in.At the front was a man who looked like he had never dirtied his hand in his life.\u201cSylvia! Are you all right, Sylvia?!\u201dThe man ran at us and tightly hugged the Heretic Questioner. Blond hair that looked like uncooked ramen noodles wobbled in the air. He wasn\u2019t as handsome as the Heretic Questioner, but that man was also handsome. His level was around\u2026 say, 60% of the Heretic Questioner?\u201cGood heavens. Your whole body is covered in blood! When I heard that you had been kicked out of the ballroom, I was anxious and came to find you\u2026. How dare this vicious thing happen\u2026\u2026.!\u201dAnd perhaps his psychopath level was about 60% of the Heretic Questioner as well.Without blinking once, the man gave an order.\u201cLook here! Go catch the suspicious men right now! I will interrogate them myself and find out who is behind this! I don\u2019t know what family did it, but I won\u2019t forgive them, no matter what they\u2019ve done for the empire!\u201dThe knights answered in unison.\u201cYes! We have received the orders of His Highness, the Crown Prince!\u201dYup.\u201cLady Sylvia. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll protect you. No matter how vicious the duke\u2019s daughter is, I, the only heir to the empire, will protect you. You only need to rely on me\u2026.\u201dThat man was the male protagonist of [The Tale of Sormwyn Academy].And he was the crown prince in love with the Heretic Questioner.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91. <Fall In. (1) >================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha PR: LightBrinOne Year Ago.There were two young ladies to whom the emperor gave epithets.\u2026\u2026Sylvia Evanail, daughter of Baron Evanail\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026A golden thread blooms in a yellow flower garden\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026From now on, people will call you like so\u2026\u2026The Lady of the Golden Silk.The heroine of this world.\u2026\u2026Raviel Ivansia, daughter of Duke Ivansia\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026A flower gilded in silver so as to not drop its head\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Child. From now on, the subjects of the empire will call you\u2026\u2026The Lady of the Silver Lily.The villainess of this Apocalypse.Noble ladies usually receive an epithet when they have their debutant ball and enter aristocratic society. The royal family or high nobility who open their debutant balls give them their new names.The noble lady\u2019s epithet differed based on how high up in society the presenter was. A name given by a baron and a name given by a count were of different classes.The greatest epithet was, of course, a name bestowed by the emperor. It was the pride of one\u2019s family to be given a name by His Majesty.Since these two young ladies attended the same academy, the huge storm that brewed was inevitable\u2026\u2026.\u2018But even so.\u2019I looked at the prince. The crown prince was holding my colleague, the Heretic Questioner, who had taken on the role of the Lady of the Golden Silk. He was holding the Heretic Questioner so tightly that the dress rippled around his fingertips like scales.\u2018Isn\u2019t he too superficial to be the crown prince of a country?\u2019Strangely, I didn\u2019t like him.The prince met my eyes. He was looking at me a little distastefully, so I had to lower my gaze. But his gaze was also unusual.Contempt. Fury. Disdain.Negative emotions were lurking in his eyes.\u201c\u2026\u2026You also survived.\u201dUhm.Was that directed to me? Probably, since I was the only one in his gaze right now. However, his voice sounded like that of someone who ate spinach three days after its expiration date. It kind of pissed me off.\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dI imitated the way people in historical dramas spoke.\u201cI safely managed to survive.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lucky.\u201d\u201cHow can it be due to the luck of this humble child? Your Highness\u2019s grace must have been crazy good.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe prince\u2019s lovely eyebrows slipped. Just now, I more or less implied [you set up the raid on your own]. If he had a guilty conscience, then even an ordinary greeting should put him on edge.\u201cYour words are too much. Do you mean to say that my royal grace is embedded in everything that happens in the world? Saving your own life and saving Sylvia from the assassins and ruffians are all due to your own fortune. I thank you.\u201dWow.He seemed to retreat and praised me, but listening carefully, that wasn\u2019t the case. It wasn\u2019t because of my \u2018skills,\u2019 but rather because of \u2018fortune.\u2019 No way. I\u2019d like to think this wasn\u2019t true, but was the prince trying to keep me in check right now?\u201cThe Lady of the Golden Silk is my master.\u201dAt that moment.\u201cAnd I belong to her.\u201dMy mouth moved without my intent.\u201cYour Highness. How can we say that it is luck that a sword protects its owner? The tool has just been used as a tool should. Your Highness praises me excessively.\u201dIt was embarrassing. Really, truly, I had planned to step back after saying something vague. What good would it be if the prince and a butler got into a fight? Nevertheless, my tongue moved agilely.\u2018Huh? Have I finally gone nuts?\u2019When my head became a bit hazy, I heard a voice.[The immersion toward the character is deepened.]What?[Currently, your immersion rate is 1%.]What the heck?\u201c\u2026\u2026Really, you\u2019re so eloquent that I want to sew your lips together.\u201dWhile I was going mad in my head, the prince\u2019s face became distorted. Outrage. Humiliation. It was really a face trying to hold back from cursing.If possible, I also wanted to yell out a bucket of swears. It was because seeing the prince\u2019s face crumpled up was strangely refreshing for a corner of my heart. Rather than thinking I should stop, I felt that his look was quite good. Crazy. This was insane.\u201cThese days, barons and such nobility seem to select servants based on their tongue rather than their personality. If His Majesty knew the situation, he would surely lament it.\u201dWait a moment.Just wait. He was supposed to be the prince of this world, but he was just a blond ramen noodle. Don\u2019t provoke me anymore. Please, don\u2019t irritate [my] emotions. This is, this stage is\u2026\u2026.\u201cHow could that be? How dare there be a day when His Majesty\u2019s eyes are blurred? Your Highness the Crown Prince is so mature that you accumulate virtues in our school every day. I am sure that His Majesty is pleased.\u201dIn other words, I was sarcastically saying his father sure would be pleased if he knew the prince hired an assassin. But that wasn\u2019t the important part.I realized the trap of this stage.And I realized why Count and Crusader, the two Hunters who dealt with the economy and safety of our Tower, became so weak and failed to attack.\u2018As time passed, those two people were eaten up by the concept!\u2019[The immersion toward the character is deepened.]Oh no.[Currently, your immersion rate is 2%.]This was something crazy.\u201cHmph. That\u2019s enough. It\u2019s beneath me to compete with you through words. As for what happened tonight, I will thoroughly investigate the truth.\u201d\u201cIs there anyone in our school who is as reliable as the prince? I sincerely request this. Please find who is behind the attack and punish them a hundredfold.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dAaah.Was it \u2018this\u2019?Was this the special feature of this stage?The prince glanced at me and said,\u201cLady Sylvia must have been very surprised. Perhaps others are lurking and may attack tonight. Know that I will protect the lady tonight.\u201d\u201cYour Highness.\u201dMy tongue was evolving into an answering machine.\u201cPlease forgive this child\u2019s rudeness. The more times things like this happen, the more one has to relieve one\u2019s fatigue where one feels most comfortable. My mistress will want to stay in her private room, as usual.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you saying that she can\u2019t be at ease by my side?\u201d\u201cI apologize. This child is simply telling the truth to Your Highness.\u201dSave me.Please save me![The immersion toward the character is deepened.][Currently, your immersion rate is 3%.]SOS! Help me!-Hey, you\u2026\u2026 What are you doing?Sword Emperor! No, Sword Emperor-nim!-Eh. Did this brat go around the bend?I really think I\u2019m going around the bend now, so please do something!-Uh\u2026\u2026 What do you want me to do?I don\u2019t know. Anyway, help me control myself!-Hmm. Can I really talk shit to you?I don\u2019t care what you say, so please just help me get a hold of myself!-Ah, then.Bae Hu-ryeong grinned.-Zombie. You seem to dislike Venomous Snake. But actually, whenever you get the change, you act more or less like the protagonist in the Venomous Snake\u2019s delusions\u2026\u2026.Ah.\u2018That\u2019s enough. I came to my senses. Don\u2019t say another word.\u2019-Come on.My mind seemed to flash to awareness as Bae Hu-ryeong masterfully dared to compare me to the Venomous Snake. Has anyone ever seen a nastier ghost? It didn\u2019t matter what he said, but he had to throw a nonsense festival. But thanks to this, the rate of immersion that rose like crazy came to a sudden stop.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dMeanwhile.The Heretic Questioner, who buried his face in the prince\u2019s embrace, was also acting abnormally.\u201c\u2026\u2026? Huh?\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Heretic Questioner was tilting his head back and forth. For the first time ever, I saw the Heretic Questioner\u2019s \u2018confused\u2019 expression. That universally acknowledged leader of the nutjobs. The pure natural-born psycho didn\u2019t understand the feelings he was feeling right now.Guilt.Perhaps that\u2019s why the Heretic Questioner pushed away from the prince\u2019s chest. He slithered out of his arms. The prince who was fighting with me with his eyes was bewildered. He looked at the Lady of the Golden Silk, no, the Heretic Questioner.\u201cSylvia, why are you acting like this all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cHuh? \u2026\u2026Hmm? Oohhh?\u201d\u00a0The Heretic Questioner tilted his head once more.\u00a0\u201cHow fascinating.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating, Sylvia?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m feeling some unfamiliar emotion. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve felt this since I was born.\u201d\u00a0The Heretic Questioner laughed.\u00a0\u201cMy heart is pounding!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cMy heart is beating so violently. Oho. Aha. Indeed! It\u2019s really mysterious\u2026.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner closed his eyes. Then, he touched his chest with both hands. The Heretic Questioner, no, the Lady of the Golden Silk, was smiling. She looked like she was listening to beautiful classical music.\u201cThe owner of this body seems to really like you!\u201d\u201cSy-Sylvia\u2026.\u201d The prince\u2019s face looked like he had eaten the soup called \u2019emotion\u2019 with the rice called \u2018touched.\u2019If I hadn\u2019t been in a hurry to stop the immersion, I might have felt envious of the timing, but fortunately, thankfully, that wasn\u2019t the case. Even though I was late, I had come to my senses.\u201cMilady,\u201d\u00a0I said forcefully. The Heretic Questioner opened his closed eyes and looked at me.\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s return to the dormitory. His Highness the Crown Prince declared that he would personally uncover who was behind the attack. Since it\u2019s late, milady should go back to your room and rest. From tomorrow, don\u2019t we have to continue milady\u2019s life again?\u201dWe had a \u2018purpose\u2019 as well as a \u2018role.\u2019The goal of clearing the stage.We couldn\u2019t forget it.\u201cOh, yes. You\u2019re right.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner blinked. He understood what I meant right away. The Heretic Questioner grabbed his skirt and greeted the prince.\u201cThank you for your consideration. But I will go back with my butler.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cGood night, Your Highness. I will now go back!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner easily turned his back, abandoning the prince whose face turned blank. He lightly stepped out of the warehouse.From behind, the prince shouted, \u201cSylvia! Sy-Sylvia?!\u201d However, the Heretic Questioner only walked away with a smile. He didn\u2019t even turn his head.\u201c\u2026\u2026The task has become difficult.\u201dI muttered, following close behind the Heretic Questioner.\u201cI didn\u2019t think there would be a trap like immersion. Damn it.\u201dI wondered why the Count and the Crusader failed, but now I understood.\u201cAhaha.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner smiled mysteriously. Click. Click. Our footsteps echoed in the corridor, and our shoes were shaded white by the moon. The sound of human feet resembled the beating of a heart.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely something we didn\u2019t expect. Death King, how much has your immersion rate increased just now?\u201d\u201cIt went up to 3 percent like mad. I barely managed to stop it.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re outstanding. Mine shot up to 10 percent right away!\u201dI was speechless.\u201910 percent? 10?!\u2019It was devastating. He had only spent a short time with that prince character, but one-tenth of his ego had been infected.The situation was more serious than I thought.Only then, even living a normal life was like walking through a poison fog. Little by little, you became poisoned, and once you came to your senses, you couldn\u2019t escape.When you let go of your hold on your mind.In an instant, the mind would be eaten by the [romance] of this world.\u201c\u2026\u2026This can\u2019t go on.\u201dI opened my mouth. My voice was slow. Well, I was nervous.Losing myself. That I might lose myself.It was always the thing I feared most.\u201cLet\u2019s prepare safeguards for ourselves.\u201d\u201cSafeguards?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI carefully touched the handle of my dagger. I felt the texture of the green tape around my finger. That familiar texture brought me a sense of stability.\u201cChoose a keyword. So that we can come to our senses whatever the situation, no matter how serious things are, when we say this keyword. For example, when I say [peach], you can say [carrot].\u201d\u201cAha. It\u2019s a secret code for the two of us!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner smiled.\u201cI agree! I saw something similar in a drama before. Then what should the secret code be\u2026\u2026\u201dClick.At that time, we heard the sound of a heel from across the corridor. The heel of a shoe was pressing dangerously to the floor of the corridor. Dull footsteps followed. A person was approaching with several servants.The moon shined.A sharp shoe trampled over the moon reflected on the hallway floor.Hair as silver as the moonlight. The Lady of the Silver Lily.The duchy\u2019s young lady led several followers and walked this way. The villainous young lady frowned like she was angry. She glowered at us.\u201cAh.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner let out a small moan.\u201cDeath King.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner stood on his tiptoes.Then, he opened his lips and murmured into my ear.\u201cI think I really do hate her.\u201dWhisper.At first, it sounded like the same voice as always.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dSlowly, I turned my head and looked at the Heretic Questioner.\u201cMhm.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner spun round and round. The hem of the long dress swirled, causing a small whirlwind to rise. The wind containing his weight pressed on my chest.\u201cI\u2019m curious, Death King.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner stopped, then splayed open his hands. He curled his fingers other than his index fingers, which revealed his bare skin.\u201cAh, I\u2019m really curious.\u201dPressing both index fingers to his lips, he was smiling like always.\u201cRight now, what kind of expression am I making?\u201dBut his eyes weren\u2019t smiling.[The immersion toward the character is deepened.][Currently.][Your immersion rate is 4%.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92. <Fall In. (2) >================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha PR: LightBrin2.Romance Fantasy Trope 1\u300eAny man near the main character is shady at first.\u300fRomance Fantasy Trope 2\u300eThe man who seems the most ordinary is actually the most extraordinary.\u300f3.My heart throbbed. I was anxious. Like broken piano keys, my heart was playing off-key. That was how ominous the Heretic Questioner\u2019s smile was.I felt a premonition that we were going to slide all the way down this slippery slope.And what was at the bottom, I could not see.\u201cHeretic\u2014\u201d\u201cYou look unharmed, Lady of the Golden Silk.\u201dBefore I could finish saying his title in the Tower, the Lady of the Silver Lily used the protagonist\u2019s title in this world first.\u201cI heard you were attacked by an assassin\u2026. But you\u2019re a girl who grew up in the borders. The thread of your life is as tough as a weed. A single assassin must not be a big deal for you.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dThe corner of the Heretic Questioner\u2019s mouth tilted up.A little later, I would find out that it was out of ridicule.Words that the Heretic Questioner would never say flowed from his lips.\u201cDid you deliberately come out this late to compliment my healthy body? Truly, I thank you, milady. His Highness did the same. I am happy that many people care for my inexperienced self! So much so that tonight\u2019s misfortunes feel like luck!\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily\u2019s eyes became ferocious.The Heretic Questioner had planted two thorns in his words just now.\u2018Aren\u2019t you the one who hired the assassin?\u2019Intimidation.\u2018The crown prince came to visit me personally because he was worried about me.\u2019Provocation.\u201c\u2026\u2026Your head is as disheveled as a weed, too. There is a thin line between imagination and delusion. Our choice of whether we step over that boundary determines our human dignity. As a noble, please act with decorum.\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry! So it isn\u2019t against decorum to slap someone\u2019s face at a ball. Well, I did grow up on the outskirts, so I don\u2019t know the manners of a duke\u2019s daughter!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf it is not disrespectful, when will you invite me to your salon? I\u2019d like to receive etiquette lessons directly from a wonderful lady. I\u2019m not used to hitting people, so I think I need to learn about the angle and strength of my hand.\u201dThere was a motorcycle engine running on his tongue.I wondered where the engine sound was coming from, but after listening more closely, the crazy noise was the sound of my own heart.Thump. Thump.Dread wrapped around my heart and held me by the neck.\u201cMilady! Don\u2019t be rude!\u201d\u201cA mere baron\u2019s daughter from the countryside is saying such thoughtless words\u2026.\u201dThe duchy\u2019s servants became indignant at the waltz of the Heretic Questioner\u2019s tongue. Some of the attendants had probably betrayed their master and belonged to the crown prince. I didn\u2019t know if it was just one or if there were more traitors, but that wasn\u2019t what mattered now.\u201cI apologize!\u201dI hurriedly intervened between the gold and silver ladies.The Lady of the Silver Lily furrowed her brows.\u201cYou are\u2026\u201d\u201cMilady is greatly shocked today because of the strange events that occurred. From this lowly servant\u2019s understanding, she desperately needs to rest. Since it\u2019s late at night, would your ladyship please allow us to excuse ourselves? The misunderstanding will be resolved tomorrow.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily closed her lips.Behind her, the servants were buzzing.When their mistress raised her right hand, they all stopped moving. In an instant, stillness enveloped the hallway. It would have been impossible to do if she did not keep her subordinates on a tight leash from the beginning.\u201cExcuse me, butler. What are you talking about?\u201dRather, it was the Heretic Questioner, the Lady of the Golden Silk, who protested.\u201cI still have a lot to say to her ladyship. You can\u2019t just end the conversation at will\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBe quiet.\u201dI grabbed the Heretic Questioner\u2019s wrist. I grabbed it, then walked away while dragging him behind me. The Heretic Questioner said, \u201cAh, wait, butler! Wait a minute!\u201d He struggled, but I never let go of his wrist. We really couldn\u2019t let our character immersions rise here.\u201cMilady.\u201dJust before exiting the hallway, I looked back. The Lady of the Silver Lily was looking at us with an equivocal expression.\u201c\u2026What is it?\u201d\u201cI have always admired the upright conduct of the duchy\u2019s servants. Tonight, your attendants were quite virtuous, unlike a common man like myself.\u201dI politely bowed my head to her.\u201cI have realized many things. This humble self pays respect to your ladyship.\u201d\u201cNow, please excuse us.\u201dWith that, I pulled the Heretic Questioner out of the hall.The Heretic Questioner, who was rebellious at first, had calmed down.There was a wide garden between the ballroom and the dormitory. Moreover, it was a spring night.The newly bloomed magnolias were drooping by their heavy heads. The night was soaked in the scent of flowers, thick under the white trees. As we stepped forward, pale magnolia petals fell and touched our toes.\u201cMy goodness.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner stepped on a fallen magnolia petal.\u201cAh.\u201dHe stopped and looked up at the night sky. After a while, the Heretic Questioner turned his head and looked at me. His face was impassive. He seemed to be disoriented.The Hunter said to be the craziest person in the Tower muttered to himself as if he couldn\u2019t believe what he had just done.\u201cDeath King\u2026\u2026.. What did I say back there?\u201d4.As soon as I closed the door of our quarters, I said, \u201cChoose a password.\u201dWe had been quiet as we walked to the dormitory. No word was exchanged between the two of us. It was a little difficult to walk because my ankles were bound by the silence.Was it due to the increased character immersion? I knew the path from the garden to the dormitories like it was natural.Perhaps the characters\u2019 memories became clearer the more immersed we were. Right now, it was difficult to judge whether that was good or bad.\u201cA password\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner blinked.\u201cIs it a secret password\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cIf we leave things as is, it\u2019ll become really dangerous for us. You have to keep it together.\u201d\u201cWe do. Death King, you\u2019re right. Yes\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Heretic Questioner seemed to be struggling to speak. He kept slipping. His voice was slipping faster than an accident on a slippery road. It was a red light, signaling that the person in front of me was in danger.I firmly grabbed the Heretic Questioner\u2019s face with both hands. Then, I forced him to meet my eyes.\u201cWhen spring comes, magnolias fall.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhen I say [when spring comes], you, the Heretic Questioner, will reply [magnolia falls]. That\u2019s our passcode. It\u2019s the phrase that tells us to get a hold of ourselves. Now, if you understand, tell me. When spring comes?\u201d\u201cMagnolia\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAgain. When spring comes.\u201d\u201cMagnolias fall.\u201dLittle by little, the eyes of the Heretic Questioner showed that he was returning to himself. He started to look in front of him, rather than blankly into space. The Heretic Questioner shook his head, saying, \u201cHmm,\u201d and \u201cWell!\u201d Then, he nodded.\u201cYes! I\u2019m back!\u201d\u201cOkay. Good job.\u201d\u201cThank you, Death King! Aha. Indeed, today had a storm of surprises. I\u2019ll never forget this day.\u201d\u201cWould you like to rest and have a cup of tea?\u201d\u201cPlease!\u201dGood. It wasn\u2019t over yet. It was too early to give up this round.I handed the Heretic Questioner a blanket and headed to the kitchen. Because it was a dormitory of the academy where royalty and nobles attend, there was a small kitchen in the Lady of the Golden Silk\u2019s private quarters. I easily found the tea leaves and kettle.\u201cWow.\u201dI was boiling the tea, but this was ridiculous.\u201cMy body just moves on its own\u2026.\u201dI never really made tea other than the ones in tea bags. It had been like that my whole life, but my hands moved automatically as if I had steeped tea for years. It was a side effect of the immersion.My body was even feeling [joy] by making tea.\u2018The lady likes it best when I add milk and a spoonful of honey.\u2019I was humming.\u2018I obtained this precious honey from an academy employee for occasions like this. It cost some money, but milady is usually so frugal that it isn\u2019t a waste. This much luxury is okay\u2026\u2026\u2019[The immersion toward the character is deepened.][Currently, your immersion rate is 6%.]It wasn\u2019t okay!Not okay at all!Fuck!!This dumb romance! What\u2019s so pleasing about adding honey to black tea? Should I open up a skull and spread honey on the neurons?! Stick a honeycomb in your head?![Shiny is concerned about the warrior\u2019s condition\u2026.][However, Shiny thinks the warrior\u2019s butler outfit is very attractive.]My weapon shone by itself in delight. Maybe it was because Shiny was happy, but the sword\u2019s sparkling color looked more exquisite. And I, the owner of that sword, squatted down while holding my head in pain.\u2018You can\u2019t let a butler take over your mind.\u2019I clenched my teeth.\u2018No way. I\u2019ve worked too hard to clear the stages so far!\u2019I was determined.Even if I made tea, I wouldn\u2019t make it like the original character. I used a kettle that he didn\u2019t normally use and pulled out a different teacup from usual. Like that, I gave the tea to the Heretic Questioner.\u201cDeath King.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner took a few sips and tilted his head.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThe tea tastes weird!\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cIf my taste buds are working correctly, this iffy taste is salt, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just how this tea tastes.\u201d\u201cOho. Rather than tea, isn\u2019t this more like saltwater? If you just measure the salinity, I think it\u2019ll be judged simply as saltwater, nothing more, nothing less.\u201d\u201cJust shut up and drink.\u201d\u201cUnderstood! I\u2019ll shut up and drink!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner slurped up the tea.\u201cThank you for the tea! It was salty!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner smiled broadly. Yup. This was how things should be. Our natural psycho finally regained his guilelessness.\u201cSo, what do you think we should do from now?\u201d\u201cWe have to make sure the villainess and the princestay together.\u201dI sighed.\u201cOr at least crush the [love line] between the Lady of the Golden Silk and the crown prince into powder. Let\u2019s aim for one of those two endings.\u201d\u201cOperation Sneaky Sneaky\u2026\u2026?\u201dThe Heretic Questioner chose the name of the operation on his own.Well, it didn\u2019t matter. I also preferred the second ending.I had never dated before, so I didn\u2019t know much, but\u2014\u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be much easier to break something than making it?\u2019It would be difficult to matchmake the crown prince and the Lady of the Silver Lily, but it would be easy to have the Lady of the Golden Silk break up with him.In this part, the Heretic Questioner and I were 100% on the same page.\u201cTo do that, the prince\u2019s love for the Lady of the Golden Silk must become cold! Do you have any plans?\u201d\u201cI do.\u201dI realized something when I was losing my mind while making tea. We need to take special measures for this stage.\u2018There is a way.\u2019Not only would it reduce the prince\u2019s affection for the protagonist, but it would also be very effective in allowing the two of us, especially me, to keep our consciousness.\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d\u201cIn the end, the more you act like [The Lady of the Golden Silk] and the more I act like a [butler], the more immersed we become in the roles.\u201dSo flipping that thought\u2026\u201cThen what if you do [something the Lady of the Golden Silk would never do] and [something the butler would never do]?\u201d\u201cThe character immersion rate may drop. Even if it doesn\u2019t fall, it won\u2019t go up. How does that sound?\u201dThe Heretic Questioner\u2019s eyes shone.\u201c\u2026\u2026Ooh. Indeed. It\u2019s a simple yet good method. As expected of Death King! You\u2019re the Hunter who broke through the unyielding 10th floor and cleared the 20th floor!\u201d\u201cYou flatter me. Mm. Anyway, our conclusion is simple.\u201dI flicked my hand and triggered a skill.\u201cFrom now on, let\u2019s become a [bad girl] and a [bad butler].\u201dThe Heretic Questioner tilted his head.\u201cWhat?\u201dThe Hundred Ghosts Reincarnation activated. I didn\u2019t have to bring in a lot of spirits like I did in the Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon. We only needed one specific ghost.My shadow wriggled and took on the shape of a person.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dA ponytail at the back of his head.Eyes that were more asshole-ish than that of any other being in the universe.\u201cHey\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Flame Emperor. It was Yoo Sooha.As soon as Yoo Sooha was summoned, he frowned. His expression crumpled like tissue, and he opened his mouth.\u201cFuck, you dog bastard. What are you going to make me do this time\u2014.\u201c\u201cCome on, let\u2019s be quiet. Hush.\u201d\u201c\u2014Mmph mmmpph!! Mmppphhh!\u201dNo matter how much he tried to intimidate me, he was a ghost that could not disobey my orders. Yoo Sooha shouted like a hostage whose mouth was sealed by a terrorist, going \u201cMmph! Mmph!\u201d and so on.Seeing the Flame Emperor\u2019s appearance lifted my melancholy mood. What could I say? It felt a bit like closing the lid on top of a trash can. The dust in my heart was refreshingly tidied up. The Flame Emperor. He was like the dustbin inside a vacuum cleaner.\u201cHeretic Questioner.\u201d\u201cYes, Death King!\u201d\u201cLooking at you, your outer appearance is too much like a model student.\u201dI put on a stern expression.\u201cYour gestures and your actions feel very pure. However, if you earnestly want to become a [bad girl], you can\u2019t go on in your current state. It\u2019ll be impossible.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner\u2019s ears perked up.\u201cIf there is something I lack, please let me know! I\u2019ll learn!\u201d\u201cYes, and you\u2019ll be taught. It\u2019s a 1-on-1 last-minute tutoring session.\u201dI slowly looked at Yoo Sooha.\u201cThe greatest tutor will teach you how to be a bad person.\u201d\u201cAha. I\u2019m looking forward to it!\u201d\u201cMmph\u2014, mmph!! Mmm mmph!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner laughed brightly like a young puppy. Yoo Sooha frowned like a bitch. Between the puppy and the dog, I nodded seriously.\u201cNow. Let\u2019s be bad.\u201dThe next day, Sormwyn Academy would explode.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

First, make them hate each other.\u300f\u300eHatred is lightning. Love is thunder. After being blinded by the lightning of hatred, the thunder of love begins to sound.\u300f6.\u201cAre you well?\u201dIt was on the route to Sormwyn Academy.\u201cYes, I slept soundly. Did you also sleep well last night?\u201d\u201cThankfully, yes. Perhaps I had a good dream; I feel refreshed. I\u2019m going to have two slices of toast this morning.\u201d\u201cOh, I want to hear what kind of dream it was. Should we eat together?\u201d\u201cOh my, what a great idea!\u201d\u201cHuhu.\u201dThe students smiled and greeted each other in a quaint, old-fashioned way. On the road with white magnolia blossoms, \u201coh my\u201d and \u201chuhu\u201d smoothly flowed from their lips.Peace. Serenity.Even baby birds gathering together and singing side by side could not be more peaceful than this, nor could a flower garden in full bloom be more serene. The mere sight of this scene would purify someone\u2019s mind. It was a moment that sparkled like a diamond.\u201cAh, Lady of the Golden Silk. Are you well?\u201dBut diamonds were just refined coal.If one lit it up, it would burn very well.\u201cNope! I\u2019m not well at all!\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner grinned at the young lady who greeted him.\u201cThere is no way I could be calm! Some assassin jerks attacked me last night and almost killed me. It\u2019s unfair that I couldn\u2019t sleep at all, and you\u2019re asking me if I\u2019m well? Do you have any sense?\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cNo, you have no thoughts at all. If you did think, you wouldn\u2019t ever ask \u2018Are you well\u2019 to someone who almost died. Ahaha. What needs to be well isn\u2019t me, but your head! Is your head well? Is your skull safe and good? How is your brain?\u201d\u201cAhh\u2026 Yes? Excuse me?\u201d\u201cAhh! Your head was resting so much that your mouth became twisted. It\u2019s all right. I understand! A healthy mind lives in a healthy body. You have a ruined head, so is your mind in good shape? Go on, go to the infirmary. In other words, please get out of my sight!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah, \u2026\u2026Aaah\u2026\u2026.?\u201dWobble.The lady swayed and fainted. If her servant didn\u2019t catch her, she would have rolled all the way to school. The students, who had been greeting each other good morning like usual, screamed.\u201cWhite Orchid Lady! Are you okay?!\u201d\u201cMy goodness! Her complexion is too white\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSomeone, call the nurse!\u201d\u201cBreathe! Can you hear my voice?! You have to breathe!\u201d\u201cLady of the Golden Silk! What did you just say to her\u2026\u2026?!\u201dA clamor.The baby birds singing peacefully were blown away, and a bomb exploded on top of the serene tulip garden. The diamond was blazing. The young noble ladies skillfully attended to their fainted classmate, but they could not hide their shock.The Heretic Questioner smiled.\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? She senselessly asked me if I was well, as I asked her if her head was well!\u201dA young lady nearby opened her mouth.\u201cHer h-head\u2026\u2026 is well\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cAh. Your hair is red. What a cool red! Could it be that your skull broke and your brain is leaking a little? Aha. If so, you\u2019re putting your already unfortunate intelligence at risk of further loss. Come on, pick it up and put it back in!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Haa\u2026\u2026.\u201dWobble.\u201cMiss?!\u201d\u201cKyaa!

Security!\u201dChaos had arrived. It was truly a scene of the Apocalypse. The book Apocalypse hadn\u2019t been destroyed yet, but the route to Sormwyn Academy was being burned to the ground with excitement.\u201cAhaha.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner, who had a 20-meter radius of space to himself, smiled with a face that did not show a single hint of evil. He did have dark circles under his eyes though because of the attitude training he had received overnight.\u201cDeath King, you\u2019re the best! My immersion didn\u2019t go up at all!\u201dHe was also the best.The effect of the Flame Emperor\u2019s one-on-one tutoring was great.\u201cIn the future, I\u2019ll continue to trust you fully! After all, the Death King\u2019s schemes are reliable!\u201dI bowed down at an angle appropriate for a butler.\u201cThank you for the compliments, milady.\u201d\u201cYou are a million times welcome! But is stepping on my foot another way to stop the immersion rate from going up? My big toe hurts a little.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help but act as a bad butler. Please withstand it.\u201d\u201cI understand!\u201dThis morning, a total of 14 ladies entered the academy\u2019s infirmary.The incident on the road in front of the girls\u2019 dormitory quickly spread to the whole school.It was known as the [Is Your Head Well] incident.7.Restaurant, main building, garden.Wherever they went, the students gossiped about the incident.\u300eThe Lady of the Golden Silk has gone mad.\u300f\u300eShe\u2019s changed since she was attacked yesterday.\u300f\u300eShe\u2019s possessed by the devil.\u300f\u300eTwo ladies and one gentleman bravely went to investigate the suspicious rumors and reveal the truth, but they still haven\u2019t returned.\u300f\u300eIsn\u2019t she more attractive now?\u300f\u300eSo who ordered her assassination?\u300f\u300eSormwyn\u2019s unofficial club, \u2018All Older Sisters\u2019 Fan Association (AOSFA) welcomes the current changes. We urge the Sormwyn students to change their perceptions.\u300f\u300eThe Lady of the Golden Silk\u2019s butler was mixing her tea with salt. A lot of witnesses saw it.\u300f\u300eIt\u2019s dangerous.\u300f\u300eAssassination\u300f\u300eI heard the crown prince is taking handling it.\u300f\u300eShe\u2019s gone insane.\u300f\u300eI\u2019m going mad.\u300f\u300eAn appropriate salt intake is good for your health\u2026 Is the salt in the black tea for her well-being?\u300f\u300eGolden Silk unnie.\u300fThe rumors snowballed like an avalanche and became a ghost story.\u201cLady of the Golden Silk! You have insulted the honor of my master!\u201dHowever, even if the rumor became exaggerated, it was true that 14 ladies had fainted. Of course these ladies\u2019 servants were angry.Even if they couldn\u2019t attack a noble lady, they could ask me, a subordinate just like them, to duel. At lunchtime, angry servants rushed in line to fight me.\u201cI cannot stand still as the honor of my master and her family is blemished. Please allow me to duel with the lady\u2019s butler!\u201d\u201cHoho.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner nodded.\u201cOkay! Everyone, solve it nicely among yourse\u2014.\u201cJust a moment.\u201dI secretly stepped on the foot of the Heretic Questioner. The Heretic Questioner winced in pain.\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\u201cOnce you decide to act, you have to continue your bad girl image to the end. Don\u2019t accept what others say right away. That looks too obedient.\u201d\u201cAh, you\u2019re right. That\u2019s true. Then how do I be bad?\u201d\u201cDo as I tell you to do.\u201dWhispers passed between the two of us. The servants who requested duels looked at us with confused faces. After a while, the Heretic Questioner opened his mouth with a face like he had an epiphany.\u201cAll right! You may duel with my servant if you like.\u201d\u201cAh, thank you for your permission. Then, right here\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBut! If you want to fight him, pay me!\u201dThe servants blinked.\u201c\u2026Pardon?\u201d\u201cI mean that you need to pay to get what you want.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner sat on a garden bench and crossed his legs. His radiant face was forceful. If children saw the Heretic Questioner right now, they would probably automatically yell out, \u2018Unnie! \u2018\u201cMy butler belongs to my family. I am the only person in my family who is attending this academy, so he is mine. What if my possession gets hurt during a duel? Are you going to be responsible for that?\u201d\u201cUhh, uhhh\u2026\u2026\u201dThe nobles\u2019 servants were dumbfounded. She wanted them to bribe her so they could have a sacred duel? Wasn\u2019t that too thuggish?\u201cUm, how much should I pay you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take 5 gold coins!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAha.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner delivered the final line that I taught him.\u201cEveryone. It isn\u2019t the case that your loyalty to your masters is worth less than 5 pieces of gold, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe servants took out the gold coins one by one. I felt a little pity as I watched them. Some of the servants looked like they were about to cry.Their faces seemed worried about whether it was honorable to pay to fight for a lady\u2019s honor. A face that seemed to ask, \u2018Is this really the right thing to do? \u2018However, there was no going back. Once a few servants began to pay, the others had to join in.\u201cH-here it is. Lady.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d\u201cI have it too\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYup. Thank you for your patronage!\u201d\u201cPlease, excuse me. I only have silver coins. Would you accept it in small change\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll accept it all!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner ripped off the frugal servants. The dignity of the young lady who was given an epithet from the emperor was buried under the jangling of coins without leaving a trace.Followers take after their masters.\u201cHm.\u201dI cracked my neck up and down, left and right, like a gangster.There were more than ten servants staring at me awkwardly.\u201cLet me ask this, just in case.\u201d\u201cWh-what is it?\u201dI lifted the holy sword, sheath and all.\u201cAmong those of you here, has anyone starved for over a week?\u201dThe thrilling sounds of a beating rang in the garden. I took down the servants one after another, feeling like a drummer. I beat them like a dusty cloth.\u201cAck!\u201d\u201cHuk, keuk?!\u201dCountless students watched as the servants screamed. Looking around, I saw the students staring at me in dismay. Behind me, the Heretic Questioner rolled the coins in his hands and hummed.Screams, gasps, and the jingling of coins.The three melodies formed a perfect trinity.\u201cSy\u2014\u201dAt that moment, someone hastily rushed in among the watching students.\u201cSylvia! What in the world is this about?!\u201dIt was the man who could be said to be the ramen noodles of this Apocalypse: the crown prince.The blond ramen was extremely flustered. My heart felt satisfied when I saw his bloated ramen face. We were returning the embarrassment we felt because of him last night.\u201cI heard rumors that you\u2019ve suddenly become strange, but as always, I thought it was malicious gossip. But now, against our classmates\u2026\u2026. You!\u201dThe prince glared at me, muttering quickly. Well. For ramen soup served with rice, his eyes were quite fierce.\u201cWhat are you doing?! When your master is tired, it is the servant\u2019s responsibility to stop them and help them recover with all their power! You\u2019re a third-rate butler, and utterly disqualified to be a servant! You\u2019re disqualified!\u201d\u201cI apologize, Your Highness.\u201dI put the holy sword on my waist and bowed my head.\u201cThis child is not judged by anyone other than the young lady. If milady evaluates me as a third-rate butler, that is what I am, and if she says that I am disqualified, I will step down. But until that moment, I will remain her faithful butler.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u2026 Despite causing all this disturbance, you shamelessly\u2026\u2026\u201dThe prince closed his mouth and pursed his lips. Then, he shook his head. Did he think it was useless to speak with a servant like me?\u201cSylvia. Didn\u2019t I tell you again and again? You shouldn\u2019t have a man like that as your butler. There are several eunuchs raised with great care in the imperial household. If I ask His Majesty, you can take one of the competent ones. It\u2019s all right! You don\u2019t need to worry. My father already thinks well of you.\u201dWow.The students in the audience exclaimed quietly. Here and there, you could also see young ladies who fell for that adoring look. Just now, the prince expressed his affection so openly.The ladies sighed forlornly and whispered among themselves.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening? His Highness\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is the Lady of the Silver Lily\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut that was an agreement before they were born, right? It\u2019s been too long. It\u2019s been said that the emperor cares for the Lady of the Golden Silk since a long time ago, so maybe\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAh, what would be best?\u201dThe ladies\u2019 eyes sparkled as they talked about what would be the best outcome.There was no scandal as heated as the romance of the imperial family.If the diamonds of their own house burned, they would die from regret, but they would pay a thousand gold to see the most brilliant diamond of another burn.\u201cSylvia, what do you think?\u201dThe prince approached and grabbed the Heretic Questioner\u2019s wrist.\u201cWould you please accept my earnest request?\u201dThe Heretic Questioner looked at the prince.At this moment, I was nervous as well.Will the love of the [female protagonist], the Lady of the Golden Silk, be more intense? Or would the ego of the Heretic Questioner playing the [bad girl] be stronger? I did my best to strengthen the latter, but in the end, it was the Heretic Questioner who had to fight in his mind.We may lose the match.\u201c\u2026\u2026Your Highness.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner slowly opened his mouth.\u201cWhat perfume did you use today?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry to tell you this, but it smells a little strange to me.\u201dA bright smile spread over the Heretic Questioner\u2019s face.Swish.The Heretic Questioner smoothly took his wrist out from the prince\u2019s grasp, then took out a fan and opened it. Over the fan, his eyes narrowed into a smile.\u201cDid you discover who was behind the assassins who attacked me yesterday?\u201d\u201cAh, no\u2026 The investigation is still underway.\u201d\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t had my butler by my side last night, I would have been hurt! If Your Highness is thinking of me, then I ask you to respect my butler just as much. Didn\u2019t he protect the prestige of the academy by protecting my life?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYour Highness. I trust my butler the most!\u201dAt that moment, ramen boiled in the prince\u2019s face.And the Heretic Questioner laughed with his fan wide open.\u201cOh-hohohoho!\u201dIt was the most romance-like laughter in the world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(1) >===================Translator: thursdays Editor: Sasha PR: LightBrin1.Is there anyone who thinks about you as much as I do?Is there anyone who cares about you as much as I do?Have you ever seen someone look at you with more desperate eyes than mine?Have you ever felt a softer touch than my hands?There\u2019s no one. There wouldn\u2019t have been anyone.I would not let them.2.Oh-hohohoho!A peal of romance-like laughter rang through the garden.The prince, whose genuine plea had been met with laughter, looked like he was about to cry.\u201cSy-Sylvia\u2026?\u201d\u201cOhohoho! What is it, Your Highness?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t your laughter a little artificial? O-of course, your voice is like that of a baby bird. No matter how you chirp, it is music to my ears. Still, if you think about keeping up the appearance of nobility\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh-hohohoho! I am very satisfied with this laughter!\u201d\u201cI-is that so?\u201d the prince muttered, stuttering. \u201cI-I see\u2026. That\u2019s how it is\u2026. No. No. Listening to it carefully, it seems to be all right. Um\u2026. Hmm. Yeah! It\u2019s all right. It\u2019s totally fine! You\u2019re so beautiful. I discovered another charming point about you today.\u201dOi. Check out this ramen-head.How did his love for the Lady of the Golden Silk not lessen even with this? All of the students around him were looking at him with slightly cold eyes.-Zombie.Bae Hu-ryeong, who had been quiet for a bit after entering the Apocalypse, opened his mouth.-I\u2019ve been silently watching your play this time. I was trying not to interfere. I can\u2019t watch this anymore, though. It\u2019s too frustrating. Hey, aren\u2019t you misunderstanding something?\u2018A misunderstanding? What am I getting wrong?\u2019-You think it\u2019s easier to break someone\u2019s love than to create it.\u2018Yes.\u2019-I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s case by case.That was what Bae Hu-ryeong said. He had the expression of a mountain gorilla, the prince of the jungle, suddenly being trapped inside a zoo.\u2018Case by case?\u2019-Yeah. You totally exude the aura of someone who\u2019s never dated, but people in love each have slightly different forms of love. Kiddo. There\u2019s a type of love that can\u2019t be cut no matter how much you try to slice it away. It seems to me that the prince guy is\u2026\u2026.The prince opened his mouth before Bae Hu-ryeong could finish his sentence.\u201cSylvia! You truly shine in diverse ways, like a kaleidoscope. If there was snow on the branches yesterday, the tree now blooms with plum blossoms. That\u2019s right. Is a human\u2019s laugh determined by their birth? What law prescribes the way nobility laughs? I too will change the way I laugh now. Mwahahaha!\u201dThat crazy guy\u2026A fantastic duet floated to the sky above the garden.\u201cOhoho!\u201d\u201cMwahaha!\u201d\u201cOh-hohoho!\u201d\u201cMwahahaha!\u201dIt was the birth of the couple of the century.I was speechless.\u2018Wh-what the hell is love\u2026?\u2019I was shocked.-You\u2019ve never dated before. Did you think a kid who\u2019s never known the feeling of love could solve this twisted relationship?Bae Hu-ryeong clicked his tongue.-There are people who have thrown away their country to look good in front of the one they love. It was a good idea to stop the immersion by acting out, but it won\u2019t be enough to destroy love. Yup. Sometimes it\u2019s just lacking.Huh? All of a sudden, Bae Hu-ryeong began to look like an adult. Am I going to have an inferiority complex because I\u2019ve been single? To this mountain gorilla?Isn\u2019t that too shameful?\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201dTap.I stepped between the crown prince and the Heretic Questioner. As if saying, \u2018Look here.\u2019 Naturally, the prince frowned when he saw me.\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d\u201cHer ladyship has told me that she trusts me the most.\u201dNow. Let\u2019s see if your love can hold against this.\u201cYour Highness is a noble man. I am from humble birth. But Your Majesty is far away, while I am always by my ladyship\u2019s side. My mistress\u2019s family is my house, and my mistress\u2019s life is the life that I serve. Your Highness.\u201dScreams of \u201cKyaa!\u201d echoed in the garden. The voices belonged to the young ladies watching us.-No. You. Crazy\u2014 Hey. Hey!Bae Hu-ryeong urgently shouted.-You idiot! Ah, this virgin kid! You really don\u2019t know the rules of love! That guy\u2019s the prince of the empire, so he\u2019ll have a lot of pride! If you say that, the prince will become more jea..\u2026!\u201cHa!\u201dThe crown prince ground his teeth.\u201cYou think yourself so great because you stay by the lady\u2019s side, using the excuse of being a butler. Very well. Then I will take care of Sylvia, too! I\u2019ll watch over Sylvia myself when she is at the academy, so you may leave now.\u201dWhat.He\u2019s the crown prince of this nation!You can be crazy for love, but how could it be this much?!\u201cOhohohoho!\u201dMr. Heretic Questioner. Please stop laughing. I can\u2019t concentrate.\u201c\u2014What in heavens is this fuss now?\u201dIt was then. The murmuring of the students stopped.In one very brief moment. The commotion stopped for less than a second. The silence was only one second long, but that was enough.The young sons and daughters of nobility bowed their heads and cleared the path.\u201c\u2026\u2026Lady of the Silver Lily.\u201dOnly the crown prince looked at her with his eyebrows furrowed.There, the lady with the moonlight in her hair walked.3.\u201cI thought you asked for a sick leave this morning,\u201d the prince said. \u201cI thought that you\u2019d be absent from school today, but is your body feeling better again? Huh. The lady\u2019s heart seems to be quite the troublemaker.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily did not respond right away. Instead, she glanced over our audience, one by one.Flinch.When she met their eyes, the students dropped their gazes. Until now, the students had been fired up by the imperial family\u2019s scandal. Only once they froze did the Lady of the Silver Lily part her lips.\u201cAre you well? I was able to have a peaceful night thanks to your concern.\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that so? That\u2019s good. You call in sick and lay down half the year, so a day like today must be precious. The sun feels nice on this spring day, so you should take a leisurely stroll.\u201dA cold expression.[Take a stroll] was the same thing as saying, [Leave this place]. The crown prince was desperately cloying with the Lady of the Golden Silk, but he was ungenerous toward the Lady of the Silver Lily.His cold-heartedness was a bit odd.\u2018Even if he\u2019s from the imperial family, it shouldn\u2019t be good to treat someone from the ducal family this harshly\u2026.\u2019However, the Lady of the Silver Lily was calm.\u201cA stroll sounds wonderful. The magnolia petals fall when the spring breeze becomes even a little rough. I worry that if I enjoy the walk alone, the flowers will be lonely.\u201dUnlike last night\u2019s struggle for words at the ball, the Lady of the Silver Lily had a silver tongue.\u201cYour Highness. Don\u2019t let yourself be dirtied in this clamorous crowd. Would you like to accompany me on a walk in the comfort of springtime?\u201d\u201cHa. Why would I\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLady of the Golden Silk.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily addressed the Heretic Questioner.\u201cYou should also walk together.\u201dThe prince shut his mouth.All the eyes nearby were drawn to the Heretic Questioner.\u201cHmm.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner gripped his fan and glanced at me.\u2018What should I do, Death King?\u2019 is what his eyes told me. \u2018Should I follow them?\u2019 His eyes showed that he would totally accept my decision.Would it be okay?The Lady of the Silver Lily and the crown prince. Both of them were dangerous. Merely being close to them deepened our immersions. The Heretic Questioner became closer to the Lady of the Golden Silk, and I became closer to the butler.It was dangerous, but nothing would be solved if we stayed still.\u201c\u2026What is your immersion rate now?\u201dI whispered in a voice that would only be heard by the Heretic Questioner.\u201cDid it rise?\u201d\u201cYes. It went up a little.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner whispered back, \u201cMy immersion rate is now 17 percent. Aha, it rose one percent when the prince spoke to me. It rose another one percent when I saw the Lady of the Silver Lily. In total, it\u2019s 2 percent higher than yesterday.\u201d2%.Compared to last night\u2019s insane increase, the immersion speed had definitely slowed down. Should we take the risk now and enter the tiger\u2019s den? If not now, when would be better?I met the Heretic Questioner\u2019s eyes.\u201cWhen spring comes?\u201dThe Heretic Questioner smiled brightly.\u201cThe magnolia falls, Death King.\u201dOkay.I made a decision.\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s follow along, milady.\u201d\u201cI trust your judgment, butler.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner closed the fan with a smack.\u201cOh-hohoho! I cannot refuse when the Lady of the Silver Lily personally suggested a walk. I gladly accept your invitation!\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily frowned. Then, she lightly turned around.\u201cFollow me quietly.\u201d4.The place she led us to was her own lodgings. The Lady of the Silver Lily, whose family had great power, did not stay in the dormitories. She stayed and ate at a separate villa.\u201cThis is where you come to [walk]?\u201d the prince complained, who had been half-forced into following.The Lady of the Silver Lily\u2019s accommodations were fancier than the other students\u2019, but that was all. The prince was someone raised in the imperial palace. He didn\u2019t seem impressed by the luxury.\u201cDo you think I would do that?\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily kept walking, unaffected by his words. Click. Click. The lady\u2019s shoes made a noise whenever they hit the hallway.\u201cThe walk was an excuse.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThere were many eyes in the garden. I couldn\u2019t tell you the truth like that. It must remain a secret.\u201d\u201c\u2026A secret?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dClick.\u201cIt\u2019s about the assassins who dared to invade the cradle of nobility. Your Highness. Rashly speaking can agitate the public.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe prince kept his mouth shut.From my deductions, the prince was the one who hired the assassins. Maybe it was just her air, but the Lady of the Silver LIly\u2019s tone seemed to say [I already know what you did].\u201c\u2026You mean you caught the culprit? Even I have not done so yet with my investigation. How could you?\u201d\u201cThe Lady of the Golden Silk\u2019s butler gave me a clue.\u201dClick.\u201cLast night, I threw out the lady and her servant from the ball. I had been overreacting. However, I only ordered them to be taken away, not for them to be locked up anywhere. It seems that some of my subordinates had evil intentions.\u201dThe villa of the duke\u2019s daughter had a staircase that led to the basement. Standing in front of it, the Lady of the Silver Lily looked back at us.Her face was expressionless.\u201cShall we go down, Your Highness?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t see the servants. How bizarre. Where did the duchy\u2019s servants go?\u201d\u201cAre you worried? I suppose you must be. I will take the lead.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily went down the stairs without answering the prince\u2019s question. Her clicking footsteps seeped through the basement. Click. Click\u2026. Soon, the darkness of the stairs buried the Lady of the Silver Lily.The prince gulped and started going down the stairs.The Heretic Questioner and I also followed them.Something thickened in the air as we went down the stairs. It was something that my nose and my life were becoming too used to. The scent of blood. The Heretic Questioner and I weren\u2019t flustered, but the prince\u2019s shoulders ahead of us flinched.\u201c\u2014I apologize for bringing you to such a squalid place, Your Highness.\u201dIn the basement, three human beings were tied down in chairs.All three were the duchy\u2019s servants whom I saw last night, and\u2014\u201cThese are the people behind the assassins who attacked the Lady of the Golden Silk.\u201dAll three were soaked in blood.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe prince\u2019s hands trembled.Even I frowned a little. The only ones whose expressions did not change after descending the stairs were the Heretic Questioner and the Lady of the Silver Lily.It was understandable why the Heretic Questioner was unaffected. He was the guild master of the Ten Thousand Temple, which carried out uncountable numbers of torture and interrogations in the Tower.However, the other person was just a duke\u2019s daughter. She resembled the moonlight. Staggering and swaying like she would fall any moment, she appeared fragile. That girl stood here as if she was very familiar with these types of places.\u201cThis is the result of the investigation I did overnight.\u201dThen, I remembered.\u201cIt turned out that they had done it for personal revenge.\u201dThe lady in front of me was the person who would destroy the world.\u201cPersonal\u2026 revenge?\u201d\u201cYes. Would you like to hear about it?\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily grabbed a servant by his hair. \u201cAghh!\u201d The servant opened his eye in agony. Could he not open his right eye? He looked at us with only his left.\u201cHis Highness the Prince has honored us with a visit. Pay respect.\u201d\u201cMilady, euk\u2026\u2026 Miladyyy\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou and your colleagues ordered an assassination. The target was the Lady of the Golden Silk. Explain to the prince why you attempted to kill the lady.\u201d\u201cMilady\u2026 miss\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you tell the truth, your family will remain unharmed.\u201dThis person.\u201cTh-the Lady of the Golden Silk\u2026 The daughter of a lowly baron on the outskirts doesn\u2019t know her place and, and dares to chase the crown prince\u2026\u2026 M-milady is His Highness\u2019s rightful fianc\u00e9e\u2026 That\u2019s right, she\u2019s his fianc\u00e9e. The agreement was m-made a long time ago.\u201dShe was dangerous.\u201cI was frustrated because\u2026 angry because of the baron\u2019s daughter, so\u2026 Stop, I did something foolish.. I apologize. I apologize, milady. I apologize, Your Highness\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDid anyone order you to hire an assassin?\u201d\u201cN-no one. There\u2019s nobody who pulled the strings\u2026\u2026\u201dBut there was.\u201cAre you saying it was just the three of you?\u201dThis was a false testimony.\u201cYes\u2026 That\u2019s right, milady\u2026 That\u2019s right\u2026.\u201dIt was to protect the prince.\u201cAre you certain?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no mistake\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAll right. I see.\u201dTo protect the prince of this country, the Lady of the Silver Lily deliberately brought about a [false testimony].She must have ensured the three of them would say the same thing, concocted an alibi, and perfectly manipulated all evidence.These people would never be able to reveal the fact that they were [the prince\u2019s agents].The prince\u2019s act of confining the Heretic Questioner and me in the warehouse was moved [behind the scenes].So was his attempt to intervene and [pretend to be a hero] during the crisis.The Lady of the Silver Lily was trying to bury all truth in the ground.For none other than the crown prince.For the man who would be affected the most if the truth were revealed.\u201cYour Highness.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily lifted her head and looked at the prince.\u201cPlease punish them.\u201dThe prince flinched.\u201cWhat do you mean, punish\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cThese are the men who tried to kill the Lady of the Golden Silk, whom Your Highness cares about. They are criminals who invaded the cradle of nobility. They deserve to be punished, and you can punish them. Your Highness is currently the foundation of this country.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy do you hesitate?\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lady asked,\u201cIs there perhaps a different truth to this case than what I have discovered?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI tell you this not as a student of the academy but as someone who will be Your Highness\u2019s vassal. Your Highness, the foundation of the country. If you find my investigation to be insufficient, please push the punishment onto another. As this matter is serious, I will send notice to the emperor\u2019s special operatives.\u201dThe emperor\u2019s special operatives.As soon as I heard that, a memory of the \u2018butler\u2019 was revived.They were hunting dogs under the control of one person and did not answer to anyone else. Made up of the empire\u2019s top swordsmen and magicians, they were given absolute rights over independent investigation.The reason why this prince was able to take over as the crown prince was because they swallowed up the former crown prince, who had been corrupt.\u201cHowever, if you are satisfied with this investigation, there is no need for such troublesome work.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily bowed her back.On the basement floor, there was a sword that seemed to have been prepared in advance.\u201cIn this place, please punish\u2014\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily rolled up her sleeves like she was familiar with the movement.Both her arms had numerous scars marking her skin.\u201c\u2014the one who didn\u2019t properly manage the servants of her family\u2014\u201dWounds from stabs, cuts, scratches, pulls, flogs, and torture took space on every part of her arms, which were originally as white as lilies. No, it wasn\u2019t just both arms. Seeing the long dent in her shoulder that looked as if a worm had burrowed through, I knew that her whole body must be covered with scars.The Lady of the Silver Lily, with her head down, whispered.\u201c\u2014Please punish me.\u201dThe silver lily.The villainous young lady of this world.\u201cAs always, I will bear the sin.\u201dThe crown prince trembledPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95. <Villain. (2) >===================Translator: thursdays ED: Sasha PR: LightBrin5.\u2026My beloved daughter.\u2026Don\u2019t expect anything.\u2026Do not expect anything at all.\u2026Do not expect things, and do not count on things. That is the secret to life.\u2026Every time you tell yourself, \u2018Maybe this time,\u2019 the world will whisper back, \u2018This time, for certain.\u2019 Being fooled once is an experience, and being fooled twice is a tragedy. But being fooled three times is a farce.\u2026My dear daughter, you are a noble. Be cautious, and do not let your life become someone else\u2019s joke. Do not let them have three chances.\u2026Two. Just two wounds are enough to be remembered forever. Those kings of old set up memorials for their death while they were still alive. Do not repeat the foolishness of building monuments in the desert.\u2026But if you still want to leave something to the world, my daughter, remember. You are not lending your life to someone. Do not try to be someone\u2019s debtor. Give without the intention of getting it back in the first place. Give everything.\u2026Forgive people for throwing carnivals with your dead body. Give them your hair. Give them your fingers. Give everything, sacrifice everything from your pureness to your naive hopes. They will ravenously desire all of you and enjoy their banquet.\u2026So leave, and do not leave anything behind in this world.Anything.That was your mother\u2019s will when she died.Her funeral was a cremation.6.The basement was quiet.\u201cIs something wrong?\u201dThere was only the quiet voice of Lady of the Silver Lily. The air was cold. The servants who were interrogated had shed blood, but the pools of blood did not heat the basement at all.\u201cPlease, punish me quickly as foundation of this country.\u201d\u201cHa, ha.\u201dThe prince laughed weakly.No, could we even say that was a laugh? The tip of his mouth just lifted slightly and trembled. It was a gruesome failure of a smile.He turned his head like he was escaping and looked at the Heretic Questioner and me. His eyes asked, [What do you two think of this absurd situation?]\u201cYour Highness.\u201dBut he couldn\u2019t escape. The cutting voice of the Lady of the Silver Lily severed the prince\u2019s gaze.\u201cShould I report their crimes to His Majesty\u2019s special operatives?\u201dThe crown prince hesitated.\u201cAre you trying to follow in the footsteps of the discarded crown prince?\u201d\u201cAre you testing the extent of His Majesty\u2019s forgiveness for you?\u201dA threat.Her quiet tone was not rude, but the duchy\u2019s young lady, the Lady of the Silver Lily, was clearly giving the prince a hard time.It was an effective threat.\u201cUh.\u201dThe imperial heir\u2019s hand trembled. Shaking, he grabbed the sword that the lady had offered him. However, his determination only lasted to holding the grip of the sword. He wasn\u2019t mad enough to swing the sword.\u201cSylvia\u2026\u201dThe prince helplessly let the tip of the sword point down. He looked at us blankly. Did he want one of us to come forward and stop the Lady of the Silver Lily?\u201cWhat a neat resolution!\u201dHowever, the Heretic Questioner laughed brightly.\u201cIt\u2019s neat how you brought in the two of us in addition to the crown prince. Aha. So everyone here will become [accomplices] and keep their mouths shut by your calculations. It\u2019ll be good for His Highness since his blunders will be covered up. And it\u2019ll be good for me since the Lady of the Silver Lily is being punished!\u201d\u201cSy-Silvia?\u201d\u201cThe problem here is that only Your Ladyship gains nothing from this.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner\u2019s eyes curved like a crescent moon.\u201cDo you receive any benefit by doing things this way? Your Ladyship. Three loyal servants of the duke are dying. You\u2019ll even receive corporal punishment on the prince\u2019s behalf. I\u2019m really curious about what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. As I said, these are my family\u2019s servants, and I, as the daughter of this family, should be held responsible for their mistake\u2026\u201d\u201cAha, how pretty! But that isn\u2019t efficient when it comes to a debate! Let\u2019s be honest with each other to have a more fruitful discussion. Why would you be punished on the prince\u2019s behalf? Is this Your Ladyship\u2019s \u2018love\u2019?\u201dThe sound of breathing in the basement.The silver and gold ladies stared at each other for a moment.\u201cIt is only what I must do to be his subject, Lady of the Golden Silk.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily replied in a composed voice, not even moving her eyebrows.\u201cThinking of my own benefit or cost is disloyal. Perhaps you find this difficult to understand since your family is from the countryside.\u201d\u201cIn other words, you don\u2019t want something in return?\u201d\u201cDo you want me to answer? Give up. Whether you understand me or not has no influence on my behavior.\u201d\u201cHow curious\u2026\u201dThe Heretic Questioner exhaled like a sigh. It was difficult for me to guess right away what he meant by that.But one thing was certain. The Heretic Questioner\u2019s response was definitely not what the crown prince had hoped for. The Heretic Questioner did not intend to stop the Lady of the Silver Lily. The face of the prince, who had clung onto his love, was stained with despair.\u201c\u2026Please wait a moment, milady.\u201dSo, I had no choice but to open my mouth.The Heretic Questioner tilted his head and looked at me.\u201cYes, butler? What is it?\u201d\u201cIf those servants are really the culprits, then you also have the right to take revenge. It would be wrong to leave the punishment solely to the prince.\u201dMy mouth felt stale. My head was spinning. To overcome this ridiculously complicated political incident\u2026 I devoted myself to thinking about [the best course]. I did not hesitate to use the butler\u2019s knowledge.[The immersion toward the character has deepened.][Currently, your immersion rate is 7%.]My tongue dried to a crisp. But it was still okay, for now.\u201c\u2026The same is true for the Lady of the Silver Lily. She was betrayed by her faithful servants. I believe this is more than enough reason that she deserves to punish these men.\u201d\u201cOoh. So?\u201d\u201cThere are three servants who have sinned. There are also three people who are entitled to punish them.\u201dI looked at the servants, tied up in the chairs.\u201cWhat if each person punishes one culprit each?\u201dSilence.\u201cIn any case, the Lady of the Silver Lily wishes to make us accomplices. That\u2019s why she brought us here\u2026. And His Highness seems to be unable to carry out the punishment alone. I believe that it will be appropriate to divide the punishment equally.\u201dThere was a hush for a while.\u201cHmm.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner closed an eye.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily pinched her brows without a word.The crown prince\u2019s complexion quickly brightened.\u201cRight! Sylvia\u2019s servant is correct. The Lady of the Silver Lily was betrayed by her subordinates. Sylvia was attacked. And I need to uphold the law! Since everyone has their own reasons, it would be best to each take care of one!\u201d\u201cYour Highness. A king should not share his duties with others\u2014\u201c\u201cShut it!\u201dThe prince nervously threw the sword at the Lady of the Silver Lily. Thwap! The sheath bounced off the lady\u2019s leg and to the ground.The Lady of the Silver Lily looked impassive, though it must have hit hard enough to bruise.\u201cIf something happens, kill it! Punish it! Beat it! That\u2019s the only thing you know how to say! How many people do you think I\u2019ve taken care of until now?!\u201d\u201cIt is the duty of the one who will lead this empire in the future.\u201d\u201cI am not a killer! I\u2019m no murderer! You spiteful woman. How wicked! If you want to see blood so much, you kill someone first!\u201dThe prince huffed, and the lady of the duchy quietly looked at him. Time seemed to freeze.The thin ice in the air broke as the lady slowly bent down. She lifted the sword. Her hands continued to move. Her left hand was over the sheath and her right hand on the hilt.Skillfully, the Lady of the Silver Lily drew the blade.\u201cYour Highness.\u201dThe color of the blade resembled her hair.\u201cIf so, at least give me an order.\u201d\u201cO-order?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness. Order me to execute them. Why are you hesitating? Did you forget how to give an order? Is it because you want to give up your claim to sovereignty?\u201dThe prince inhaled deeply.\u201cK-\u201cHe fumbled over the word.\u201cKill him\u2026.\u201dHowever, the Lady of the Silver Lily never missed.Blood splattered.The air in the basement split apart, as did the weightier flesh.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily\u2019s shoulders shook a little as if she was sighing. That was all. After taking a life with a sigh, the Lady of the Silver Lily looked at us.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI felt something ominous. My heart throbbed disturbingly.I realized how I felt for the Lady of the Silver Lily.[The immersion toward the character has deepened.][Currently, your immersion rate is 8%.]It was something instinctive that told me that [this person will someday stand in the way of the Lady of the Golden Silk].It was an obsessive compulsion to deal with the person in front of my eyes.\u201cAhaha. You\u2019re becoming more and more interesting to me! Mm, very good!\u201dThat was why my immersion rate was rising like crazy.\u201cIt\u2019ll be troublesome to leave the person who tried to assassinate me alone. Please hand me the sword. I\u2019ll take care of the second one. Now, shall I become an accomplice?\u201dHow many people has the Heretic Questioner killed so far?I didn\u2019t know, but it was very clear that the Heretic Questioner was not an amateur in this.As soon as the Heretic Questioner received the sword, he hummed and completed the execution in one blow.Now, there was one servant left.\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dThere was only one person left who needed to administer punishment.The prince opened his mouth and looked at the Heretic Questioner. He didn\u2019t seem to expect that the Heretic Questioner would execute someone so easily.\u201cUgh, euh\u2026!\u201dThen something shocking, no\u2013something unbelievable, happened. The prince took a back step and tried to run away. Before the Lady of the Silver Lily could say anything, the Heretic Questioner said, \u201cAh!\u201d As he did, the prince ran off.Nobody had expected it, so the crown prince nearly succeeded in getting away. Yup. If I didn\u2019t block the basement stairs behind them.\u201cH-how impertinent! Whose path do you think you\u2019re blocking, servant?\u201d\u201cYou.\u201dI snatched the prince\u2019s wrist and gripped it tightly. I intentionally increased my strength.The prince tried to shake off my hand but failed. He let out a low scream. He couldn\u2019t compare with me in terms of grip strength in the first place.\u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2026 Agh! Let go of me this instant!\u201d\u201cIt happened because of you, did it not?\u201dThe voice that spilled out of my mouth was cold even to my ears. It wasn\u2019t my usual voice.\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have happened if you did not order the assassination attempt on a whim. You were so crazy for love that you set up a kidnapping act. Well, things like that may happen sometimes. But do you plan to ignore your responsibility just because you\u2019re crazy?\u201dI glowered at the prince.\u201cHold it.\u201d\u201cH-hold it\u2026 What am I supposed to\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe sword. Hold it.\u201dThe prince flinched.[The immersion toward the character has deepened.][Currently, your immersion rate is 9%.]The immersion increased, but that didn\u2019t matter. Right now, my feelings were the same as the butler\u2019s. Anger at this cowardly escape.I grabbed the prince\u2019s wrist and dragged him along. He resisted, trying hard not to be pulled by me. However, I ignored his attempts.\u201cHold the sword\u2019s hilt.\u201d\u201cUgh, you rude thing\u2026! You dare\u2026!\u201dSince he didn\u2019t want to hold it, I forced him to.\u201cRaise the sword properly.\u201d\u201cLet go! I order you to let me go! I-is anybody there?!\u201dSince he did not want to raise the sword, I had to force him to do so.\u201cIt shows how much you\u2019ve let others take the blame until now. The dirty work, the vulgar work, the things that you didn\u2019t want to touch. You must have handed all of these over to the Lady of the Silver Lily. You, who is the prince of this country.\u201d\u201cSy\u2026 Silvia! Control your butler! Please! Sylvia!\u201d\u201cStrike with the sword.\u201dThe prince\u2019s arm strength was negligible. It was easy to overcome.So, I overcame it.\u201cAh.\u201dThe smell of blood in the basement became a bit thicker. The servant\u2019s body, tied to the chair, slid down.The prince looked in front of him with a devastated expression. At his feet, the Lady of the Silver Lily slowly bent her knees. The hem of her skirt dipped into the pool of blood, turning red.\u201cIt will please everyone that the foundation of the empire has upheld our nation\u2019s order, Your Highness.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe prince did not answer. He turned his back without a word. This time, I let his hands go.\u201cPlease keep your heart firm and continue to execute fair judgment in the future.\u201dThe prince tiredly climbed the basement stairs. Thud, thud\u2026. Meanwhile, the Lady of the Silver Lily continued to advise him. Her persistent voice bounced off the prince\u2019s back and returned to the basement.\u201cThe fate of this country and its people rely on Your Highness\u2019s mindset. Your Highness may be one person, but your actions are not yours alone. Each of Your Highness\u2019s actions and decisions has a great influence on the empire. Please.\u201dThe sound of footsteps became faint with distance and cut off. We continued looking at the Lady of the Silver Lily, who still had her head bowed.\u201cBecome strong.\u201dI.I wanted to understand this person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96. <Villain. (3)>=============================Translator: thursdays PR: LightBrin3.It was the third day since we fell into the Apocalypse.The Lady of the Silver Lily was absent from the academy.\u201cThey say she\u2019s in bed because her body\u2019s unwell.\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. She gets sick often, so of course she would fall ill after interrogating her servants all night long!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner took small sips of the black tea (which contained a large amount of sodium, good for his health).\u201cPhysical fitness is the nation\u2019s strength! It\u2019s difficult to achieve your goals even if you have a great cause when your body is weak. Mm, what a shame. The Lady of the Silver Lily is a talented person who can overturn the empire\u2026.\u201d\u201cI heard that the prince is absent as well.\u201d\u201cAhaha. Yes, yes. It\u2019s all thanks to you, butler. Maybe he received too much of a shock. He might even apply for a leave of absence.\u201dWe were in one part of the garden, having teatime by the magnolias. The other students passing through the garden were startled when they saw us.\u201cIt\u2019s the crazy master-servant pair!\u201d\u201cThe naughty lady!\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t go near them!\u201dYoung ladies lifted up the hems of their dresses and the young men rolled up the ankles of their pants to run away.Thanks to this, we had the spacious garden to ourselves. Sweet.\u201cHeretic Questioner, you just called me [butler], not [Death King]. Be careful.\u201d\u201cAh! I apologize. My mistake. It\u2019s hard to control myself since my immersion is over 20 percent. Oh, also, this salted tea is surprisingly charming! Another cup please, butler.\u201d\u201cYou called me a butler again\u2026.\u201dI sighed and poured more tea into the lady\u2019s teacup.Splish.\u201cMhm.\u201dI began to hum. After taking on the butler\u2019s role, I realized that tea ceremonies were quite deep. The way the tea poured from the pot drop by drop and gathered in the cup, the way the liquid rippled as it poured\u2014it was beautiful. This culture truly suited the young lady\u2026\u2026.[The immersion toward the character has deepened.][Currently, your immersion rate is 10%.]\u201cKyaah?!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner jumped.\u201cButler, why did you suddenly dump the tea on me?! It\u2019s hot! It\u2019ll definitely damage my delicate hair!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, [Kyaah]! That\u2019s not the way you normally scream! Has your body and heart become one with the Lady of the Golden Silk Plum? Tell me this. When spring comes?!\u201d\u201cThe magnolias drop, and the butler\u2019s hair will fall off too.\u201d\u201cAaaack!\u201dThere was a moment when I experienced the horror that I might lose my hair.We calmed down and stopped fighting. I acted like a proper servant and brushed the Heretic Questioner\u2019s hair.The Heretic Questioner\u2019s hair had grown a bit over the past few days. Was it the effect of his sacred transformation technique? Or was it because he was becoming more and more like the Lady of the Golden Plum Silk?\u201cYour expressions show much more emotions than before, Heretic Questioner.\u201dI ran my fingers through his golden hair. I had never combed someone\u2019s hair or had mine be combed by someone, but my hands moved on their own.\u201cYou used to smile all the time. In another way, it was like you weren\u2019t smiling at all. Rather than smiling because you were happy, it felt like smiling was a default expression.\u201d\u201cAha. Am I different now?\u201d\u201cYes. You\u2019ve become more emotional. Or should I say vivid? Now, I feel like I understand why you smile when you smile. Whether you\u2019re smiling because you\u2019re pleased or if you\u2019re faking it.\u201d\u201cI see. I\u2019m also aware of that. Death King, do you think that this is a good thing?\u201dI quietly looked down at the back of the Heretic Questioner\u2019s head. It was a small head. Small body. Small shoulders. Small arms. I thought about how many people he must have killed despite his small body.The Heretic Questioner.From Europe, Bulgaria to be specific, and a first-generation Hunter.Age unknown.Number of murders, unknown.\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes. I think it\u2019s a good trend.\u201dI opened my mouth.\u201cHonestly, I was wondering what to do with you.\u201d\u201cMm? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a crazy, psychopathic killer.\u201dI slowly tied the back of the Heretic Questioner\u2019s hair. It reminded me of taking care of my younger siblings at the orphanage.\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t kill you without a reason. The Black Dragon Guild and even the Sword Saint, who hates people like you the most, kept you alive. Which means there\u2019s a reason not to kill you.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner laughed. He didn\u2019t seem surprised to hear I was wondering if I should kill him. Rather, he seemed to find it fun.\u201cAn accurate discernment!\u201d\u201cWhy do you kill people?\u201dI finally asked the question I had wanted to ask very much.\u201cYou may be a psychopath, but you\u2019re a psychopath who can listen. You know how to understand others in your own way. Then, why murder them?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner stroked his chin. He radiated an atmosphere of deep thought. In the distance, beyond the flower bushes in the garden, there was the quiet sound of students laughing.The Heretic Questioner turned his head. Then, he began to whisper so only I would hear.\u201cFirst of all, I should tell you that I\u2019m very talented.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner made some hand signs.\u201cSacred technique, Hidden Spirit!\u201dOne of the Heretic Questioner\u2019s gloves disappeared.\u201cIt is one of the sacred techniques that I can use. I can make anything, no matter what it is, disappear from the world. Of course, I can also use this technique to get rid of evidence and bodies after a murder.\u201dHis bare fingers waved in the air.\u201cIf a powerful person doesn\u2019t kill people, it isn\u2019t because they\u2019re a good person! Death King, they simply find it annoying to cover up the corpse and are afraid of being discovered later. But I don\u2019t have to worry about annoyance or fear!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe Tower really was confusing in the first generation.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner\u2019s face turned bright.\u201cThe revival of slavery. Racial discrimination and nationalism. Terrorism. Manipulation. Genocide. Incitement and fabrication. Ideological conflicts. It was a bit like compressing all of human history and melting it in your mouth. The feeling that [At this rate, we will all perish] spread to small and medium warlords, the current five guilds.\u201dThe Black Dragon. Sangryun. Ten Thousand Temple. Chen Mu-mun. The Civil Militia.\u201cThe five gathered.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner spoke as if he were reciting some epic.\u201cThe Black Dragon\u2019s guildmaster spoke first!\u201d[I\u2019ll leave out the useless words. Let\u2019s make an everlasting non-aggression pact.]\u201cThe Count added a condition.\u201d[Guarantee that Sangryun will have exclusive rights to supplies from the outside world.]\u201cAnd I added this!\u201d[I want every guild to have its own exclusive territory! That\u2019s my condition for cooperating with this cover-up!]\u201cThe Venomous Snake complained.\u201d[Well, the craziest guys are the most reliable ones. Tsk, tsk. It\u2019s the end of the world, really\u2026. But why is this coffee so bitter? Who gave me coffee that I didn\u2019t even order? Oi. Look at this. Hey?!]\u201cThe Sword Saint organized things!\u201d[I won\u2019t say, \u2018Do what you have to do.\u2019 I\u2019ll say, \u2018Do what you want to do.\u2019 Tonight, we will be killing people with our own conviction, our judgments, and our methods.]\u201cThat night, 4,653 people died.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner\u2019s smile was still bright.\u201cThe next night, 10,171 people died. Then the next night, 8,275 people. And the next night, 7,412 people, and the night after that, 23,781.\u201dThey died.They died.They died. The Heretic Questioner continued to repeat that refrain.After a while, he happily said, \u201cAnd then,\u201dThe Heretic Questioner said that the day came suddenly.\u201cThat night, nobody died.\u201dIt was the end of a long cleanup operation.He said that the Black Dragon Witch cried that night.And as for the Sword Saint\u2014[I will take responsibility and resign.]The Sword Saint was the commander of the Civil Militia at the time.[And I will never speak of this again. I allowed the massacre. I participated in it. I did it even though I knew I shouldn\u2019t have. I will despise all of you forever. And I will hate myself a little more than that.]He left.After that day, the position of the Civil Militia\u2019s commander remained perpetually empty.\u201cSince then, the Crusader has been in charge of the Civil Militia.\u201dThe CrusaderThe vice leader of the Civil Militia. The Crusader always introduced herself like that and had always been called that.\u201cThe Crusader regretted it.\u201dI suddenly remembered the night when the Crusader blocked the Sword Saint along with the Alchemist. Was this the reason for the subtle tension between the Crusader and the Sword Saint?\u201cBut I didn\u2019t regret it! It was a necessary sacrifice!\u201dThe Heretic Questioner grinned.\u201cBut, maybe because I\u2019m being immersed into the Lady of the Golden Silk Plum? I had a weird thought just now.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cDeath King. I think things might have gone differently if you were there.\u201d\u201cHow interesting. I\u2019ve never felt this mood before.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner raised his head. He stopped whispering. In the sky, magnolias were blooming.\u201cDo you people always live in this sort of mood? If I had only done something back then. If this happened at that time. Do you drift, wander, and live among these thoughts?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner lamented.\u201cWell,\u201d the 5th-ranked Hunter said with a sigh. \u201cThis is why people are so beautiful and lovely.\u201d\u201cHeretic Questioner\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf I were also like everyone else\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Heretic Questioner stopped talking for a moment.\u201cMm.\u201d He continued. \u201cMmm.\u201dAnd then.\u201cIt\u2019s troublesome, butler. I keep desiring more and more to stay in this world.\u201dThe moment the Heretic Questioner smiled, I heard a voice.[The immersion toward the character is deepened.][Currently, your immersion rate is 11%.]I realized then.I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to kill this person.I couldn\u2019t kill someone who knew how to feel regret.\u201cMilady.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhen spring comes.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner waved his hand. The missing glove suddenly returned and wrapped his bare hand. It was a white glove patterned with flower petals. The Heretic Questioner beamed.\u201cSpring is nice. Would you like to go for a walk, butler?\u201dTime seemed to stop.I didn\u2019t know what kind of expression I made. Then, the Heretic Questioner looked at my face and said, \u201cPfft!\u201d while laughing. He was laughing so hard he had to hold onto his stomach.\u201cAhahaha! Ha! Your complexion is fantastic, Death King! It turned blue in an instant! You looked like a corpse!\u201d\u201cReally, you\u2026\u2026 Even if it\u2019s a joke, something like this\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I guess having emotions made me a bit of a prankster! Ah, I understand. Now I know what I usually feel when I\u2019m with you, Death King! I feel like I\u2019m looking at a reliable big brother!\u201d\u201cA big brother\u2026. You\u2019re from the first generation. Aren\u2019t you actually older than me?\u201d\u201cNo comment!\u201dBut then, the Heretic Questioner continued, \u201cIt is clear that I am becoming quickly immersed into the role of the Lady of the Golden Plum Silk! Even during this conversation, my immersion rose by 1 percent. My immersion rate is now 32%. Tomorrow, it may increase to over 50 percent! That\u2019s how much I\u2019m addicted to feeling [emotions].\u201dThe Heretic Questioner touched the back of his head, where I had tied his hair.\u201cI am the protagonist of this Apocalypse\u2019s tale. But you will be the main character in the end. Death King, before I drown in emotions and become absorbed by the Lady of the Golden Plum Silk, please save the ending.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201dI nodded.\u201cI promise.\u201dThe Heretic Questioner smiled.\u201cI believe in you, my butler.\u201dThat night, the Heretic Questioner\u2019s immersion rate went over 50 percent.4.\u2018In the end, it is the Lady of the Silver Lily who will destroy this world.\u2019I headed to the Lady of the Silver Lily\u2019s lodgings under the pretext of checking on her health.\u2018She\u2019s the key. I need to understand her. Her love, jealousy, tolerance, arrogance, and monopoly\u2026. I have to understand it all if I want to complete this Apocalypse. And I will.\u2019Unlike yesterday, the lady\u2019s residence was filled with servants.\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I said politely. \u201cWould it be possible for me to see the young lady of the duchy?\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cI was sent over by the Lady of the Golden Plum Silk.\u201dThe servants\u2019 faces turned hard. It was well-known that their master and the Lady of the Golden Plum Silk had a bad relationship. \u201cPlease wait a minute!\u201d yelled one of the servants, running to the Lady of the Silver Lily\u2019s quarters.After a while, the servant returned with a bitter expression.\u201c\u2026Follow me. The lady has permitted you to greet her.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dThe servant guided me not to the Lady of the Silver Lily\u2019s parlor or bedroom, but her office. Numerous servants came and went with reports.\u201cHere is a letter from the Lepanore region, milady.\u201d\u201cPut it on the left side of my desk.\u201d\u201cMilady, The Lady of the Green Pine sent this in place of the viscount family head. Since the season is what it is, it seems like a request for exchanging crops\u2026.\u201d\u201cSend it to finances for review and bring it back.\u201d\u201cMilady.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily, who was looking at some documents at the desk in the center of the office, raised her head. Her red eyes glanced over my body. She said casually,\u201cA guest has arrived. Everyone, leave.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily flipped over a sand timer on her desk.\u201cI will give you a 15-minute break.\u201dThe servants rushed out.In the spacious office, only the Lady of the Silver Lily and I were left.\u201cSo.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily put down her quill.\u201cYou say the Lady of the Golden Plum Silk sent you here? That\u2019s commendable. She used to grind her teeth whenever she saw me just a few days ago. She\u2019s become a different person from then.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026She heard that you collapsed because you were ill. You seem healthy. How surprising.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still a student. I need a proper excuse to take care of things outside of class. Even so, it\u2019s too much to say that I\u2019m healthy.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily coughed.\u201cI\u2019ve been keeping an eye on your performance. In a short period, you\u2019ve managed to notice spies in my employ. It isn\u2019t only your lady that has changed, but also you. It seems that someone with a good head was chosen for this time\u2019s [actor]. How fortunate for the empire.\u201d\u201cIf you weren\u2019t at least that smart, I wouldn\u2019t have allowed you to visit.\u201dFor a moment, I couldn\u2019t understand.\u201c\u2026Pardon?\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily narrowed her eyes.\u201cI thought you were smart, but you have a dumb side to you, too.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 do you mean\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in the 14th session.\u201dHer composed voice continued,\u201cBut even so, I\u2019m just a regressor who repeats the last ten days of this life. This is the 13th time I\u2019ve seen an [actor] like you.\u201dThen, I heard a voice.That voice made me speechless.[A silver-plated heart is looking at you.]The Lady of the Silver Lily.\u201cWhat session are you on?\u201dShe was a regressor in this world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97. <Your Heart. (1) >===================Translator: thursdays Editor: Yahiko PR: LightBrin\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen your face,\u201d said the Lady of the Silver Lily.\u201cDid the Constellation send you here without an explanation? That\u2019s rare. Constellations usually try to give an apostle as much information as possible to start with. Do you have a bad relationship with the Constellation?\u201d\u201cAn apostle\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cYou really are clueless. Interesting.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily opened a drawer. She took out a sandglass. It looked just like the sandglass that she had turned over. Ring! The lady lightly pressed a bell on her desk.The door of the office opened.\u201cDid you call, milady?\u201d\u201cTake an extra 15 minutes. The break may last longer, so tell everyone to rest comfortably.\u201d\u201cYou seem to be enjoying the conversation. Shall I bring some tea?\u201d\u201cYes. Jerenisan tea.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dThe gray-haired servant nodded. He lowered his head and left the room.I didn\u2019t know what to say or how to say it, so I stood there awkwardly. The Lady of the Silver Lily raised her brows at me.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Stand comfortably.\u201dShe did not tell me I could sit down comfortably.\u201cWhich Constellation sent you? Mutia? The Triangle Star? Hesimit Creech? Lazarus? Psyme? Hmm. Looking at your face, it looks like you\u2019ve never heard of them. Who do you represent?\u201d\u201cThe Librarian of All Things\u2026\u2026\u201dMy head was befuddled. I did feel that the lady in front of me was not an ordinary person, but I didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be like this. I racked my brain and tried to recall the Librarian\u2019s title.\u201cNo, it was the Corner Librarian who sent me.\u201d [1]\u201cA library.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily twirled her quill with her left hand.\u201cCorner\u2026 Ah, is it Hamustra?\u201dHamustra.A true name.This person knew the true name of a Constellation.\u201cDid Hamustra explain nothing to you?\u201d\u201c\u2026The Librarian tries to avoid involvement in the Apocalypse as much as he can. Rather than giving us information upfront, he wants us to figure things out ourselves.\u201d\u201cApocalypse?\u201d\u201cA world with collapsing barriers because there is no Constellation\u2026 That\u2019s what the Librarian calls a world that is about to end.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily\u2019s eyes became narrow, like she was amused. Her pupils were red, so her gaze still drew attention even when she narrowed her eyes. Her eyes were a color that could overwhelm anyone she looked at.\u201cAs expected of a Constellation, it\u2019s arrogant. Calling others\u2019 world whatever he wants. An Apocalypse? Perhaps\u2026. Hmm. It isn\u2019t wrong that the world will one day perish. But I can\u2019t simply hand over my soul.\u201dI blinked.\u201c\u2026It seems that you still don\u2019t know anything. Did you not possess the butler of the Lady of the Golden Silk to steal my soul?\u201dI shook my head. I had never heard of this before.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily closed her lips. Her eyes began to moisten as if she was seeing a national treasure. Scrape. The lady continued looking at me as she opened the drawer and took something out. It was a third sandglass.Ring.\u201cDid you call for me, milady? I have the tea now.\u201d\u201cRest for another 15 minutes.\u201d\u201cYour employees will be very happy today.\u201dThe servant went out.The Lady of the Silver Lily looked at me over her teacup while sipping tea.\u201cLook here, butler.\u201d\u201cUh, please call me Kim Gongja. That\u2019s my real name.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s impolite. Why are you asking me to call you by your name? Blame yourself for possessing a butler instead of a noble.\u201dThis person had been a little uppity since a while ago, hadn\u2019t she?\u201cIn any case, I understand that your state is like pure white paper. You probably haven\u2019t even received a [strategy guide].\u201dWhat was that supposed to be?\u201cIt\u2019s like this.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily took out a piece of paper from her drawer.Curvy script was written on a paper approximately size A4.+1. The Lady of the Silver Lily is weak in the sunlight. It is better to schedule dates for the evening and night rather than during the day.2. The Lady of the Silver Lily has dull taste buds, so she likes exciting food.3. The Lady of the Silver Lily likes white flowers. However, she receives too many lilies. Keep note of this when choosing a gift.4. The Lady of the Silver Lily is pragmatic. She prefers conversations about politics, diplomacy, and money. Remember that writing love poems will be useless....10. The Lady of the Silver Lily is a loyal subject of the empire. She may speak poorly of the empire or the prince, but she will never tolerate it if anyone else were to do so. Be careful.+I was speechless. This was crazy. What was that?\u201cThis is the strategy guide that the apostle who came to conquer me in the 6th session had. He was an apostle sent by a Constellation called Mahos. He called it the [target route].\u201dMy mouth opened.\u201cT-target route\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI was so shocked that I poisoned him and took it,\u201d the Lady of the Silver Lily said calmly.\u201cAs he died at my hand, he yelled, [I thoroughly followed the strategy, so why can\u2019t I win you over?!] He sounded as if he had been wronged. But I am the one who feels wronged. How could there be a strategy guide for a person\u2019s heart?\u201d[The silver-plated heart is expressing her grievances.]\u201cIt\u2019s looking at people like they\u2019re easy. If someone really wants to win my heart, they need to approach me fair and square. However, a strategy guide or target route? It\u2019s rotten to the core.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you can be sensible.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily put down her teacup.\u201cThere is a reason I appraised you highly. It\u2019s not just that you\u2019re smart. It\u2019s that you still see the people of my world as [human].\u201d\u201cI-is that so? I feel like you\u2019re saying something that should be obvious\u2026.\u201d\u201cThere were numerous brutes who could not even satisfy that obvious condition. Mere beasts that do not regard other people as people. And yet, they believed themselves to be human. Filth.\u201dI held my breath for a moment.The Lady of the Silver Lily touched her chin when she saw me do so.\u201cHmm?\u201dAfter humming, she nodded.\u201cIs that how it is?\u201dThump.\u201cDo these words mean something to you?\u201dThump.\u201cHave you seen many such beasts as well? Or were you once seen as subhuman by such a beast?\u201dThump.\u201cIf not, is this the case? Someone dear to you said something similar\u2014\u201d\u201cMilady.\u201dI had to interrupt her speech.I could no longer stand this feeling of someone splitting open my chest, taking apart my ribs, and staring at my raw heart through a magnifying glass.[The silver-plated heart looks at you.]I had to do something.I opened my mouth.\u201cThough you say such things, did you not consider me dull because I am in the body of a commoner, not a noble?\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily did not even blink.\u201cWhat, are you that sad I haven\u2019t called you by your name?\u201d\u201cIt just seems to me that your ladyship is not in a position to speak down to me.\u201d\u201cI am not acting like I am better. You\u2019re merely a poor butler who caused chaos at the academy.\u201dThe voice of Lady of the Silver Lily sounded a little merry, somehow.\u201cHowever, I admit your point is valid.\u201dThen, the lady coughed as if to bring the conversation back on track.\u201cNow, what is it?\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cI know that you do not want my soul. In that case, why did you cross the boundaries between worlds to come here? This is a world that repeats every ten days, forever.\u201d[The silver-plated heart questions your true intentions.]\u201cIt isn\u2019t that the Constellation hated you so much he exiled you. I heard that Hamustra is rather moderate. But you wouldn\u2019t have come here for a vacation. Answer me, actor who plays the role of the Lady of the Golden Silk\u2019s butler.\u201d\u201cI am\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI will hear no lies. The moment you say anything slightly untrue, I will never give you what you want, whatever your purpose. I will not reveal my heart to anyone who does not show their own first.\u201dI agonized over what to say.\u2018I want to make your world become the 25th floor.\u2019But was this stage really necessary? It wasn\u2019t. The situation in the Tower wouldn\u2019t be troubled if we chose a different stage.\u2018A fragment of my Holy Sword is in this world.\u2019Did I have to collect all of the fragments and complete the Holy Sword? That wasn\u2019t the case, either. Finding Shiny\u2019s sisters will make me stronger as her owner, but in other words, it\u2019ll just make me a little stronger.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe reason I had to stay on this stage right now.\u201c\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t know what love is yet.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDating or romantic feelings, I\u2019m ignorant to all that. Your ladyship may not know this, but the genre of this world is [romance]. I think this is the right place to learn about love.\u201dWhen Master performed her last dance, Bae Hu-ryeong blocked Master\u2019s sword and shouted something.\u300cThis Gongja kid still hasn\u2019t tasted the wonders of the world.\u300d\u300cCult master, did you know? This kid still has never fallen in love! He\u2019s never been in a relationship!\u300dThose words had made a deep impression on me.\u201cIf there is something I lack, I want to learn it. No, I want to know it. Leaving myself ignorant like that? It feels wrong. It\u2019s like I\u2019m buying something that isn\u2019t 100% full.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily examined my expression. Maybe I was just seeing things, but her red eyes looked a little disconcerted.\u201cThat\u2019s why you want to learn love?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWith me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u2026 something I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cExplain.\u201dI organized my thoughts.\u201cTo be precise, it\u2019s more like I want to learn love from this world.\u201d\u201cThe world.\u201d\u201cYes. I want to know what I lack. I want to feel it.\u201d\u201cThen, why did you come to me? You have your lady. Wouldn\u2019t it be faster with the Lady of the Golden Silk?\u201dThe Heretic Questioner.The Lady of the Golden Silk.\u201cI cannot.\u201d\u201cWhy not? Do you hate others who are possessed?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of liking or hating. That person is\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2018If I were like you,\u2019 that person had said.He had said that.\u201cThat person is worse than I am.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cTo learn something, you have to learn from someone who is better than you.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily sipped her tea. For a while, it was silent.\u201cI suppose that this time\u2019s Lady of the Golden Silk is unqualified to teach someone love. Rather, she seems like someone who needs to be taught.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s still no reason to come to me.\u201d\u201cI do have a reason,\u201d I said fervently.The thoughts that I had in the dungeon filled my head.\u201cI want to understand you.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily did not seem to expect those words. A drop of tea splashed onto the front of her dress.She blinked and repeated, \u201cUnderstand me\u2026?\u201d\u201cYes. I don\u2019t know yet whether it\u2019s for the prince or for the empire, but Your Ladyship is loyal and has dedicated your life. I\u2019m curious how you can do that. I want to know what kind of feeling lies in your heart and what you think. If it\u2019s because of love, then I want to feel that feeling, just like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a little embarrassing, even shameful. But this is my honest answer.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily remained silent for a while.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dThis time, I could clearly see it.\u201c\u2026is truly the first time I\u2019ve come across such a case.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily was flustered.\u201cYou want to know love. That comment alone shows you don\u2019t know people. But you want to understand me? Understanding is not a word to be said lightly. It\u2019s a word that leads people to poison. Understanding is no different than taking responsibility. Yet.\u201d\u201cLibrarian-nim.\u201dI raised my head and looked into the blank air. Obviously, the Librarian wasn\u2019t there.However, the Librarian and the top Hunters were no doubt listening to our conversation right at that moment.\u201cPlease stop broadcasting for a moment.\u201dThe air in the office was quiet.\u201cI want to say something to the Lady of the Silver Lily, privately.\u201dAfter a while, a voice responded to my request.[The Librarian gladly accepts your request.][You are allowed \u2018skip the scene\u2019 for 10 minutes.]Okay.I looked again at the Lady of the Silver Lily.\u201cI\u2019m a regressor, too.\u201dI continued, \u201cBut the way my regression works is a little different than yours.\u201d\u201cWhat is the difference?\u201d\u201cYour ladyship said that you repeat the last ten days of this life. I go back a day whenever I die.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t an ordinary regression, either. If someone kills me, I get a glimpse of that person\u2019s trauma.\u201d\u201cTrauma?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMy whispered voice spread through the office.\u201cI can see the scars, memories, and scenes that have affected a person in the deepest parts of their heart. If their wound is about something precious to them being destroyed, I see the memory of it being destroyed.\u201dI didn\u2019t need to choose my words carefully. Just by opening my mouth, by letting my tongue loose, I naturally said what I wanted to say. When I told my secret to the Lady of the Silver Lily, I suddenly realized it.\u201cBecause of that, I can understand others a little more easily.\u201dI.I had wanted to tell someone my story.To someone in the same situation. To someone who lived a life similar to mine.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily was silent. Her eyes became calmer as I continued to speak. I could feel her listening to me seriously.\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of skill. A technique. I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll become used to understanding others easily. One of the people I trust most told me, [Never get too used to a skill]. But\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut.\u201d\u201cIf I alone understand, one-sidedly\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat isn\u2019t true understanding.\u201d\u201cStill, I can\u2019t just let people be.

    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98. Your Heart. (2)====================Translator: thursdays Editor: Yahiko PR: LightBrin1.\u201cBut,\u201d said the Lady of the Silver Lily.\u201cA week from today. Until the end of this world, you have to be my exclusive servant, not the Lady of the Gold Silk\u2019s butler.\u201d\u201cYour ladyship\u2019s exclusive servant\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. I only know my own love; I\u2019ve never taught anyone else to love. There is no other method to teach you other than to directly show you the way I love. So shouldn\u2019t you stay by my side to observe? Watch and learn.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNow that I say it, it feels like I\u2019m incurring a loss. No, I\u2019m definitely losing something. Aren\u2019t I revealing my embarrassing private life? Know that this is the fortune of your life\u2014including your past and future lives. Peasant.\u201dShe truly was a haughty aristocrat.2.The next day, my two-contract life began.My master was not just the Lady of the Gold Silk but also the Lady of the Silver Lily.\u201cHmm. You\u2019ve arrived.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily greeted me in her dressing room.At 5 a.m.The lady was already awake. Four servants surrounded her to dress her up and prepare her for the day. Normally, it was highly discourteous to step into a lady\u2019s dressing room as she was arranging her toilette, but the Lady of the Silver Lily dismissed any concerns by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s annoying. Cut it out.\u201dAs soon as I entered, the lady said, \u201cShow it to him.\u201d\u201cYes, milady.\u201dThe gray-haired servant pulled out a tablet decorated in a floral lily pattern. The sentences on the tablet were written in an impressive cursive script.+LESSON 1. (Fundamentals)Love starts like a bitch.+\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI was thinking last night. What method should I choose to teach you love? I cannot leisurely focus my attention on you, nor can I find someone to be your first love. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201dWhile I was dumbfounded and unable to reply, the Lady of the Silver Lily continued to speak indifferently. Beside her, the servant trimming the nails of the lady\u2019s right hand looked just as apathetic as her master.\u201cThus, I\u2019ve decided to teach you what truths you need to know in advance. Read this. Repeat after me. Love starts like a bitch. \u201c\u201cL-love starts like a bitch\u2026?\u201d\u201cCorrect. It\u2019s a bitch. Well, sometimes it just turns out like that.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily opened her fan with her left hand. Whoosh! The fan spread out, making a clean and crisp sound. The lady covered her mouth with the fan.\u201cSome lovers who find their perfect matches right away exist in this world. Probably. There may be some who love each other and care for each other from the moment they meet to the day they are buried in coffins. But you aren\u2019t one of them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a 99% probability that the lover you meet will be a bitch. Even if she isn\u2019t a bitch now, she will become a bitch some day. Why? It\u2019s simple. It\u2019s nearly impossible for a human being to be perfect forever. Similarly\u2014\u201dSwish.The Lady of the Silver Lily folded her fan and pointed to the gray-haired servant. Then, the servant turned the tablet around like he had been waiting all along. Another sentence was written on the back of the tablet.+LESSON 1. (Advanced)You are also a bitch.+\u201cYou are also highly likely to be a bitch.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut don\u2019t be discouraged. Humans are animals that learn from experience. If one is played by a bitch, one can make sure not to be played by another again. If you act like a bitch to someone, you can learn not to be a bitch the next time. It\u2019s about learning [how to recognize a bitch], [when to act like a bitch], and [how not to act like a bitch].\u201dMy mind was blank.\u201cC-can\u2019t things go well from the beginning?\u201d\u201cButler.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily looked unimpressed.\u201cDon\u2019t expect too much from people.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHumans forget the things they\u2019ve said. They make a decision, but end up giving up on it later. They forget and they quit. The following two words are the basic laws of love. If you truly want to be good at love, you have to learn to do the opposite: [remember] and [persist].\u201d\u201cA-are you also teaching me memorization and persistence?\u201d\u201cHow childish\u2026.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily sighed. What was it? What did I do wrong? I really had no idea.\u201cYou must see it to learn it. I shall demonstrate.\u201dDemonstrate?How?\u201cYou\u2019ve seen it with your own eyes, yet you still don\u2019t know.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily stood up from her seat. The servants who had been sticking to her like kittens drew back at once. Accepting the servants\u2019 escort, the Lady of the Silver Lily proudly stated,\u201cThe person I love is the biggest bitch in the whole world.\u201dUhm.Why was she acting like that was a good thing?\u201cAfter me.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily began to walk, and I followed, as did her servants. The servants, for some unknown reason, were holding containers of water.We arrived at the most luxurious dorm in the academy. It was the place where the crown prince stayed.\u201cL-Lady of the Silver Lily.\u201dThe prince\u2019s attendants greeted us, perturbed. Or perhaps I should say they were depressed? Even though the ducal family was lower than the imperial family, the atmosphere strangely felt like nobody could stand against the Lady of the Silver Lily.\u201cY-you\u2019ve come.\u201d\u201cI have.\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t even bright outside yet\u2026.\u201d\u201cIs His Highness awake? A king\u2019s morning should begin earlier than his people\u2019s.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHe isn\u2019t awake, then. Bring me to him.\u201dThe prince\u2019s attendant trembled.\u201cH-his Highness gave us strict orders\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat was the order? Nevermind. I know what it is. He would have said not to let me inside when I visit. Is that right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026.\u201d\u201cThe Emperor had called me specifically when he sent the nation\u2019s foundation to this school. His Majesty told me that I, as the prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, need to work hard because His Highness can be lazy and self-indulgent. I am following the emperor\u2019s orders in caring for the crown prince. You are a servant of the imperial family. Tell me this: Are you the prince\u2019s servant? Or are you the servant of His Majesty, the Emperor?\u201d\u201cM-milady.\u201d\u201cDo you dare to reject His Majesty\u2019s imperial command because of your position as the prince\u2019s servant? The emperor will be pleased to hear of this.\u201dShe had resolved the situation in just one minute.Not a single one of the imperial family\u2019s servants stopped the Lady of the Silver Lily. The lady crossed the garden, went through the lobby, and finally reached the crown prince\u2019s bedroom.\u201cYour Highness.\u201dShe knocked three times.\u201cAre you awake?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t come in!\u201d\u201cSo you are up. I shall enter, then.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily took out a key and opened the door like it was her own bedroom. Click. The prince\u2019s bedroom opened up and welcomed us, though its owner was shaking in his bed.\u201cHieek?!\u201d\u201cYour Highness, dawn has broken, and yet you remain lying in bed. This is not good. The emperor wakes at 4 o\u2019clock every morning to take care of the state\u2019s affairs. Can the nation\u2019s foundation, who will succeed that great work, afford to be slothful?\u201d\u201cCome here! Is anybody here?! Somebody help\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cClose the door.\u201dThe bedroom door slammed shut. There were no imperial servants left in the bedroom. Only the servants of the Lady of the Silver Lily lined up expressionlessly, and the prince\u2019s shoulder trembled even more.The Lady of the Silver Lily opened her lips.\u201cButler.\u201d\u201cY-yes.\u201d\u201cI shall teach you the second lesson.\u201dThe lady nodded at the gray-haired servant.At her signal, the servant picked up a paper pad that had been prepared in advance.+LESSON 2. (Fundamentals)If you can\u2019t avoid the bitch, enjoy what you can.+\u201cE-enjoy\u2026.?\u201d\u201cYou will also fall in love someday. And your first love will be a bitch. My advice to you is that since that will be the case, you should make the most of it.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily flicked her finger.\u201cAnd there is only one way to make the most of an encounter with a bitch.\u201dThe gray-haired servant skillfully turned the paper over.+LESSON 2. (Advanced)Become a bigger bitch than the otheryour opponent.+Splash!The Lady of the Silver Lily\u2019s servants raised the buckets of water and tossed them over the bed. They had brought the buckets all the way here for this moment. \u201cHeuk?!\u201d The prince, struck by the water, floundered. His ramen-noodle hair was swelling up.\u201c\u2014Being in love with a bitch is like being at war.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily looked at the prince calmly.\u201cIt is better to avoid war whenever possible. Peace is worth more than anything. If the person you love is polite? You are polite in return. What if the person is kind? Then, obviously, you must also be kind. But if the person is inevitably going to be a bitch, keep this in mind.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily took out a fan. It was a different fan than the one before, and surprisingly, words were written on it.+Today\u2019s motto:Don\u2019t be kind to a bitch.+She was crazy.\u201cRepeat after me. Don\u2019t be kind.\u201d\u201cD-don\u2019t be kind.\u201d\u201cHumans are animals that want to look well in front of others. Some humans want to look impressive in front of others, and others want to look knowledgeable. Then, there are the humans who want to appear kind. From what I see, you belong to the last category. Control yourself.\u201dHowever, the lady did not restrain herself. At all.\u201cOpen the door.\u201dThe servants opened the door. In the corridor, the imperial servants stood around restlessly.\u201cWhat are you all doing?\u201d the Lady of the Silver Lily said indifferently. \u201cHis Highness is soaked. Though the spring season is refreshingly cool, I fear that the nation\u2019s foundation will become ill. Hurry and change his clothes.\u201d\u201cY-Your Highness!\u201dThe imperial servants ran inside in a rush. They were all holding towels, as if they knew this would happen. What that told me was that this was not the first time the Lady of the Silver Lily commenced Operation Water Waking.\u201cListen carefully. This is an equation of love.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily slowly went out into the corridor.\u201cHandsome people lose to smart people. Smart people lose to bitches. Therefore, the people at the pinnacle of love are smart, beautiful people with the personality of a dog. Butler, you need to internalize this truth and cultivate yourself with hard work.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026.\u201dWhen I looked back, there was still a lot of commotion in the prince\u2019s bedroom.\u201cThis is a bit different from the love that I imagined. I thought, maybe\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou expected something more romantic?\u201d\u201cYes, and\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou thought love was felt in the heart, not one\u2019s head.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s also correct.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily tossed her fan. Swish. The gray-haired servant skillfully caught the fan and put it in his pocket. We continued talking as we walked to the parlor.\u201cHowever, that is all up to your luck. Having a relationship that makes your heart flutter the first time you see someone is not an easy thing. The life you\u2019ve led determines whom your heart is excited by. Falling in love at first sight is actually because a glance can show what kind of life the other person has lived.\u201d\u201cThat sounds difficult\u2026.\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s difficult.\u201dThe lady\u2019s red eyes narrowed.\u201cShall we test how difficult it is?\u201dA test.\u201cWhat sort of test is it?\u201d\u201cSee if you can cause my heart to pound.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026How should I do that?\u201d\u201cYou only need to do something admirable.\u201dAn admirable act.\u201cWhat would count as something admirable?\u201d\u201cDo I need to tell you that, too? Why don\u2019t you look within yourself? Think for yourself, ponder over it, and answer. Butler. You\u2019re intelligent, so perhaps you will succeed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI will at least inform you whether your answer is correct.\u201dWe arrived at the parlor. This was definitely the residence of the crown prince, but the lady of the duchy walked around comfortably like it was her own home. She dismissed all of the servants except me and sat on a chair.The room had a red carpet.Scarlet pupils of the same color quietly stared at me.Hmm.\u201cWhoo\u2026\u2026\u201dI took a deep breath. The breath passed through my throat and curled up like a solid seed in my lungs. Though I was just breathing, it was evidence of my determination.I took out the cards from my bosom.+[Facial Recognition Barrier Card][What a coincidence! Overhearing crucial secrets! card][Oops! I shouldn\u2019t have said this! I said something wrong! card]+Before I entered the Apocalypse, the Librarian gave me these cards, saying that these cards would be my \u2018army and support.\u2019 I originally planned to use these cards on this stage. The Lady of the Silver Lily tilted her head.\u201c\u2026\u2026? What are those?\u201d\u201cThese are the cards the Corner Librarian gave to me.\u201dAnd then.\u201cTo use Your Ladyship\u2019s words, these are like a [strategy guide].\u201dRiiip!I tore the cards without hesitation.The ripped cards scattered like fine sand until not a trace was left.[The Corner Librarian is surprised by your decision.]Maybe these cards really would have helped me and the Heretic Questioner get past this stage. But it was even more important to show sincerity to the person before me.At least, that was what I believed.[The Corner Librarian realizes your intention and applauds you.]Rewards were just rewards.A shortcut only has meaning when it can be used.There was no reason for me to be obsessed with a reward or set my path on a shortcut without meaning.\u201c\u2026\u2026Oh.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily cupped her chin on her hand and looked at me.\u201cIndeed.\u201dThe red eyes gleamed like they were filled with blood.\u201cThat is admirable.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily lightly beckoned me over.\u201cCome here.\u201dI approached her.\u201cYour chin is too high. Lower your head.\u201dI lowered it.The Lady of the Silver Lily whispered in my ear.\u201cWell done.\u201dShe took out a glass bottle. I didn\u2019t know what it was at first, but I realized the moment the cap popped open. A blue scent. It was a perfume bottle.[1]The Lady of the Silver Lily took off her gloves.She used her pinky finger to skim over the bottle\u2019s opening.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you this now.\u201dShe smoothly reached out her hand toward the back of my neck. She put a dot behind my ear.\u201cI will not be responsible for you.\u201dThe fragrance.It was a strong, flowery scent that made one\u2019s head spin.\u201c\u2014\u2014.\u201dThe smell of white lilies.My head instantly became clouded.\u201cDo you smell it?\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily held my right hand. It took me a moment to realize our fingers were intertwining. Time stuttered because of the scent running rampant in my head.\u201cYes\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo you like it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily\u2019s red eyes turned slant.\u201cI like it as well. It is my favorite scent. It has a sweet aroma.\u201dWhisper. Her voice was climbing along my neck.\u201cIt was not unpleasant when you confessed your secret to me and destroyed it on your own. Continue attending to me. I, too, shall share a secret with you tonight.\u201dMy heart was pounding.[The immersion toward the character is deepened.]This could be a big problem.[Currently, your immersion rate is 15%.]I might end up falling for this person.~~~[1] The word for perfume bottle is the same as the word for homesickness.

Oi, Kim Zombie.There\u2019s this onomatopoeia, [mung], in Korean. It\u2019s the sound that a dog makes as well as the word for when your mind goes blank.Mung.-Mr. Zombie Kim? Mr. Crow-tit Kim? Young Master of the Demonic Cult? Look here, Death King. Can you hear me?I was mung. You couldn\u2019t distinguish between mung and me. I was mung, and mung was I.There was only one scene that occupied my mind.A red carpet. Red eyes. A blue scent. A voice. A touch.-Ah, this creep. You\u2019ve been struck. Struck good and proper. The look in your eyes. It\u2019s the same look as when the Chaegal family\u2019s rogue fell in love with the Ice Palace\u2019s head.What was love\u2026?Confucius says: Love is a lily flower. [1]The Lady of the Silver Lily\u2026-I\u2019m sorry, Zombie. This is all my fault. She\u2019s on a different level than you. Way too different. Because of me, you came to love someone who\u2019s out of your league.When I blankly turned to look at him, Bae Hu-ryeong was picking his nose with his finger. Somehow, it was the worst pose a person could make while apologizing.Ah, wait. This isn\u2019t a person. It\u2019s a ghost\u2026-But honestly, it\u2019s really funny. Do more.I blankly muttered in my mind.\u2018Suicide\u2026\u2019-Huh?\u2018If I commit suicide, I can experience the same thing again, right\u2026?\u2019-You crazy bastard\u2026 Still, at least you\u2019re aware enough not to talk about suicide regression out in the open. That\u2019s a relief. All this is being broadcasted in the Tower\u2026\u201cSuicide\u2026\u201d-Your awareness is flying away! This crazy bastard! Hey! Shiny![Shiny jumps up and strikes the warrior\u2019s head.]\u201cAaaack!\u201dI held my head in my hands and rolled around on the grass in the garden.\u201cI know I\u2019m not in my right mind! But what can I do when I can\u2019t stop thinking of Her Ladyship\u2019s face?!\u201d-You call her Her Ladyship even when she\u2019s not around? You\u2019re getting one step ahead of yourself\u2026\u201cOh, I shouldn\u2019t wash my face today. Even if I wash my face, I won\u2019t wash behind my ears. Does it still smell like lilies? Can you smell the back of my ear for me?\u201d-Two steps\u2026\u201cHow many times did that ramen-headed prince save the world in his previous life to receive Her Ladyship\u2019s love? Oh, damn it. Internet. I need the internet. The internet and computers.

An addiction I cannot deny! Ah, my heart!\u201d-I knew it. I knew that this kid would flip out of the universe when he found love. I knew it, but I advised him anyway. I\u2019m a horrible person.\u201cI\u2019m not the only one feeling this!\u201d[The immersion toward the character is deepened.][Currently, your immersion rate is 21%.]\u201cLook! This body keeps getting more immersed with the butler. This means he has the same feelings, and what feelings would those be? The butler has also fallen in love with the Lady of the Silver Lily!\u201d-Uh. Didn\u2019t that butler love the gold silk or iron ax lady?\u201cHa. You don\u2019t know anything. Does love have to bloom for only one person? Love doesn\u2019t work like that. Love\u2014well, love is love. Love is like\u2026 love.\u201d-Wow. It\u2019s been less than half a day since you had your first love, and wow\u2026I stretched out on the lawn. It was midday. Classes were happening at the academy. The Heretic Questioner, the crown prince, and the Lady of the Silver Lily were at their lessons.\u201cHow can I get the Lady of the Silver Lily? No, what am I saying? I\u2019ve no right to say something like that. Just\u2026 How can I make the lady happy?\u201d-Since I released your madness onto the world, I\u2019ll take some responsibility and give you advice.Bae Hu-ryeong harrumphed.-This isn\u2019t the time to think about that sort of thing, you baby.\u201cThen what am I supposed to think about, old man?\u201d-You need to know about the other person more.\u201cI know her.\u201d-Well, when you\u2019re in a relationship, you have to be very aware of your partner. That\u2019s how to be a man. But right now, you\u2019re her exclusive servant. Even if you don\u2019t do anything, you will have more time to be with her. You have the advantage of location.\u201cThe advantage of location\u2026\u201d-Yes. So, feel free to observe the other person a little more.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d-But?\u201cIt\u2019s not going to last much longer. This world, that is.\u201d-Hmm.Bae Hu-ryeong crossed his arms.-That is a big problem.Bae Hu-ryeong spoke vaguely. It was as if the \u2018problem\u2019 I was talking about was different than the one he perceived.However, a bell rang, announcing that class was over, and I couldn\u2019t ask Bae Hu-ryeong why his tone was like that.The truth of the problem was revealed that very night.4.It was a dark night with the clouds swallowing the moon.The candles in the dormitory were struggling to lift up the darkness, but it was clear that they were insufficient. Sormwyn Academy was sinking into blackness.\u201cYou can think of it as your reward for showing me something special.\u201dIn this darkness, the Lady of the Silver Lily led the way with her lantern.I followed after her, being careful not to step on her shadow.\u201cFor that, I will tell you my secret.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily was wearing her nightdress. The white dress was loose over her form. My heart jumped every time the hem of her dress fluttered. Was this because I\u2019d gone nuts, like Bae Hu-ryeong said? But wasn\u2019t this feeling too tender to say it was nuts?\u201cFollow me.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily walked forward. At night, nobody was in the hallway. As I followed her, I stared openly at her fingers, lit up by the lantern\u2019s light.\u201cWhat are you thinking right now?\u201d the Lady of the Silver Lily asked suddenly.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI asked what you\u2019re thinking about. I can feel your gaze. I\u2019m curious.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAlthough it is only temporary, you are my servant. Is it not disloyal to refuse to answer your master\u2019s question? I said I\u2019m curious, so you have to answer.\u201dI hesitated.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201c\u2026I was thinking that I wanted to hold your hand.\u201dWhen I spoke, rather than my tongue moving, my heart seemed to leap out of my mouth. I was embarrassed.I hadn\u2019t been so embarrassed even when Shiny was singing my praises. Really. My face was so hot I thought I was going to die.\u201cHmm.\u201dJust then, something closed around my left hand.It was the Lady of the Silver Lily\u2019s hand.Her skin. Her touch. The cool temperature. The moment her dry fingers wrapped around mine, I almost mistook them to be gripping around my heart. A flower scent thickened inside my head.Even though we were just holding hands.\u201cY-your Ladyship.\u201d\u201cHave you been thinking of me all day long?\u201dMy tongue crisped up inside my mouth.\u201cDid you miss my touch and fragrance? Did you fantasize about me?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cAnswer. If you\u2019re not honest, I\u2019ll let go.\u201d\u201cI-I thought about you.\u201d\u201cProperly.\u201dMy head was spinning.\u201cToday, all day, I only thought about you, milady.\u201dThe fragrance of flowers turned into a voice and whispered in my ears.\u201cWell said. You are my faithful servant.\u201d[The immersion toward the character is deepened.][Currently, your immersion rate is 29%.]Now.I no longer knew up from down.I just didn\u2019t know.\u201cY-you shouldn\u2019t do this.\u201d\u201cWhat shouldn\u2019t I do?\u201dThink.Let\u2019s think.\u201cI-I\u2019m from beyond this world\u2026 borrowing the body of a butler.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d[The silver-plated heart is looking at you.]\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you saw me as \u2018human\u2019?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you lie?\u201d[The silver-plated heart is looking at you.]\u201cIn the end, do you, just like the other apostles, consider me just a \u2018native\u2019 or an \u2018inhabitant\u2019? Or, using the terms of Hamustra, the one who brought you here, do you consider me a \u2018character\u2019?\u201d[The silver-plated heart, to you\u2014]\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201dI could barely speak.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 No, I am. That is, my original master is the Lady of the Golden Silk.\u201d [3][The immersion toward the character is deepened.][Currently, your immersion rate is 30%.]\u201cI am only attending to Your Ladyship just briefly, so\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying something strange again.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily looked at me.\u201cYou said you only thought about me today. In other words, didn\u2019t you have no thoughts of the Lady of the Golden Silk?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cWas it a lie?\u201d[The silver-plated heart\u2014]\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t a lie. I am\u2014\u201dMy head.My breath.\u201cIf so, then isn\u2019t your master already me, not her?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cCall me master.\u201dHer hand held mine a little tighter.\u201cJust once is enough. Call me, with all your sincerity.\u201d\u201cAnd, if you call me \u2018Master,\u2019 I\u2019ll give you a prize.\u201dA prize.\u201cI promise you a delectable reward.\u201dWhy was it that the moment I heard her words, my heart was filled with honey?Without realizing it, I had opened my mouth, but someone called out to me before I could say anything.-Gongja.A low voice.[Shiny is shaking to bring back the warrior\u2019s senses.]A Constellation\u2019s warning.The reaction of these two, this languid addiction I felt, all made me feel some d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.It was the same sensation I felt in the basement, when the Lady of the Silver Lily interrogated her servants.This intuition that it was dangerous.\u201cHmm?\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily looked at me. Her red eyes, her expressionless face, placidly looked at me.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dWhisper.\u201cDon\u2019t you need the prize?\u201dThe prize.\u201cYou just need to say it once.\u201dJust one time\u2026If it was just once, wouldn\u2019t it be all right? To test it out?I did feel the danger, but if something went wrong, I had the power to turn back time. That\u2019s right\u2026 I have that sort of power. So it wasn\u2019t wrong to say that I also had the power to take risks. If you thought about it, this might have been the right thing to do. Wasn\u2019t it important to know what would happen if that word came from my mouth? Wasn\u2019t this somewhat similar to when there was the traitor among the Rankers when we first dealt with the Devil King of Fall Rain?So, wouldn\u2019t it be okay? Saying just one word. If things went wrong, I just had to turn back time. It would end just like that since I had that ability.Then, just once, at least once, I could\u2026\u300cBut you know that I\u2019m the Flame Emperor.\u300d\u300cThat\u2019s why you have to die for me.\u300dThe back of my neck turned cold.\u300cDeath King-nim.\u300d\u300cI still believe in you.\u300dMy fingertips froze.\u300cMilord.\u300dMy head, it\u2014\u300cYou are my disciple.\u300dReturned to its senses.The sight before me cleared up. My resolve steeled. My thoughts returned to me quickly, as if trying to reinforce against what had nearly happened.Was I a person to obey someone easily?Was the weight on my shoulder that light?No.I am Preta\u2019s lord.And the Young Master of the Demonic Sect.I have lived so I would not become like Yoo Sooha.Thus, I ran away with the Alchemist in the snowfield, so I would not take a single death for granted.\u201c\u2026I apologize, milady.\u201dI put my palm on the back of the Lady of the Silver Lily\u2019s hand. Though it was only a word.Because it was only a word.\u201cWhy are you apologizing?\u201d\u201cI cannot recognize you as my true master.\u201dI wanted to learn the joy of love. I was learning it. But even then, I didn\u2019t want to learn to the extent that I lost myself. At least, not for a one-sided relationship.\u201cIf you really want to win my heart, milady will have to use a different method.\u201d\u201cSay it. I\u2019ll listen.\u201d\u201cI will serve you as my master, so please make me your master.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI will value your judgment over mine. I will weigh your advice heavier than my principles. I will not value myself the most. I will follow you. But in return.\u201dI looked at the lady\u2019s face. With our hands clasped together, the distance between us was very short. Her red eyes. I knew them to be the same color as her heart.\u201cPlease treat me the same way.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you do something wrong, I\u2019ll tell you that it was wrong. What I really think, what I see, what I feel. I\u2019ll confess everything to you without a single lie. However, it cannot be one-sided. If I give you my heart, how shall I breathe? I\u2019ll end up choking and dying. Only if you give me your heart will I be able to live.\u201dI gripped the Lady of the Silver Lily\u2019s hand a little more strongly.\u201cIf you want to see me go mad, please go mad with me.\u201dThen, the Lady of the Silver Lily shook off my hand. She took two steps back like someone who was dealt an unexpected blow.\u201c\u2026Indeed.\u201dHowever, her poker face had not yet collapsed.\u201cYou\u2019re different from the other half-baked apostles. I thought you were a docile child\u2026 But being unfamiliar with love does not mean you are unfamiliar to life. I was in too much of a hurry.\u201d\u201cYou tried to tempt me to become your subordinate, right?\u201d\u201cIt was my mistake. I thought you were easy.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily bit her lips for a moment. Even her face was beautiful and terrifying. In the hallway at night, the white moonlight that shined on her became a shadow.\u201cYes, I\u2019m not an easy man to win.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a shame. It would have been comfortable if you dedicated everything to me.\u201d\u201cYou said that understanding is no different than taking responsibility. One-sided responsibility is only one-sided understanding. I didn\u2019t come to Your Ladyship because I wanted something like that.\u201dMy heart was pounding, but I endured it.\u201cSo, what is the secret you planned to tell me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily turned around and began to walk.\u201c\u2026There is a heirloom in my family that has been passed down from long ago. It is a sword with a laughable legend attached to it. If you make a wish, the sword will surely make it come true.\u201dAt the end of the hallway.Curtains were placed where even the moonlight could not reach. The curtains were thick and red, and they seemed to be covering something.\u201cHowever, there are conditions.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily grabbed the tail of the curtain. With a whoosh, the curtains were pulled aside. Beyond the veil, there was a full-length mirror that looked like it belonged in a dressing room.And.\u201cWhen you make your wish, you must stab your heart with the sword.\u201dA sword was embedded in the center of the mirror.The Lady of the Silver Lily stood before the mirror.Coincidentally, the heart of the lady was reflected over where the blade was stuck.[Shiny detects the presence of her sister.]The Holy Sword by my waist trembled.[Shiny says that this is the Guardian Sword\u2019s third sister.]Drip. Drip.Blood came out of the mirror from the sword, drop by drop. The curtains that had been hiding the mirror weren\u2019t originally red. It was the blood from the heart of the mirror that had stained them so.[It is the Sword of Prayer.]\u201cBack when I was not yet a regressor, His Majesty the Prince became infatuated with the Lady of the Golden Silk. I was resentful, and I made a wish to my family\u2019s sword.\u201d\u201cWhat was your wish\u2026?\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily\u2019s lips moved.-Please let my love last forever.\u201cThen, my life became eternal.\u201d\u201cEven if I die, I do not die. My feelings for His Majesty also remain unchanged. My heart has become immovable since that day.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily took my hand.She grabbed my hand and led it to her chest.Where her heart was. Where it should have been.\u201cDid you say you wanted my heart?\u201dBut.I couldn\u2019t feel a heartbeat there.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said the Lady of the Silver Lily. \u201cI have no heart to give you.\u201d[The silver-plated heart is looking at you.]And the blood flowing from the mirror gathered and began to form a small shape.The size was different, but it was definitely the thing that killed the Crusader and the Count last time.It was the shape of a demon.I didn\u2019t know why the blood from the mirror made that shape, whether it had been summoned or created.\u201cNow.\u201dHowever, the Lady of the Silver Lily raised the sword like she was used to it.\u201cHelp me.\u201dThe sword was pointed at the little demon.\u201cIt\u2019s time to take care of today\u2019s tasks.\u201d~~~[1]: Might be a good time to remember that Gongja\u2019s name = Confucius in Korean.[2]: \ubc1c is foot (or step, in this case), and \uc528\ubc1c = fuck[3]: Here, Gongja switches from a more casual \u201cI\u201d to a more formal/respectful \u201cI.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100. < Drama. (1) >=================Translator: thursdays Editor: Yahiko PR: LightBrin1.Blood from the mirror covered its surroundings.At first, it was only a drop or two. Then, the drops of blood continued to fall, turning into an endless faucet.However, clang\u2026 clang\u2026 The moment a faraway grandfather clock rang, the drops of blood changed. Blood gushed uncontrollably from the gap in the mirror.Clang\u2026Twelve o\u2019clock. A dozen strikes of the bell.A single drop swelled into a single column.One column split into six.The corridor was covered in blood.It was a sea of red blood.The grandfather clock rang its last.We were standing on a carpet of blood.\u201cMilady.\u201dI instinctively wrapped myself around the shoulders of the Lady of the Silver Lily. The pool of blood swarmed all the way up to our ankles. The slimey, moist texture felt foreboding.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my nightmare.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily whispered in my embrace.\u201cKeep your guard up, butler. This place is no different from another world. Other people cannot know or see what happens here.\u201dSuddenly, the sea of blood began to bubble.Thousands of bubbles rose up, and thousands of bubbles popped.But among them, there were a few that stayed intact instead of disappearing as the other bubbles did.[The silver-plated heart is manifesting.]They were demons shaped like lips. No, they were just lips. There was no face or body, only the red lips and red tongue.The thing grinned.-His Highness.-Loathe him.The blood bubble lips continuously rose up and burst. The words they muttered were rarely connected. The words were incoherent. Like a chorus in terrible disharmony.-The kind crown prince.-Before he was the crown prince, the prince picked a flower for me.-You wiped my tears with your sleeves. You were still a nice person.-The heart was soft. That\u2019s why.-But\u2026Stab!The Lady of the Silver Lily pierced the blood bubble lips with her rapier. The demon popped. However, twice or thrice as many tongues arose from the sea of blood in its place.The demons\u2019 cackles were red.-Love him.I also swung my sword.-What\u2019s the point of loving someone who was born distinguished?The demons\u2019 fighting power was trifling. They didn\u2019t even fight back. They only accepted the strikes.But.-Though he\u2019s an unattractive person.-True love is embracing and guiding a foolish man.They were unnerving.It wasn\u2019t a physical attack but a mental one.-I love you. Your Highness.-I also know how to love.-I am a loving noblewoman.I bit my lips. It was unpleasant. I attacked faster to slice through the bubbles.-Are you going to kill me?-It\u2019s no use. The tragedy becomes sweeter the more you trample over it.-Lady of the Golden Silk. She\u2019s flirting with His Highness?-Disgusting.The sea of blood surged with laughter.-She\u2019s so naive, dreaming of romance. His Highness doesn\u2019t love the Lady of the Golden Silk. She\u2019s just a way to escape from his imperial duties.-Poor prince.-Pitiful prince.Damn.I had seen a phenomenon like this before.\u2018The Devil King of Fall Rain!\u2019Before I reaped her and gave her the name Preta, the Constellation was like this. The Devil King shed blood from the sky and freely used an army of monsters.This was the strength of a Constellation.Those demons were the familiars of the Lady of the Silver Lily.[The presence of the silver-plated heart becomes more prominent.]Something other than lips came from the sea of blood.They were hands.Like a bride and groom at a wedding, two hands were intertwined.-Raviel. Your family and the imperial family have set up an engagement between us.-An engagement, is it?-Yes. But I don\u2019t want a political marriage.The demons\u2019 hands clasped together.Blood dripped endlessly from the hands of blood.It came to my attention that the demons were reenacting [what happened in the past] like a play.-We can ignore the engagement uncaringly decided by the adults. Regardless of them, I will love you. I came here today to formally propose to you.-Prince.-Raviel. When we grow older, will you marry me?Dozens of lips surrounded the hands.In unison, they answered.-Yes.-I\u2019ll love you surely.-I\u2019ll love you too, my prince.That son of a bitch.He said something like that and still wasn\u2019t taking responsibility?-His Highness most likely forgot.-It was a promise made as children.-It can\u2019t be helped.-People have poor memories.The blood bubble lips cackled.-It can\u2019t be helped!I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.I was engulfed in rage.Splash! I took a step forward, focusing aura on my front foot.Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.Eighth form.Sword of Incineration.As the waves of blood spread, so did my aura.The sea of blood that covered the corridor burned.-Ooh.Behind me, Bae Hu-ryeong spoke.-Now, you can take on these mobs with a single blow. You\u2019ve grown a lot, crow-tit.Normally, I\u2019d have played along to Bae Hu-ryeong\u2019s taunts. But right now, I wasn\u2019t in the mood. I cleared the corridor. The demons were swallowed in the inferno. The demons did not even scream as they disappeared. Rather, the way they laughed till the end pissed me off.\u201cShit.\u201dI burned the demons with a blow, but I was still seething inside.Anger toward the crown prince. Contempt.The fact that an honorable person like the Lady of the Silver Lily was hurt because of such a man, that she had made an irreversible wish. These things made me mad.\u201cSince when\u2026?!\u201dI took a breath to temper my voice. No matter how angry I was, I didn\u2019t want to raise my voice to the Lady of the Silver Lily.\u201c\u2026When did you become a Constellation? These things are the familiars of a Constellation. You made them.\u201dThat was why they did not resist; they recognized us as allies.The Lady of the Silver Lily nodded. She knew.\u201cIt happened the moment I stabbed my heart.\u201dUnnoticed, the blood began to return to the mirror. Writhing. Slinking. The columns of blood crawled back through the crack in the mirror.Regressing. The Lady of the Silver Lily watched calmly as the drops of blood inched away like leeches.\u201cIt seems there is no original Constellation in this world. I don\u2019t know if there was one and they were killed or if they never existed from the start.\u201dLefanta Aegim probably killed the Constellation. But this wasn\u2019t the time to talk about that. I carefully listened to the lady\u2019s words.\u201cAs time passes, the demons become more powerful. Their numbers grow, and their sizes increase. It becomes hard to control them as I do now. And on the tenth day\u2014\u201dOn the tenth day.There, the Lady of the Silver Lily paused. She shook her head once and rephrased.\u201c\u2026At any rate, as the ten days began to loop, I became [this world\u2019s representative]. Though it\u2019s not what I wished, the world\u2019s time revolves around me.\u201d-Hmm.Bae Hu-ryeong clasped his chin.-It\u2019s not a typical ascension. In Murim terms, it isn\u2019t a righteous path but an evil path. Though the sword in the mirror is only a fragment, it was once a part of the [Guardian Goddess].Bae Hu-ryeong shrugged and muttered.-If you embed it in your heart, you\u2019ll ascend to a Constellation even if you don\u2019t want to\u2026 Combined with the repeated regression, it isn\u2019t something a human body can handle. Though, she isn\u2019t a complete Constellation but a knockoff. Anyway, it was the result of many coincidences.\u2018Can someone become a Constellation even if they don\u2019t want to?\u2019-Yup. Zombie, were you born human because you wanted to be?Seriously, even if you try to talk to him, he\u2019s like this.-The important part is the conditions. Not will. There are many people who suffer because they are human, but those who suffer because they became Constellations are also surprisingly common. It\u2019s easy for one\u2019s life to become miserable. Understand, Young Master of the Demonic Sect?I exhaled.My anger toward the prince fermented in my heart. That anger left a bitter taste in my mouth.The Lady of the Silver Lily looked at me.\u201cHow unusual. Aren\u2019t you disappointed?\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cYour words are correct. Whatever the circumstances, those demons are my familiars. They aren\u2019t making up the verses. The things they said were all things I whispered in my dreams, even if it was unconsciously.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily tilted her head.\u201cI pledged a love that would never change. In order to keep that love pure, I have to remove the dust and flaws that settle in my love everyday.\u201dDisappointment.Frustration.The feeling of wanting to receive as much as one gives.\u201cThis is the result.\u201dAn oil stain on a heart.The very epitome of a curse.\u201cIsn\u2019t it ugly?\u201d muttered the Lady of the Silver Lily. \u201cI have shown you what love is. But I didn\u2019t only show you. I tried to harvest your love, too. I brought you here to awaken you from this fantasy.\u201d\u201cDisappointed?\u201dWithout my knowledge, a breath spilled from my lips. It wasn\u2019t a sigh. It was a breath barely containing anger.\u201cIt\u2019s ugly? I don\u2019t know much, but milady, I will never be disappointed in you about something like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026Like this?\u201d\u201cYou told me a secret. You took your heart and revealed it to me as it is. A person who is really detestable, milady, is someone who never shows their heart to others. Pretending to be laid-back. Pretending to be composed. Knowing only how to hurt people.\u201dThat bastard Flame Emperor.\u201cRather, I\u2019m worse. If Your Ladyship knew what kind of thoughts I have, you would abhor me.\u201d\u201cThat makes me curious.\u201d\u201cIf you brought me here to make me give up, you were wrong, milady. I didn\u2019t fall in love with you because your heart isn\u2019t ugly.\u201dThe Lady of the Silver Lily paused very briefly. Love. It was because of this word. My face became hot when I said it out loud, but I didn\u2019t think to hesitate.\u201cIt\u2019s only been one day since you came to love me. My teaching is brilliant.\u201d\u201cDoes it matter that it\u2019s only been a day? Would it have been better if I loved you for a year? A thousand days? Do you want me to return after that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI can see what kind of people you despise. And what you despise is the same as what I hate. I can see what scars you wear and how you are hurt. I love the way you live. Because, you and I, we live the same life.\u201dWill she hear me? Would she understand what I mean?That wasn\u2019t something I could know.I had never said something like this to anyone else. I wasn\u2019t used to it. But I wanted to keep the person in front of me. And I wanted the Lady of the Silver Lily to keep me. I wanted us to share one life and have each other.\u201cI love you as much as I love myself. I wish you could love me as much as I love you.\u201dThese were my true feelings.And the only method I knew was to exclaim it with all my heart.\u201cI will definitely make you love me. I won\u2019t tell you to abandon the crown prince. Even if I don\u2019t ask you to, you will abandon him one day.\u201d\u201cMy heart is\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. But it doesn\u2019t matter if your heart is held hostage by the world. If that\u2019s the problem, I\u2019ll free you. But if you still love the crown prince, then I\u2019ll become an even better person than he is and stay by your side.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDid the crown prince give you unforgettable memories when you were children? That doesn\u2019t matter, either.\u201dI whispered in the Lady of the Silver Lily\u2019s ear.\u201cThe two of us are regressors. The only two in the world.\u201dI knew that my face was red. But I said what I had to say.\u201cThere will be a lot of times that only you and I can enjoy. During those times, I\u2019ll give you such breathtaking memories that they will make your memory of the prince fade away. I\u2019ll try my best.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dThe tips of the Lady of the Silver Lily\u2019s eyes rose up.\u201cCan you repeat these last ten days indefinitely? You\u2019ll become tired of it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s no issue. This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve repeated the same days over and over again.\u201d\u201cWhat if I tell you to get out of my sight because I become tired of you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll disappear, but\u2014\u201dI moved my hand. I moved it, and I grabbed the Lady of the Silver Lily\u2019s fingertips. She had let go of her lantern while fighting the demons. It was something that took courage. A lot of it. Fortunately, I had enough.\u201cTo start with, that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\u201cWhy is that?\u201d\u201cBecause you haven\u2019t grown tired of the crown prince\u2026 and I am a better person than he is. If I make you uncomfortable, please tell me now. I\u2019ll disappear.\u201dSilence.The Lady of the Silver Lily looked at my face.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re insufferable.\u201dThe lady\u2019s lips parted.\u201cI should be bothered, but right now, I don\u2019t feel that way. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be easily bothered, either.\u201dIt was then.\u201c\u2026ler\u2026!\u201dFrom far down the corridor, there was a voice. It sounded urgent.
