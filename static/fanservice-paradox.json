After he was done recording the program, Fang Juexia sat in his manager\u2019s car to go back to his dormitory. He looked out of the window in a daze. The concrete forest covered in snow was incredibly quiet, so obedient that it was like a blanket had finally been laid over a stiff body waiting for peace.The recording had gone on for far too long. The indoor competitive games had sapped Fang Juexia of all his energy. He wasn\u2019t good at socialising with others, yet he always has to submit because of the exposure it affords.\u201cJuexia, are you tired? How long did the recording go for this time, damn it\u2026\u201d Manager Cheng Qiang sneaked a glance at the rearview mirror; within the mirror, Fang Juexia was covered in an oversized, fluffy black down. His pale face was about to sink into the darkness, as if he was just a beautiful phantom who was sealed up in the mirror.Fang Juexia had his head turned to one side, and the light red birthmark at the corner of his left eye could be seen through the strands of hair on his forehead. He caught a glimpse of the faded maple leaves buried by the snow outside the window. Late autumn had fled in a hurry, leaving them behind, forgotten, and now they were a mere touch of red amidst the blanket of ice and snow.Or perhaps, he was mistaken.\u201cEight hours and forty-two minutes,\u201d he replied with exact numbers. His voice was very soft. Then, he answered the first question, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m not tired.\u201d\u201cGet more sleep before the next recording. Don\u2019t go to the practice room.\u201d When Cheng Qiang turned the steering wheel, he changed the subject, \u201cBut you barely spoke towards the end, that won\u2019t do. The TV station didn\u2019t give you much screen time in the first place. If you don\u2019t speak, they would just cut you out entirely. You\u2019re someone who can attract a whole wave of fans with just your face, you know? As long as the camera focuses on you, you\u2019ll win.\u201dFang Juexia knew that Cheng Qiang had good intentions, so he forced out a smile and said in a gentle tone, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll definitely take note next time.\u201dUpon hearing that, Cheng Qiang couldn\u2019t say anything more. Fang Juexia is a member of the six-man boy band, Kaleido, and he could be considered a treasure that their company had picked up by chance. After all, he was once a trainee in Astar, the top entertainment agency in China. He had a fan support group even before his debut. Rumour has it that he would debut as the Center in the company\u2019s new boy band. But an unforeseen event occurred; Fang Juexia actually left his original company before the band was formed and joined Star Chart. After two years of being a trainee, he debuted as the face of the group, main dancer, and lead vocal of the boy band Kaleido. He was the key figure of the group.At the beginning of his debut, there was quite a stir as well. Fang Juexia\u2019s popularity from being the best trainee in the beginning hadn\u2019t waned, and there were also loyal fans who had always been waiting for him. When he first took charge of this band, Cheng Qiang was full of enthusiasm and expectations. After all, these children had both good looks and talent. But even he didn\u2019t expect the series of events that occurred afterwards.Coming to a premature end doesn\u2019t feel good at all.He suddenly recalled something. \u201cOh, right, you were supposed to take photos for the inside pages of a magazine tomorrow\u2026\u201d As soon as he thought about it, Cheng Qiang almost flared up, but he didn\u2019t want to affect Fang Juexia\u2019s mood so he informed him in a tone that could be considered relaxed, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go anymore, they have other arrangements on their side.Fang Juexia actually knew about that in the afternoon. During his break, he heard his assistant, Xiao Wen, on the phone, while cursing about \u201cintercepting\u201d, and 'so what if they\u2019re one of the FBM (Five Big Magazines: Vogue, Bazaar, ELLE, Cosmo and Jiaren), do they think they\u2019re all that just because they have a ton of readers\u201d. He looked quite indignant then. Later on, after asking about it, he found out that the inside page shooting and interview that had been finalised earlier was intercepted by a male actor who had recently become popular due to a hit web drama. Losing a job opportunity should have been quite discouraging, yet Fang Juexia felt relieved instead.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, there\u2019ll be more chances in the future. That magazine can be considered to owe us one now,\u201d Cheng Qiang comforted. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty good now. Since you don\u2019t have work tomorrow morning, you can sleep in and eat something good. You\u2019ve become skinnier recently. Oh right, when you go back, tell Ling Yi that if he orders takeaway in the middle of the night again I\u2019m going to force him to go on a diet. He doesn\u2019t have the self-awareness of being an idol at all, his cheeks are just full of fat when you pinch them. Is he trying to become a comedian\u2026\u201dAs he listened to his manager nag, Fang Juexia\u2019s phone suddenly started vibrating. He took his phone out and glanced at it \u2013 the words \u201cAssistant Director Yang\u201d were flashing on the screen. Two seconds later, he pressed the side button to turn the display screen off, acting as if he didn\u2019t see it.But within a minute, his phone started vibrating again. It was a text message this time.[Why didn\u2019t you pick up?][Did you think over what we talked about last time?][Call me back, hurry!][Don\u2019t worry, you can be certain I won\u2019t treat you unfairly.]The text messages flowed out one by one, like snakes constantly scuttling out of holes in the dark.His fingers were frozen from the cold, so he typed slowly.[I\u2019ve already refused your offer the last time.]Within two seconds, his phone rang again, so Fang Juexia had to pick it up. The middle-aged man on the other end started raging, \u201cI\u2019ll give you one more chance. You have nothing to lose from this! If you want to continue participating in the program, then you better start behaving.\u201d\u201cI apologise.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s calmness seemed out of place at the moment. Seeing that something seemed off, Cheng Qiang glanced at him again. \u201cWho is it?\u201dAfter half a month of offering carrots and sticks, Assistant Director Yang has lost all patience. All kinds of unpleasant words started spewing from his mouth, \u201cDo you know how many people who can\u2019t get famous would stick close to my ass? Do you think you\u2019re some clean toy?\u201dHere we go again.\u201cLaozi is letting you follow me because I think highly of you, I think highly of your\u00a0face. You think I\u2019d cling onto you?\u00a0Pei, you\u2019re just a slut yet you dare set up a chastity gate, you don\u2019t need to come to the recording anymore! Pack your bags and scram! Seriously, I fucking gave you face and you have the nerve to not take it!\u201dFang Juexia listened to his scolding in silence. When the other side hung up in exasperation, he finally felt relieved.\u201cWhat is it? Who was that?\u201d\u201cAssistant Director Yang.\u201d Fang Juexia announced the outcome as if it was nothing major, \u201cHe asked me to get off the program.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Cheng Qiang stopped the car at once and turned around. \u201cNo wait, what, what happened?\u201dFang Juexia licked his dry lips and simplified the whole process down to its barest essentials. \u201cHe has always wanted me to follow him, I didn\u2019t agree, so he wants to kick me away.\u201dHe had said those words very nonchalantly, yet Cheng Qiang\u2019s expression changed and he didn\u2019t know what to say for a while.\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny, we had signed for six episodes in the beginning. You\u2019ve only gone for three recordings! This is a breach of contract\u2026\u201dFang Juexia said in a flat tone, \u201cIt isn\u2019t the first time for them to do something like this. There\u2019s no point in discussing contracts with hoodlums.\u201dThat was true. Cheng Qiang rolled down the window and lit up a cigarette. A cold gust of wind poured in all of a sudden, beating painfully against their faces. \u201cBy then, they may just throw the blame to you to make you look bad, no they\u2019ll definitely do that, they\u2019d have to come up with a reason for kicking you off the show all of a sudden\u2026this won\u2019t do, I have to contact the TV station. We can\u2019t just let him mess around like that.\u201dHearing this, Fang Juexia\u2019s indifference thawed. He sometimes wished that he wasn\u2019t a member of a band, so that he would be able to assume responsibility for everything without dragging anyone else down.\u201cI\u2019ll have to trouble you all, Qiang Ge.\u201d At last he sighed, breaking the calm front he possessed as if he was an outsider.Cheng Qiang\u2019s hands gripped the steering wheel as he muttered some vague curses. His brows furrowed, then smoothed out. With swift movements, he put out his unfinished smoke, rolled up the windows, and started the car again. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it isn\u2019t the first time this damn program\u2019s messing with us. Nothing happened the last time too.\u201dLast time\u2026A tall figure walked by on the road. Fang Juexia, who was in a daze, mistook that person for someone else. He raised his hand to wipe away the condensation on the windows. That person turned around as well, but it wasn\u2019t the person he was thinking about, so he calmed down.Of course nothing would happen, who would dare provoke a powerful little devil?After a while passed, Cheng Qiang heard the word 'sorry\u201d uttered at the back. This made him feel even more helpless. Beyond the windshield, the night scene of the city continued flying backwards, and the circle of light cast by the street lamps broadened their field of view. Suddenly, the scene of Fang Juexia coming to the company for the first time popped up in front of his eyes. At that time, he was stopped by a female colleague for some gossip, saying that a super amazing trainee had just arrived at their company who looked insanely handsome.He wanted to know how exaggerated the \u2018insane\u2019 part was, so he dropped whatever work he had and ran over to have a look.He really was especially good-looking,\u00a0extremely\u00a0good-looking. He was so good-looking that his scout was put on the company\u2019s annual commendation list by default.At that time, Fang Juexia was only 18 years old, dressed in a black hooded sweater. He had even thought that the sweater, which had no sense of design, looked good because he was wearing it. The young man\u2019s bare face felt transparent somehow, and the spot at the corner of his left eye close to his temple had a tiny, thin light red birthmark that looked very unique.In this circle, the supply of pretty faces has always exceeded demand. They were refined and approachable, attracting you as they roused your imagination.But what\u2019s special about Fang Juexia\u2019s beauty was how distant it seemed.He naturally has a temperament that seems to keep people out of a ten-thousand-mile radius around him, like a silent, cold art piece with a low saturation.Cheng Qiang sent him back to the dormitory. Although Fang Juexia was tired, he was feeling restless. He took a bath, then sat in front of his desk and quietly opened a Sudoku book. With a pen in hand, he calculated everything out silently before filling in the blanks with numbers one after another, and his heart gradually calmed down. Once he was done with the Sudoku game, Fang Juexie went to bed and covered himself with a blanket. A wave of sleepiness hit him like a tide, submerging him in an instant. He didn\u2019t know how long he was deep asleep for before he vaguely heard a familiar voice while he was half-conscious.\u201cJuexia? Jue\u2013xia\u2013\u201dAfter struggling to open his eyes, he was greeted by the sight of a face mask that was within inches. Fang Juexia blinked twice, like a lens that was trying to focus, then burrowed deeper under his blanket. With a drowsy voice, he asked, \u201cWhat time is it?\u201dLing Yi took off his face mask. \u201cIt\u2019s so late we can have afternoon tea!\u201d As the main vocalist and treble, his voice would reverberate when he shouts. His ice cold hand reached into the blanket and he pulled Fang Juexia out. \u201cStop sleeping my Ge, something big happened!\u201dThe words 'something big\u201d stabbed Fang Juexia in an instant. He sobered up, wiped his face, and got off the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll go wash up.\u201d\u201cWhy is this Ge so calm all the time\u2026\u201d Ling Yi sat up from the bed and ran back to the living room. Sitting side by side on the sofa in the living room were two big guys \u2014 one was Kaleido\u2019s main dancer, Lu Yuan, and the other was He Ziyan, the lead rapper. The two of them had their heads stuck together as they stared at a laptop\u2019s screen with relish.\u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201d Jiang Miao, the leader of the team, had just wiped down the zither placed in the corner of the living room with the soft piece of cloth in his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll go heat up the soup for him, he hasn\u2019t eaten anything after sleeping for so long.\u201dLing Yi nodded rapidly, his gaze chasing after Jiang Miao, who was walking to the kitchen. \u201cMiao Ge, I want a bowl too!\u201dLu Yuan exclaimed, \u201cThese girls are bloody amazin\u2019! How could they say that?!\u201dHe Ziyan, who was sitting right next to him, teased, \u201cDalian Hunk, please speak proper Mandarin.\u201dLu Yuan, \u201cI\u00a0am\u00a0speaking proper Mandarin!\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgLing Yi snickered as he squeezed in with them, emulating his accent, \u201cDin\u2019 he now, it was\u00a0bloody\u00a0proper!\u201d\u201cPiss off!\u201dJust as they were causing a huge fuss, Fang Juexia walked out. The three-man group on the sofa looked up with subtle expressions on their faces.Fang Juexia understood. Before the rest could speak, he apologised, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I got you all involved again.\u201dThe three people on the sofa looked at each other, then looked back at Fang Juexia, question marks plastered all over their faces.\u201cHuh, shouldn\u2019t we be thanking you?\u201d He Ziyan said with a smile, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that our K band would blow up in such a way.\u201dThank?Fang Juexia had a vague sense that everything seemed to be a little different from what he had predicted. \u201cWhat was the big thing you guys were talking about?\u201dLing Yi turned the laptop around to face Fang Juexia. \u201cThe video taken of you and Xiao Pei at the airport by a fan made it to the Hot Searches list! Look, there are already more than 30,000 shares!\u201dAnd Pei Tingsong?Fang Juexie squinted a little as he watched the video playing on the screen. It was taken when he and Pei Tingson were waiting at the airport the day before yesterday.In the video, Pei Tingsong, dressed in a black overcoat, was wearing a pair of sunglasses as he strode over with his long legs to Fang Juexia, who was looking down at his ticket. He forced him to walk back so much that he had to lean on the wall. This guy who was almost 1.9m tall exuded an overbearing pressure. He casually took away the ticket in Fang Juexia\u2019s hand, pinching it between his fingers as he smiled at Fang Juexie, seeming as if he was saying something. Then he lifted his hand, and just like that, gently patted Fang Juexia\u2019s cheek with the ticket.The straight, sharp line of the ticket glided across his fair skin, that piece of paper bumping around with no restraint as they tried to knock down each other\u2019s bottom line.It really was Pei Tingsong\u2019s vile style, as always.But no one expected this scene to be caught on camera.In the video, Fang Juexia looked up slightly and stared at Pei Tingsong, only to see the smile on his face become more arrogant. He remembers the atmosphere then, and he also remembers how Pei Tingsong was actually forcing him to switch seats. At that time, he was adhering to his usual code of How to Get Along with Pei Tingsong 101 \u2013 hide whenever he can and not cause any trouble. So he took the ticket back, bit it, straightened his lapel with both hands, then looked up again and forced out a soulless smile as he faced the youngest member slash devil incarnate of their group.Ling Yi, who was lying on Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder, was scrutinising the Fang Juexia in the video in silence. He saw this living Buddha\u2019s expression turn grave, who then stayed silent for a while before speaking.\u201cAre the netizens talking about how Pei Tingsong is bullying me in the group? Has the company\u2019s PR said anything?\u201dTeammates: \u2026\u201cJuexia, wake up!\u201d Ling Yi shook him vigorously. \u201cThey\u2019re shipping you and Pei Tingsong!\u201d\u201cShip\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia was instantly stunned.How can there be people in this world who would ship the CP who has the worst relationship in the group?Dalian Hunk Lu Yuan bravely snatched the mouse to click on the comments. \u201cAi, my goodness you just haven\u2019t seen what the netizens are saying. Come come come, I\u2019ll show you, it\u2019s really just,\u00a0wow.\u201d[Licking Sugar in the North Pole Circle (north pole circle = shipping rarepairs, basically): AAAAHHHHHH PHEROMONES ARE FLOODING THE SCREEN!!!

Anyway, that was what the online world was like\u2014even if something was false, if you said it an enough number of times, it would become true.Just as he was about to take the initiative to change the subject, Jiang Miao brought out a bowl of soup from the kitchen. \u201cJuexia, Qiang Ge just called you, but you missed it. He wants you to go to the company for a meeting. Oh, right,\u201d he added, \u201cXiao Pei has already gone over there.\u201d\u201cRight now?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dUnder the pressure of the aura of maternal love being exuded by the captain, Fang Juexia still ended up drinking the bowl of chicken soup before rushing to the company.He hadn\u2019t expected that even the boss would join this meeting. Although Star Chart could only be regarded as a small-scale brokerage company, the boss still usually had a lot of things to do, so he seldom appeared in the actual company.\u201cHere he is, sit down.\u201d Boss Chen Zhengyun sat in the middle of the conference room with his hands folded, and motioned for him to sit next to him. Fang Juexia sat down based on his directive and then looked across the long table.The one who had pulled down his gray wool hat to cover his eyes and was leaning back in the chair to sleep soundly in public couldn\u2019t be anyone else but Pei Tingsong.\u201cXiao Pei, wake up.\u201d Cheng Qiang, who was sitting next to him, woke him up. Pei Tingsong pushed his hat up in a daze, then took it off and scratched his head. The clouds parted to reveal his sharp brow and eyes, which were directly aimed at Fang Juexia, who was right across from him.\u201cFinally arrived.\u201d The first sentence he uttered upon waking up was not polite in the least.His eyes were pinned on Fang Juexia, but Fang Juexia reflexively turned his face to look away, so his birthmark at the corner of his left eye was now facing Pei Tingsong. Seeing it made him think back to when he was little and had seen a particular kind of flower in the garden. It had been pink, and its petals had been long and slender, exactly the same as the shape of Fan Juexia\u2019s birthmark at the corner of his eye.\u201cSince last night, the two of you have been hanging on the Hot Searches list, and we were also quite surprised by this.\u201d Chen Zhengyun glanced at his assistant and ordered, \u201cReport the findings.\u201dThis incident had blown up quite suddenly, but Chen Zhengyun had still sent someone to record and analyze the data at the first possible moment. There were a lot of PowerPoint slides dedicated to the data. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t speak and just listened quietly. He casually glanced sideways at Pei Tingsong and saw him lying on the table, about to fall asleep again.\u201cIt\u2019s basically like this: not only on Weibo and the\u00a0Baidu Index, but also on some websites with a lesser number of active users, their trending search numbers are quite considerable.\u201d The assistant laughed. \u201cThey\u2019re trending even hotter right now than when Kaleido debuted.\u201dPei Tingsong, who had closed his eyes, suddenly let out a mocking laugh.So he wasn\u2019t asleep. Fang Juexia glanced at him again, and unexpectedly, this guy actually opened his eyes at that same instant. Both of them were caught off guard as their eyes met. Pei Tingsong had a pair of long, narrow, yet deep eyes, and the sharp contrast between the whites of his eyes and the black of his iris strongly gave off an aggressive feel.\u201cAlthough it wasn\u2019t done on purpose, the popularity is real. As all of you know, Kaleido\u2019s development, even after having already debuted for two years now, has never been satisfactory.\u201d Chen Zhengyun\u2019s eyes flitted back and forth between the two people. \u201cWe\u2019re having this meeting today in order to also discuss the development plans for the later stages.\u201dFang Juexia knew how things stood. For artists, their boss counted as a very honest and kind person. Even if they had already debuted for two years and had only amassed a tepid following, he hadn\u2019t forced everyone in the group to crazily participate in a variety of shows in order to improve their exposure unless the artists themselves asked to do so.In other words, their group had also debuted pretty hastily. It had once been ridiculed as \u201cfive bargain-priced\u00a0hidden treasures\u00a0+ one\u00a0airborne\u00a0household\u201d.At the beginning, it was because their senior brother group had gotten a bit popular, especially the group\u2019s face, Shang Sirui. Taking advantage of the favorable winds, Star Chart had wanted to launch another new boy band. Fang Juexia, who had once been a trainee who had nearly debuted in a large company, naturally deserved the center position in this new group.The other main dancer, Lu Yuan, had been the champion in a hip-hop competition before, but after the competition, due to an uneven distribution of interests in the company, he had been kicked out by the original dance company. After experiencing several twists and turns, he came to Star Chart.Ling Yi, the lead singer, had been born with a good voice, and when he had been a child, he had taken part in a children\u2019s singing talent show. Unfortunately, he had encountered people with special connections, and so had only ever taken second place. When he was 17, he had participated in another recruitment talent show, but again, because he had no connections, he could only make it into the finals before being eliminated. Later, he was recruited by Star Chart\u2019s talent scouts and became a trainee. He had trained for three and a half years before he made his debut.Group leader Jiang Miao was a student from the\u00a0Central Conservatory of Music, and he was good at playing the guzheng. Unfortunately, his family\u2019s situation wasn\u2019t good, so in order to support his Meimei, he had, for a time, become an anchor and had livestreamed playing the guzheng. However, he wasn\u2019t popular because he didn\u2019t show his face. He was then discovered by Star Chart\u2019s talent scout and was turned into a trainee.As for the two rappers in the group, among all the idol trainees, they stood out even more for having \u201cunknown origins\u201d. He Ziyan had been very young when he had started mixing with underground bands, and he had also gone to bars to sing and work as a DJ back then. He had a natural gift for electronic music, but he never even mentioned his home or his family. Pei Tingsong counted as the only one amongst all of them who had been born with a golden spoon in his mouth. He had parachuted in as an airborne just before the group was created, throwing all the previous plans and arrangements into disarray, for everything had to be rearranged to shove this young master into the group.However, it was undeniable that in this circle, Pei Tingsong\u2019s rapping skills and creative ability were absolutely top-notch. When they had debuted two years ago, he had only been 19, and his family background, talent, and appearance were all so well-tailored that it felt as if someone had created a bug in the system, so it would have been difficult for the company to not have gone crazy over him.\u201cI won\u2019t do it.\u201d Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t mince words. With one hand supporting his cheek, his other hand picked up the pen on the table and twirled it.Chen Zhengyun didn\u2019t seem to pay much attention to him. He turned to Fang Juexia and continued, \u201cThe planning department worked overtime and gave me a new outline.\u201d The assistant distributed the plans to everyone in the room while Chen Zhengyun stated simply and clearly, \u201cThe company is ready to readjust the marketing strategy for you guys. To be frank, even if you and Xiao Pei agree to do fanservice by being a CP together, you don\u2019t need to show too much intimacy. Be fairly normal, and just show a bit of friendship between group members, and that\u2019ll be enough.\u201dThese words stabbed straight into the bottom of these two people\u2019s hearts. They had been at odds with each other ever since their debut, with both of them looking down upon the other. It was just that the way Fang Juexia expressed his dislike was by not spending much time with the other party, while Pei Tingsong wasn\u2019t the same. He would come by every once in a while to play some vile tricks on him.Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t have stirred up this big of an uproar.\u201cThis is a very good opportunity. As long as you grasp this popularity, your future development will certainly reach new levels.\u201dFang Juexia stared at the plan and was silent for a few seconds. He thought of all the large and small conflicts that had erupted between Pei Tingsong and him during the past two years. If their relationship stayed the way it had always been like, he could try to avoid him as much as possible and thus maintain a harmonious atmosphere within the team. But if they agreed to this\u2026.The consequences were unimaginable.He looked up and said, \u201cBoss, forget it\u00a0ba. I don\u2019t really want to form a CP.\u201dJust as his voice fell, and even before the boss could get a chance to deal with him, the person from across the table started to get angry and asked, \u201cLooking down on forming a CP with me?\u201d\u201cGive me some reason to be convinced.\u201d Pei Tingsong raised his eyebrows, his eyes contemplative. \u201cAm I not good-looking enough or not rich enough?\u201dHe was hinting brazenly. Fang Juexia neither changed his expression nor did he answer.\u201cThen, Xiao Pei, you really want to form a CP, don\u2019t you?\u201d Chen Zhengyun jerked his chin over at Cheng Qiang and said, \u201cRecord it down, the youngest member agreed.\u201dXiao Pei rolled his eyes, and disagreed in a lifeless tone, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cYou seem pretty eager to me.\u201d Chen Zhengyun was too lazy to dally around with others. His gaze fell back on Fang Juexia, and he said, \u201cJuexia, this matter concerns not only the two of you, but also the whole group. In fact, it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want to; it\u2019ll just be losing a chance to gain some fans outside of the usual circle. But then again, by now, people online have already dug up old videos of the two of you, and as long as this topic keeps getting more popular, it will spread by itself. Even if you don\u2019t take the initiative to organize any CP fanservice, from the moment that video landed on yesterday\u2019s Hot Searches list, you two have been passively trussed together.\u201dHis implication was that by looking at the current state of affairs, you should just go ahead and seize the initiative on this matter, rather than remaining passive.Fang Juexia looked at him. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to use this method.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a method, Juexia, it\u2019s an opportunity.\u201d Chen Zhengyun shrugged before adding, \u201cThe six of you, based purely on your strengths, could definitely have achieved better results than what the situation is like right now. The most difficult thing though is to have strength without having any opportunities.\u201d\u201cOr have you already forgotten what you said to me when you first joined the company?\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgFang Juexia\u2019s heart suddenly contracted.He had said that he wanted to stand in the center of the stage.But he didn\u2019t even have a stage now.Even though their debut had involved a lot of coincidences, the company had still put their whole heart into it. Chen Zhengyun himself had prepared and completed the initial stages of planning for their group\u2019s debut. The group\u2019s name\u2014Kaleido\u2014was also based on the word \u2018kaleidoscope\u2019, embodying the ever-changing meaning of a kaleidoscope. They were all very clear on the hope that had been placed on them.But whether a group could succeed or not involved too many factors.A thin layer of sweat formed on his palms, his nerves seemed as if they were being shredded inch by inch, and he stiffened. At this time, his cellphone suddenly vibrated, and Fang Juexia\u2019s hand trembled. Seeing the caller ID flash by, his brow tightened even more.\u201cSorry, I\u2026 need to go out first.\u201dChen Zhengyun nodded and since it was already like this, he let everyone else take a break too, also going outside to smoke. Only Pei Tingsong and Cheng Qiang were left in the conference room. Pei Tingsong felt bored stiff as he held the pen to practice calligraphy on the papers containing the plan. He had originally wanted to write out his name, but had just written the first part of \u2018Pei\u2019 when he heard Cheng Qiang sigh. He looked up to see that Cheng Qiang\u2019s face was cloudy and grim with demoralization.He was a little curious. \u201cStrong Ge, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201dThe name \u2018Strong Ge\u2019 had been given to him by their fans first. This was because during airport meetups, all of the group members called him Qiang Ge, Qiang Ge. The fans heard them wrong, and since then had always called him Strong Ge. Pei Tingsong felt it was interesting and decided to follow suit.Cheng Qiang fidgeted and said, \u201cShit, as soon as we talk about it, I get angry\u2026\u201dFang Juexia had to go around and around in circles before he managed to find an empty meeting room on the same floor. He originally didn\u2019t want to answer the phone, but this Assistant Director Yang was not only the assistant director for a number of variety shows, but was also a small high-levelled member on the program broadcasting platform. As a small, not-so-popular idol, he had already crossed the limits by not giving him much face.\u201cAssistant Director Yang.\u201dThe person on the other end of the line seemed to have switched personalities as he said with a kind tone, \u201cXiao Fang\u00a0ah, you\u2019re not busy at the moment\u00a0ba? Yesterday, my temper was really a bit bad. If the words I used were too heavy, don\u2019t take it to heart. You also know that I like you very much, and it\u2019s only because I like you that I grew a bit excited\u2026.\u201dOnce the word \u201clike\u201d came out of his mouth, Fang Juexia frowned. He put his cellphone back in his pocket and adjusted his wireless earbuds. \u201cDirector, I have already clearly expressed my intentions\u2026\u201d\u201cYou child, listen to me finish first. You got on the Hot Searches list yesterday, and don\u2019t you feel pretty happy about it? You see, you actually have potential with how good-looking you are, right\u00a0ba? You also have the professional ability, but just lack the steps to climb up.\u201dThe more he spoke, the more disgust piled up in Fang Juexia\u2019s heart. It was as if the big-bellied and disrespectful assistant director was standing in front of him at the moment, with lewdness spilling out of his eyes as he caressed his shoulder with that thick hand of his. Now, even hearing the sound of his breathing through the receiver made him feel sick.\u201cAssistant Director Yang, if\u00a0you\u00a0have to impose upon people\u2026\u201dWithout waiting for Fang Juexia to finish his sentence, the other end retorted in a loud voice\u2014\u201cHow is this imposing on people! This is simply taking what each person needs. All this mess trending online these past two days was because of your company buying a spot on the Hot Searches list\u00a0ba. That\u2019s good\u00a0ah, they have learned how to boost people now. They should have started doing things this way a long time ago\u00a0ma. But you have to think clearly, new people are piled up to the brim at all times in this circle. If you don\u2019t get the exposure required to follow-up and make good use of this popularity right now, then it\u2019ll all be in vain. All the money you guys spent on the Hot Searches list will be as if you tossed it into the water instead. Do you understand?\u201dThe sharp voice coming through the earphones solidified and transformed into a grating electronic sound, cruelly cutting through Fang Juexia\u2019s proud self-esteem.At this moment, he had become a cheap commodity on the shelf. Even if he didn\u2019t end up in the pitiable situation of being forced to be bought and sold, anyone could come along and wantonly crumble his insides into pieces, leaving behind only the fragile plastic packaging intact. Pick it up and shake it, and all you would be able to hear would be the clear wails of broken dreams colliding against each other.The more the other side said, the more confident he grew, and so started exhibiting his intention of seducing him over to his side by saying, \u201cWhat is a good way to gain exposure? Of course it\u2019s by participating in a reality show\u00a0ah! When it comes to reality shows, your company doesn\u2019t have the kind of contacts I do\u2026\u201dNausea, dizziness and fatigue, along with his lack of food, darkened his vision and weakened his legs and feet. The voice coming through the headset split into countless pieces of sounds, with bursts of static layered on top of them.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to do online? If you\u2019re going to do something, you need to get on a satellite TV program. For every minute you are on such a program, your national profile will increase, just like the boat that rises with the tide. Xiao Fang, you just have to take it easy. As long as you come to me, I promise to tailor one such plan just for you\u2026\u201dAll of a sudden, his cheek was brushed by cold fingertips.The source of his disgust disappeared with his earphones being removed. His ears were empty for a moment, and the noisy and chaotic world suddenly quieted down, it felt as if he had sunk into the deep sea.\u201cAssistant Director Yang.\u201dA hand was casually placed on Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder, and his entire body went stiff as he turned his head in stupefaction.The old man on the other end of the call, who had originally had an unceasing stream of words to still vomit out, was stunned at the sound of this voice, and the exaggerated words that he had held onto scattered all over the floor. After all, this low voice didn\u2019t sound anything like Fang Juexia\u2019s, and its cynical tone contained\u00a0nothing in common\u00a0with Fang Juexia.\u201cI\u2019ve recorded this.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Fang Juexia envied him so much.\u201cYou! Who are you?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t tell?\u201d His tone at the end of this question made him sound even more careless than before. Fang Juexia felt the hand on his shoulder sway gently as fingertips tapped against him. \u201cI\u2019m Pei Tingsong\u00a0ah.\u201dThe other party\u2019s voice suddenly came to a halt. \u201cPei\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, Pei Tingsong, the one who had counter-killed your garbage last time. I heard\u00a0you\u00a0wanted to have me blocked last time? Did you succeed?\u201d Pei Tingsong pressed a hand on the table behind him and then sat on it. \u201cIt seems that in the end, the broadcast didn\u2019t dare to cut out my parts\u00a0ma.\u201dFang Juexia knew where this guy\u2019s power came from, but he didn\u2019t expect that this guy would actually be willing to use this power on his own self.The other party experienced the sensation of having a\u00a0fishbone get stuck in his throat\u00a0for a moment. He knew that he couldn\u2019t afford to offend this guy, so he didn\u2019t try to go around in circles with him. \u201cYou give the phone to Fang Juexia, I have proper business to discuss with him.\u201d\u201cYour proper business is related to hidden rules for young male artists? Your benefits are pretty good\u00a0ah.\u201dHe even knew about that; Fang Juexia frowned.Pei Tingsong had a straightforward character, and after having worked with him for two years, Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t be more clear about this point. But even so, the words \u201chidden rules\u201d pierced sharply through him, so he tried to escape from the loose grip of that leisurely and carefree hand on his shoulder to widen the excessively intimate distance between them.But the moment his shoulder left Pei Tingsong\u2019s grasp, Pei Tingsong caught hold of his runaway wrist. He hadn\u2019t changed his posture at all\u2014his head was still half-bowed as he spoke on the phone\u2014only his eyes raised up slightly as he matched his sharp gaze against Fang Juexia\u2019s. Then he continued with his conversation, \u201cIf I worked for the news, this would be a great scoop. Ready-made materials just waiting for me to bust them open and explode them into the light, right?\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t know who that \u201cright\u201d was meant for, all he could feel was his wrist being encircled and pricked by thorns.\u201cWhat the hell does it have to do with you?\u201dFang Juexia was also curious, because this matter really had nothing to do with Pei Tingsong.\u201cOf course it has something to do with me.\u201dThe hold on his wrist tightened.Pei Tingsong\u2019s long legs spread apart as he explained, \u201cDidn\u2019t you see the Hot Search? The company has asked us to form a CP, so before this business agreement ends\u2026\u201d He faced Fang Juexia and laughed like a naughty child. \u201cEverything he does is bound to me and mine.\u201d\u201cHis reputation concerns my reputation, and his private life affects the public\u2019s view of my private life. Once we publicly announce and establish a symbiotic relationship, the eyes of the many will start to equate all of these things between us.\u201dHis tone made it very clear that he was completely bantering. \u201cDo\u00a0you\u00a0think I look like the kind of person who would become a sugar baby for you?\u201dThe voice on the other end of the phone went from being agitated and indignant at the beginning to getting completely choked off by the end of this conversation. This person could think of nothing more to say. In this circle, some people were famous, some had money, and others had their own means. However, they all had one thing in common; that was, they accepted and generally abided by all the rules, spoken and unspoken, of this industry. But Pei Tingsong was a freak who loved breaking the rules, and he also had strong backing behind him, one who supported his rule-breaking wholeheartedly. This not only made him look like a bastard, but also made him someone not to be trifled with.Hearing no further sounds from the other end of the call, Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth curled as he said, \u201cGoodbye then, Assistant Director Yang.\u201dHis tone then cooled as he warned\u2014\u201cBe a bit more well-behaved, and dream less.\u201dPei Tingsong raised his hand to the earphones to end the call before taking them off. He then raised his chin and stared at Fang Juexia, not saying a single word. Although he didn\u2019t speak, the way he raised up his eyebrow made for a very obvious hint\u2014he just was waiting for him to speak first.Fang Juexia knew that he should open his mouth and say something at this time, but he first looked down at\u00a0 Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand, which was still grasping onto his wrist, and there didn\u2019t seem to be even the slightest indication that he would let go. Pei Tingsong saw him glancing at their hands, and the corners of his mouth hooked up again, while the slender fingers of his free hand started playing with the headphones.\u201cThank you.\u201dPei Tingsong tilted his head, and his eyes chased Fang Juexia\u2019s evasive gaze. \u201cListening to your tone of voice, it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re all that grateful towards me.\u201dWho would have known that Fang Juexia would suddenly reply solemnly, \u201cI\u2019m very grateful. But I didn\u2019t want anyone else to get involved in this matter, especially my group members.\u201dSo earnest.Pei Tingsong lazily nodded twice. \u201cYou especially didn\u2019t want it to be me\u00a0ba.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s indifferent eyes fell on him for a few seconds, and then he nodded slightly, showing his agreement for this sentence.\u201cBut thank you all the same.\u201dHearing this, Pei Tingsong laughed. Talking about it, the most unusual part of his facial features were his eyes. When he wasn\u2019t smiling, they looked cold and intense. But the moment he smiled, they would immediately turn into a pair of curved, childish eyes, and his entire demeanor would also change completely in a flash.However, Fang Juexia knew that even if this person was smiling at him now, it was only out of amusement at his circumstances.He was simply curious and asked, with an expression like that of a student with a strong thirst for knowledge, \u201cWhy would there be someone who has taken a liking to you\u00a0ah? I can\u2019t imagine the way you would look in bed at all. Do these people have a thing for ice or wood?\u201dHe said it so bluntly that Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t get angry at all, and instead quipped back quite peacefully, \u201cThen can you let go of this wood\u2019s hand?\u201dOnly then did Pei Tingsong discover that he was still holding onto his wrist, and his naturally vile instincts took over again as he stated, \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201dIn the midst of this standoff, they heard Cheng Qiang\u2019s voice calling out from outside, \u201cJuexia? Xiao Pei? Weird\u2026\u201d\u201cQiang Ge told you.\u201d Fang Juexia quickly understood the whole story.He just saw the other side shrug, then non-committedly say, \u201cWho cares who told me, anyway, if things had continued to develop, sooner or later, the whole company would know.\u201d\u201cSo what if they knew?\u201dLooking at this fearless appearance of his, Pei Tingsong felt it was funny. \u201cThat\u2019s true, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s the first time. Then why did you refuse this time? Anyway, previously you\u2026\u201dAt that very instant, Cheng Qiang saw the two people inside the conference room through the glass door. He opened the door and said, \u201cWhat are you two doing? I had to go around in a whole circle before I found you guys.\u201dFang Juexia pulled his hand away quietly and looked down at his wrist, which had turned red from the strength of Pei Tingsong\u2019s grip. Pei Tingsong looked completely relaxed as he got down from the table. \u201cNothing, just cultivating feelings in advance.\u201d\u201cCome on, you haven\u2019t managed to cultivate any feelings even after two years, you phonies.\u201d Cheng Qiang kept an eye out for the expressions on Juexia\u2019s face and specially asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cI took care of that matter.\u201d Pei Tingsong took the lead in saying, \u201cI\u2019ll also tell my Jie that if Yang Chenggang misbehaves again, then she should directly withdraw her investment. With his character, we\u2019re just waiting for him to be exposed and for the program to be boycotted, and by then her money would really have been squandered away.\u201dCheng Qiang nodded. The reason why he had been willing to tell Pei Tingsong about this matter was because he had long been aware of the issues between him and this assistant director from before. He knew that with Pei Tingsong\u2019s character of not even being able to\u00a0bear a speck of dirt in his eye, he would definitely take action.\u201cThen you have to really thank Xiao Pei.\u201d He placed his hand on Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder and steered them towards the conference room where the meeting was being held, but Fang Juexia just stiffened up before agreeing in a low voice.Pei Tingsong walked behind them and looked at Fang Juexia\u2019s back. Humans were a complex mass of contradictions\u2014a fact he knew well. Yet, Fang Juexia was probably the strangest contradiction he had seen. There was a natural coldness to his appearance, which gave the impression that he kept people at\u00a0arm\u2019s length\u00a0at any and all times, and yet such a person was deeply involved in rumors of that sort.But now, looking at his current countenance of preferring death before dishonor, Pei Tingsong became really curious.It couldn\u2019t be post-traumatic stress?Although Pei Tingsong looked down upon people who sold their bodies to get to their positions, he had a natural affection for people with high professional ability, and Fang Juexia was such a person. His dancing ability was absolutely top notch in the entire circle, not to mention that he had been born with a good voice that had a hoarse timbre to it. After working together for two years, Pei Tingsong\u2019s aversion to him had gradually decreased little by little, dropping from the peak it had been at when he had first heard the rumors, and currently, he almost couldn\u2019t feel anymore of it.Besides not being disgusted anymore, he had also become a little curious, because the contradictions that were present in Fang Juexia\u2019s personality and behaviour were too special.The second half of the meeting flowed by very quickly. Pei Tingsong was absent-minded for most of it and even forgot about the purpose he came here for here\u2014to oppose their plan to make them form a CP. After a while, the door of the conference room opened, and the four other members of their group entered one by one.The boss motioned for everyone to sit down and told the assistant to distribute the new plan. \u201cEver since Kaleido debuted, you guys have only released two albums, and the most recent one was the mini-album from a year ago. In fact, you should have made a come-back a long time ago, and you guys have all probably been pretty anxious this whole while.\u201dChen Zhengyun glanced over each group member and said, \u201cWe discussed it in the meeting we had just now. In order to make the most of your recent popularity, the company has decided to launch the production and distribution of a new album as soon as possible.\u201dGroup leader Jiang Miao brought up a question. \u201cBut it takes time to make an album\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Chen Zhengyun said, \u201cWe can\u2019t compress the production time and release a crudely-made album to fool the fans just because you guys got a bit more popular. You guys are idols, and singing and dancing are your bounden duties, so at least in these aspects, we can\u2019t let anyone down. Therefore, in order to balance the production quality and time, we need to maintain your popularity in another way. Ziyan, Jiang Miao, you guys have variety show resources, Lu Yuan is still filming a dance program as well, Ling Yi has an OST, and Juexia is also filming\u2026\u201dCheng Qiang cut him off. \u201cJuexia\u2019s program is gone.\u201dChen Zhengyun\u2019s face showed some suspicion, but he didn\u2019t delve into the topic. He continued, \u201cTo reiterate, in short, we are still engaged in talks about acquiring other possible prospects. If these talks go well, we can get a spot as a drop-in guest for you guys on some of the popular variety shows.\u201d With that, he motioned to his assistant to distribute the other documents related to the plan.Ling Yi took the plan, flipped through its pages, and said in surprise, \u201cThere\u2019s even an ensemble show featuring only us?\u201d\u201cThis time, we will mainly film everyone\u2019s day-to-day real life, and may add some entertainment sections afterwards to break it up a bit and not make it too monotonous.\u201d Cheng Qiang carefully explained the details of the plan for the ensemble show to everyone, \u201cThe format will likely consist of filming and livestreaming at the same time, and we may intersperse some livestream clips in the middle too to save time on filming.\u201dBefore the end of the meeting, Chen Zhengyun stood up. \u201cYou are all children possessing good abilities. Over the past two years, all of you should have realised how cruel this circle can be. I don\u2019t need to say anything else, everyone already knows the score.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing you all as shining idols.\u201dWhen Fang Juexia heard this sentence, he fell into a reverie and felt as though he was back to the start. It seemed as though that stage he had longed for back then had once again drawn near him, even though it had approached him in this absurd way.Right after the meeting finished, these six people stayed behind at the company to practice for the new album.Today\u2019s entertainment industry offered idols a lot of opportunities, but they were not all specifically related to the career of an \u2018idol\u2019 itself. What was embarrassing was that most of these young people entered the circle with the dream of singing and dancing on a stage, but eventually ended up doing various other jobs for a variety of reasons. By carrying the title of \u2018idol\u2019, many of them suffered from all kinds of prejudices and couldn\u2019t get the kind of stage an idol should have.Music and dance gradually got further and further away from them, as they busied and tired themselves out by rushing between large and small performance venues, and then burning through countless all-nighters in largely identical recording studios, until they forgot their original intentions. Finally, they would be hastily judged as being \u201cinsatiably greedy\u201d or \u201ctrying to do something beyond their ability,\u201d and would then disappear under the new wave of beauty that entered the circle.The chaos that came with being in this artiste profession caused too many fresh lives to be passively ground into residue under the gears of the entertainment circle, which was like a large and perpetually-moving machine. This would happen day after day, and there would always be more fresh and beautiful victims who would be lured into its jaws.\u201cThe intensity of Juexia\u2019s dance practice is too high today.\u201d Ling Yi panted for breath while leaning against the wall, and unscrewed his malva nut thermos to drink some water. \u201cNo way, I didn\u2019t warm up my voice properly today, cough, cough.\u201d He started to goof off, speaking in a hoarse voice while stretching out his own hand, \u201cHuohuo, my throat, what\u2019s wrong with my throat? I will never be favored again\u2026\u201dHe Ziyan, who was helping group leader Jiang Miao hold down his feet while he was doing sit-ups, spared a hand to cover his own mouth as he laughed. \u201cEnter the cold palace\u00a0ba, Concubine Ling. Your physical strength is too poor for you to be favored.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it, look, even Yuan Ge can\u2019t keep up with him! Both of them are our main dancers, so we can compare them\u00a0ba.\u201d Ling Yi used his arm to turn Pei Tingsong around a bit. \u201cRight\u00a0ba,\u00a0Xiao Pei.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Pei Tingsong, with his hands stuffed in the pockets of his hoodie, replied perfunctorily as he gazed at Fang Juexia, who was in front of the mirror, from a distance.He felt that as though this person was completely filled with energy that he had been holding back for a long time.That kind of feeling couldn\u2019t be described; clearly, in terms of popular aesthetics, this person\u2019s appearance could pretty much be described as fragile and soft. However, he felt that Fang Juexia was much rather like a thorn.A stubborn thorn that never softened.This was already the second time that the man in front of him had found himself drowned up to his chin in the quagmire of hidden rules. Even if that first instance could be somewhat regarded as just a rumour, Pei Tingsong had personally witnessed the unsuccessful transaction that the most recent instance had ended up being.What was it that these people were coveting so much? His beauty? His youth?This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgSeriously, he didn\u2019t understand.Pei Tingsong had never been in love before. It wasn\u2019t that he was too young to be interested in these kinds of feelings, it was just that he wasn\u2019t interested in dating. He felt that it would be a waste whenever he imagined his heart being caught up in such sticky and trivial thoughts. These kinds of things like feelings\u2014 when it was going good, it could send people up into the heavens, and when it was going bad, even going to hell would be a better option.But they probably didn\u2019t want to date Fang Juexia\u00a0ba. These middle-aged men all had families; they just wanted to sample something fresh and then leave.The thought of that sort of physical lust felt even more absurd; he had a very hard time imagining what it felt like to have any ideas towards a man\u2019s body. Although he grew up abroad, had all kinds of friends around him, and supported minority groups, he wasn\u2019t gay. He couldn\u2019t understand this kind of craving.Two of his blind spots had been poked at in one go. However, Pei Tingsong\u2019s way of thinking was different from others. Above all else, he couldn\u2019t tolerate ambiguity and had to deeply consider any matter involving it.He tried to find the answer from Fang Juexia\u2019s body.\u201cHoly crap, Fang Juexia is crazy. How long has he been practicing for by now? Daddy is tired to death, in the future, I\u2019m not going to practice dancing alongside crazy training demons anymore,\u201d Lu Yuan also came back, bent over and gasping as he wheezed out these words.Jiang Miao finished his last sit-up with a smile and said, \u201cAh, my stomach is so sore\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s eat, I\u2019m so hungry~\u201d Ling Yi dragged Jiang Miao up. \u201cCaptain, I want to eat!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, it\u2019s time.\u201d Jiang Miao looked at his watch and then called out to Juexia from afar. Only then did the Fang Juexia being reflected in the mirror stop, and he gasped out, \u201cI\u2019ll come later.\u201d\u201cAlright\u00a0ba.\u201d Everyone knew what his personality was like. When it came to training, this guy would become the most intense person in the whole company; no one could stop him. Ling Yi pulled at Pei Tingsong. \u201cLet\u2019s go Xiao Pei, today, Ge will take you down to the countryside to eat at the company canteen, using my card!\u201dWho would have known that Pei Tingsong would take this moment to deviate from his normal behavior by saying, \u201cYi Ge, you guys go first\u00a0ba, I\u2019ll practice for a bit.\u201dThese several people froze right on the spot.No, this guy who usually treated his job of being an idol as a\u00a0hobby, had undergone a personality change?Jiang Miao could take a hint and smiled. \u201cThen we\u2019ll go first. Don\u2019t practice for too long and delay eating dinner.\u201dLing Yi was still worried even after they all reached the canteen. \u201cThe two of them won\u2019t start fighting\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cThis fight has been waiting to happen for a long, long time.\u201d The expression on He Ziyan\u2019s face, that of a Bodhisattva having opened his third eye to predict the future, really clashed with his short eyebrows.Lu Yuan took the opportunity to cut a piece from the sirloin steak on his plate and stuff it into his mouth. \u201cYou have to say though, I seem to have been brainwashed by those girls online. When I look at the two of them now, they seem like an old couple.\u201dLing Yi used his chopsticks to hold a very thickly cut portion of shredded potato, and held it in such a manner that he looked like a big boss who was smoking as he spoke, \u201cXiao Fang, and this Xiao Pei\u00a0ah, every single day, they always seem like they could start fighting in the very next second. Do you think all these little girls will cultivate the two of them as a CP after seeing what they\u2019re really like?\u201d\u201cThey will.\u201d He Ziyan calmly used his chopsticks to slap Lu Yuan\u2019s evil hand away, which had stretched forward for a second time.\u201cWhy?\u201d Ling Yi blinked.\u201cEat\u00a0ba.\u201d Jiang Miao\u2019s facial expression clearly conveyed that he had seen through things but was too polite to explain it. \u201cThey won\u2019t fight.\u201dThere were only two people left in the practice room, and Fang Juexia soon stopped practicing dancing. Habits learned over the course of two years already caused him to naturally take the initiative in trying to turn away from Pei Tingsong whenever he faced him, in order to avoid creating any trouble. He pushed his sweaty hair back, revealing his bright and clean forehead, and got ready to leave.Seeing the other party\u2019s naturally red birthmark, Pei Tingsong suddenly remembered the moment he had seen him for the first time.As an airborne trainee, he had been led by Cheng Qiang to meet his future group members. This meeting had taken place in a training room, and it had happened in winter. When the door had opened, several boys could be seen practicing the dance for their debut. Upon hearing movement, everyone had turned their heads. Only one guy, in a black baseball cap, had still been practicing while facing the mirror, and did so right up to the moment Cheng Qiang opened his mouth.He had then stopped, and breathing silently, had turned around, very much like the way he did just now. Sweat had trickled down the lines of his jaw, just like how a drop of water melts off an icicle hanging at the edge of a roof.The last person to introduce himself was, of course, him.Fang Juexia, who had only been 20 years old at that time, had taken off his hat and pushed his sweaty hair back, exactly the way he had done just now, thus revealing his whole face. The slender and long light red birthmark on his pale skin had brought forth an abstract image in the sea of his mind.Cherry blossoms scattering and billowing across snow\u2014This was the most appropriate image he had found to describe it.\u201cHello, my name is Fang Juexia.\u201d[\u00a0Even though the rain doesn\u2019t know summer has left, the sun was clear and summer was deep.\u00a0]Obviously, his name pertained to summer, but his whole body carried the coldness of winter.He had nodded and smiled back. \u201cPei Tingsong.\u201dAt that time, Ling Yi, who was a naturally friendly person, had asked curiously, \u201cWhat a special name! How did your parents come up with it?\u201d\u201cI was born on New Year\u2019s Eve. \u2018A pot of fire roars with the bamboo, staying up to feast and listen to the pepper wine being poured.\u2019 My grandfather named me using two words from that poem.\u201d\u201cWow, it sounds really good, but you don\u2019t look like a child who was born in the winter.\u201dReally.Pei Tingsong\u2019s gaze, which had been blurred by his memories, gradually returned to reality, and he noticed himself fixedly staring at Fang Juexia through the mirror.His unceasing gaze fell on the half-rolled up sleeves of Fang Juexia\u2019s hoodie, where his exposed arms looked pale and wiry. The blood vessels and muscles in his arm could be seen moving faintly. Since he had worked up a sweat, his originally loose clothing was now unconsciously sticking to his body, swaying with his movements. Pei Tingsong\u2019s gaze wandered down to see the hollows on the sides of his ankles and heels being hugged tightly by the hems of his pants, which also scraped against his snow-white skin.At the sight of this, for some reason, Pei Tingsong recalled the feel of the moment when he had held onto Fang Juexia\u2019s wrist tightly.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Fang Juexia noticed the direction of his gaze through the mirror, turned around, and looked at him coldly.Releasing the hand that he had subconsciously clenched, Pei Tingsong\u2019s lips lazily curved up, and he looked straight at his face.\u201cTrying to see exactly how you\u2019re attractive.\u201d\u2014The author has something to say :The names of the two people are from:Pei Tingsong: \u2018A pot of fire roars with the bamboo, staying up to feast and listen to the pepper wine being poured.\u2019\u2014\u2014\u201dNew Year\u2019s Eve\u201d (Dai Fugu of the Song Dynasty)Fang Juexia: \u2018Even though the rain doesn\u2019t know summer has left, the sun was clear and summer was deep.\u2019 \u2014\u2014\u201dXi Qing\u201d (Fan Changda of the Song Dynasty)In fact, these two poems are quite in line with their respective personalities.[If you can\u2019t get used to Fang Juexia\u2019s character in the beginning, please directly abandon this story. Don\u2019t scold him as being a weak bun or say that he might as well just clean himself up and send himself in to be cursed out or something, it\u2019s very unpleasant to hear. Fang Juexia is definitely not a weak bun character. He is a very strong and rational and brave person. Please don\u2019t use the ideas you\u2019ve formed from just three chapters to maliciously speculate about him.At this time, the relationship between the gong and shou is very bad, so there\u2019s no need to scold him for disrespect. The writing made it clear that they had a bad relationship from the start, and the shou also hasn\u2019t taken care of the gong. If you guys lived with someone you had a bad relationship with, you probably wouldn\u2019t be very affectionate with them either. If you can\u2019t accept this, then you can abandon this story.And finally, explaining the question many people have asked, \u201cWhy not make a recording?\u201d Do you really think that a little idol recording something can change the fact of him being bullied by those with capital and family background? Can he really revolt? After sending out the recording, who do you think will be the one bearing the consequences, won\u2019t it be him and his group members? They already didn\u2019t have any backstage connections or capital, and after this, won\u2019t they now get frozen out by national TV and capital resources?This article starts with an unpopular group and an unpopular idol, who will crawl up step-by-step. If you don\u2019t like this, you really can abandon this story, don\u2019t force yourself to continue reading.]No abuse, no abuse, no abuse in this work.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Without showing even a flicker on his face, he picked up his coat off the ground, shrouded himself with it, and prepared to leave the training room.However, Pei Tingsong still hadn\u2019t gotten used to his blatant disregard and pulled back on his arm. \u201cHey, is that how you treat a benefactor?\u201dFang Juexia paused in his steps and glanced at him, his words cool as he retorted, \u201cI also don\u2019t want to do so, but with the way you take liberties with me, you don\u2019t seem to regard yourself as my benefactor.\u201d He pulled his arm away from Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand, and his coat fell to the floor.\u201cThen what do I regard myself as?\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s eyes were indifferent as he said curtly, \u201cA\u00a0patron.\u201dHaving said that, he was ready to leave the room, but Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t intend to let him go so easily. This time, he didn\u2019t try to grab him anymore; he directly stepped forward and blocked Fang Juexia from moving forward, and did it so abruptly that Fang Juexia almost ran into him.\u201cAbout that, you really reminded me of something.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s eyes drooped, while the corners of his mouth seemed to carry a trace of perverseness as he spoke\u2014\u201cI also can\u2019t help you for nothing\u00a0ah.\u201dFang Juexia silently raised his eyes and looked directly at the teammate who had never stopped trying to trip him up.\u201cAs a patron, I\u2019m bound to take something from your body, right?\u201d Pei Tingsong laughed. \u201cIsn\u2019t that how it is?\u201dHe originally thought that he had become immune towards such banter and would not react to it at all, but whenever the initiator was Pei Tingsong, Fang Juexia\u2019s mood would begin to creep beyond the bounds of calmness.\u201cI don\u2019t have time to play this kind of boring game with you.\u201d He moved away in preparation to leave, but who would have known that Pei Tingsong would calmly block him again.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t desire your body.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u00a0 looked him up and down, not bothering to cover up the profane expression on his face while doing so. \u201cBut since we\u2019re going to be selling fanservice from now on, one side will have to cooperate with the other side\u00a0ba. Looking at your expression\u2026\u201d He bent down, picked up the coat that had fallen on the ground, and placed it on Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit too fake.\u201dFang Juexia stared at him and didn\u2019t speak. He was always like this; those eyes of his were cold and direct, as if he was never afraid nor did he care about anything.\u2014This reminded Pei Tingsong of winter.He liked the smell of winter, the cold air mixed with the faint scent of withering plants. Although it had hardly ever snowed in\u00a0Atherton, he still liked winter.Pei Tingsong had a strange hobby since childhood.In the winter, the gardener would cut off half of the withered branches and leaves that had lost the vitality of summer in the garden. This was the happiest time of the year for him. He would squat on the ground, carefully select the straightest of these branches, then grasp its two ends and break it in half.These cut-off branches were beautiful, straight, and inflexible, and looked as if they would never yield. At the moment it snapped in half, you could feel the power of its obstinate resistance beneath its hard surface. But this power was of no use; all the branches would eventually snap in two with a crisp cracking sound. The broken sections then revealed the last green bits of the tree\u2019s vitality, and the complex scent of plants and decayed dead branches would waft out, which Pei Tingsong found very bewitching.That moment when the branch broke was the moment he experienced immense psychological satisfaction.And at this current moment, he could feel that very familiar satisfaction nearing him.It felt as if he had once again found his favoured type of withered branch.\u201cDon\u2019t make it seem as if we\u2019re as incompatible as fire and water. I\u2019m really not interested in you that way. However, since we\u2019ve already agreed to sell fanservice, we have to at least make it look fanservice-y. If you don\u2019t know what to do\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s smile at the end of this trailing sentence looked very pure.He stretched out his hand and pushed away the sweaty hair across Fang Juexia\u2019s forehead. His voice was very low as he said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay if you just obediently listen to me, Juexia Gege.\u201dThis was the first time that Fang Juexia heard this guy, who was three years younger than him, actually call him \u2018Gege.\u2019In these two years, their lives appeared to have converged many times, but in fact, they had completely existed as two straight lines positioned at different coordinates on the same plane, without any intersections at all. Fang Juexia\u2019s temperament was always very placid, treating and regarding whatever kind of difficult person he ran into rather coolly. He did so because he believed that people always followed the basic rules of the animal kingdom, which were just projections of the laws laid down by nature for all living creatures.But Pei Tingsong was an exception.He was an incendiary, explosive, and completely uncertain factor.Fang Juexia maintained his habitual silence, while his eyes still openly and directly looked at Pei Tingsong. After a few seconds, he reached out to Pei Tingsong and neatened up his carelessly rumpled collar, just like a good Gege would do. That beautiful mouth didn\u2019t utter any words in the end; the corners of his mouth simply drew up, and he left.The group spent the next few days in planning meetings and in practice rooms, with the concept of their comeback still being a bit fuzzy. That lasted until Cheng Qiang made a joke in the middle of a meeting.\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult. If worst comes to worst, let\u2019s let Jiang Miao play the guzheng, Ziyan can DJ, and after they\u2019re done, Yiyi can wail a bit, and then Juexia and Lu Yuan can come dance while Xiao Pei raps.\u201dOriginally, it was just a joke, and everyone was busy laughing. They never thought that this \u2018joke\u2019 would be taken seriously by two of the people at the table.\u201cWait a minute.\u201d / \u201cI have an idea.\u201dFang Juexia and Pei Tingsong spoke simultaneously in one voice, and the meeting room went silent for a moment. Everyone was shocked speechless by this unprecedented tacit understanding between these two people, and the atmosphere in the room turned awkward for a bit.Just as everyone was waiting for them to explain further, the two of them once again fell silent, as though they were waging a contest against each other.Cheng Qiang knocked on the table with his knuckles. \u201cYou two are too funny. Alright\u00a0ba,\u00a0Lao Si, you talk first.\u201d\u201cBased on what criteria?\u201dKnowing that Pei Tingsong would definitely not be satisfied by this, Cheng Qiang just went along with him and said, \u201cThen you talk first.\u201d\u201c\u2026if I\u2019m going to talk, then I\u2019m going to talk.\u201d Pei Tingsong cleared his throat, and as he twirled the pen in his hand around and around, he said, \u201cFor the comeback, let us personally produce it.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t so much his idea, but his tone and the way he expressed it made it seem as if he were making an official announcement.Cheng Qiang rolled his sleeve and said, \u201cHey, you little punk\u2026\u201d\u201cI also approve of his idea.\u201dEveryone\u2019s heads turned together as they looked in the opposite direction at Fang Juexia.Ling Yi tilted his chair back and said to Lu Yuan in a small voice, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s strange\u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Lu Yuan nodded his head seriously, and his eyes kept flickering back and forth between the two people. \u201cWhy do I feel like the two of them make a good pair right now, what\u2019s going on with me?\u201dLing Yi rolled his eyes and quipped, \u201cYou\u2019ve eaten a poisonous\u00a0Gu.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t hear these comments his group members were making. He said, \u201cIn fact, the concept of the previous two albums also took a lot of thought, but their ultimate effect was rather tepid. Of course, it may be that we didn\u2019t properly digest and implement the concepts. So I thought,\u201d he looked at the boss with a sincere attitude and continued, \u201cthat instead of creating a new concept for us to adapt and digest, we should assume\u2026\u201dAs this math major graduate\u2019s aphorisms appeared again, all of his group members couldn\u2019t help laughing. Ling Yi directly went along with him and teased, \u201cWe should assume X, and obviously\u2026\u201dAs everyone laughed, Pei Tingsong took a sideways glance at him and saw that his pale neck had begun to grow red.Fang Juexia coughed and tried to drag the topic back to its original point. \u201cI meant to say, we should just cleanly throw out the past model and get everyone to participate in the creation process of this album. As Qiang Ge said, everyone has something they are good at. Although it can\u2019t be guaranteed that the effect will be a simple summing up of all our abilities, some sparks will definitely get kicked up during the fusion process, won\u2019t they?\u201dHe very seldom spoke this much, so he seemed even more serious while saying this.Chen Zhengyun was a little surprised but still nodded. \u201cGive me a clear-cut idea.\u201d\u201cChinese classical folk music with electronic music.\u201d Pei\u00a0 Tingsong stopped twirling the pen in his hand and explained, \u201cThis isn\u2019t something new, but you won\u2019t find it\u00a0 flooded with many boy-bands either. Miao Ge\u2019s guzheng can be used as the pluck or lead. Take\u00a0trap music\u00a0as an example, the low pitch of the bass with the clear sounds of the guzheng should create a very good sense of space. Add in some catchy drum sets, and I think it would make for some great dance music.\u201d(These are all popularized terms)His idea quickly won the approval of electronic music producer He Ziyan. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about this problem before. To tell you the truth, I still have several demos in my hand that I created based on this idea, with trap and\u00a0future bass. Being non-mainstream and using the guzheng as the foundation of a\u00a0vaporwave\u00a0track will definitely be amazing. And since you can change the plucking of the guzheng, the rhythm can become very fast, which is very suitable for the buildup before the drop.\u201d He then looked at Jiang Miao. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201dJiang Miao smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting. If you guys really want to try, I\u2019ll give you another suggestion.\u201d He looked at Ling Yi and said, \u201cYiyi can try singing opera. You have a high voice, so if you hold it up there to go with both the folk music and the electronic music, it should make people break out in goosebumps.\u201d\u201cWith the captain saying that, I have a little to do now too, huh.\u201d Ling Yi rubbed his own arm. \u201cBut I have never tried that before. What about Juexia? Why don\u2019t you also try it?\u201dBefore Fang Juexia could even open his mouth, he heard Pei Tingsong say, \u201cHis voice has a more mixed feel, it\u2019s more suitable for the hook.\u201dLing Yi immediately naughtily teased, \u201cTch, tch, tch, finding yourself a hook so fast.\u201dHe Ziyan looked completely serious as he stated, \u201cThe hook is the soul of hip hop\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026. Soul~\u201d Lu Yuan also joined in. \u201cWatching those CP videos for the past two days has kind of gone to my head.\u201d\u201cGone to what head.\u201d Cheng Qiang knocked on Lu Yuan\u2019s head as he asked, \u201cWhat about the choreography?\u201dLing Yi immediately started imitating an artificial Northeastern accent, \u201cDon\u2019t strike his weirdo head.\u201d\u201cScram, you keep trying to learn it, but you still don\u2019t sound right. What weirdo head, it\u2019s the\u00a0crown of my head.\u201d Lu Yuan rolled his eyes, then became serious and said, \u201cYou guys have finally come to my home court. Choreography for a boyband needs to be both memorable and have dramatic tension. Since everyone has set the theme, I don\u2019t think we should try to insert too much traditional choreography into the performance. There are two kinds of live-styles we can use: one is the band version, where we play the guzheng live on the spot, while the other is singing and dancing live.\u201d\u201cThis is a good idea.\u201d Looking at the rush of inspiration everyone was experiencing, a smile appeared on Chen Zhengyun\u2019s face. \u201cAnything more?\u201d\u201cI have a suggestion\u00a0ha.\u201d Lu Yuan grinned and looked at Juexia as he proposed, \u201cThe part about making it memorable, we should let our Juexia take the reins for that.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgFang Juexia didn\u2019t understand his reasoning. \u201cMe?\u201d\u201cSince tradition and modernity are colliding together musically, some traditional elements to the choreography also have to be included\u00a0ah. A scene just flashed through my mind, in which Juexia was dancing classical Chinese dance. We only need a short solo dance to accompany the bridge in the middle, and if we can get that dance sequence captured in a long shot there, it will definitely be really amazing\u2026\u201dListening up to here, Pei Tingsong\u2019s mind unexpectedly and automatically proffered up an image. During the solo performance of the guzheng, a single beam of light was projected down onto the completely dark stage, only illuminating Fang Juexia. His waist bent down, his sleeves flicked up, and with a folding fan in his hands, his slender body stretched out, before twirling around. Through the silk fabric of his clothes, the light caressed the flexible lines of his muscles, just like the way moonlight skims over water.At the last pluck of the guzheng, his pointed toes landed on the ground, his fan unfolding in an instant, a touch of red extending beyond his eyes and brow.\u201cXiao Pei? Pei Tingsong\u2014\u201dCheng Qiang\u2019s voice pulled him out of his imagination. Pei Tingsong returned to his senses, looked up, and found that everyone was looking at him. \u201cWhat are you guys looking at me for?\u201d\u201cWhat were you thinking about that you got so engrossed into it?\u201d He Ziyan was already standing up and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go\u00a0ah, the meeting is over.\u201dSo fast.It was over in the duration of just one dance.\u201cHow about it? The idea I just suggested.\u201d Lu Yuan held Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cI remember you said that you had learned both classical dance and modern dance as a child.\u201dFang Juexia nodded and replied, \u201cI danced both as a child.\u201d\u201cAs a child?\u201d Ling Yi could always manage to insert himself into any conversation. \u201cJuexia, you\u2019ve also been trained in dance since you were a child? You\u2019ve never even mentioned that to us before.\u201dPei Tingsong walked behind them with his hands stuck in his pockets, and thought\u2014 let alone his childhood, when has this guy ever shared anything about his own experiences?\u201cEn.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes drifted down unconsciously. The white floor tiles in the corridor were glared under the reflected light, and one such bright tile reflected a stage. The man on the stage danced unhurriedly, with both ease and grace. Walking further, he saw his immature self standing beneath the stage, holding his mother\u2019s hand and looking up.[Mama, I\u2019m going to be like dad when I grow up!][Okay\u00a0ah, our baby will definitely be the best dancer, even better than your dad~]\u201cI learned it for a few years, and then I stopped.\u201d Fang Juexia raised his head, looked straight ahead, and walked to the elevator with everyone. His tone was calm, but he quickly continued speaking, seemingly in an effort to prevent anyone from asking any further questions, \u201cThe foundations should still be there, I can try.\u201dJiang Miao looked down to scrutinize his own hand. \u201cAiya, I also have to go back to my old career.\u201d Just as he said that, his right hand was seized by He Ziyan.He Ziyan made the motion of laying down beats and laughed as he said, \u201cGoing back to our old careers 2.0.\u201dLu Yuan said, \u201cThen you guys quickly make a demo\u00a0ah, I want to start choreographing now!\u201dLing Yi started fawning upon him, \u201cYuan Ge! Dalian hunk! I want a super handsome part!\u201dSeeing everyone get caught up in this bustle, Fang Juexia\u2019s heart filled with a warmth that he hadn\u2019t experienced in a long time. It was as if they had gone back to the time of their debut, the time when everyone had been working hard to advance towards their dreams and had been putting in their full effort to try and present the best stage they could\u2014 all except for one person.Glancing away from these people, he saw the metal wall of the elevator reflect Pei Tingsong\u2019s figure. His head was half-lowered, and looked as if he was lost in thought.In Fang Juexia\u2019s memory, Pei Tingsong had still been a 17-year-old child when he had arrived. In fact, he didn\u2019t have too many opinions on airbornes; in the end, he was a group member, so he would also get along with him normally.However, at that time, Pei Tingsong had really been too rebellious. Just because he had had a bad attitude one time during dance practice, Fang Juexia, who had never lost his temper before, came into conflict with him. That was the first time they had had a fight. When the two youths had started fighting, the people to the side couldn\u2019t even stop the fight.[Did you think I just wanted to come here to be some kind of idol? Practice, what practice?! I don\u2019t have anything to say to someone like you who spends all their effort into climbing higher and will do anything to get promoted!]Only after hearing this did Fang Juxia realize why the initially friendly Pei Tingsong had changed his attitude towards him.But he hadn\u2019t gotten angry at that moment, and had instead gone completely icy cool.[I hear you want to be a hip-hop singer.]As early as the day after Pei Tingsong had entered the company, everyone had heard that he had been forcibly sent back to China from the United States by his parents when he was just a teenager. Everyone had also heard that he had been carted off into a small company like Star Chart by his Jie probably because his family wanted to let him experience the muddy waters of the entertainment circle.Whether it was his original intentions or even the way he arrived here, all of it was totally different from the way the rest of them had bitterly worked to get here.[Dreams are the sort of things that can\u2019t be divided into high or low, but only realized or unrealized.]Fang Juexia had then loosened the hand that held him by his collar\u2014[I also have nothing to say to a childish and prejudiced person like you.]The trajectories of the lives of a paranoid person burdened with rumors and an arrogant and unbridled rebel should have run opposite to each other. However, under the influence of a strange series of events, they just happened to run into each other, and this encounter had turned into a troubling event that still hadn\u2019t been repaired even after two years.Neither one of them condescended to go and understand the other. Both were of the opinion that as long as they could keep a safe distance between them, they could always maintain a superficial peace.\u201cOh right, Miao Ge,\u201d Pei Tingsong said as they got out of the elevator, \u201cYou guys go practice first, I have to move.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re moving?\u201d Ling Yi\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cYou\u2019re moving back to the dorms, right?! Today?\u201dPei Tingsong nodded. \u201cTomorrow, Strong Ge has been urging me to do so for a long time. After all, we\u2019re going to be recording the group documentary soon.\u201dFang Juexia stared at Pei Tingsong\u2019s side profile. Coincidentally, he turned back and met his gaze at the same time. It was just like what had happened the second time they had formally met and again like that time when dealing with the \u201chidden rules\u201d. As soon as Pei Tingsong had found out about it, he had taken action. If it hadn\u2019t been for this, they would have probably continued to avoid one another, perhaps even until the day the group disbanded.Pei Tingsong laughed, gratuitously giving off a bratty feel. \u201cIt seems that not every Gege is welcoming me home\u00a0ah.\u201dIt was said that many killers liked to return to the scene of a crime in search of some kind of pleasurable sensation. Strangely, he had always thought that Pei Tingsong was such a person, but at this moment, his own simple and ordinary body seemed to be secreting some kind of pleasure-promoting neurotransmitters, making it seem as if he was looking forward to something.Now that the safe distance had been breached\u2014Those troubling matters were going to be tragically acted out again\u00a0ba.\u201cWelcome back.\u201d Fang Juexia smiled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5Chapter 5 \u2013 Anonymous PostTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksIf fjx hadn\u2019t been kicked out of AS, he would have been at the top of the most influential idol groups nowEver since they had made it onto the Hot Search list because of the airport video, the conversation about them online had never stopped. Cheng Qiang found Fang Juexia and asked him to promote things on his own Weibo as well.In fact, everyone in Kaleido had started doing things like promoting on Weibo from the time they had debuted. With the popularity Fang Juexia had already garnered and the support of their senior brother idol group, the initial response hadn\u2019t been bad. Just when everyone thought that they could just coast on the favorable east wind created by their senior brother idol group, an anonymous post had suddenly appeared in the forums, titled\u2014 [If fjx hadn\u2019t been kicked out of AS, he would have been at the\u00a0top\u00a0of the most influential idol groups now\u00a0ba, it\u2019s really true that scandals can hurt you].The author of the post claimed to be a former AStar trainee, and he told the whole story in vivid detail.[fjx entered AS as a dancer. Let alone his ability, just his face completely outstripped that of others. A high-leveled person (but not a top boss) took a liking to him, and he was kept by that person for a while. However, I don\u2019t know why, but later on, he had a public quarrel with that person, slammed the door, and left (many trainees know about this matter), and then he was expelled from the company the next day. At that time, there had been less than half a year left before the debut of 7L. On the surface, he had even been slated for the center position in the group, the teaser had already been filmed, and the debut song had already been recorded. I don\u2019t know why he went to look for trouble. Now that he has debuted, isn\u2019t he still fighting with 7L? Oh, no, such a disgrace, he just doesn\u2019t fit with that muddled K group.]7L was the nickname for \u201cSeven Luminaries\u201c, AStar\u2019s seven-man boyband. Because it was a seeded group created by a large company, many people paid close attention to it even in its early stages of formation. It had a smooth sailing debut, exploding in popularity and gaining numerous fans very quickly. Seven Luminaries launched a year earlier than Kaleido, but because of the circumstances surrounding Fang Juexia\u2019s special training experience, the two groups that had completely different starting lines were now linked together, and so they started being compared against each other.[Was fjx that high-handed? Even a predetermined center position can get kicked out, that\u2019s going pretty far\u00a0ah.][To tell you the truth, comparing K to 7L is like\u00a0comparing the moon to porcelain. 7L is a top idol group created by a legitimate major corporation, where everyone keeps striving for the top. How can a pheasant-like group from a small company even have the gall to compare themselves to 7L?][Like a cooked duck flying. But to tell the truth, his face really can play, his appearance level as an idol reaches all the way up to the ceiling. If I were a golden boss, I would also take him as a sugar baby. The face of 7L right now is really just like the faces of passers-by. What\u2019s more, fjx\u2019s pink birthmark is really too seductive. An abstinent, beautiful drama queen would also be quite delicious, but unfortunately. they went with some kind of abstinent iceberg-faced character for his debut. It\u2019s boring.][Reasonably guessing, it may be that fjx\u00a0opened his mouth like a lion\u00a0and pissed off the high-leveled person so much that he told him to scram. How many true loves are there really\u00a0ah,\u00a0men are all the same, they get tired of someone once they have them. Even if they had gotten an immortal, it would be of no use.][The group is really chaotic. Having one member being an airborne is fine, but now, even the only member who had the background of being a genuine trainee has now been exposed in a sex scandal. Unpopular K really will never be able to make a turn-around like this.][Hahahaha, how everyone here has silently agreed that it was a male high-level executive who was keeping fjx\u00a0ah\u00a0hhhhh][About to die from laughter, fjx, this kind of hype about yourself is pretty good\u00a0ah. In the future, you can bind yourself to 7L and happily suck on their blood for a lifetime.][Will an explosive video get leaked soon\u00a0ah? I feel like this matter has someone big moving behind it]\u2026.This explosive post was pinned to the front page, and hung there for several days. Other social networks also spread it around while chattering about it endlessly, and other media-related marketing account Weibos tirelessly forwarded it around as well.On the third day after this post was published, even part of an audio recording that Fang Juexia had done for the Seven Luminaries debut before he had left AS was leaked. His voice was so special that no one could mistake it for being anyone else\u2019s. This leaked recording directly confirmed the fact that the author of the post had once been a reserve member for the Seven Luminaries\u2019 debut, which made this discussion about \u201chidden rules\u201d turn more and more intense.Even when Star Chart later issued a legal notice and published an announcement trying to clarify this so-called \u201chidden rules\u201d scoop, it didn\u2019t help.The cost for spreading rumors online was terrifyingly low\u2014the speaker only needed to move a finger, and the listener would only believe what he or she was willing to believe. Everyone loves dogblood gossip and tends to be hooked by news of beautiful wastes of skin getting involved in dirty deals. No one cared about any truth that was being revealed by a person new to the fray.Kaleido lost several endorsements back then, and their performances were also canceled. Many \u201cpassers-by\u201d summed up this situation as both a success and failure for Fang Juexia.He originally hadn\u2019t been afraid of anything, but this sentence had stabbed him hard.But at that time, his teammates and the company didn\u2019t give up on him, and he also didn\u2019t want to give up. This kind of scandal was very personal, and not many people would take the initiative to confirm the exact details of what had happened with him. However, his group members tried very considerately to avoid this topic. They didn\u2019t seem to care whether the post was true or not, but just wanted to keep safeguarding the group. So, Fang Juexia had just distanced himself from all social networks and had given the company full responsibility over his accounts.It was kind of funny now; Fang Juexia, who didn\u2019t even have any Weibo side accounts at that time, had by now pretty much given up on all social networks, and contacted everyone either through text messages or phone calls. Ling Yi often complained that he was like a village devoid of the Internet, always lagging behind on the latest news.Although this method was clumsy and dumb, it also allowed Fang Juexia to slowly come around. His thought process was very simple, which was that he would keep proceeding forward on the path he had chosen, no matter the cost he had to pay while traversing it. He was just like a tree whose only goal was to grow higher. Even if his branches and leaves were pruned, or his branches were cut off, as long as he kept striving for the high skies, everything would be fine.However, it really wasn\u2019t an easy matter to persuade Fang Juexia to return to social networks now.\u201cCan\u2019t Xiao Wen help me promote things?\u201dXiao Wen was the group\u2019s assistant. He was usually the one who took Cheng Qiang\u2019s place and helped to smooth certain relationships out, across the various levels of staff they worked with, using money. However, he had recently taken a vacation and gone home.\u201cYou can\u2019t always let Xiao Wen take your place. How\u2019s this, you download Weibo first, login into your account, and then read the fan\u2019s messages\u00a0ah.\u201d At the other end of the call, it seemed as if Cheng Qiang had been called over by someone else again. \u201cHey, I can\u2019t talk any longer, I have to go to work.\u201dHe hung up the call. Fang Juexia sat in front of the mirror in the training room, and held the cellphone for a long time, before finally downloading Weibo again.At this time, the door of the training room was pushed open, and Ling Yi darted in, actually holding an ice-cream cone in his hand and calling out, \u201cJuexia!\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s natural disposition was to be a bit slow, so before he could react, Ling Yi had already caught sight of his cellphone screen.\u201cYou\u2019re going back onto Weibo!\u201dAs a result, Fang Juexia, who had planned to do some psychological preparation for a while before jumping back into Weibo, was half-forced into logging onto his account again just like that, with everyone egging him on.To be honest, his heart was beating obviously fast; it seemed that even after this long, he could still get nervous. He could almost clearly recall that period\u2014 whenever he went online, he would be bombarded by the curses ringing out everywhere, and the words in the various comments would jitter before his eyes, just like a swarm of wildly dancing bees.\u201cEh, it froze.\u201d Ling Yi\u2019s voice brought him back to reality.Jiang Miao once again tapped on the Weibo icon to open up the app which had crashed and thus had exited out of that account on its own. \u201cMaybe there are too many notifications in the cache?\u201dThe Weibo interface opened again, and sure enough, proved their captain\u2019s conjecture right. The notification interface was a sea of red, and there were countless comments and unsolicited private messages piled up into a heap.He Ziyan said with a laugh, \u201cXiao Wen only took three days off, and the notifications are already about to explode. It seems that the popularity gained from Juexia Ge\u2019s Hot Search is truly real.\u201d\u201cQuickly check and see what they have written.\u201d Lu Yuan\u2019s head directly propped itself right in front of Fang Juexia, crowding into that space in such a way that Ling Yi had no space anymore.\u201cHey, hey, hey, buddy, you\u2019re rubbing off some of my ice cream!\u201dHolding his small cellphone, Fang Juexia took a deep breath and clicked open the comments section.[AHHHHHHHH JUEXIA GEGE I\u2019M HERE!!! I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late! The Hot Search made me so happy! It let me find this immortal little Gege!][Watched your dance clip at station B! It\u2019s really intense! It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve become a fan of an idol group!][Why are\u00a0you\u00a0so good-looking, even your birthmark is a huge plus! Goddess\u00a0Nuwa\u00a0carved you out meticulously, while I\u2019m just a little pile of mud\u00a055555][I want to see a fresh selfie of you! Begging you, save us children\u00a0ba!][Adding my ID number to wanting to see selfies! I feel like Gege\u2019s Weibo is full of advertisements, and contains nothing about his daily life. I want to see regular life updates!][Ge, do you know how special your voice is? It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve run into and admired such a cool young voice that isn\u2019t greasy or artificial at all, one that also carries its own reverberation and an ethereal feel to it. It\u2019s so great, wuwuwu voice fan is crying like crazy!! You are the true\u00a0voice rogue! Can you go to more singing programs in the future\u00a0ah,\u00a0live singing is also okay!][jxgg, I just started liking you recently, because I thought you looked pretty good when I saw you on the Hot Search list, and when I searched some more, I ended up entering your fan circle. Seeing your previous performances and variety shows, it\u2019s like I\u2019ve really discovered a treasure! I feel like I came in too late wuwuwu, sorry Gege!]This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org[When will you return\u00a0ya,\u00a0I miss Gege! Our K group has to do well\u00a0ah!][It\u2019s nearly New Year\u2019s. I wish that Juexia Gege will be safe and healthy this year and will have his own stage.]Upon seeing this sentence, Fang Juexia\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but tremble.There were endless comments, countless words containing praise and encouragement, as well as reams and reams of private messages. These little girls, who were total strangers, were like skylarks that had come out of nowhere, chirping cutely towards him as they flew over and drowned him in soft pleasure.\u201cLet\u2019s take a picture together\u00a0ba!\u201d Ling Yi proposed.Fang Juexia immediately supported this proposal but soon realized that they were missing one person, and so subconsciously raised his head and looked around. Jiang Miao quickly realized the meaning behind his subtle movements, and then said with a smile, \u201cI have a backstage group photo of us from when we participated in that Hor D\u2019oeuvres concert. Xiao Wen took a pretty good picture. Should I send it to you?\u201dA little surprised at Jiang Miao\u2019s understanding and his subtle thoughts, Fang Juexia nodded.At this time, if he posted a selfie containing only the five of them, it would definitely create a line of discussion divergent to their narrative, even if the simple truth behind the matter was that that specific person just happened to not be present at that time with the rest of them.\u201cYou download WeChat again\u00a0ba.\u201d He Ziyan said, \u201cOr the captain will have to send you an email.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThus, under Ling Yi\u2019s instigation, Fang Juexia once again downloaded all the social platform apps he had previously deleted one by one. He logged into WeChat and saved the photo Jiang Miao had sent into his phone.The six of them were dressed in costumes of the same color, and had gathered backstage for a touch-up. His face just happened to be facing the camera, and Pei Tingsong could be seen behind him. His face was turned to the side, and he was letting the stylist tidy up his coat, a rare occurrence of him looking smartly well-behaved.After pondering for a while, he couldn\u2019t think of any good captions to post along with the picture. He was really unfamiliar with this kind of thing, so Fang Juexia just uploaded the photo by itself in the end.This photo took on the form of a newly opened window for Fang Juexia. The spring breeze blew in, and he was once again knocked down and submerged into a sea of small skylarks that blotted out the sky.Cute things really did engender cheer in people.\u201cWow, it\u2019s only been a few minutes and it\u2019s already broken through 10,000 forwards.\u201d Ling Yi was a little surprised; none of their posts had ever achieved such a\u00a0 level this quick before. \u201cYou\u2019ve really become a trending person, Juexia.\u201dHe was just about to deny it when Lu Yuan interceded, \u201cYou didn\u2019t see the reaction to Xiao Pei\u2019s last Weibo post. There were so many comments there, and it got popular to the point that even the rest of us got more followers.\u201dHe Ziyan held Ling Yi\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cWhether or not it\u2019s trending, put that aside for now. You have to record the demo with me first.\u201d Then he looked at the group leader. \u201cMiao Ge, you bring the qin\u00a0ba.\u201dJiang Miao nodded and told Lu Yuan, \u201cQiang Ge just informed me that your dance teacher will be arriving soon. Go to the 10th floor and wait for him\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Lu Yuan grabbed his clothes and shook them out. \u201cWork has started\u00a0la.\u201dLooking at everyone getting busy with impending work, Fang Juexia asked, half a beat too slow, \u201cWhat about me? Am I going to record with Ziyan, or am I going with Yuan Ge?\u201dBut both of them refused him because they didn\u2019t need him at the moment.\u201cThere\u2019s a place that actually really needs your presence.\u201d The droop to Jiang Miao\u2019s eyes became more obvious as he smiled and said, \u201cYou have to go back to the dormitory. They told us that the production team is going to come over to install cameras, so help everyone by taking a look\u00a0ba.\u201dThus, in the end, Fang Juexia was allotted the most leisurely job and went home to take a rest.After a bath, he changed into pajamas and pulled his slightly long hair into a short ponytail, one which looked a bit like an apple stalk. After returning to the room and taking his daily dose of vitamins, Fang Juexia took out a thick Sudoku book, turned to a page that he hadn\u2019t done yet, sat down at the desk with a pen in his hand, and thought carefully.Just after Fang Juexia had finished three Sudoku puzzles in a row and was feeling extremely tranquil, he suddenly heard the doorbell to the dorm ring.Oh, no, the production team was here.Conscious that he was being negligent of his duties, Fang Juexia immediately put down the Sudoku book and stepped into his slippers, quickly hurrying to go open the door. Every time he played Sudoku, he would get immersed in his own little world. Hearing the doorbell ring persistently now, he could wager a good guess at the amount of time the other party had been pressing the button for.Without looking at the monitoring screen of the security camera installed at the door, Fang Juexia anxiously ran out onto the porch and opened the door. He was too busy apologizing to notice anything. \u201cMy\u2026\u201dHowever, there was no production group on the other side of the door, and instead, standing there was Pei Tingsong, wearing a black down jacket and a black facemask, with his hand raised in the air, as if he was about to press the doorbell button again.The \u201cmy apologies\u201d that he had just been about to say was swallowed back down into his stomach.\u201cMy what?\u201d Pei Tingsong unconsciously raised his eyebrows, one hand pulling off his mask and stuffing it into his pocket as he asked, \u201cMy who?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 6Chapter 6 \u2013 Two People AloneTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksWho do you live with?Fang Juexia\u2019s surprised expression cleared up bit by bit, like water gradually growing still again after the ripples dispersed.\u201cNo one,\u201d He replied simply.\u201cYou\u2019re the only one here?\u201d Pei Tingsong glanced inside, his body permeated with the cold air from the outside. \u201cThe moving company is downstairs and will bring the things up in a moment.\u201dFang Juexia, who had frozen mid-way through opening the door, let go of the door only after hearing that and said, \u201cOh\u2026\u201d Then he remembered that the other party hadn\u2019t entered the room yet, so he moved up a step and asked, \u201cIs there a lot?\u201dHe also wanted to ask if he needed help, but it felt as if this question had gotten stuck in his throat. He could neither swallow it down nor ask it out loud.The warmth of the house gushed out into the corridor, and Pei Tingsong plucked off his hat as he replied, \u201cNot much.\u201d He glanced at Fang Juexia\u2019s snow-white soft pajamas and seemed to have guessed the direction of Fang Juexia\u2019s thoughts. \u201cGo in\u00a0ba. With you wearing this little, you\u2019ll freeze to death if you go down.\u201dThese weren\u2019t words that souded any good, but at least now he wouldn\u2019t have to go out. Fang Juexia was quite satisfied with this outcome.After a while, the sound of the elevator doors opening could be heard, and the movers quickly brought in Pei Tingsong\u2019s luggage. Fang Juexia tidied up the living room, where the games his bandmates had played yesterday had been left strewn about, so that he could make some room for the movers.After doing that, he got himself a cup of hot tea, and holding it, leaned against a wall, and watched them. Altogether, they brought in five big cardboard boxes. Observing the way they put down the boxes, he guessed that each box was pretty heavy.Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help but be curious about the things that Pei Tingsong had brought in.\u201cHave troubled you guys,\u201d Pei Tingsong thanked them politely.Just as he was about to send them away, Fang Juexia suddenly called out to them and stopped them, then poured a cup of hot tea for each of the three big uncles. Without saying anything, he handed it directly to them.\u201cThank you, thank you.\u201d Huffing and puffing, the three big uncles hastily took the tea. After drinking it, their chests and hearts both felt nice and warm, and they were smiling and laughing as they left.The production team that had been arranged hadn\u2019t arrived yet, so the only two people left in the dormitory were him and Pei Tingsong. Over the past two years, this kind of one-on-one time with just the two of them was almost zilch, which was somewhat embarrassing. He stared at the big boxes as if they were also staring back at him.\u201cI\u2019ll show you your room.\u201d Fang Juexia finally managed to think of something to say. He walked around him in his slippers, and only when he got to the door did he remember that He Ziyan would usually lock the door. He was worried and decided to give it a try, so it was unexpected when it opened.He Ziyan knew that Pei Tingsong would be coming?\u201cI\u2019m rooming with Ziyan Ge?\u201d Pei Tingsong was standing behind him, and was carrying a cardboard box to bring into the room.\u201cEn.\u201d Fang Juexia moved to let him in. The room was quite large, and as soon as one entered through the door, they would see a large workbench with several display screens and midi percussion pads on it. Going around it, on another table, was a DJ mixer board. This really was Ziyan\u2019s room. There was plenty of sunshine shining in, and the area next to the window was empty, with only a solid wood bed there that hadn\u2019t been made. Pei Tingsong put down the cardboard box and touched the bookshelf being used to divide up the room.\u201cWho do you live with?\u201d He asked suddenly.Fang Juexia froze for two seconds before answering, \u201cYiyi.\u201dHe thought that if Miao Ge or Yiyi had been here right now, they might have taken Pei Tingsong around to familiarise him with the environment. However, it just so happened that he was the only one here, and he wasn\u2019t clear on what to do. Should he take Pei Tingsong around for a tour of the dormitory, or should he remain silent and help him move his things in, or should he just ignore him and go back to his room?The last option was too cold, even if Fang Juexia really wanted to do so.He could just do so.Fang Juexia had started to take a step away, wanting to go, but who would have known that Pei Tingsong would suddenly open his mouth\u2014\u201cI want to see the other rooms.\u201d He took off his coat and put it on the empty bed, and he was wearing a very-soft looking gray sweater underneath.Forget it, after all, they were both in the same group.\u201cEn,\u201d said Fang Juexia, then turned around and went out. Pei Tingsong kept his eyes pinned on this person. His back was covered with a snow-white fuzzy sweater, and his neck was long; when specifically looking at him from the side or the back, he looked just like a lone little swan. This surprised him, probably because he had never seen the way Fang Juexia was at home. Devoid of any makeup and wrapped up in a soft coat\u2014it seemed that he had lost some of that cold aura he usually rediated so that no one may either approach or look at him closely.\u201cThis is Miao Ge and Yuan Ge\u2019s room.\u201d When Fang Juexia opened the door, the room looked very cramped. There was a stack of guqin music scores piled up on the shelf near the door, and a guqin was placed by the window. Back then, the captain had taken the initiative in choosing the smallest room, which also only contained a bunk bed. However, it turned out that Lu Yuan also liked to sleep in bunk beds, feeling that sleeping high up in the top bunk was very nice.He didn\u2019t know how to explain their surroundings well, so he simply stayed silent. He took Pei Tingsong out of the room and then led him to take a turn around the living room and the open-plan kitchen. Fang Juexia said dryly, \u201cThat\u2019s basically it.\u201dWho knew that at this moment, Pei Tingsong would lean against the kitchen counter and ask, \u201cWhat about your room?\u201dFang Juexia blinked slowly, then as if acquiescing to this request, he turned around and guided him to his own room.After all, they now lived together. If he didn\u2019t see it today, he would inevitably see it tomorrow.Pei Tingsong felt this was interesting; he had thought that Fang Juexia would refuse. After all, he had always refused him, but now, he agreed to let him breach his private space so easily. Today\u2019s Fang Juexia seemed to be particularly easy to pick on.But the guy wearing pajamas just opened the door and didn\u2019t go inside. From outside the room, he politely introduced, \u201cThis room.\u201dPei Tingsong definitely wouldn\u2019t miss this opportunity to invade his territory. He stepped in without saying a word, which led to Fang Juexia losing control of the situation, leaving him the only option of passively following him from behind.This room was more distinct than he had imagined, with a row of wardrobes separating the two sides. The area facing the door was filled with all kinds of ornaments. The bedding had a\u00a0Minion\u00a0pattern printed on it, and there was also a row of Minion dolls lined up on the head of the bed. Ling Yi was, famously, a Minion fan.Pei Tingsong walked further into the room, and the area on the other side of the wardrobes was an extreme opposite to the front of the room. It looked very empty, with the only furniture being a combined wooden bookshelf and desk, two or three light gray cabinets, and a bed. A folded square shaped quilt lay on top of the dark blue bed, all very clean and meticulous.He searched his mind for an appropriate adjective to describe this scene, but realized that the most appropriate description that could be used was the owner himself\u2014This was all very Fang Juexia.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to see in my room.\u201dHe could sense that Fang Juexia\u2019s tone had begun to sound a little defensive. Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help it as the corners of his mouth quirked up, and then he walked up to the desk. His gaze was drawn to the huge Sudoku book that lay on it.\u201cDo you like Sudoku?\u201dFang Juexia walked over, stuck a pen in to bookmark the unfinished page, and closed it. \u201cWhen I\u2019m bored, I play a bit.\u201dThis surprised Pei Tingsong a bit, but as his gaze moved upwards, more unexpected things continued to appear in his line of sight.\u201cThe Unity of Mathematics.\u201d He drew closer and looked closely at the books on the shelf.It wasn\u2019t just \u201cThe Unity of Mathematics\u201d, but also \u201cLectures on Riemann Surfaces\u201d, \u201cFunctional Analysis\u201d, \u201cMorse Theory\u201d, and another dozen or so mathematics textbooks, all in the same vein.In fact, Fang Juexia\u2019s embarrassment had already reached its peak, but due to an emotional delay, his tone was still calm as he answered, \u201cObviously, I studied mathematics.\u201d\u201cYes, I almost forgot.\u201d Pei Tingsong remembered that Ling Yi and the others had mentioned this and had also joked about it before by saying that Fang Juexia had more homework in college than in high school. He also remembered Fang Juexia\u2019s inborn talent for mathematics, even though he had just seen the tip of that iceberg every once in a while during some popular variety shows.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Fang Juexia reached out and tried to pull him away, grasping his wrist tightly, exactly like how Pei Tingsong had caught hold of his before.His fingers were very long, but much softer than Pei Tingsong had imagined, and they were warm as they gently encircled his cold wrist.\u201cLet\u2019s go and arrange your things.\u201dObviously, this sentence carried a commanding tone, but Pei Tingsong could hear a slight request embedded in it.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgIn fact, he was very curious about what kind of reaction Fang Juexia would show if he continued to stay here, in total opposition to his wishes. However, he could feel that Fang Juexia\u2019s tolerance had already reached its limits. Even if he wanted to have fun with him, he would have to take it slow.Pei Tingsong wasn\u2019t sure whether this aura of coldness and indifference that Fang Juexia exuded at all times was actually real, or just a fake character he was acting out. Maybe Fang Juexia was the type of person who would sell his body for opportunities like they said, and because his desires were too obvious, he had to cover it up by playing an abstinent character. If so, then his acting skills were really too sophisticated. Pei Tingsong was really curious, to the extent that he even started wondering why he hadn\u2019t found it so interesting to interact with him in the past.But Fang Juexia\u2019s shell was both cold and hard, and pretty much grew right on top of his skin, so just peeling it off would be simply too cruel.Thus, Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t continue tangling with him, and let the other person drag him out of the room.Once they reached the cardboard boxes, Fang Juexia naturally loosened his hold on Pei Tingsong\u2019s wrist and rolled up the sleeves of his pajama top, thus revealing a small section of his pale forearms. He helped move a big box into the room and realised that it was really terribly heavy. Only when Pei Tingsong opened up the box did he find out that it was full of books.Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t let him move any more boxes, and just told him that he could help him arrange his books on the bookshelf. Fang Juexia pulled out and carried several books in his hands and asked him how he wanted them placed, whether in alphabetical order or by year. Who would have known that Pei Tingsong would heedlessly say, \u201cHowever.\u201dHowever. Fang Juexia repeated this word in his heart,\u00a0 then he started arranging the books in his hands one by one. He didn\u2019t arrange on the basis of the year of publication or the title, but rather on the color shades of the book covers.Pei Tingsong moved the rest of his things in, then started opening them up and arranging them on the side. He had brought only four large boxes as his moving-in luggage, with only one of them containing his daily necessities, while the rest were full of books.\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring any clothes?\u201d Fang Juexia had stepped onto a chair to arrange books on the top-most shelf, and he asked this as he stepped off of it.\u201cI don\u2019t live far away, we\u2019ll see later\u00a0ba.\u201d Pei Tingsong said as he sat cross legged on the ground, setting books into the bottom-most shelf.They organized the books in silence just in this manner, one shelf per person, until they filled up the entire previously-empty bookshelf. Fang Juexia felt an inexplicable sense of achievement,\u00a0 even though the books weren\u2019t his, nor was this bookshelf.\u201cWhat about the rest?\u201d He asked questions much like a child.Pei Tingsong gathered up a few hardback multi-volume works, stepped onto a stool, placed them on the top of the bookshelf, and then stacked them into piles. He clapped his hands and said, \u201cDone.\u201dHe had grown up in the United States. Even though he had always been studying Chinese and had even lived in China for several years now, some of his habitual English expressions would still appear from time to time.Fang Juexia stood in front of the bookshelf and saw that the finished product, which they had put together, gave off a strange feeling of having different layers. The colors of the book-spines on the first layer went from light to deep, while the colors on another layer had no pattern whatsoever.\u201cMeditations on First Philosophy\u201c, \u201cCritique of Pure Reason\u201c, \u201cEthics\u201c, \u201cThe World as Will and Representation\u201c\u2026. He looked at the books on the bookshelf and found that they were all reading material beyond his knowledge.It turned out that Pei Tingsong studied philosophy.He only knew that Pei Tingsong had originally been studying in the United States. Like any young dandy who was going to inherit his family business, he had studied business management. However, he had later dropped out without approval and had applied to another liberal arts and science college, and it seemed that he had chosen to study a major that his parents hadn\u2019t agreed to. And then, because he had been drawn into the underground hip-hop circle, his elders simply sent him back to China.But why enter the entertainment industry, and moreso, why come to such a small company? These were questions whose answers could only be speculated about, because Pei Tingsong\u2019s coming and goings were uncertain and mysterious. All that everyone knew was that he finally tested into P University as an international student, and then refused to live in the group dorms by saying that he had to go to school. Anyway, they didn\u2019t have many public events, so normally, he would just pretty much go to school.Now that he thought about it, their lives really had no intersection, aside from work.\u201cPretty much done now.\u201dHe saw Pei Tingsong move the stool away, and he wanted to help, but as soon as he lowered his head, he bumped into the bookcase. He felt something shaking, and before he could react, he was dragged forcefully over to the side, which threw his body off-balance, and he nearly fell over.A succession of thuds sounded out against the ground, and now, there were several thick books spread out upside down on the floor.It was at this point that the hand holding\u00a0 his arm tightly released its grasp. Fang Juexia turned his head and saw that Pei Tingsong\u2019s other hand was covering his right eye, and he suddenly realized what had happened. \u201cAlright\u00a0ba? You\u2014did your eye get hit?\u201dPei Tingsong didn\u2019t let go of his eye, instead shaking his head continuously like a child, before sitting on the hard bed and burying his head in his arms.\u201cI caused that to happen, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s guilt suddenly welled up. He remembered that it had been him just now who had lowered his head and hit the bookcase. Pei Tingsong must have come over and pulled him away before getting hit.\u201cDon\u2019t try to put\u00a0feathers in your own cap,\u201d Pei Tingsong pushed his hand away as he argued, \u201cIt was me who wanted to put the books up there.\u201dAfter saying that, he murmured in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, every day it\u2019s I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t listen to him at all. \u201cLet me have a look.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d He suddenly grew wayward again.After going up against each other in such a way, Pei Tingsong thought that Fang Juexia was just saying that sentence for show, but what he didn\u2019t know was that Fang Juexia was terribly stubborn. He kept repeating this sentence like a robot.\u201cLet me see.\u201dBut after all, he had failed to become a hero and had instead gotten hurt himself. His self-esteem had suffered a slight set-back, so he was even more awkward when making a compromise. \u201cThen you go get me a band aid.\u201d Having said that, he stressed again, \u201cJust a band aid is enough, okay, a band aid.\u201dHowever, it seemed as if Fang Juexia\u2019s ears had become blocked as he ran out with a\u00a0dundundun\u00a0sound. When he came back, he was carrying the whole first-aid kit, and it clattered against the headboard of the bed when he put it down.Pei Tingsong looked at the box in front of him, then looked at Fang Juexia.This wasn\u2019t a little swan, this was a goose.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 7Chapter 7 \u2013 Ensemble LivestreamTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksHello everyone, we are Kaleido!\u201cI said it\u2019s just a little scrape, what are you mobilizing all your forces for?\u201dIt seemed as if Fang Juexia was unable to hear him, and the expression on his face seemed to have congealed from the start. In fact, when he had run out to fetch the first-aid kit just now, he had even imagined the scene of him rushing Pei Tingsong into the emergency room. There were just the two of them in the dormitory right now, and what would he do if an unexpected misfortune befell Pei Tingsong? He wouldn\u2019t be able to explain it clearly, and things that couldn\u2019t be explained clearly were the most troublesome.Even if no unexpected misfortune befell Pei Tingsong, if his appearance was ruined because of this incident, Fang Juexia would still not be able to escape that responsibility for it. However you put it, they all depended on their faces to earn a living to a certain extent.Fang Juexia opened the medicine box immediately after fetching it. Although Pei Tingsong kept covering half his face with his hands and was not letting him do anything, he still went ahead and took out a cotton swab, dipped it into the iodine solution, and then reached out to his face with it.\u201cAre you doing some sort of patient-nurse roleplay?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked a little angrily, not bothering to cover up his face anymore, and instead grabbed that hand holding the cotton swab in front of his face.He was also slightly dazed. After saying those words, he actually went ahead and really imagined Fang Juexia acting out this kind of role-playing scene with some unknown boss. However, in this two-person scenario that he imagined, he could only see Fang Juexia\u2019s face.Originally, because Fang Juexia had wanted to help him deal with the wound quickly, he had leaned over quite a bit, so now their faces were really much too close to each other\u2019s.Pei Tingsong could smell the fragrance of the shower gel Fang Juexia had used on his body. The soft smell of milk mixed with a hint of bitter herbs wafted up from the side of his pale neck, and like threads of soft yarn, fluttered across Pei Tingsong\u2019s face.\u201cIt\u2019s bleeding.\u201d Fang Juexia stared at the corner of his eye. His voice contained a slight surprise, and even his cold eyes had widened a bit, which made it seem as if he had been infused with life, and his whole cold person had become enlivened as he said, \u201cAlmost hit your temple.\u201dIt was actually a really serious injury. The area where the corner of the hardcover book had hit was very dangerous, being between the corner of his eye and his temple; a slight amount of carelessness could have led to an even more serious injury. Blood had welled out of that spot, and two drops had landed on his sweater before disappearing into its fibers.Fang Juexia\u2019s wrist was being held very tightly by Pei Tingsong. He turned his wrist around, trying to break free from the other\u2019s grasp, and his protruding carpal bone rubbed into Pei Tingsong\u2019s palm.When he lifted his eyes in response to this struggle, he caught a glimpse of Fang Juexia\u2019s slightly pursed lips. The bow of his lips had sunk into his soft lower lip, which gave the misconception of him being both stubborn and delicate to most people.Pei Tingsong let go of his hand and quickly sobered up his thoughts. The person in front of him wasn\u2019t delicate at all, but was just born with the kind of face that made people come up with misconceptions about it.Fang Juexia acquiesced to the resistance being put forth by this devil incarnate, so he simply wiped off the blood on his face and then handed him an alcohol wipe, saying, \u201cWipe the blood on your hands by yourself.\u201dHe had been dancing for many years, and injuries were common fare in this field, so he was also used to resolving them by himself. After becoming a trainee, he had begun to help his friends in dealing with minor injuries, so this didn\u2019t count as anything new. However, Fang Juexia had unexpectedly discovered that if he observed Pei Tingsong by drawing closer to him, then this person seemed to look different than he usually did.He was the one who looked the most aggressive in the entire band. His facial bones were so defined that it gave off the feeling that he was a mixed-blood. In addition, his skin was also quite pale, which made him look even more like a person with mixed-blood, and so he had always been called the \u201cunofficial face of the band\u201d.Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes were long and narrow, his double eyelids were long and deep, the angle at which his eyebrows protruded over his eyes was deep, and there were two very light moles situated underneath the\u00a0curve of his right eye.\u00a0 Fang Juexia had never discovered any of this before, and only saw it now, after drawing so close to his face.It was this very pair of eyes that allowed both perversity and boyishness to coexist in harmony in Pei Tingsong\u2019s appearance, because his true smiles didn\u2019t originate from his lips, but from his eyes. If his eyes didn\u2019t smile, and he just hooked up the corners of his mouth, he looked very evil. But if his eyes were also smiling, then he looked very much like a child.\u201cHey, have you gone mute?\u201dFang Juexia stopped scanning his appearance, came back to his senses, and tore off a section of the medical bandages in his hands as he said, \u201cWood, ice, mute. Your description of me is starting to look more and more like a biological classification.\u201dHow strangely he talked, this nerd.\u201cYou\u2019re more lifeless than non-living things,\u201d He consciously said this, in a mean way, but Fang Juexia actually thanked him for it, which left him bereft of any way to retort.Pei Tingsong, like a broken recording, had been repeatedly saying the entire time that he could just stick a bandage on it, but Fang Juexia was just like a bad robot who didn\u2019t listen to any instructions, and used the best quality bandages on his wound. The movements of his hands were very light, and from time to time, the outer edge of his palm would gently press against Pei Tingsong\u2019s cheekbones, soft to the touch.The neckline of his sweater was too high and tight, so he couldn\u2019t breathe freely, and there was blood on the top of it too, so Pei Tingsong\u2019s desire to change out of it grew even more. The warm air seemed to bake the scent of Fang Juexia\u2019s shower-gel on his body, making it grow even richer and stronger. Pei Tingsong tried to glance over, but his gaze accidentally fell on the birthmark at the corner of the other\u2019s party\u2019s eye. It was such a small mark, but when he didn\u2019t put on any foundation, it looked even more pink and soft, and drew in all the color from his skin.This seemed to be the most vibrant part of Fang Juexia\u2019s body.\u201cEnough.\u201dPei Tingsong quickly shifted his gaze away, and then rubbed at the gauze placed at the corner of his eye.\u201cMaking a mountain out of a molehill,\u201d he said in a low voice.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t hear him clearly, so his hands paused for a moment as he was packing up the medical kit.He raised his head, his beautiful eyes widened slightly, looking not so-cold anymore, and instead showing a hint of muddled confusion.Pei Tingsong glanced at him and curtly said, \u201cDidn\u2019t say anything.\u201d He pulled at the collar of his sweater. \u201cI need to change clothes.\u201dFang Juexia had always ignored this kind of a \u2018Young Master\u2019 tone, so he just kept looking at him, and so these two people ended up looking at each other awkwardly.\u201cI didn\u2019t bring any clothes,\u201d Pei Tingsong continued.Fang Juexia was still looking at him, not moving even a bit to take any action.\u201cForget it.\u201d Pei Tingsong understood that he couldn\u2019t communicate with him, so he took out his cellphone to call He Ziyan. \u201cI\u2019ll take something of Yan Ge\u2019s.\u201dFang Juexia tidied up the medical kit and returned it to its original spot, only to discover that Pei Tingsong hadn\u2019t moved after he came back.\u201cHe didn\u2019t pick up,\u201d Pei Tingsong murmured, \u201cWhat is he doing\u2026\u201dFang Juexia, who was standing at the side, stared at the little spots of blood on his sweater. They had nearly dried, and it probably didn\u2019t feel good.\u201cI have a sweater that I\u2019ve only worn once. It\u2019s very big, and you should be able to wear it.\u201d Having said that, he quickly added, \u201cIf you want to wear it.\u201dPei Tingsong finally ended up acquiescing to this. It was a round-collared lavender gray sweater, with a long black frame printed on the chest, and with grayish-white words written inside it\u2014Melt for you.Melt for you.At this moment, Pei Tingsong began to imagine what this sweater would look like on Fang Juexia\u2019s body. It definitely wouldn\u2019t look ugly, but this phrase was too inconsistent and really didn\u2019t fit his style.He changed his clothes and came out. He had matched it with a pair of black overalls, so the overall style gave him a fresh air of youthfulness.\u201cJust right.\u201d Pei Tingsong pulled at the cuffs of his sleeves. In fact, Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t short; his stature of\u00a01.8 meters\u00a0also counted as being absolutely tall in the boy band, but it was just that Pei Tingsong was too good at growing. When he had entered the band as an airborne, he was still in the midst of his growing stage, but even at that time, he had\u00a0 already reached a height of\u00a0184 cm. He had then made another leap, and now was already\u00a0188 cm, which made him the tallest in the entire band.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t make a sound, simply taking the sweater he had changed out of, and putting it into the washing machine. He was pondering by himself on how he could go back to his room alone without seeming too cold or indifferent.He was just hesitating on what to do when a voice called out from the direction of the door.\u201cJuexia!\u201dHe walked into the living room and saw that everyone had returned. He Ziyan was carrying two boxes of fried chicken in his hands, and as soon as he came in, he bumped his shoulder against Pei Tingsong\u2019s shoulder and greeted, \u201cHey, bro.\u201dReal\u00a0ABC\u00a0Xiao Pei used Chinese to reply, \u201cI just called you, but you didn\u2019t answer.\u201d\u201cReally? Let me see.\u201dLing Yi rushed over, bitterly embracing Fang Juexia and complaining, \u201cTwo Fire\u00a0isn\u2019t letting me eat fried chicken.\u201dHe Ziyan turned his cellphone on while his voice carried some ridicule as he replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not me, it\u2019s the flesh on your stomach that prevented you first.\u201dLu Yuan and Jiang Miao walked into the house behind them, and the two of them seemed to be talking to someone else.\u201cWho else is there?\u201d Fang Juexia asked.\u201cAh, we came with the staff of the production team,\u201d Ling Yi said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to start recording today, just as soon as the cameras are installed. Qiang Ge said that since Xiao Pei also came back today, it\u2019s the perfect occasion for us to do a livestream to celebrate all of us being together again!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re starting today?\u201d Fang Juexia felt that it was too sudden, but Jiang Miao had already brought the staff inside. They turned around for a bit and then started to install the cameras.Lu Yuan was cradling two large tubs of popcorn in his hands. \u201cStrong Ge said that we should make a pilot livestream episode to build up momentum for the group, and it\u2019s already been publicized.\u201dHe Ziyan put down the fried chicken in his hand. \u201cThe topic once again returns to our Dalian Hunk\u2019s home field.\u201d\u201cIron bros, double click 666, yo~\u201d Pei Tingsong suddenly inserted.\u201cSee,\u201d He Ziyan patted Pei Tingsong on the shoulder and said, \u201cEven our Xiao Pei, an overseas returnee, knows this phrase!\u201d He suddenly discovered something. \u201cYi? Xiao Pei, what\u2019s wrong with your face?\u201dFang Juexia glanced at him. The corners of his eyes seemed to be a bit swollen, but Pei Tingsong just answered casually, \u201cGot it while practicing boxing.\u201dThis person was really strange. On one hand, he was frank enough that he didn\u2019t fear offending anyone, but on the other hand, he could spout lies without having to come up with a draft beforehand, and his face wouldn\u2019t carry even the slightest tinge of red while he did so.\u201cJuexia, you\u2019re not going to clean up a bit?\u201d Ling Yi ran over and hugged Fang Juexia, rubbing his arms against the fluffy sweater he was wearing.Fang Juexia shook his head, and pulled up the plush hood of his pajamas, which then covered most of his face. \u201cForget it. Let\u2019s not make everyone wait for me.\u201dLing Yi sighed, \u201cAh, the basic strength of the face of a group is that you can meet anyone without any makeup at any time, not even being afraid of a livestream.\u201dThe staff\u2019s efficiency was very high, and soon, all the machines were installed and debugged successfully. As soon as they took their first steps out of the house, Cheng Qiang arrived right on their heels. Behind him was a young woman around 30 years old, who was the director of the ensemble show this time. Based on how she talked, she seemed very energetic and experienced. After finishing his chat with the director, Cheng Qiang came to them and told them the things they had to pay attention to during the recording process, before pulling Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia to the side.\u201cThey\u2019re going to start the fanservice now.\u201d He Ziyan had gotten Pocky from somewhere and had a stick of it dangling from his mouth.Ling Yi snapped the stick hanging out of his mouth in half and very quickly ate it. \u201cOur Two Fire is the emperor of truth.\u201dLu Yuan seemed to think of something, and spoke while heading over to the spot the two of them were. \u201cHey, do you need me to provide a plan for you? I\u2019ve read a lot of comments by your CP fans online\u2026\u201d Before he could finish saying that, he was grabbed by their smiling captain, who rebuked him, \u201cEnough, you.\u201dLing Yi clicked his tongue a few times. \u201cThe Dalian Hunk looks sophisticated on the surface.\u201dHe Ziyan was expressionless as he said, \u201cIn reality though, he\u2019s crazily shipping the CP of his own family\u2019s teammates.\u201dThe two of them high-fived each other.\u201cOK! Let\u2019s all get ready, we can start now!\u201dTheir ensemble show would be a combination of footage gathered from both manual shooting and the fixed cameras. 24 hours of source material would be gathered by the fixed cameras, while manual shooting would only take place during certain periods of time, and only when everyone was present, such as the livestream right now. However, in order to make it seem as real as possible, there weren\u2019t many people in the camera crew.\u201cThe livestream has started.\u201dAs soon as they said that, the livestream froze. This was the first time it had actually frozen like this.Jiang Miao asked, \u201cIs it a problem with the network speed?\u201dLu Yuan replied, \u201cNo\u00a0ah, our dormitory network is excellent.\u201dThe staff member explained, \u201cIt\u2019s because there are too many people. It\u2019s fine, it\u2019ll be good in just a bit.\u201dThis \u201cjust a bit\u201d took nearly 15 minutes. During this period, they moved the sofa back, spread a tablecloth on the floor, and placed all the food and drinks on it. Everyone sat down on the carpet, and several people also ate and drank for a while. Finally, they saw the barrage start scrolling smoothly, and almost all the words were in\u00a0Klein Blue, which was the Kaleido support group color.[AAAAAHHHHHH I\u2019M HERE GEGES! Was crying over it freezing 5555][Three Water, Two Fire, Yiyi, Juexia,\u00a0Yuanyuan, and there\u2019s even Xiao Pei! I love you all!]Jiang Miao clapped his hands twice, prompting the members around him. \u201cLet\u2019s greet everyone\u00a0ba. 1, 2, 3.\u201dThe six big boys sitting in a row raised their right hands at the same time, with their thumbs, index fingers, and middle fingers stretched out in front of their faces to make a \u201cK\u201d character. They all cried out in unison, \u201cHello everyone, we are Kaleido!\u201dAfter greeting everyone, Ling Yi and Lu Yuan started clapping for themselves. \u201cGood!\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cDo some more!\u201d The more Ling Yi clapped, the more excited he got. \u201cYuanyuan, do some breakdancing!\u201dFang Juexia silently grabbed Ling Yi\u2019s small excited hand, pulled it down, and stuffed him with some jelly drops.[Teacher Fang: As a calm person, I am so tired of living with this crazy group.][Hahahahahaha the Roommate CP is really cute! You cause trouble, while I pull you back hhhhhh][How are Juexia\u2019s pajamas this cute? It\u2019s so fuzzy, really want to stroke it!]Ling Yi\u2019s eyes were sharp. \u201cJuexia! They say your clothes are really cute, and they want to pet you!\u201dJuexia squinted at the screen. He pulled a bit at the fluffy pajamas on his body, and his tone was flat as he responded slowly, \u201cWhat brand is this\u2026 Yiyi gave this to me last year for my birthday, and I already cut off the tag, so I can\u2019t check.\u201d\u201cHey, they\u2019re sure to be able to get the same one, don\u2019t worry\u00a0ba,\u201d Ling Yi said.[Ahhhhh, the Roommate line is so real!][Yiyi is super sticky with Juexia~ Cold, doting gong x soft adorable cutie shou, we\u2019re fed so well!]Jiang Miao, as always, cued them up, \u201cIn order to celebrate our Xiao Pei\u2019s return to dorm life, Ziyan bought a lot of delicious food today.\u201d[Every time I watch K group activities, I feel like I\u2019m watching Three Water and Two Fire take little children out to play~ The spring outing of the Kaleidoscope kindergarten has started\u00a0la.][Captain, your yellow sweater today looks really good\u00a0ah!][The little band is really very handsome! The Wanyan band was honest and didn\u2019t deceive me.]\u201cThank you, Two Fire!\u201d Ling Yi clapped his hands like a little seal, then flew to open the box of fried chicken, but was quickly knocked aside by Lu Yuan with his chopsticks. \u201cWe\u2019re letting you eat, so you just immediately make a grab for it? Don\u2019t you know how many\u00a0jin\u00a0and\u00a0liang\u00a0you\u2019re at?\u201d\u201cLu Yuan is implying things about me!\u201d After shouting, Ling Yi fell on Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder and lamented, \u201cI\u2019ll give it to Juexia, he\u2019s thin!\u201dFang Juexia couldn\u2019t hold back anymore, and so he lowered his eyes and laughed gently. This laugh just happened to be spotted by Pei Tingsong, who was handing out the utensils, and he felt that it was strange.It turned out that he could also laugh like this.[Where\u2019s Xiao Pei?][The black pants belong to Xiao Pei\u00a0ba! Completely can\u2019t see his face\u00a0ah\u00a0hhh Xiao Pei, quickly come out and let mama seeee!]\u201cThey\u2019re calling for you,\u201d Fang Juexia lifted his head up and said so suddenly to the close-by Pei Tingsong, while taking over the utensils at the same time. He saw that during this spare time, Pei Tingsong had put on a pair of black-rimmed glasses, which gave him a very school-boy look.Pei Tingsong froze for a moment, and then realized what he meant, so he sat down next to Fang Juexia. As soon as he sat down, his face finally appeared on the screen.They were too close, and Fang Juexia felt unaccustomed to it, so out of habit, he moved a bit to the left. However, Pei Tingsong reached out and grabbed him around his waist. He simply dragged him back to the right, and the two of them ended up close together.Pei Tingsong kept his composure and then let go of Fang Juexia\u2019s waist, using his hand to push up his glasses a bit as he smiled at the camera.[AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH MY XIAO PEI!!!!][What\u2019s wrong with the corner of\u00a0Putuo Temple Site\u2019s\u00a0eye? Are you hurt?][Nearly didn\u2019t see it since it\u2019s blocked by the glasses, there\u2019s even gauze on there.][TingJue CP combo!!! Screenshot it\u00a0ma!\u00a0In a daze\u00a0ah!][Shit! Did Xiao Fei embrace\u00a0jxgg\u00a0for a bit just now?!! Such a gong of a man!][Ahhhhhhh Putuo Temple Site is too\u00a0sue-ish!

The corner of his eyes curved into a beautiful arc, extending all the way to the edge of his pink birthmark.\u201cXiao Pei, take off the\u00a0yi\u00a0and start up the\u00a0wen.\u201dHe said this rather inexplicably, and Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t know what he was talking about, so he stared at him, only to see Fang Juexia\u2019s index finger stretch out from the cuffs of his sleeves and write out the\u00a0yi\u00a0character in the air.[I get it!!! Change the character of\u00a0yi\u00a0into\u00a0wen, and Pei becomes Fei! Ah, our Juexia is such a smart baby\u00a0ah!][When Juexia isn\u2019t smiling, he looks pretty cold, with a completely chilly and domineering face. Once he smiles, it\u2019s too sweet\u00a0ba. The curve of his eyes and his beautiful birthmark all go together then\u00a0la~][55555 a giant mouthful of fluff as soon as I come on! That pun of \u2018take off the\u00a0yi\u00a0character, and start up the\u00a0wen\u2019 is also too\u00a0cute! Deadpan Fang Juexia!]Pei Tingsong realized what was going on and wanted to laugh, but also thought that doing so would be too stupid. So he tried to hold back his smile and pursed the corners of his mouth instead. He turned his face to shake his head at the screen, saying in a deep voice, \u201cWhat a rotten pun.\u201dThis was the first time he had heard Fang Juexia say Xiao Pei, although the purpose wasn\u2019t to call out to him.[Oh my God, this year\u2019s doting is coming!! Wuwu\u00a0kswl!][OMG\u00a0Pinot Tree Supreme\u00a0is such a good gong!! Him suppressing his smile is too sue-ish, too sue-ish. I\u2019m thinking again of that scene where PTS was taking that plane ticket and lightly swatting Gege\u2019s face with it!][Hahahaha what the hell is a Pinot Tree Supreme\u00a0la,\u00a0Pei Tingsong has a few too many nicknames!][Thanks to the sister who misspelled Xiao Pei\u2019s name. Don\u2019t crawl around, quickly come back!][Wait, that sweater Xiao Pei is wearing\u2026 Isn\u2019t that the birthday present Awakening Juexia Station sent this year? Juexia wore it once, and Awakening Juexia Station\u2019s Weibo even verified it before\u2026]The appearance of this line in the barrage soon caused a great disturbance.[I just exited to flip through Awakening Juexia Station\u2019s Weibo for a bit, and it really is there! It\u2019s the same style!!][It\u2019s Juexia\u2019s\u00a0ba!][TingJue is rio!!!! ][Xiao Pei, how is this taking off\u00a0yi\u00a0to start up\u00a0wen, when it\u2019s clearly you putting on\u00a0clothes\u00a0to start up with Xia\u00a0ah\u00a0!]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He supported his forehead and looked at Fang Juexia. His eyes widened a little, and he made an expression that clearly said\u2014 [you explain this to me].However, Fang Juxia was still immersed in searching his memory, and only snapping out of it after a long while had passed. \u201cIt seems it really was sent by a support station.\u201dI\u2019ll kill this person. Pei Tingsong could only pretend that nothing had happened and forcefully changed the topic by requesting, \u201cZiyan Ge, help me get some potato chips\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cIf you want to eat something\u00a0ah, it\u2019s not that easy.\u201d He Ziyan crossed his two long legs and stated, \u201cYou have to play a game. You can eat if you win, and you will be punished if you lose.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the punishment?\u201d Ling Yi suddenly grew spirited.Lu Yuan had a burst of inspiration, and exclaimed, \u201cHow about a kiss on the mouth?\u201dThe other five people: \u2026.[Hahahahahaha Teacher Lu Yuan, if\u00a0you\u00a0can say it, then go ahead and perform it live!][How made winds\uff01][WOC\u00a0kiss on the mouth hahahahaha! Is our little K group this open? What are all of you usually doing in the dormitory!]Ling Yi narrowed his eyes and pinched Lu Yuan\u2019s face as he teased, \u201cYou\u2019re afraid it\u2019s not gay enough\u00a0ba?\u201dLu Yuan pinched his face in return. \u201cIf I\u2019m gay, then you\u2019re a 0.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m\u00a0Ling Yi!\u201dLu Yuan asked, \u201cAre you a 1 or 0?\u201dHe Ziyan immediately added, \u201cIf he\u2019s a 1, I don\u2019t believe it.\u201dXiao Pei commented, \u201cHow is he a 1?\u201dJiang Miao quickly intervened to mediate the dispute, \u201cOkay, okay, don\u2019t keep going.\u201d[The little team: My situation is too hard!][What kind of gay group crosstalk is this\u00a0ah\u00a0hhhh][01: in three days I\u2019m going to k*ll all of you][Sure enough, there are no straight men in Kaleido.]Jiang Miao said, \u201cIf there\u2019s going to be a punishment\u2026 To be fair, everyone should write down a punishment, and the loser will have to draw out one of them and then perform it, how\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d[Whoa, whoa, whoa, I want to see what punishment everyone wrote!]The director arranged for these things behind the camera, and then said, \u201cEveryone has one minute, so come and write your punishment down in front of the camera\u00a0ba. Remember to show it when you finish writing it\u00a0oh.\u201dFang Juexia was a bit distracted as he thought about this punishment matter when he suddenly heard everyone talking about him.\u201cWe have to agree first, we can\u2019t have any games that involve arithmetic\u00a0ah.\u201d Lu Yuan took a French fry and stuffed it in his mouth. \u201cOtherwise, Teacher Fang will curbstomp us all.\u201dOnce he said that, everyone actually sighed deeply at the same time.[Hahahahaha, what should have come out, still came out][Will the human-shaped calculator Fang Juexia make his reappearance in the world??!][\uff1f\uff1f New fan is completely confused, begging for an explanation!]He Ziyan laughed and said, \u201cI can still recall the fear of being dominated by\u00a0Wangzai Milk.\u201d[I knew it! Wangzai Milk was really too funny!]Ling Yi clapped his hands and explained to the online audience, \u201cLet\u2019s go. So, previously for one of our group\u2019s activities, our Juexia participated in a variety show, and it seems that b station has a clip from it. At that time, there was a segment that was all math, the kind where the subsequent problems just kept getting harder and harder. However, our Juexia, with his amazing calculation abilities, won the grand prize: a car full of Wangzai Milk. Yes, a whole car.\u201d[WTF? A whole car?][Why is it so dumb hahahaha][In the early days, Juexia really did go on a lot of strange variety shows for exposure, hugging my Xia~]\u201cHow long did it take for us to finish drinking all of it?\u201d Lu Yuan drew close to ask.Jiang Miao thought about it. \u201cA month or two\u00a0ba. At that time, the only designated drink for us after we returned home was Wangzai Milk.\u201d[Hahaha, six young people gathering together to drink milk! About to die from laughter!][Wangzai, collect money from the viewers!]He Ziyan grinned and showed his shiny, white teeth. \u201cI remember that during that time, Juexia would use milk to stew\u00a0tong sui\u00a0every day for us to eat. Ah, right, explaining a bit to new fans, Juexia grew up in Guangzhou.\u201d[AHHHHHHHHHH\u00a0plgg\u00a0and I are from the same place! I\u2019M SO HAPPY!]Ling Yi, as his roommate, added, \u201cBut I heard that Juexia\u2019s mother is from the North.\u201dJuexia nodded and stated, \u201cShandong.\u201d[The most beautiful children are North-South mixed bloods! No wonder!][What the hell are North-South mixed bloods\u00a0ah\u00a0hahahahaha the sisters can flatter!]Lu Yuan shook his head. \u201cAnyway, after that incident, we start to shiver anytime we see Wangzai Milk.\u201dSpeaking of the past, Pei Tingsong thought it was funny. When they were on that program, the sponsors probably hadn\u2019t expected that such difficult questions could be worked out, so they had set up that kind of award. They hadn\u2019t expected Fang Juexia to really solve them.[At that time, Juexia was also slandered because of this\u2026]Seeing this sentence, Pei Tingsong also recalled the other things that had happened at that time.It was a small program, not very popular, so it didn\u2019t get much of a response after it was broadcast. However, Fang Juexia\u2019s anti-fans would never miss any opportunity to mock him. At that time, they said that it was scripted, that he had cheated, and had even written a lot of such small pieces about it. If Pei Tingsong hadn\u2019t been there on the show to witness what had actually happened, he would have been pretty much brainwashed by them.Fang Juexia looked cold, but to the people close to him, his silence seemed more like a slow reaction on his part. He didn\u2019t have much expression on his face and spoke quietly, not having much confidence in defending himself. \u201cWangzai Milk is very delicious\u00a0ah.\u201d[AHHHHHHHHH, Juexia is too milky today! Sure enough, no matter how alpha he is on stage, he becomes very milky offstage!][The way he trailed off was too cute\u00a0ba!]Pei Tingsong glanced at him and noticed that once Fang Juexia had finished saying this sentence, he had gone to Ling Yi to verify whether Wangzai Milk was good or not.This guy was so strange; he was the strangest person he had ever seen.Everyone talked and laughed, and driven by Jiang Miao, they began to prepare for the game. When writing out the\u00a0 punishments, everyone went to one side by themselves. Fang Juexia leaned over on the sofa with his back to it and thought for a long time.He really couldn\u2019t think of any good punishment.Ling Yi\u2019s mind was fast and he was the first to rush in front of the camera, where he then secretly wrote down the words, 'special dark drink\u201d. He was elated to show it to everyone. Lu Yuan followed after him to write a sentence, \u201ccopy a little clip of someone doing the\u00a0coarse flower hand.\u201d[If there is a punishment, there must be a special x][Hahahahaha little clip of coarse flower hand, killing people and punishing the heart\u00a0ah,\u00a0Teacher Yuan!][Yuanyuan is really not worried about lifting a stone to hit his own feet]Jiang Miao was kind enough to just write \u201c20 handstand push-ups\u201d. Pei Tingsong casually wrote down 'send an ugly photo to the groupchat.\u201d When it came to Fang Juexia, he really didn\u2019t know what he should write. Seeing that the given time was coming to an end, he had to quickly put his pen to paper, then he folded the note with the words \u201celephant trunk game\u201d written on it and put it in the punishment box.[The little captain and Juexia really are the angel team\u00a0la, they completely don\u2019t know how to give people a hard time.]This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org[Send an ugly photo to the groupchat hahahahaha, Pinot Tree Supreme, you really are 19 years old!][I\u2019m still looking more forward to our Huohuo\u2019s idea. After all, he\u2019s a\u00a0wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u00a0hhhh]He Ziyan stepped forward, wrote down a line of characters, and showed it to the camera. His bandmates were ordered to turn around and weren\u2019t able to look at the screen during this period. However, when they turned around, they found the barrage still messaging about it.[Shit! It\u2019s still Fire Ge who can play!!!][Fire Ge is too good at this hahahaha, looking forward to the punishment!][respect Fire Ge!!!]What kind of a punishment was it? Fang Juexia was curious and envious at the same time. Interesting people always wrote down punishments that were also interesting.The set of games began. At first, it was simple, with You Draw and I Guess, then Guess the Name of the Song, and so on. However, Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t know what kind of misfortune he was suffering from, but that night, he lost again and again. From the total of six punishments, he did three all by himself. First, the handstand push ups, and then the dizzying elephant trunk game. He was still dizzy when he drank Ling Yi\u2019s special drink, made of soy sauce, vinegar, honey, mustard, sesame oil, and milk.\u201cIs this really giving me a welcome for my new arrival? This is simply looking forward to my sudden death the very day I move in\u00a0ba.\u201d Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t stop coughing.[Hahahahaha the band tyrant also has a day like today! It\u2019s really the heavens that have eyes hahahahaha][How hard to drink is Yiyi\u2019s drink\u00a0ah\u00a0hahaha, Xiao Pei already poured himself a large can of coke!][Finally, we have something that all us sisters can get \u2014 Ling Yi\u2019s special drink that Xiao Pei drank!][You guys look at the expressions around hahahaha]Pei Tingsong still felt nauseous and wanted to grab some more drinks to make the taste of the special drink disappear. He stretched his neck and looked around, but it seemed that there were no unopened drinks left in front of him anymore. Although Fang Juexia had a cold face, he was also very observant. While everyone was still immersed in the happy atmosphere of the game, only he realized what Pei Tingsong was looking for. After only two seconds of hesitation, he pushed the can of orange soda in front of him towards Pei Tingsong.Seeing this move of his, Pei Tingsong turned his head to look at him.Fang Juexia mouthed silently\u2014haven\u2019t drunk from it.Thinking of the words that Cheng Qiang had said to them before the livestream, Pei Tingsong went ahead and picked up the soda can. Fundamentally, both of them actually didn\u2019t have much of a band camaraderie with each other, so he automatically regarded Fang Juexia\u2019s action as a kind of \u201cfanservice.\u201d[Xiao Pei is drinking Juexia\u2019s drink!][Wearing Gege\u2019s clothes and drinking Gege\u2019s drink, Xiao Pei is awesome!][Cult\u00a0CP fans, don\u2019t look at basic human behavior with rotten eyes\u00a0la. Just obediently watch the game, okay?]The barrage burst into a frenzy, and the director\u2019s voice sounded out again, \u201cThen start the last game. You guys can draw it yourself\u00a0ba.\u201dWith that, the staff took out the game box. Pei Tingsong saw it, put down the soda can, and rolled up his sleeves. \u201cI\u2019ll draw. They have been the ones drawing for all the previous games, and I must have always been losing because of this.\u201dHe Ziyan laughed and teased, \u201cBecause why? Because of philosophy?\u201d[Hahahaha, Fire Ge is great! Does the youth study philosophy?][Hahahaha, Xiao Pei\u2019s daily philosophy study joke has been cued]Ling Yi declared, \u201cJust won\u2019t let him draw!\u201dJiang Miao grabbed Ling Yi\u2019s hand and said, \u201cYou let him draw\u00a0ba.\u201d[Hahaha, I\u2019ve discovered that the words Three Water says the most every day are \u201cYou stop\u2026.that\u201d and \u201cYou let him\u2026.ba\u201d breaks my heart x]Lu Yuan was bored and started popping his arm to the music. \u201cYeah, or else he won\u2019t admit that he\u2019s a game black hole.\u201d\u201cWho said that, I play games very well. It\u2019s these low-energy games that don\u2019t match me.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s expression was completely defiant, but in Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes, the way he dragged out the words \u201cvery well\u201d made him look like a stinky little kid.\u201cHow about this: we let you draw, but if you lose again this time, during the punishment, we\u2019ll add the clip of you doing the flower hand move, how\u2019s that?\u201dFang Juexia wanted to laugh; Lu Yuan was being really persistent about this clip.Lu Yuan\u2019s carefully prepared punishment hadn\u2019t been used up until now, and internally, he was sighing and wringing his hands over it. Unexpectedly, there was Pei Tingsong who ran straight into it.\u201cAlright.\u201d Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t fear it at all, and directly put his hand into the game box. Fang Juexia quietly put a potato chip into his mouth as he stared at him, and a slightly bad premonition arose in his heart.Snap, the chip broke in half.His premonitions had always been very accurate.Pei Tingsong had a straight-forward attitude as he stretched out his hand, drew a note out from the box, opened it, and looked at it.The director said, \u201cGive everyone a look at it too.\u201dWhen the note was turned over, Pei Tingsong frowned in disbelief and asked, \u201cPass the candy wrapper. What is this\u00a0ah?\u201dThe barrage had already taken the lead in going crazy.[AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH PASS THE CANDY WRAPPER! Is it the one where you suck the wrapper to stick it steady, then turn around as you keep going?!!!][Holy shit, I caught sight of this being played in another group before!!! Super exciting!!!][Passing around a tissue paper would be too effective\u00a0ba,\u00a0director Jiejie is awesome!!!

What kind of game did this count as?Lu Yuan was laughing so hard that he had rolled onto the floor. \u201cPei Tingsong, hahaha, Putuo Temple Site has discovered his golden finger!\u201d\u201cWhat are you laughing at?

Consistent with what was being said in the barrage, it was a game where the band members had to pass the cellophane to the next in line with their mouths, and the last member needed to hold the candy wrapper with his mouth for three seconds before it could count as being a success.\u201cAlright, now figure out the order.\u201d[AHHHHH order!

SquareCircle!!!]The barrage had turned into CP chaos, and it seemed as though people couldn\u2019t send enough messages about their preferred CP.The director again took out a box, this time containing six balls, on which were written numbers, and then said, \u201cDraw these and then sit in a row according to the number you get\u00a0oh.\u201c[Sit in a row and kiss.][Hahahahaha what the hell is sitting in a row and kissing?!][What beautiful Chinese!]Everyone successively grabbed a ball. Jiang Miao drew a 2, after which it was He Ziyan\u2019s turn. He carefully flicked his fingers around while drawing a ball, a bit like a gambler king watching the cards, before then showing a confident smile.[Fire Ge is either 1 or 3!!!]He Ziyan aimed the other side of the ball at the camera, and sure enough, it was a 1.[Two Fire: You guys are right, I am a 1]It was now Ling Yi\u2019s turn to take the box.[Is our Lingyi a 0 or 1 hahahaha]\u201c3!\u201d Ling Yi hugged Jiang Miao\u2019s arm and exclaimed, \u201cAh, I\u2019m next to Miaomiao!\u201dLu Yuan rolled up his sleeves and shook the box, which had only three little balls left, for a long time. At last, he extremely cautiously drew out a ball and announced, \u201cIt\u2019s now time to witness whether or not I\u2019m a third wheel!\u201d[Hahahaha Teacher Yuan is really the TingJue CP official support group captain!]Fang Juexia faintly felt a bit worried. If Lu Yuan didn\u2019t split up the two of them, this game would become really embarrassing. Of course, it was also embarrassing to pass the candy wrapper using the mouth around with other members, but it would still be better than doing so with Pei Tingsong. It was plainly clear that up until two days ago, they had still been waging their two-year long cold war, but now, they were playing such an intimate game.You never knew what would happen next.\u201cLet\u2019s draw together\u00a0ba.\u201dThe director suddenly said, \u201cLu Yuan really knows how to create an effect for the program\u00a0ma.\u201d[Hahahahahaha Northeast Lao Ge is awesome]Xiao Pei shrugged. \u201cFine.\u201dThe two of them reached into the box and took out the balls. Before the numbers were announced, Lu Yuan suddenly became serious, and said with a lowered voice, \u201cSeriously, I still want to pass the candy wrapper around with Juexia.\u201dPei Tingsong let out a sneer.[AHHHHHH, this deja vu of two gongs fighting for one shou][That sneer is so Alpha!][Hello, in the SquareCircle CP, Teacher Fang is the gong\u00a0ba.\u00a01.8 meters\u00a0tall and has a salty look, we\u2019re not joking around here][Wuwuwuwuwuwu SquareCircle girl enjoying blue skies overhead!]Ling Yi, whose seat had already been assigned, opened a package of milk toffees and distributed them. Fang Juexia took one and stuffed it into his mouth. The rich sweetness of the milk toffee spread in his mouth.[However, the frigid face lordship doesn\u2019t care about this battle at all and instead eats sweets happily.][Juexia\u2019s face, if I had to pass the candy wrapper to him, I might just die suddenly 5555][Xiao Pei, you fight for your mama a bit!][Xiao Pei, you spent this whole night as a waste just for this moment of luck\u00a0ah! You have to pass the candy wrapper around with the beautiful baby!]\u201cCome on, come on, come on, let\u2019s announce it together.\u201d Lu Yuan counted to three, and the two of them then reached out their hands at the same time to show the numbers on the balls to the camera.[AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH XIAO PEI IS 5!!!][Okay, No. 4 honored male guest missed the chance to kiss the beautiful baby][AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH TINGJUE IS COMING UP!! I\u2019ll go downstairs and run ten laps to calm down!]The barrage simply went crazy.Even though Fang Juexia looked as though he had expected this, his consciousness was still stuck in a state of dissociation. He still hadn\u2019t figured out what the situation was and what it had to do with him.[jxgg really assumes the role as K\u2019s calm person, he really has no waves at all][Hahahaha, Fang Juexia has never\u00a0let go\u00a0before!][jxgg is really beautiful. He looks like a quiet little white rabbit in these pajamas and hat][Ah, I\u2019m jealous, I want to bodyswap with pts\u2026.]It wasn\u2019t until Jiang Miao symbolically put the last of the remaining six small balls into his hand that Fang Juexia suddenly realized what had just happened.\u201cYou\u2019re the last one,\u201d Jiang Miao said.Was that so?What was the meaning of this?His fuzzy pajama hood covered his dizzy head, and an abnormal heat rose up on his cheeks.\u201cWait\u2026\u201d He stepped back and asked Ling Yi in a low voice, \u201cIs Pei Tingsong passing it to me?\u201dLing Yi pretended to wipe away some tears, took a long breath through his nose, then deeply nodded.How could this happen?Fang Juexia\u2019s soul began to leave his body.Under the guidance of the staff, the other members sat down in the order they had drawn, and he was automatically lined up last. He Ziyan raised his hand and asked, \u201cWill standing be more\u2026 convenient?\u201d He hesitated for a second.[Hahaha, the word \u2018convenient\u2019 is too wonderfull!][Messing around with adult idols is an endless enjoyment!!]Who would have known that the director would actually happily agree, \u201cAlright\u00a0ah.\u201dSo the six big boys stood in a row and waited for the game to begin.Lu Yuan was just joining in the fun and didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. \u201cWhoever loses the candy wrapper will have to record themselves doing the flower-hand clip\u00a0ah!\u201d\u201cMr. Yuan, persistent men like\u00a0you\u00a0are really rare these days,\u201d Ling Yi complained.Lu Yuan said, \u201cDon\u2019t fall in love with me, there will be no result, unless you\u2019re better at the flower-hand dance than me.\u201dHe Ziyan said with a laugh, \u201cMaybe Xiao Pei will be better at the flower-hand dance than you.\u201dPei Tingsong shrugged and replied, \u201cAnyway, if I lose, I won\u2019t be surnamed Pei any longer.\u201d[Hahaha Pei Tingsong\u2019s desire to win is real!]This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgThe staff took out a palm-sized piece of colored cellophane and handed it to He Ziyan, who was first in line.\u201cThis candy wrapper is strangely very good looking.\u201dHaving said that, He Ziyan turned around. In order to reduce the possibility of losing hold on the candy wrapper as much as possible, he directly shortened the distance between himself and group leader Jiang Miao. Only when the tips of their noses were about to stick together did He Ziyan stick the candy wrapper onto his mouth, sucking air in to hold it in place before drawing even closer.Ling Yi exclaimed, \u201cAh, Fire Ge is so clever\u00a0ah!\u201dWhile their surroundings started to rise up in an uproar, Jiang Miao took a deep breath and held back his smile. He blocked his ears and ignored the playfulness with which his Didi was drawing closer. He took hold of the cellophane wrapper stuck to He Ziyan\u2019s lips, but in the beginning, it didn\u2019t go smoothly, and the cellophane wrapper remained stuck fast to He Ziyan\u2019s mouth.\u201cOOOOOHHHHHH so exciting!!\u201d Lu Yuan crowed.[Mr. Yuan is really a rotten man\u00a0ba!][wtf, I\u2019m about to have a nosebleed! This is just a fucking hot kiss\u00a0ah!]After several attempts, the disobedient candy wrapper was finally sucked up by Jiang Miao\u2019s mouth. Taking advantage of this opportunity, he turned around quickly and approached Ling Yi, who wasn\u2019t ready yet.\u201cAh, wait a minute! Wait!\u201d[AHHHHHHHHHHHH FORCEFUL KISS!!!! Wtf I\u2019m shipping the YiMiao CP!!!][WaterFire just now really did rub their mouths together for a long time\u00a0ah, oh my fucking god! Fire Ge did it on purpose\u00a0ba!][TingJue girl has already shown a dirty smile in front of the screen at the moment!][WTF, I\u2019m blushing right now!]Ling Yi did yell to wait, but he moved unexpectedly fast; his lips were like a small suction cup that immediately sucked and held fast onto the wrapper. He turned around fiercely and didn\u2019t even think before directly standing on his tiptoes, grabbing Lu Yuan\u2019s shoulder, and drawing him closer, scaring Lu Yuan so much that his pupils enlarged.\u201cWu?!\u201d Lu Yuan\u2019s eyes were as wide as copper bells.[Hahahahahahahaha I\u2019m about to die laughing from Yiyi.][Why is it that when it comes to OneRoad, the scene becomes so funny hahahaha][Suddenly a tough guy! Kissing online!]Lu Yuan was flustered as he took the cellophane wrapper from Ling Yi\u2019s mouth, but due to Ling Yi\u2019s nervousness, he had forgotten to let go of Lu Yuan. As a result, Lu Yuan could only forcefully push Ling Yi away, and then turn to face Pei Tingsong.[Hahahahaha what love and hate is this?!][Yuanyuan: Let me go! I need to go find Xiao Pei!][Juexia is so calm, he\u2019s like a bystander at the moment lolololol][Did jxgg forget that he is also playing the game hahaha, he\u2019s even showing the kind of expression where he\u2019s smartly watching a play]Fang Juexia, who was watching from the side, had become engrossed in it, and didn\u2019t realize that it would be his turn soon. Compared to him, Pei Tingsong wasn\u2019t much better either. He was used to just fooling around at work, so at this critical moment, he had still simply stuck both his hands into his pockets, and wasn\u2019t looking nervous at all. When he saw Lu Yuan turn to face him, he just lowered his head a bit.Lu Yuan seemed to have mastered some skills. Almost as soon as the two of them touched, they completed the handover, with the cellophane wrapper very quickly transferring over to Pei Tingsong.[Wow, how fast! Mr. Lu is awesome!][Wuwuwuw how is my Xiao Pei this handsome\u00a0ah! Two hands stuck in his pockets, not in love with anyone!][AHHHHHHHHHHH MY TINGJUE IS COMING UP!!!! TINGJUE!!!][TINGJUE!!!!!!][I\u2019m waiting for the TingJue kiss of the century!!!!]The barrage suddenly went crazy as if they had been injected with chicken blood.Maybe it was because of an emotional delay, but Fang Juexia, who should have reacted earlier, only started to suddenly feel nervous at this moment. His heart began to beat strangely, in a rather violent and unfamiliar fashion.Pei Tingsong, who still had his hands stuck in his pockets, turned around. The lower half of his handsome face was covered with translucent cellophane, and the refracted gorgeous luster of it softened the edges of his face.He was recklessly shining as he stood on that spot.The light in the living room pierced through the lenses of his glasses and dissolved into his eyes, which were full of aggressiveness.He didn\u2019t know from which second it started, but somehow, the air around them seemed to solidify, and all movements were transformed into a slow-mo state, further turning into a montage under a\u00a0gaussian blur filter.Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t step closer. He just turned his head and bent down to get close to him.As if he was getting close enough to steal a kiss.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t know what was wrong with him, and it wasn\u2019t that he wanted to go against him, but he still subconsciously took a step back.With that step back, the soft light in Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes immediately disappeared, and now, the desire to win sharpened them. He pulled his right hand out of his pocket, reached out and quickly took off his glasses, then grasped the back of Fang Juexia\u2019s neck, and firmly dragged him back towards him while he was still trying to draw further away from him.Also, at this moment, Pei Tingsong\u2019s breathing began to grow ragged.The cellophane wrapper was pushed free by his breath, and it left his lips as it frivolously and slowly started to fall to the ground.\u201cAh, it\u2019s over, it\u2019s over!\u201d\u201cLost, lost, lost!\u201dEven Fang Juexia had concluded that he would lose, and had also concluded that the troublesome lip contact would not come as scheduled. The punishment wouldn\u2019t fall on him, so logically, he should be relieved.But he wasn\u2019t.Was he really going to lose?No one could imagine how strong Pei Tingsong\u2019s desire to win was.In the next moment, everyone was left stunned. Pei Tingsong actually bent down, tilted his head slightly, and caught that slow-escaping cellophane wrapper again. He was like a cheetah just waiting for the opportunity to strike, his movements natural and smooth, just like floating clouds and flowing water, taking only seconds to accomplish his goal. He then seized the back of Fang Juexia\u2019s neck with his right hand again and held his cheek in place with his left.His body suddenly leaned forward, and Fang Juexia\u2019s escaped soul returned at that very moment.The delicate membrane rustled, and then the other party\u2019s soft lips were forced against his. His heart nearly stopped beating at this point, and all his senses were violently mixing together.The cellophane had blinded his mind.Pei Tingsong\u2019s desire to win had resulted in them colliding into a kiss.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

TingJue is amazing, they\u2019ve made a reservation on the Hot Search list now\u2026.][These ups and downs are\u00a0brilliant][Xiao Pei is too gong-like!\u00a0Wolf cub, you\u2019re awesome!!][What have I done to be done like this by the TingJue CP\u00a0ah!!!]\u201cHoly\u2026\u201d Lu Yuan was completely shocked, but his last remaining trace of reason compelled him to change his words in front of the camera, \u201c\u2026.crap.\u201dIt was at this moment that Pei Tingsong became clear-headed, and that\u2019s when he felt that he had been possessed by something for an instant. Logically speaking, his part of the mission for the game had been successfully accomplished by now.That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.Upon coming to this realization, he quickly withdrew his hands from where they were holding Fang Juexia in place and pulled away from his lips.However, Fang Juexia still hadn\u2019t managed to react to all this yet.His eyes were muddled, his head was in a complete mess, and every nerve in his body was sluggishly standing still. So, that candy wrapper just stayed on his lips for less than a second before it fluttered off and fell down. The light motion it flickered with as it descended downwards made it seem as though it was very satisfied with the development it had brought about.\u201cAHHHHHHHH JUEXIA! IT FELL!\u201dWhat?Fang Juexia reached out in a panic and managed to grab the cellophane candy wrapper that had escaped his lips. He looked at everyone in chagrin and confusion.In not even three seconds, this roller coaster game had finally ended with a dramatic failure.The director regretfully noted, \u201cThe game challenge failed, and the pass failed at the last person in the line, so Juexia has to accept the punishment.\u201d[Ah, Juexia alone?][How can my beautiful baby be so miserable\u00a0ah\u00a05555][Juexia was scared into failing\u00a0ba, who could have expected such a development\u00a0ah][Writing in my blood to beg that Xiao Pei accompanies jx in bearing the punishment!!]When Ling Yi saw these lines on the barrage on the screen, he also started to yell and jump around with them. \u201cThey\u2019re\u00a0right, it was only because Xiao Pei scared Juexia that he forgot to suck in a breath and secure the candy wrapper. Xiao Pei is responsible for half of the failure!!\u201dAt this, Pei Tingsong\u2019s expression was full of question marks, and he reached out to push aside Ling Yi\u2019s head, which the person had stuck closer to him while speaking.Ling Yi immediately fled to the captain and complained, \u201cMiaomiao! He\u2019s shoving me!\u201dHe Ziyan once again forced away Ling Yi\u2019s arms which were hugging Jiang Miao. \u201cGo, shoving you back.\u201dLu Yuan said, \u201cI also agree that Xiao Pei should be punished together with Fang Juexia!\u201d Saying so, he then fell to his knees with his hands devoutly clasped together and pleaded, \u201cBegging you! Let my group members get the chance to record a clip of them doing the hand flower dance\u00a0ba!\u201d\u201cNo? Based on what?\u201d Xiao Pei refused, \u201cIt didn\u2019t fall down when it was with me.\u201dJiang Miao, who shouldered the heavy responsibility of cueing people while on the show, took the punishment box from the staff and smiled like a Bodhisattva as he said, \u201cHowever we do it\u2026 Juexia, you should draw a punishment first\u00a0ba.\u201dFang Juexia raised his hand and took off his pajama hoodie, thinking that it was the cause for his feverish cheeks. Without saying a word, he reached into the box, and without much hesitation, chose one of the two remaining punishment slips.[Teacher Fang: the bottom line of K\u2019s emotions][Juexia isn\u2019t calm, but in a daze\u00a0ba\u00a0hahahaha, so cuuuute][Please draw Two Fire\u2019s! Begging you, I\u2019m willing to exchange my height with Ling Yi\u2019s for a lifetime!]\u201cClip, clip, clip\u2026\u201d Lu Yuan chanted as he hung on Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder.Opening the note, Fang Juexia showed the side with the punishment written on it to the camera.Written on it in bold and big letters were: The group will select another member who is to be shut up in a closet with the person responsible for drawing the punishment, and then the two of them will be left alone in there for five minutes.[AHHHHHHH IT\u2019S THE PUNISHMENT WRITTEN BY Fire GE!][Two Fire is too awesome! K is so amazing to have\u00a0you!][Holy shit holy shit!! K group is really all gongs!!][The closet! My God, I surrender!][Kaleido, you can change your name to Gayleido\u00a0ba, you can even think of such a gay punishment hahaha][As we all know, Kaleido has no straight men.]\u201cAh! My little clip! My hope has been dashed to pieces!\u201d Lu Yuan was holding his head and squatting on the ground as he grumbled, \u201cI even already found the specific video that I wanted you guys to imitate.\u201dPei Tingsong raised his eyebrows. \u201cThen why don\u2019t you be the one to just do it?\u201dLu Yuan suddenly stood up and adjusted his collar, before refusing, \u201cIn that case, let\u2019s just forget about it.\u201dAs soon as Ling Yi saw the punishment, he stamped his foot and shouted, \u201cAhhhhhh, Juexia, who are you going to choose!? Who?\u201dFang Juexia was in a quandary when Jiang Miao suggested, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you choose the person who passed you the candy wrapper?\u201dLu Yuan immediately made a \u201cplease\u201d gesture towards Pei Tingsong. \u201cI agree!\u00a0Please\u00a0enter the closet.\u201dLing Yi was already laughing hard enough to roll around on the sofa. \u201cHahaha, remember to come out in five minutes\u00a0oh!\u201d\u201cWhat are you guys talking about?!\u201d Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t know what was going on, but he could distinctly sense that his welcome night to the dorm was becoming stranger and stranger.Not daring to wait for him to understand, Ling Yi and Lu Yuan began to push at his back, and nudged him into one of the rooms. Ling Yi shouted, \u201cJuexia\u2019s closet is big! Head to our room!\u201d\u201cWait, isn\u2019t it\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong was completely baffled. \u201cI didn\u2019t lose, so why should I also go in, I\u2019m not going.\u201d Saying that, he then pointed to Fang Juexia and ordered, \u201cYou\u2019re also not allowed to go in.\u201dI\u2019m the benefactor here\u2014the one who helped you get rid of that big problem after all.But before Fang Juexia could say anything, He Ziyan grabbed the initiative and broke his daydream apart first. \u201cThat won\u2019t work. Juexia drew the note that I had written, so of course, I will set the rules.\u201d With that, he waved his finger quite dominantly and directed, \u201cForce\u00a0Lao Liu\u00a0into there.\u201d\u201cAye.\u201d Ling Yi and Lu Yuan responded in unison, then trapped Xiao Pei, who was the tallest in the group, between them, and dragged him against his will into Juexia\u2019s room. Jiang Miao kept smiling from behind them and glanced back at Juexia. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go in?\u201dFang Juexia was naturally reluctant to do so internally, but he had been the one to lose the game, and he had also been the one who just had to draw this particular punishment. In fact, rather than being shut up into a closet together with Pei Tingsong, he would prefer to record a clip of himself doing the hand-flower dance.\u201cCan the punishment be changed?\u201d Fang Juexia asked.[Is Juexia embarrassed? Hahaha][God, if I were Juexia, I would definitely still be muddled, it was all too stimulating][Our beautiful baby is really miserable. He was clutched at by the neck and kissed, and he still has to suffer punishment lolololol]Jiang Miao laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s not my call.\u201d After saying that, he cast a gentle look over at the staff and said, \u201cHow about you work through things a bit more here? It\u2019ll be fine, everyone will wait for you.\u201dAs soon as this sentence was uttered, Fang Juexia\u2019s [not willing to trouble others] mechanism was triggered. He sighed silently and went to his room.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgBy now, the barrage was already covered in messages\u2014[AHHHHHHHHHH the ceremony is over, into the bridal chamber with you!!!][Congratulations to the two newlyweds!! A harmonious union lasting a hundred years!!!][999999999999999][Wtf, when I clicked in, I didn\u2019t think it would be so wonderful x][Holy shit, this group\u2019s livestream is too exciting lolololol I can actually witness people coming out of the closet with my own eyes in this lifetime hahahahaha][Juexia is really so coldly cute. He has no expression on his face, but he still obediently went in]The staff carried the recording equipment into the room, opened the closet door, and forced both of the people to hand over their cellphones to them. Fang Juexia took off his slippers and of his own free will, entered the inky-dark space, but Pei Tingsong kept pretty much shouting and yelling as Ling Yi and Lu Yuan tripped him up and tossed him into the closet.The door slammed shut.The staff maintained a bit of distance, so the camera could only capture the firmly closed closet door.Ling Yi\u2019s voice sounded out, \u201cThe two of you shouldn\u2019t even think about sneakily coming out\u00a0ah.\u00a0There\u2019s a camera Da Ge stationed outside, and everyone watching the stream is staring at you.\u201d Having said that, he pulled Lu Yuan away. \u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019re just in time to take a five minute break to go eat something.\u201dThe sound of footsteps got farther and farther away. Inside the closet, it was so dark that you couldn\u2019t even see your own fingers if you stretched your hand out. Many short coats hung down from above, and the only posture the two people could sit in was face to face with their knees bent. There was no space to place their four long legs comfortably, so they could only be bent and placed in a cramped position.With the closet door closed, this dark rectangular space was cut into two distinct regions, just like two disjoint magnetic fields, by a ray of light shining in from the crack of the door.Pei Tingsong, who had kept losing all night, had nursed a bellyful of anger throughout, and he had, through great effort, finally managed to not lose at something, but in the end, his outcome was to actually be forced to accompany the person getting punished. What kind of logic was this?He wanted to vent his grievances, and even more wanted to directly leave the closet, but there was a camera placed right outside.Leaving aside the punishment, he was even locked up with the person most contrary to himself in the entire group. Needless to say, this closet must be Fang Juexia\u2019s. The smell prevalent in here was exactly the same as that on the clothes he had on his body\u2014a lingering cold scent. It was just like the frosty breath that blew against one\u2019s face when one took a popsicle out from the freezer and then unwrapped it.Even his smell matched his person\u2014 No warmth, no emotions, just dull and indifferent.Compared with the wolf cub, who was at the edge of turning manic, Fang Juexia was much calmer about taking the punishment. He bent his right leg and curled up against it, then rested his chin in the curve of his elbow as he tilted his head and stared quietly at the closed closet door. Five minutes was 300 seconds, and that didn\u2019t count as too long a time.Ever since he was little, he was a child who loved to just sit in a daze, and the thing he did most often when in such a daze was to count the seconds as they passed. There was a very small clock hidden in his heart, a\u00a0tick tick tick\u00a0that could be heard clearly with every second that went by.In Fang Juexia\u2019s view, these so-called hardships were just emotional factors that people attached to time by themselves while at work. Within his ever-turning internal clock, time was forever objective and direct, and thus there were no emotions that could interfere with its operations.In this way, he could separate time and emotion, and whether he was sad or happy, the speed with which time passed always remained constant. There was no fleeting moment of happiness that darted away in a flash, and there was also no suffering that seemed to last a year. His mind remained calm because of the existence of this precision, no matter what happened.It was the same at this moment. As long as he counted the seconds away as usual, he could forget that this was some kind of punishment.Originally, they could have gotten through the full five minutes by being quiet. However, a burst of gurgling sounds broke this equilibrium, while also halting Fang Juexia\u2019s little internal clock.In the dark, he raised his chin slightly and looked sideways at the other person.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Pei Tingsong kept his voice low in fear of being recorded by the camera outside. The tone he used was fierce, but he seemed handsome for only a second before his stomach growled again. He quickly lowered his head and subconsciously covered his stomach with both of his hands.Although Fang Juexia\u2019s face didn\u2019t contain much emotion, he still turned around and stopped staring at the closet door. He knew that Pei Tingsong had had pretty much nothing to eat all night, so it was inevitable that he was hungry. If something like this had happened in the past, he would definitely have pretended that he hadn\u2019t heard anything. In any case, he was very clear on the fact that Pei Tingsong wouldn\u2019t die of starvation in five minutes.But Pei Tingsong had really been dragged into this punishment because of what he had drawn; he hadn\u2019t really lost that game, and he had even strived greatly to win.Fang Juexia reached out and felt around in the pocket of his pajamas in the dark. Before they had started to play the games, Ling Yi had handed him an individually wrapped mochi. Once the games had started, it had become too late for him to eat it, and he had the impression that he seemed to have stuffed it into his pocket.Sure enough, he found this unexpected ration hoard in his pocket and took it out.\u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s voice sounded out in the darkness, light and slow, as he said, \u201cI only have here\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong was unaware of what Fang Juexia was going to do this time around, so he grumpily interrupted, \u201cWhat? You feel like you haven\u2019t made me suffer miserably enough?\u201dJust when he threw out these words, he felt the other party fall into silence. This feeling was a little strange; it was as if on the other end of this darkness was a little animal who was hiding there, and as long as he browbeat him even a little, this animal would stay in his place and not dare to move.A slight thread of guilt rapidly shot up in his heart\u2026 a very little one.But after a few seconds, the things that happened completely deviated from the scene that Pei Tingsong had imagined. That small animal not only dared to move, it even made a very not-so-small movement. Under this heavy curtain of darkness, he couldn\u2019t see what Fang Juexia was doing, but the sudden sensation of hands fumbling around his body caught him off guard.Fang Juexia knew that it was useless to say anything more, so he directly reached out and wanted to give him the small snack in his hand. However, he couldn\u2019t see anything; the tiny bit of light coming from the crevice of the closet door might be somewhat useful to Pei Tingsong, but it was totally useless to him. Fang Juexia half-knelt on the floor of the closet and leaned forward. He stretched his hand out and groped around like a blind man. This kind of recklessness was a very rare occasion for him who had always been restrained and careful.His fingertips came into contact with the cotton coat, and after the clothes, he touched bone. Based on what his fingertips were touching, he came up with a picture of the scene in his mind.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dClear and distinct lines of his bones, and then to the right, was the collar of the shirt, and he even accidentally managed to rub against the exposed skin at the edge of the collar.\u00a0This was probably the shoulder,\u00a0Fang Juexia thought. His hand headed down, his target being reaching the other party\u2019s hand. But along the way, his slender fingertips glided past too many places, such as Pei Tingsong\u2019s chest, the words \u201cmelt for u\u201d on his chest, his tight waist and abdomen, and then further down.\u201cHey.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s voice was so deep that it fell straight into Fang Juexia\u2019s heart, just as he grabbed Fang Juexia\u2019s hand to stop him from recklessly groping about anymore.In the next moment, Pei Tingsong used some strength to pull Fang Juexia, who was already leaning towards him, closer to him.Time was really not objective. At this moment, the speed with which it passed by had slowed down infinitely, so that when Fang Juexia\u2019s body crossed the weak line of light coming in through the seam of the door, Pei Tingsong could clearly see the pink birthmark at the corner of his eye. It flashed in the dark, crossed the boundary of light, and then disappeared into the darkness again.Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t kneeling quite so stably, and as soon as he was pulled, he was forced into a position right in front of Pei Tingsong. The two of them almost ran into each other. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t know exactly how close they were, he only knew that he could feel the other person\u2019s warm breath directly now.At this moment, that infallible tiny clock hidden within his heart suddenly malfunctioned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 11Chapter 11 \u2013 Senses In The DarkTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksToday is the commemorative day of our TingJue\u2019s coming out of the closet!Fang Juexia\u2019s sense of time was thrown into chaos, and so was he.\u201cHere.\u201d He hastily stuffed the mochi into Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand, before forcibly pulling his arm away and returning to his half of the space within the dark closet.How many minutes were left? He tried to calculate the amount of time left, but the more he calculated, the more chaotic he felt instead. The second hand of his internal clock that had mis-ticked seemed to have gotten stuck in the rhythm of a beat that he couldn\u2019t get into, and even when he chased after it, he couldn\u2019t bring it back to its normal track. Finally, Fang Juexia could only choose to give up. He leaned his back against the wall of the closet and retracted his hands and feet as far back as possible. It seemed that staying in such a posture was safe.However, his little clock was broken, and he no longer had the confidence that he would remain calm and stable.To be honest, Pei Tingsong was a little confused about what had happened just now. He pinched the mochi in his hand, and from the packaging came the broken crinkling sounds of plastic being squeezed.Fang Juexia\u2019s perceptiveness was always delayed. His perception was slow in catching up, just like during the transferring the candy wrapper game before, where he was only startled by Pei Tingsong\u2019s swift and vicious attack, but felt nothing else. However, all of a sudden, the sound of the rustling of a package appeared in the silent wardrobe. This seemed to trigger some of the nerves in his sensory system, which then instantly pulled him back to the scene of that explosively competitive game.The sound of the rubbing of the cellophane candy wrapper brought about a reaction after a long delay\u2014his already red ears started to boil up.Just having his clock fail was enough, but now, even his perception was starting to go haywire.It turned out that Fang Juexia was trying to give him a snack. Only now had Pei Tingsong managed to figure out the other party\u2019s motivation.Then just say it directly\u00a0ah.Right, Fang Juexia had wanted to tell him directly in the beginning, but he had stopped him.The lively voices of their group members floated in from outside.Pei Tingsong felt powerless inside. Originally, he should have been one of them.\u201cYou want to dispatch me with just this\u2026\u201d He said in a low voice.Who would have known that under the cover of darkness, Fang Juexia would grab the initiative to say, \u201cThen throw it over here, and return it to me.\u201dHe tried to take the opportunity to get back his snack, although his tone seemed a little cold.\u201cDream on.\u201d Whatever had arrived in his hands would not be returned. He directly opened the package with his teeth and squeezed the soft mochi into his mouth.The moment it touched his lips, the familiar soft glutinous feeling caused Pei Tingsong to become lost in his thoughts.Clearly, during the process of playing the game, he had had no abnormal emotions, just a pure desire of wanting to win.But right now, it seemed as if his lips had been electrified, and this mochi led him down a path filled with intrigue and strange, wild thoughts.In the darkness, where no one could see anything, Pei Tingsong\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple rolled up and down in a flurry, and then he swallowed up the small soft thing, secretly vowing that he would never eat mochi again.Even so, the scene of when he had transferred the candy wrapper still lingered in his mind. The darker the surroundings became, the brighter the glimmer of Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes seemed to be.Under the darkness, a petri dish of emotions started to breed, and the accompanying silence allowed for\u00a0 a magnifying glass to be focused on all their senses.Only wanting to get away from some kind of train of thought that even he wasn\u2019t clear about, Pei Tingsong tried to break this silence. He stretched out his somewhat limp and numb legs and poked Fang Juexia, calling out, \u201cHey.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t I have a name?\u201dFang Juexia wasn\u2019t trying to make things hard for him on purpose, and was just asking this question without carrying any emotions about it. As a matter of fact, he had long been used to Pei Tingsong\u2019s wanton disregard, and he also didn\u2019t care much about the proper behavior that should be displayed with order of age. It was merely that at this moment, he felt very strange; everything was very strange.Pei Tingsong choked. He had originally wanted to ask Fang Juexia if he had anything else to eat, but now that he had been coldly counterattacked, his natural vicious behavior bounced right to the forefront.\u201cHow many times have you called my name?\u201d After saying this, he attempted to grab the cool guy\u2019s attention by getting closer, then using his knee to push apart Fang Juexia\u2019s legs, and giving an order in a rather commanding tone, \u201cHey, look at me.\u201dHis deliberately low voice sounded more oppressive like this. He maliciously pushed his knee in hard, pushing the other person\u2019s legs further apart, even going to the extent of stepping on his thighs. \u201cYou\u2019re not looking at me at all\u00a0ba?\u201dFang Juexia answered bluntly, \u201cI can\u2019t see you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s tone contained more mischievousness now, shadowed with a hint of a smile. Just as he was about to make his next move, the closet door was suddenly opened.The light caught them off guard.\u201cDang dang dang dang! Come out of the closet\u00a0ba!\u201d Ling Yi, who was holding the door of the closet, had the cameraman standing behind him. At first, he didn\u2019t see things clearly, but in the next second, he noticed that there was something strange about the positions of the people in the closet, especially Pei Tingsong\u2019s legs\u2026Standing beside Ling Yi, Lu Yuan gloated and said, \u201cYuan Ge is very pleased. It seems that in the past five minutes, you two have gotten along very well\u00a0ma.\u201dEyes that had been immersed in the dark always took some time to adjust to the brightness of the light that had suddenly returned. Fang Juexia squinted his eyes and lowered his head, while Pei Tingsong reached out his hand to block his eyes, while also quickly retracting his wanton legs.Of course, this scene was also immediately recorded by the camera and broadcasted on the livestream.[It\u2019s only been five minutes, but I\u2019ve missed you guys so much!! Quickly let mama peek at what you two are doing!][Hahahahahaha\u00a001\u00a0about to die of laughter, come out of the closet\u00a0la,\u00a0it really is][AHHHHHHHH WHAT KIND OF ADULTEROUS SCENE IS THIS!!! I feel faint!][Pinot Tree Supreme, where are you stepping with your feet!][WTF, what happened between the two of you to be in this position?? Why was there no cameraman in the closet! I hate it!][This scene contains the visual sense of the anti-pornography team directly breaking into the scene hhhhhh, especially with the way Juexia\u2019s lowering his head, as if admitting guilt][AHHHHHHHHH A BILLION TIMES WRONGED!! I want to see wardrobe play!!][Came out of the closet came out of the closet came out of the closet][Today is the commemorative day of our TingJue\u2019s coming out of the closet!]Pei Tingsong walked out first, mumbling to himself and suffocating to death.\u201cJust now we played another game outside, and then Lu Yuan lost, hahaha!\u201d Ling Yi said that and then couldn\u2019t stop laughing as he continued, \u201cHe had to record a clip of himself doing the flower hands!\u201dOnly then did Fang Juexia realize that they had been deceived when they had been told about a cameraman sitting outside, and that there had been no one outside the closet at all.His heart beat a little strangely, not following his body\u2019s usual rhythms. He attributed this to the lack of oxygen in the confined space.\u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d As soon as he got out, Xiao Pei started to forage for food. \u201cI\u2019ve been punished all night, quickly give me something to eat.\u201dLing Yi picked up a bag of food that had already been opened and was lying on the sofa. \u201cHey, eat this. Mochi, it\u2019s delicious.\u201d Then he took one out of the package and threw it at Pei Tingsong.This tiny little mochi drew an arc in the air. When it reached Pei Tingsong\u2019s arms, the way he reacted violently to it made it seem as if it had basically turned into a hot potato. \u201cI don\u2019t want this.\u201d After saying that, he threw it to He Ziyan. He Ziyan didn\u2019t manage to catch it, and the mochi bounced off his arm, and as luck would have it, fell into Fang Juexia\u2019s hands.Seeing this scene, Pei Tingsong walked away awkwardly, pretending that he hadn\u2019t seen anything. \u201cWhere\u2019s that half-full bag of chips from before?\u201dFang Juexia bowed his head and stared at the poor mochi\u00a0 that lay paralyzed in his palm. Finally, and still expressionless, he opened the bag and ate it himself.\u201cIs it delicious?\u201d Ling Yi pulled him in front of the sofa. \u201cI bought it.\u201dIt was delicious\u2026.Fang Juexia pursed his lips and then smoothed them out again. He gripped the transparent colored plastic wrapper and stuffed it into the pocket of his pajamas. Suddenly letting go of the squeezed packaging caused it to slowly rebound in this small fluffy space, making a slight but lingering rustling sound as it did so.\u201cDelicious.\u201dAfter everyone arrived, an interactive chat session was opened up. Each of them could feel the growing number of fans, and could also tell that there were a lot of new fans who couldn\u2019t manage to connect to the livestream right now. This was an exciting matter; after two years of hard work, they could finally be seen by everyone.\u201cLet\u2019s answer the fans\u2019 questions.\u201d Jiang Miao looked at the barrage rolling across the screen and automatically cued everyone up.Ling Yi and Lu Yuan gave him a lot of face and started clapping, \u201cOkay!\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d He Ziyan took a look at the screen and picked a question. \u201cThis fan friend with the ID of [Kaleido is my new obsession] asks, \u2018Are all the Gege in K using their original name? Do any of you have a stage name or an English name or something?\u2019\u201dHe then exchanged glances with Jiang Miao, who said with a smile, \u201cVery few people ask about this. Is it because our members\u2019 names are all pretty special?\u201dAs soon as this was mentioned, He Ziyan started up, \u201cOnly Ling Yi is special\u00a0ba.\u201dJust as he finished saying that, he and Lu Yuan started up a two-person act without any warning. Suddenly, they both cried out in unison, \u201cIs there a\u00a01?\u201d Lu Yuan even pulled open Ling Yi\u2019s coat, searched inside, and was kicked away by Ling Yi who yelled, \u201cNo! Scram!\u201dPei Tingsong had seen the video before, and he was laughing so hard that he was nearly spraying out the potato chips in his mouth. \u201cHahahahahaha.\u201d[Hahaha, no, I\u2019m going to go crazy with laughter from watching this silly group][Help, hahahahaha is there a 1 hahahahahaha][Look at 01\u2019s expression hahahaha, damn 01 is too miserable hhhh]\u201cYou guys are bullying me again!\u201d In the beginning, Ling Yi swung his arms around like a little chicken paddling in the water, putting up a desperate fight against He Ziyan and Lu Yuan. He was restrained by Fang Juexia and Jiang Miao with difficulty, and Jiang Miao held back a smile as he said, \u201cOkay, okay, don\u2019t get angry with the two of them.\u201dFang Juexia suddenly, and also rather absent-mindedly, added, \u201cIf you damage yourself by being angry, there\u2019s no one to replace you.\u201d[Hahahahaha Teacher Fang gradually becomes meaner]He Ziyan, who had laughed enough, covered his stomach and sat upright before saying, \u201cOkay, okay, okay, seriously answering the question now. All six of us are using our original names. We have no stage names or English names. Maybe the company didn\u2019t make any overseas plans at that time?\u201dLu Yuan directly exposed everything, \u201cThe company is so poor, how can it afford to do overseas planning?\u201dLing Yi said, \u201cIt\u2019s fortunate that they didn\u2019t make any such plans, since we haven\u2019t gotten that popular.\u201dPei Tingsong said, \u201cThis group\u2019s biggest strong point is that we all know ourselves.\u201d[Hahahaha Teacher Yuan is awesome!][Boss is watching you!][Pei Tingsong, you didn\u2019t inherit this advantage, and you\u2019re the one who knows himself the least!][Fuck! Three consecutive hits, hahahaha, what\u2019s with this group!]Jiang Miao looked at the barrage and said, \u201cWhat about Juexia? Ah, yes, Juexia is his real name.\u201dFang Juexia immediately nodded and said, \u201cYes, my mama came up with it, because my birthday is June 26, and I was born in the\u00a0summer.\u201d\u201cJuexia\u2019s name comes from ancient poetry,\u201d Jiang Miao added, \u201cXiao Pei\u2019s is also from ancient poetry, isn\u2019t it?\u201dXiao Pei had a Pocky dangling from his mouth, and he looked at the camera and asked, \u201cDoes my name sound nice?\u201d[Sounds nice!!!][It has both Ting and Song, you were born to be a\u00a0singer!]Jiang Miao suddenly thought of something and said, \u201cAh, but Xiao Pei grew up in the United States, so maybe he has an English name\u00a0ba.\u201d He glanced at Xiao Pei as he continued, \u201cWe actually really don\u2019t know.\u201dHowever, Pei Tingsong directly shook his head. \u201cNo, when I was there, everyone just directly called me Song. The pronunciation wasn\u2019t a barrier, and Americans would also find it strange to come up with another name when you already have\u00a0one. And my grandfather said that one should be proud of their origin and their name.\u201d[Your grandfather feels very stylish]Ling Yi said, \u201cTelling you guys secretly, Xiao Pei\u2019s grandfather is a writer\u00a0oh, and he\u2019s published a collection of poems.\u201d[Wow! Your grandfather is so awesome!][I feel that Xiao Pei\u2019s family is especially magical. No wonder Xiao Pei is so talented!]Lu Yuan stared at the screen. \u201cSomeone is asking why Xiao Pei\u2019s Chinese is so good.\u201d\u201cI grew up in a bilingual environment.\u201d Pei Tingsong explained, \u201cMy grandfather used Chinese with me, and I used English with my mom. When I was a child, my grandfather took me to read Chinese books, and he taught me how to write characters using a brush.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t know anything about any of this. He listened in silence, and some particular thoughts came to his mind. Sure enough, people\u2019s inherited genes would be responsible for many things, eventually evolving into those so-called ingrained bad habits or those inborn talents. He could verify that fact just by looking at Pei Tingsong.\u201cIn short, I don\u2019t have an English name. Everyone should just call me by my real name.\u201d Pei Tingsong emphasized again, \u201cIt\u2019s Pei, not Fei.\u201d[Hahahahahaha take off the\u00a0yi\u00a0and start up the\u00a0wen\u00a0Xiao Pei]The corners of Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth couldn\u2019t help but draw up upon being cued like this. It just so happened that this sentence had also made Pei Tingsong think of him, and so the two people\u2019s gazes collided unexpectedly.Pei Tingsong mouthed at him\u2014what are you laughing at?Fang Juexia raised his hand, pulled down the rising corner of his mouth with his index finger and thumb, and returned to his expressionless state.Before Pei Tingsong could bask in his satisfaction, Ling Yi, who had suddenly hooked his arm around his neck from behind him, shouted, \u201cXiao Pei, I\u2019ll give you an English name!\u201dLong years of doing crosstalk with him gave Lu Yuan the opportunity to immediately respond, \u201cYou withdraw, let me do it!\u201d He covered Ling Yi\u2019s mouth and said, \u201cPei Tingsong\u2019s English name is Listen and Song\u2026\u201d\u201cPei,\u201d He Ziyan added his surname to it and in the imitation of a foreign accent, dragged out the name.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Finally, he used the leopard\u2019s legs to strangle He Ziyan\u2019s neck.[Hahahahahaha the group bully is worthy of being the group bully. One against three!][hhhh look at Juexia! He\u2019s quietly, and bit by bit, moving further away from the battlefield, hahahaha]Only after the usual consequence of their group leader stepping in to mediate between them did Kaleido restore its\u00a0veneer\u00a0of team harmony and everyone sat back in place. Jiang Miao was half dead with exhaustion as he asked, \u201cWhat were we doing just now?\u201dFang Juexia, who was in charge of being the rational one, looked up and raised his hand, like the only student in the class who was listening, and said, \u201cAnswering the fans\u2019 questions.\u201d\u201cOh, yes, yes.\u201d Jiang Miao took a deep breath. \u201cThen let\u2019s find another one.\u201d Cheng Qiang, who was behind him, pointed at the clock, and Jiang Miao immediately understood the cue as he suggested, \u201cThis will be the last question. How\u2019s this, Juexia will take a screenshot of the barrage, and then Lu Yuan will pick a question from it.\u201dWith Fang Juexia\u2019s less talkative personality, he basically ended up being a wallflower on any program he was a part of, so Jiang Miao often went out of his way to cue him and give him more camera time.\u201cScreenshot it, here.\u201d Fang Juexia handed his cellphone over to Lu Yuan.\u201cOkay\u00a0lei.\u201d Lu Yuan carefully went through the screenshot, and suddenly, his eyes brightened and he announced, \u201cI\u2019ve decided it\u2019s you! The ID called [Wild Boy Pei Tingsong]\u2026.pfft.\u201d\u201cHahahahahaha wild boy listen and song!\u201d Ling Yi started laughing so hard that his whole person bent over into Juexia\u2019s chest, and then he was gasping for breath even as he continued, \u201cHahahahaha!\u201dJuexia also laughed and patted Ling Yi\u2019s arm while warning, \u201cYou\u2019re about to swoon.\u201d[AHHHHHHHH jxgg is so doting!][The\u00a0Nap\u00a0CP has red hot interactions!!!]In the face of his Geges\u2019 merciless ridicule, Pei Tingsong showed a fake smile and stated, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? I think this ID is very cool.\u00a0Swag.\u201d\u201cCough,\u201d Lu Yuan held back a smile. \u201cThis fan is asking if Kaleido has an official name for their fans? Our K fans can\u2019t not have an official name\u00a0ah.\u201d He vividly imitated the excited tones their fans usually used.He Ziyan pulled the pink leopard doll that had been used just now into his hands. \u201cThere actually is an official name for the fans.\u201dJiang Miao nodded and added, \u201cYes, our boss came up with it himself. Because our group\u2019s name is Kaleido, then based on homophony, Boss named our fans Domino.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t it sound like a spell?\u201d Ling Yi picked up a small toy hammer to act out a little fairy casting a spell with a wand and waved it around while chanting, \u201cKaleidomino!\u201d[Hahaha 01 is really so cuuute, there\u2019s nothing in his head][You saying it like that even makes me myself feel cuter~]\u201cThis name actually has a profound meaning,\u201d Ling Yi explained, before throwing the hammer away. \u201cEveryone knows that there are usually a lot of domino tiles, and all of them are small and very cute\u00a0ma,\u00a0just like our fans!\u201dLu Yuan shot a disgusted glance at him and said, \u201cWhat kind of explanation was that\u00a0ah?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with it?! Then you explain it!\u201d[K: Sorry, we really don\u2019t know what the name for our fans means.][Hahahahahaha, I\u2019m going to be angry! Is our name so unimportant?][It\u2019s obvious that no one listened during the planning meeting hhhh, but this Domino name is pretty good]The two of them continued to talk all over each other, while Jiang Miao bumped Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cJuexia, come explain?\u201dOnly then did Fang Juexia, who had been watching this play silently the entire time, open his mouth and replied, \u201cI actually\u2026also don\u2019t remember what the boss said at that time.\u201dHearing this, Pei Tingsong, who had originally also gotten pulled into the fray with Lu Yuan and the others, also felt amused and laughed.[Hahahahahaha Juexia is too honest]\u201cBut I really like this name.\u201dFang Juexia considered his words for a bit before saying, \u201cHow to say it\u2026? Dominoes is a team game. I even participated in a domino-toppling competition with a small team when I was still a student. In this competition, participants needed to place these dominoes one by one, one after the other, which is a matter that requires a lot of patience and precision. Finally, just by pushing the first tile, you can make each of the other following tiles fall down one after the other. If even one tile in this train of tiles doesn\u2019t fall, then all that remains is a very small probability of success.\u201dHe seldom said so many words, so he felt a bit unused to it. He also felt that he had deviated from the main topic a little, so he explained further, \u201cEn\u2026 In fact, I just think the process of playing this game is very similar to the feelings of our fans. You are all encouraging us and waiting for us with your greatest patience and perseverance. You\u2019re just like a series of well-behaved dominoes waiting in your positions. Every single person is indispensable.\u201dWhile saying all this, Fang Juexia had forgotten to even look at the camera. Whenever he got lost in his thoughts, his eyes would look upwards unconsciously. So, right now, he was being illuminated by the ceiling lamp of the living room, and his eyes and eyebrows appeared incomparably tender.\u201cMoreover, you guys are also very clear on the fact that a group becoming wildly successful is quite a remote possibility, but even then, everyone still continues to give us their very unselfish love and support to allow us to carry on. En\u2026\u201dWhen Fang Juexia had started talking, Pei Tingsong had been disdainful, thinking that he had nothing to say, and so had just started talking some nonsense. But gradually, Fang Juexia\u2019s explanation began to resonate with him. He was also acutely aware that Fang Juexia\u2019s thoughts had now hit a roadblock, so he opened his mouth and continued his words, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dFang Juexia froze for a moment. He had almost never heard Pei Tingsong agree with him before, so this surprised him.\u201cJuexia Ge is right. Domino-toppling is a game that requires a lot of endurance, and if you\u2019re even just a little bit careless, you may fall short of success, and end up facing a field of collapsed tiles. And you will experience collapses like these over and over again. This is a lot like how\u2026 you guys know that there will be many setbacks and defeats faced during the development of a group, but you guys still keep accompanying us.\u201d He smiled at the camera. \u201cYou guys don\u2019t give up, but instead pick up the fallen tiles and set them up straight again and again.\u201d There was sincere admiration on his face as he uttered, \u201cRespect.\u201dNo one could have imagined that Pei Tingsong, who possessed the least sense of belonging to the group, could have ever spoken words like these. In this situation, everyone else around him was a bit stunned. He Ziyan was the first one to reach out with his hand and pat him on the shoulder. \u201cYes, really thanking everyone so much. Without you guys, we couldn\u2019t have held on until now, and you guys are the best!\u201dLu Yuan clapped and echoed, \u201cThat\u2019s right! Dominoes are the best!\u201dJiang Miao smiled and added, \u201cI hope that we can keep showing everyone a new view, just like a kaleidoscope, and also hope that all Dominoes can accompany us, one by one, step by step, never stopping.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s create the last miracle together\u00a0ba.\u201dThe livestream ended at 9:30 p.m. After seeing the staff and Cheng Qiang out the door, the six of them played a few games in the dormitory, and had fun until around 11 or 12, when they finally started feeling sleepy. Only then did Pei Tingsong remember that he had not made his bed, nor did he have any bedding to make his bed with right now.\u201cYou\u2019re really like you\u2019ve just come to the countryside, too miserable.\u201dSo all he could piece together was that Ling Yi and He Ziyan\u2019s bedding had just been changed, with the previous ones not being washed yet, and that Jiang Miao and Lu Yuan\u2019s bunkbed was a whole size smaller than theirs, so none of these people\u2019s bedding would work.There was only Fang Juexia\u2019s left.One was not willing to lend it out, and the other wasn\u2019t willing to make his bed with it, but there was no other way; after all, Pei Tingsong had to sleep.Fang Juexia opened the cabinet and took out the sheets that he had changed and laundered to give to Pei Tingsong, along with a new quilt he hadn\u2019t used. To be honest, he was a bit of a neat freak, and underneath his still expression, his heart had already become filled with turbulent waves.What to do, did he really have to lend it to him? He had never shared these kinds of things with others; sharing clothes was already the furthest limit of what he could bear.What to do now? He could just refuse, but he couldn\u2019t let Pei Tingsong sleep in such a manner for a night; he was also so tall, so he couldn\u2019t squeeze into someone else\u2019s bed\u2026.It would still be better to lend it to him\u00a0ba. It was just this once, and that was fine, it was no problem.\u201cHey.\u201d Pei Tingsong crossed his arms over his chest and stared at Fang Juexia. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201dHe was determinedly clinging to his quilt and sheets, looking like a rabbit protecting its food.Fang Juexia returned to his senses. He decided that he still had to be a good Gege, so he hesitantly extended his arms out front.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia was stuck mid-sentence for a long time and didn\u2019t know what he should order the other person to do. He was also very clear that it was useless to order the little demon king Pei Tingsong to do anything.\u201cThanks\u00a0la.\u201d Pei Tingsong took hold of the sheets and the quilt, wanting to accept them, but the other party still didn\u2019t subconsciously let go. So, he pulled at it a bit, and nearly ended up pulling Fang Juexia into his arms.He was really a strange person. Wasn\u2019t it just some sheets and bedding? Instead, he was acting as if it was his life that was required.However, Pei Tingsong was a young master, who, from a very young age, only had to open his mouth to get food delivered into it, so even if he had the bedding in his hands, he was completely lost on how to make a bed. Fang Juexia watched his performance\u2014 where he pulled at the sheet and bent his waist around the bed for 20 minutes, before he couldn\u2019t watch anymore, and helplessly offered his aid, \u201cLet me do it\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cOkay\u00a0ah.\u201d Pei Tingsong took this aid as a matter of course and acted as a master who only asks others to do things instead of doing them himself. He went around to the other side and opened the window. The night view outside was beautiful, and he leaned half of his body out the window to see the curling vine of wisteria growing at the side of the building. Its green tendrils were all curled up, and it was a rare sign of vitality in the midst of winter.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgIt seemed to have grown over to this side from the balcony next door.\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201dHearing Fang Juexia\u2019s voice, Pei Tingsong turned around. The bed had been made neatly and tidily, without any wrinkles. The quilt had also been covered into the bed cover, and was even folded into a square tofu block shape, just like how Fang Juexia\u2019s was next door.This guy couldn\u2019t actually be some kind of domestic robot\u00a0ba?\u201cThank\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish saying thank you, Fang Juexia turned away stiffly, his indifferent back causing Pei Tingsong\u2019s next words to stick in his throat.The whole bed smelled of Fang Juexia, just like the way his clothes and his closet did. Pei Tingsong, who was wrapped in this soft, cold fragrance, turned his head to look out the window.It seemed as if he was wrapped in the moonlight.At the thought that his sheets and quilts were all being used by another person, and were covering him on the top and cushioning him at the bottom, Fang Juexia just couldn\u2019t sleep, and kept turning around in his bed like a pancake that just could not be thoroughly cooked.Separated by a wall, these two people suffered from insomnia together.As Kaleido\u2019s popularity had recently seen a rise, many marketing accounts had already recorded the livestream, with the expectation of finding some explosive moments that would increase their own traffic.But there were too many explosive moments in that livestream, too many to even count. So in the early hours of the next day, the keywords [Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong\u2019s candy wrapper kiss] directly appeared in the Hot Search list, and its popularity kept climbing. Fans watched as it gradually rose from the bottom of the list to reach second place. The next morning, entries such as [Kaleido crosstalk group] and [Kaleido fans\u2019 name] had also appeared on the list.Fang Juexia had been forced off his original variety show and had thus lost his only daily journey outside. However, his lifestyle habits had always been healthy\u2014 which consisted of getting up early in the morning and then running a small circle around the neighborhood before returning to the dormitory. His room had a balcony, which had been empty when he first moved in. Now, it was already full of flowers and plants.His mother was a person with a very strong sense of life. Their small house in Guangzhou had been decorated by her to be warm and beautiful, with the small garden on the first floor being filled with flowers and plants. When he was a child, he had watered and loosened the soil with his mama. Now that he had grown up, he still had the habit of taking care of his own small garden very seriously.Plants were as simple as math problems. As long as you followed the rules for their growth and spent ten times the required amount of patience on them, these little guys would reward you with the most beautiful results.Ling Yi and their group leader had things to do, and so left early in the morning. By the time he returned home from his morning run, Fang Juexia saw Lu Yuan\u2019s\u00a0Gudetama\u00a0slippers lying by the door, so realised that he had probably gone to dance practice. Thinking that He Ziyan should still be in the dorm, classmate Xiao Fang, after finishing his work in his garden, made two egg salad and bacon sandwiches, and also brewed two cups of coffee.Only when he walked up to He Ziyan\u2019s door did he suddenly remember that Pei Tingsong had also moved back into the dorms.In order to avoid facing any dangerous elements, Fang Juexia\u2019s hand, which was about to knock on the door, stopped in midair. He simply pulled it back, and instead called He Ziyan on his cellphone.The call was picked up after it rang a few times on the other end. \u201cJuexia? What\u2019s the matter?\u201dHis voice didn\u2019t sound like he had just woken up. Fang Juexia asked, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\u201cOh, Jiang Miao has low blood sugar and doesn\u2019t feel good. He sent me a message, so now I\u2019ve bought some stuff and I\u2019m going to go find him.\u201dFang Juexia heard the sound of the GPS and realised that he was driving. \u201cOkay\u00a0ba, then be careful on the way.\u201d\u201cDid you come find me for something?\u201d He Ziyan asked.\u201cNo, just saw that you weren\u2019t here, and so was just asking.\u201dAfter hanging up the call, Fang Juexia held his cellphone and was getting ready to leave. Unexpectedly, the door to He Ziyan\u2019s room was suddenly opened. Pei Tingsong, dressed in dark gray pajamas, was now standing in front of him. His hair was ruffled from sleep, and the low pressure of having not gotten enough sleep surrounded him.Fang Juexia felt a little guilty. He stood still and blinked at him.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough for you to stand here when making a phone call, but you also have to block my way\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong stretched, and when he brought his arms down, he coincidentally patted the brim of Fang Juexia\u2019s hat. \u201cIf I end up late for school in a bit, are you going to explain it to the professor?\u201d\u201cOh, right.\u201d Fang Juexia quickly straightened his hat. It was only then that he remembered that this guy was still a college student.Pei Tingsong quickly washed up; his mouth was parched, so he planned to go to the refrigerator to find something to drink, but when he walked over to the kitchen, he found two breakfasts laid out on the table.Fang Juexia changed his clothes, came out, and found that Pei Tingsong had already sat down at the table and was eating the breakfast he had originally prepared for his roommate.Pei Tingsong drank a mouthful of coffee, and contentedly stretched before saying, \u201cSo you still count as possessing a bit of conscience, knowing to prepare breakfast for the youngest in the group who has to take morning classes.\u201dActually, it wasn\u2019t made for you\u2014Fang Juexia responded in his heart. But he didn\u2019t plan to say it out loud; anyway, this breakfast would become wasted if it just sat there. After washing his hands, he also sat down, finished his share, and then cleaned up without saying a word.When Xiao Wen called, Fang Juexia pressed the speakerphone button and placed the phone by the kitchen counter.\u201cJuexia?\u201d\u201cEn, you talk, I\u2019m listening.\u201d\u201cOkay\u00a0lei, I\u2019ll report your guys\u2019 itinerary to you,\u201d Xiao Wen banged out a lot of words, and then added, \u201cBy the way, there is a new event in the next two days. Next Monday night, the Spring Festival party on the CloudTV platform will be livestreamed online. One of their guests dropped out of the program because of illness, so let\u2019s go replace them. Everyone needs to practice the main single a bit and then go to rehearsal on Sunday night. There\u2019s not even two days left, so it\u2019s a bit of a rush.\u201dFang Juexia let out an \u201cen\u201d and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just as well that I don\u2019t have any personal events recently, so I\u2019ll practice it well.\u201d\u201cWho would worry about you\u00a0ah, mainly it\u2019s that group bully\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong suddenly appeared behind Fang Juexia and picked up his cellphone, responding, \u201cWhat group bully? I\u2019m right here, so talk a bit more carefully for me.\u201dXiao Wen, who was on the other end of the phone, was so scared that he choked on his own saliva. \u201cCough, cough, cough, Xiao-Xiao Pei, how are you right next to Juexia?\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s hands were wet, so he couldn\u2019t grab his cellphone back at this moment. He didn\u2019t expect Xiao Pei to take the initiative to put the cellphone aside and keep talking, \u201cI\u2019m in the dormitory, and so is he, is that not okay?\u201d After saying so, he turned and walked away, as if looking for something, murmuring to himself about keys and so on.\u201cOh, right, right, you moved back to the dorms.\u201d Xiao Wen pressed his chest and after finishing his report on the events for the next few days, he didn\u2019t have anything else to add. \u201cThen you guys get along well\u00a0ah. I have to go to a meeting, so I\u2019ll hang up first. Bye bye!\u201dGet along well.These words made Fang Juexia want to laugh.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Fang Juexia turned a deaf ear towards him and washed the dishes in silence.\u201cDo you have a car?\u201d Pei Tingsong put on his hat while walking over; he was even still wearing yesterday\u2019s lavender-gray sweater.Fang Juexia shook the water off of his hands and said, \u201cYes.\u201d Although it wasn\u2019t a fancy car, it could be used instead of walking. However, he wasn\u2019t planning on going out of his way to help, and so suggested, \u201cYou can call a taxi.\u201dPei Tingsong raised his hand and glanced at his watch before replying, \u201cIt would be very difficult to call one now.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m going to the company later.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s on the way, see me off first\u00a0ba.\u201d Pei Tingsong dragged Fang Juexia to the hallway, nimbly took down his white down jacket from the hanger by the door, wrapped it around his body, and quickly pulled the zipper up with a swish. \u201cQuickly.\u201dThis person was really just\u2026 Fang Juexia didn\u2019t know how to describe him.He was different from everyone else he\u2019d ever met before.The results were obvious. Fang Juexia parked his car outside the entrance of P University, where people were coming and going, and pushed his hat down onto his face. The person in the passenger seat was sleeping soundly. When he was woken up by Fang Juexia, he frowned and even pulled down his wool cap to cover his eyes.Fang Juexia sighed and surprised him by saying, \u201cThey\u2019re taking attendance now.\u201dPei Tingsong woke up with a start. He pushed his hat up and stared at him for three seconds. Fang Juexia opened the car door and said, \u201cGet out of the car.\u201d\u201cSo fast?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t fast at all. During the 20 minutes it had taken to drive here, they had passed six traffic lights, and they had had to wait for more than 40 seconds at four of those. Fortunately, the traffic wasn\u2019t too heavy at this time of the day.Using the rearview mirror, Pei Tingsong tidied up his hat, got out of the car, and closed the door. Tilting his head, he waved to Fang Juexia in the car, and said, \u201cThanks.\u201dFang Juexia nodded and watched Pei Tingsong trot into the campus with everyone else, carrying his school bag on his back. His cellphone rang, and it was his mama sending him a message.[Juexia, Mama was watching the program at home and discovered that you weren\u2019t in the previous episode. Did you get sick?]Only then did Fang Juexia remember that he had forgotten to tell his Mama about the show. There had been too many things happening recently, so he hadn\u2019t thought that even those parts of his that had already been recorded had been completely cut out.[No, I\u2019m in very good health, but I didn\u2019t feel like filming for that program anymore, so I left. Don\u2019t worry, Mama, I\u2019ll call you in the evening.]After editing his message and sending it, Fang Juexia got ready to start the car and depart. However, as soon as he looked down, he found a card lying on the passenger seat, one which was even covered with a matte black card cover. He flipped over the card, and sure enough, there was a picture of Pei Tingsong.Even his campus ID card photo emitted the arrogant air of a demon king.He wanted to send a message to Pei Tingsong to let him know about this, but found that he did not have any of Pei Tingsong\u2019s contact information.It was just a campus card. At worst, once he got back to the dorms, he could put it on Pei Tingsong\u2019s desk.Fang Juexia held the little card and looked at the bright smile shown by the youngest in their group in the ID picture. He thought about his own feelings, of what it felt like to lose his campus card when he was in school.Without a card, you couldn\u2019t eat, and you couldn\u2019t go to the library. There were also some classrooms you couldn\u2019t enter without swiping your card.Ugh.Fang Juexia finally stuffed the card into his pocket, undid his seat belt, and got out of the car. Fortunately, he had a very good memory. During breakfast, he had heard Pei Tingsong murmuring to himself when he had brought up his schedule on his cellphone to confirm the building number. The campus was bustling, so he put on his mask and lowered his hat. However, because he wasn\u2019t very familiar with this place, even after he walked a bit of a ways away based on the map, he still did not manage to find the building Pei Tingsong had mentioned.It seemed that he would still have to find someone to ask him for directions.With just this small walk, he had already been noticed by many girls. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t really want to expose himself, and looking around, he suddenly saw a very tall boy in front of him. His back looked very reliable, so Fang Jeuxia quickly walked over to him and lowered his mask.\u201cExcuse me, I want to ask\u2026\u201dThe moment the other party turned around, Fang Juexia was startled.Wasn\u2019t this\u2026 Zhou Ziheng who had filmed \u201cEscape For Your Life\u201d along with the senior from his company?Even though he was wearing a pair of black rimmed glasses, Fang Juexia could see past them straight away. It was only at this time that he remembered that Zhou Ziheng was indeed studying at P University as well. He felt that it was a bit impolite for him to freeze up like this mid-sentence, so he cleared his throat and finished asking his question.\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s over there. You turn right and cross the path, and it\u2019s that gray one.\u201d Zhou Ziheng pointed and gave directions. \u201cVery close by.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Fang Juexia bowed. \u201cThank you, senior.\u201dWho knew that the widely famous top class actor\u2019s eyes would suddenly shine and that he would suddenly ask, \u201cSure enough! I was just wondering about how familiar you looked, are you from Kaleido? Why are you here?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m Fang Juexia.\u201d He raised his head, and the wind blew the brim of his hat upwards, enough to reveal his forehead and the red birthmark at the corner of his eyes. \u201cI\u2026 came to give something to the youngest of our group.\u201d\u201cOh, I know, Pei Tingsong\u00a0ba, he\u2019s pretty famous around the school.\u201d Zhou Ziheng was satisfied with his memory and reached to pat him on the shoulder like a senior member would as he said, \u201cI like your guys\u2019 songs a lot. I have to go to the laboratory, so I\u2019ll leave first\u00a0la.\u201dSeeing this senior performer leave, Fang Juexia felt that it was a little strange. It turned out that the actor who usually looked so imposing actually had such a friendly and easy-going personality.Based on the directions, he found the building that Pei Tingsong was having class in.\u201c422\u2026\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia silently read the number and entered the elevator. However, he soon regretted his decision. The elevator was narrow and there were mirrors on all sides. He could clearly feel the girls around him looking at him, especially the one standing right in front of him, who had rushed into the elevator in a hurry. Fang Juexia lowered the brim of his hat as much as possible to cover his birthmark, then lowered his head and stared at his shoes.\u201cHello\u2026\u201d A girl\u2019s hesitant voice sounded out. \u201cAre you Fang Juexia?\u201dSure enough, he was still recognized. Fang Juexia looked up and laughed, neither admitting nor denying it. The other party felt that he had admitted it, so her tone was jubilant, and she even began to stutter, \u201cOh my god, good god, I love you so much!\u201d She seemed to have thought of something while saying this, and her eyes brightened as she asked, \u201cJuexia Gege, did you come here today to find Pei Tingsong?! I-I\u2019m in the same class as him! Today\u2019s class!\u201dFang Juexia glanced at the time in the upper right hand corner of the elevator\u2019s electronic display board and then focused his gaze back onto the girl. In a very objective manner, he said, \u201cThen you\u2019re already late.\u201d\u201cSure enough!\u201d The girl grew more excited and exclaimed, \u201cYou came here just to find Xiao Pei! Oh my God. I didn\u2019t stay up reading the Hot Search until 3 am last night in vain. It\u2019s so real, it\u2019s so real\u2026 \u201d She then covered her mouth as if she were afraid of making any noise, seeming just like a strange little animal.What was so real?Fang Juexia was at a complete loss.Pei Tingsong was sitting in a seat right next to the door and facing the window, and he was listening to the lecture, when suddenly, a voice came in through the door, and a late girl crept in. Not many people took this course, so there was an excess of empty seats. As soon as this girl came in, she sat directly in front of Pei Tingsong.After glancing at her once, he continued to listen to the professor.\u201c\u2019The\u00a0Ship of Theseus\u00a0has a reasoning similar to that of a typical\u00a0Sorites paradox, but it is different in essence: the predicate used in the latter is the initial logical\u00a0predicate, and it is a typical\u00a0fuzzy predicate\u2026\u201dWhen the professor on the platform mentioned the Ship of Theseus, Pei Tingsong stopped twirling the pen in his hand and couldn\u2019t help being distracted. It seemed that he was now that great ship that was constantly being disassembled, and everyone was always forcing him to replace old parts with new parts.After replacing every deck and every part, was he still himself?How could you manage to preserve your true self.Just as his mind was wandering, the girl in front of him suddenly turned around and put a card on his desk. It was clearly his campus ID card.Pei Tingsong was stunned and wondered if she had picked it up after it had fallen down somewhere. So he said thanks in a soft voice as he took back the card.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d The girl lowered her voice. \u201cSomeone asked me to give it to you and told me not to tell you who they were.\u201dSince she had said it in such a way, Pei Tingsong naturally asked, \u201cWho?\u201d\u201cJuexia Gege,\u201d The girl\u2019s expression suddenly turned excited as she continued speaking, \u201cHe just left\u00a0la.\u201dFang Juexia?He subconsciously looked out of the window. In fact, Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t expect to see anything, so he wasn\u2019t clear on what had motivated him to do this. However, he just happened to catch sight of the figure wrapped in a snow-white down jacket as he walked on the path downstairs, and his slender legs walking step by step along the path, as he gradually left his sight.Pei Tingsong placed a hand against his cheek and tapped his right index finger on the campus ID card.This was really beyond his expectations. He hadn\u2019t expected that Fang Juexia would actually make an extra trip for him. Plainly, during the livestream last night, he had felt that this person\u2019s shell had softened a little, but after one night, it seemed that he had recovered that ice cold appearance of his.But then again, why didn\u2019t he just directly send him a WeChat message?Only then did Pei Tingsong remember that he did not even have the contact information of this person, and not a single way to contact him at all.After he had returned to the dormitory, He Ziyan\u2019s phone rang.[Xiao Pei: Yan Ge, send me Fang Juexia\u2019s WeChat\u00a0ba.]Pei Tingsong held his cellphone. He had been listening to the professor attentively all along, but now he seemed to be unable to concentrate at this moment. He waited a long time before receiving He Ziyan\u2019s reply.[Ziyan Ge: What? Are you guys doing fanservice?]This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org[Ziyan Ge: Kaleido groupchat has him\u00a0ah, silly Didi.][Ziyan Ge: The one called\u00a0Non-differentiable Life]Pei Tingsong frowned. What kind of WeChat username was that\u2014Non-differentiable Life?Anyway, he still clicked on Fang Juexia\u2019s WeChat and opened it. His profile picture looked strange at first, but after he enlarged it, he could see that it was an empty Sudoku array. Clearly, even though he was born with a pretty face that everyone coveted, his core was as rigid as it could be.Sure enough, this Fang Juexia didn\u2019t possess a single thing that they could be in harmony on.Although he complained about this person internally, Pei Tingsong still sent him a friend request. Midway through the class break, he was lying on the table trying to make up some sleep, since he hadn\u2019t managed to get enough the previous night. However, just as he put his arm under his head, he smelled the cold scent that had emanated from the bed yesterday, which suddenly pulled him back to his insomniac state from the previous night.This scent was really stubborn, just like its owner.Pei Tingsong suddenly raised his head, startling the boy who was sitting next to him. The other party thought that this person wanted to go out, so he was getting ready to get up so that he could let him out, but unexpectedly, Pei Tingsong reached out and pulled him back.\u201cClassmate, let me ask you a question.\u201dThe boy sitting at the same desk felt a little flattered. After all, this person was an idol, and was also a student who had won the highest level scholarship available for gifted students without much effort. The professor had even praised him as talented, and he was always a loner. No matter which circle it was, he didn\u2019t interact much with anyone. The boy had never thought that such a person would actually come to him to ask for advice. He cleared his throat and fully prepared himself psychologically for the unexpected examination of his knowledge and upcoming academic discussion. \u201cG-go ahead.\u201dWho knew that this unconventional top student would suddenly stick his arm out in front of the boy\u2019s nose, his expression nearly looking superstitious as he asked, \u201cCan you smell something?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d The boy was confused.\u201cSmell it.\u201d Pei Tingsong even specially rolled up his sleeves a bit.Although the boy didn\u2019t know why he was asking this, he still obediently sniffed, and then answered, \u201cEn\u2026there\u2019s something.\u201dSure enough, that smell was still around! Pei Tingsong then asked, \u201cDoes it smell good?\u201dThe boy didn\u2019t know what kind of answer he wanted to hear, so he could only state the facts, \u201cSmells good\u00a0ya\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat smells good?!\u201d Pei Tingsong suddenly flared up. He pulled his arm back and smelled it again. He then said to himself, \u201cWhere does it smell good? Why does it smell good now?\u201dHis male classmate was utterly baffled, and was still pondering on what exactly had happened, when the other party again extended his arm out and ordered, \u201cYou smell it again.\u201dThis time, he must know the right answer\u00a0ba.He pretended to be very serious, and after smelling it again, he went against his conscience and said, \u201cEn, it doesn\u2019t smell good, it smells very bad.\u201dWho knew that Pei Tingsong would retrieve his hand again and frown. \u201cWho are you saying doesn\u2019t smell good?\u201dThe boy: ???He was completely stupefied as he watched Pei Tingsong sniff repeatedly at his collar and arms, continuously muttering to himself. He really didn\u2019t know what to make of it. The bell rang, signalling that class would be starting, and this poor temporary table mate of Pei Tingsong\u2019s finally achieved salvation from this mire of a dilemma.Sure enough, there was a wall between geniuses and ordinary human beings like them.It was already noon by the time Fang Juexia finished his dance practice. Only then did he discover the friend request on his WeChat.This person\u2019s WeChat username was Resister, and there were no further messages attached to this request.From the first moment that he saw the name, his intuition told Fang Juexia that this was Pei Tingsong, and a message from He Ziyan confirmed his hunch. He accepted the friend request, since after all, they were all part of the same idol group. Fang Juexia had a strict personality, so right after adding him, he changed the name it was saved under. In order to facilitate easy retrieval in the future, he used the same format for renaming as he did for everyone else in the group.After a while, this new friend sent him a message.[Kaleido Pei Tingsong: I didn\u2019t even notice that my card was missing, thx]This thanks was entirely Pei Tingsong\u2019s American style, but Fang Juexia didn\u2019t actually want to confirm that he was the one who had returned his card. To his surprise, Pei Tingsong seemed to have predicted this behavior of his, as just when he was about to type and deny it, he received a photo of his back profile from the other party, which had been taken from a window.Pei Tingsong watched as the typing prompt of the other party paused, and felt pleased. When he was leaving the classroom, there were two girls who were eating the Hot Search\u2019s\u00a0melon.\u201cAh, it\u2019s really sweet. What kind of immortal maneuver is a candy wrapper kiss\u00a0ah!\u201d\u201cIs this wanting me to stuff myself with dog food to have a good year? Ah, how can TingJue be so real\u2026\u201dThey ate so much melon that they had unknowingly arrived right in front of the melon\u2019s root.His cellphone vibrated, and Pei Tingsong took it out and unlocked it, involuntarily smiling while doing so.[Just a pretty face: No need for thanks.]But when he saw the lines that popped up following this message, the smile on his face gradually solidified.[Just a pretty face: Take it as me paying off my debt.]\u2014The author has something to say :Ship of Theseus: One of the oldest thought experiments. In the first century A.D., Plutarch asked the question: if the wood on Theseus\u2019 ship was gradually replaced until all the wood left was not the original wood, would this ship still be the original ship? Later, the ship of Theseus evolved into a classic paradox of identity. This paradox will be unfolded later on.Non-differentiable Life: Juexia will explain later why he came up with this name.Resister: RebelBy trying to clear up mines, my piece is getting longer and longer hhhSome readers who have read my other pieces should know that I am a very, very protective writer. I can\u2019t really accept the role of being scolded groundlessly, so by making the tags more specific, it\u2019s probably for the better, so as to avoid readers from entering by mistake. I also wrote clearly in the summary that Pei Tingsong is a 19-year-old boy who is rebellious and a bit arrogant. However, he is also very kind, and he was born with a golden spoon in his mouth, but he doesn\u2019t have a young master\u2019s temper. On the contrary, he dares to resist his family and pursue his own dream. If you like mature, steady, low-key, and silent gongs, Xiao Pei is obviously not that, and he can\u2019t be. So if you don\u2019t like this type, you can quit directly, but please don\u2019t curse out the character~I like to write developing characters, so that you can feel a sense of participation in witnessing their changes after reading the piece, so their initial personas are not perfect. This story is the same, and Xiao Pei and Juexia will influence each other and grow together during their best age.Innocent\u00a0Zhi Chu\u00a0bows (presses head) and thanks you for your tolerance~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He originally didn\u2019t want to read them, but Xiao Wen sounded so excited in his messages and had wanted to share so much that Fang Juexia went ahead and clicked open the first one.[@I\u2019ve bumped into a real one: Kaleido\u2019s livestream was really amazing. Everyone must click open the video to watch it. There are a lot of boy bands playing the \u2018transferring the candy wrapper\u2019 game, but this time, when watching these guys play it, I blushed, my heart started pounding, and I nearly ascended into heaven! Pei Tingsong passing the candy wrapper to Fang Juexia made for too strong of a moment there. I even added a slow-mo playback at the end of the video, and the higher the quality of the video, the more amazing it looks. Kaleido is a real treasure of a boy band, so everyone should go to Station B to watch the recording. The whole thing is full of high energy!]This Weibo post only showed those few minutes when they were passing the candy wrapper, and the slow-mo part came just when Pei Tingsong was passing the candy wrapper to him, with special effects and background music also having been added to this part. The Weibo post was published at 10 o\u2019clock last night, and had already passed 60,000 forwards by now.@Neon Girl: Shit! Who doesn\u2019t want to kiss a beautiful baby? //@Flying over the top of the\u00a0fandom wall: I really find Fang Juexia\u2019s face so delicious\u00a0ah. All beauties have such a face 5555, but how can someone also have such a long birthmark? A birthmark as beautiful as a woman\u2019s\u00a0beauty mark\u00a0/ @The Useless Person is Me: My wolf blood is boiling! //@I\u2019m the Emperor of Europe: The moment Pei Tingsong took off his glasses was amazing\u2026. //@Who doesn\u2019t love beautiful Geges: PTS is the youngest in the group??? //@Rotten Women HQ: Holy shit, this candy wrapper doesn\u2019t exist in my eyes, that was purely a forceful kiss\u00a0ah!! Pei Tingsong is too gong!These words were strange to Fang Juexia. He had pretty much gotten used to people saying things like\u2014 \u201cThe hidden rules person who was born just a pretty waste of skin\u201d, 'stillborn C position\u201d, \u201cabandoned imperial concubine,\u201d or words that were even more unpleasant to hear. Upon suddenly seeing such words, his mind went a bit blank. He didn\u2019t know how to feel about it, so he just replied to Xiao Wen\u2014[Xiao Juexia: Wow, so many people.]Xiao Wen received this not very serious reply, and didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or to cry.[Xiao Wen: Juexia, you really know nothing about popularity.]Pei Tingsong, who had completed his second round of moving into the dorms, also received Xiao Wen\u2019s WeChat message, but the Internet addicted teenager had already opened his Weibo on his way back to the company long before he received those messages. Their popularity ranking was still high and trending, and for the first time, all six members of K were on the Hot Search list.[@Kaleido, let\u2019s get explosively popular\u00a0ba: When I was lurking in the livestream last night, I was shrieking so much that my next door neighbor called the police! Here\u2019s a summary of the fluff moments for everyone: The sweater Xiao Pei was wearing was Juexia\u2019s, when they sat together, Xiao Pei even put his hand on Juexia\u2019s waist, and we don\u2019t even have to mention the candy wrapper kiss. The biggest piece of explosive news from last night is that they were locked up in the closet together for five minutes after losing that game! Isn\u2019t that awesome?! Start shipping it for me!][@ Does Weibo have 1: I really didn\u2019t expect it to be so awesome before clicking into it. The moment the candy wrapper fell, I sucked in a breath, but who could have thought that he would actually save it and start kissing him\u2026.][@ Don\u2019t love me, there\u2019s no result: This already isn\u2019t me messing with a CP but the CP messing with me\u00a0ah! Isn\u2019t it enough that I\u2019m shipping it?!][@Sansan\u00a0is my little baby: Fuck! This was a real kiss\u00a0ah,\u00a0the candy wrapper was pretty much not even there, okay! It\u2019s pretty much @ing me to ship the CP! Look at your junior company brothers!!!]Pei Tingsong looked at the profile picture of the above poster. Huh, it was really clever, this was a fan of their senior brother group.[@Is TingJue doing fanservice today: Fucking hell, Pei Tingsong, you\u2019re only 19 years old\u00a0ah, how can you be so smooth!? When Gege was held down and kissed by him, my wolf blood started boiling up!]Pei Tingsong carefully recalled his actions from that time\u2026Did that count as holding him down and kissing him?[@Just a face dog, what about it: K\u2019s face is so quiet\u00a0ah\u00a0lololol. I have seen them perform on stage before, and he has always had that kind of iceberg face, but how can he look so obedient and blank during this game hahahaha]That was true; this guy was like a different person on the stage, but after getting off the stage, he wouldn\u2019t even say a word.[@Did you read a book today: Big fan, I saw their answer about their fan name on another Weibo post, it was really conscientious. It didn\u2019t feel like a group just going through the motions with their fans.][@Teacher Fang is as beautiful as a flower replying to @Did you read a book today: Although K is messy, it has never just gone through the motions with its fans. Everyone is very good, and their professional ability is strong and lovely.][@Sweet pepper little cutie: Fuck, this kind of game, I remember that 7L has also played this game\u00a0ah, and a lot of other groups have played this game as well, but the most exciting thing that happened there was just that the candy wrapper fell and two people ended up accidentally kissing. I didn\u2019t expect such a wonderful second try! PTS is really capable, what kind of alpha move is directly holding the back of Gege\u2019s neck to hold him still?? ][@The world is hard: This group actually looks pretty good eh, and this is my first time seeing them, but the main face and maknae\u2019s faces are just\u00a0yjjc. I just saw someone say that the maknae is alpha, but the appearance of the main face is a little like an alpha who deliberately pretends to be a cold\u00a0beta. He is really super alpha when on-stage, the type that holds no one in high regard. On-stage, he\u2019s the cool, salty ace, while offstage, he\u2019s forcefully kissed into confusion by the group bully maknae\u2014it\u2019s an immortal\u00a0doujinshi!][@Watermelon is too much like a pig replying to @The world is hard: I think Fang Juexia is an omega pretending to be a beta! He looks like an iceberg beauty but he is actually a clever, gentle, and beautiful baby!][@Empty Nest Girl replying to @ Watermelon is too much like a pig: You guys are actually discussing ABO designations so seriously hahahaha. If it\u2019s like this, I\u2019m standing for alpha-beta; I think Fang Juexia is a beta with very weak pheromones!]What are pheromones? Wasn\u2019t Omega a popular watch brand?Everyone\u2019s discussion gradually began to enter the blind areas of Pei Tingsong\u2019s knowledge.[@ Happy fat house little darlings: This candy wrapper kiss must be poisonous, I can\u2019t get out\u2026.][@Six men\u2019s cross talk group: In fact, K\u2019s appearance and strength are all especially strong. From writing lyrics to music composition to choreography, these are all pretty much arranged by the members of the group themselves. Everyone can go find out~\u00a0 Xiao Pei\u2019s rapping ability is basically at the level of an underground rapper, and I\u2019m willing to declare he could beat up the rap parts of other boy bands. Although Juexia is the main dancer, his vocals are also extremely excellent, and he is a complete voice rogue! The other members also have their own special characteristics, you absolutely won\u2019t go faceblind! Everybody go seeeeee our little K\u00a0ba! Becoming part of our little K is a win-win situation!]Although Pei Tingsong had always insisted that he didn\u2019t regard being an idol as a career, and that sooner or later he would leave Kaleido to become a serious hip-hop artist, when he saw these fans conscientiously introducing their good points to others, his heart was still moved by it. After entering the company\u2019s building, he was just about to get out of the elevator when his cellphone vibrated. It was a screenshot of a chat log Xiao Wen had with Juexia, which he had sent to Pei Tingsong.[Xiao Wen: I\u2019m here to supervise your fanservice! Juexia is slacking off a bit here, so President Pei, you have to start fighting for it!][Little Tyrant:\u00a0Nope.]After playing it cool with Xiao Wen, Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help opening the screenshot of the chat log he had just received.\u201cWhat tone is this\u00a0ah,\u201d He unconsciously took on Fang Juexia\u2019s voice as he complained, \u201cWow, so many people\u2026 What kind of perfunctory words are these? How can you look down on forming a CP with me?\u201dPei Tingsong had always been a person who, if instructed by others to go East, would plant himself in the West. Fang Juexia was a thorn in his side; there was no harm caused by seeing this perfunctory reply of his, but it just stuck in his heart and made him unhappy.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgAs he walked to the practice room, he opened up his chat with Fang Juexia and edited his message to him\u2014[Kaleido Pei Tingsong: The company wants us to do Weibo fanservice.]Fang Juexia actually replied back very fast this time, which made Pei Tingsong feel more relaxed.But as soon as he opened it\u2014[Just a pretty face: Really? I didn\u2019t get a notice.]Notice??? His mood took a sharp turn.Pei Tingsong held his cellphone with both hands, lowered his head, and started replying back in an angry manner, not bothering to look forward anymore.He originally wanted to write\u2014 [Are\u00a0you\u00a0suggesting the company write out a script for you to follow step by step?]\u2014 but he kept feeling like something was off about this response, so he deleted it word by word.I am the notice\u2014 Pei Tingsong nodded in his heart. Yes, acting like a cool guy was more consistent with his style.While typing these words quickly, the absent-minded Pei Tingsong accidentally bumped into someone. He reflexively said sorry, but then when he looked up, as luck would have it, he saw that he had just bumped into that heartless Fang Juexia. The other party was wearing a thin white shirt while holding his coat in his hand, and his cheeks were red. One look and it was obvious that he had just come out of the practice room again.Under the dual pressures of bumping into him and his own shock at this encounter, Pei Tingsong clicked on send and sent the message without even knowing about it. Meanwhile, Fang Juexia\u2019s cellphone vibrated at that very moment.Fang Juexia saw that Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes were on guard and contained some doubts, so he simply replied, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He lowered his head and took his phone out of his pocket to unlock it. Pei Tingsong went around him and was prepared to leave when another person appeared at the end of the corridor and called out to him. It was Cheng Qiang.\u201cHey, perfect, you two are here. I have something to tell you guys.\u201dPei Tingsong frowned, and while pulling the zipper of his coat up and down, asked, \u201cWhat is it now?\u201dCheng Qiang shrugged and replied, \u201cRemember the inside pages of the magazine Juexia was supposed to do, but someone else\u00a0stole\u00a0from us? This time, you guys have been invited to shoot a two person cover. They say it\u2019s an upgrade, and it also makes up for the missed cooperation opportunities from before.\u201dPei Tingsong straightforwardly rolled his eyes. Although he didn\u2019t get along with Fang Juexia, following this kind of behavior of going where the wind was blowing was really disgusting. \u201cThey really can talk, back when they pushed Fang Juexia out, they weren\u2019t this nice. I\u2019m not doing it.\u201d\u201cHey, they have taken the initiative to upgrade us to the cover. What\u2019s funny is that the group that stole the original job from us is very dissatisfied with the invite for the cover shoot that we\u2019ve gotten, and so, they are all clamoring to withdraw from the photoshoot for the inner pages. Who knew that the people on the magazine\u2019s side would actually agree, saying, \u2018You guys can quit\u00a0ba.\u2019 Is that funny or what, guys. This circle is just so cruel; only those who are popular have the right to speak.\u201dPei Tingsong hissed, but when he turned his head, he realized that Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t really paying attention to this matter that was directly related to him. It really was the situation where the emperor wasn\u2019t anxious, but his eunuchs were anxious. As Fang Juexia put away his cellphone, his expression was a little strange, and he even raised his head to stare at him.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Pei Tingsong pretended to be fierce.Fang Juexia looked hesitant and embarrassed as he asked, \u201cWhat you said\u2026is it true?\u201d\u201cWhat is true?\u201d He didn\u2019t understand what Fang Juexia was talking about. He frowned and said, \u201cI\u2019m not some lame liar.\u201dFang Juexia blinked two times slowly, then let out a dull \u201coh\u201d, and said, \u201cThen that\u2019s very good.\u201d After he said that, he was called away by Cheng Qiang, who said that the composer was coming.Pei Tingsong went to his own small rap writing practice room, took off his coat, and put it aside. Then he took out his cellphone, planning to open up his audio memos. However, as soon as he sat down, he thought back to Fang Juexia\u2019s reaction just now. The more he thought about it, the stranger Fang Juexia\u2019s expression and eyes seemed to him, but he couldn\u2019t pinpoint why they were strange to him.Finally, half an hour later, Pei Tingsong opened up his WeChat chat box with Fang Juexia again, and then saw the message he had sent, in distinct, bright words\u2014[I am the\u00a0gay.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 15Chapter 15 \u2013 Scene Of The GalaTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksWhat if Fang Juexia was gay?Xiao Pei held his cellphone and let out a string of \u201cfucks\u201d, and as he panicked, he ended up kicking his shin against the table. It hurt so bad that it made him feel as though he was going to die. He quickly bent over and clutched his leg, unable to even let a cry out.Coincidentally, the door of the small practice room was suddenly opened at this time. Ling Yi appeared, carrying a bag of oversized yam slices, and was followed by a camera. Ling Yi didn\u2019t even glance at him and said, \u201cXiao Pei, Huohuo said to ask if you have any lyrics written on hand to discuss\u2026\u201d He saw Pei Tingsong sitting with his large stature all huddled up on his chair and asked curiously, \u201cWhat are you doing? Doing yoga on the chair\u00a0ah?\u201d Then he went over and offered, \u201cDo you want to eat yam slices?\u201dWhen Pei Tingsong raised his head, Ling Yi looked at him and was startled. \u201cOh, why are you shedding tears, if you didn\u2019t write lyrics, then you didn\u2019t write them\u00a0bei,\u00a0what are you crying for\u00a0ya?\u201dPei Tingsong gnashed his teeth and said, \u201cI hit my leg\u2026\u201d\u201cOh it\u2019s like that\u00a0ah, silly.\u201d Ling Yi laughingly patted him on the back. \u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as you didn\u2019t break it, or else it would affect our comeback~\u201d\u201cYou have the heart and lungs of a dog.\u201dLing Yi grinned. \u201cYes\u00a0ah, you are a Siberian wolf, while I am an adorably cute Chihuahua.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re pretty good.\u201d Pei Tingsong finally managed to knead his leg a few times before placing it down slowly. Ling Yi then led him to He Ziyan\u2019s workshop, after saying that the composer had also arrived.Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t expect that as soon as he entered the workshop, he would catch sight of Fang Juexia, with whom he had just parted ways not too long ago, as he sat next to He Ziyan. They seemed to have been discussing something, and when they heard someone coming into the room, they naturally raised their heads. However, as soon as he saw that it was Pei Tingsong, Fang Juexia lowered his head again.This unnatural behavior reminded Pei Tingsong\u2014he still hadn\u2019t cleared up that misunderstanding with Fang Juexia.Pei Tingsong coughed twice and walked over, then called out, \u201cUm, Juexia Ge\u2026\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Ling Yi\u2019s ears were miraculously sharp, and he disrupted the conversation mercilessly by asking, \u201cHow come the words coming from our youngest son today are so sweet, calling someone Ge?\u201dHe Ziyan also followed along in interrupting, \u201cCould it be that something of our Xiao Pei\u2019s has landed in Juexia\u2019s hands?\u201dFang Juexia guessed that Pei Tingsong wanted him to hide the fact that he had come out to him on WeChat today. It seemed that everyone didn\u2019t know about this. Although he didn\u2019t understand why Pei Tingsong would suddenly tell him such a private matter, when he thought about it carefully, he understood that since Pei Tingsong had grown up in a foreign country, he was used to being free and open, and it was very normal for him to have awakened to his true self early on.Since this logic seemed to be consistent, Fang Juexia also succeeded in persuading himself about it.Since Pei Tingsong hadn\u2019t told any of the others about this, it would be better if he came up a lie for him and changed the subject. With such a kind thought in mind, Fang Juexia said, \u201cHe\u2019s actually\u2026\u201dJust after he said those few words, his mouth was suddenly covered. The perpetrator was Pei Tingsong, who was now standing behind him.\u201cActually what?\u201d Pei Tingsong forced himself to smile as he stated, \u201cI am a Didi, and Didis should call their seniors Gege.\u201dHe Ziyan laughed and agreed, \u201cWell founded, completely unable to refute.\u201dLing Yi felt that something was strange and wanted to stretch out his paws to push Pei Tingsong\u2019s hands aside, but his hands were covering Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth quite tightly, and did not let go even a bit.\u201cDo you guys share some small secret you haven\u2019t told us?\u201d Ling Yi\u2019s face was full of suspicion. \u201cThe post-production little Jiejie remembered to give me a complete set of\u00a0Detective Conan\u00a0manga\u00a0ah. There is only one truth\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is only one,\u201d Pei Tingsong barreled in to interrupt, \u201cIt\u2019s that we have a little secret we don\u2019t want to tell you. Don\u2019t try to pry into things you don\u2019t oversee, or you\u2019ll already not be my most loved Ling Xiao Yi.\u201dHe Ziyan applauded, \u201cIt rhymes, awesome.\u201dPei Tingsong let go, pulled up a chair, and sat in front of Fang Juexia. He raised an eyebrow at him, his warning obvious.I didn\u2019t want to say anything anyway. Fang Juexia thought that saying anything more at this point would be superfluous, so he just didn\u2019t say anything. His skin was very pale and delicate, and Pei Tingsong\u2019s ten fingers clasping him had left a red mark.\u201cTch, tch, tch\u2026\u201d Ling Yi, with a sad face, went over to the camera and mimed out being a blubbery mess of snot and tears. \u201cThis section must not be cut. Ling Yi is now already an abandoned wife, having been replaced by another one. Barrage, spam for me, Pei Tingsong is an unfaithful lover, and needs to give his abandoned wife some face!\u201dEven the composer, who had been watching the whole time, couldn\u2019t help laughing as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s really a waste to have Yiyi as the main singer, he should have gone to the acting department.\u201dFang Juexia was also amused by Ling Yi, and the corners of his mouth unconsciously curved up slightly. The icy layer on this eternally cold face broke, and emotions rippled through it\u2014seeing it made Pei Tingsong feel strange. His outstretched feet quietly kicked against Fang Juexia\u2019s, and he saw the other person return to his senses as he turned his face slightly to look at him, still not saying anything, but having just taken his smile off his face.\u201cWas it funny?\u201d While everyone else was chatting in a lively manner, Pei Tingsong asked him this in a low voice.His voice was special, possessing a deep tone that didn\u2019t match his richly youthful face. It was probably because people who grew up speaking English had a stronger chest resonance. Normally speaking, in a noisy environment, bass sounds were the ones most easily covered up, but the three words Pei Tingsong had spoken fell directly into Fang Juexia\u2019s ear. He wasn\u2019t sure whether he heard him first or whether his eyes saw the irrepressible bantering smile at the corner of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth.Fang Juexia pursed his mouth and turned his head back around while wielding a cold shield of indifference. He had been calm for a long time, and had long become accustomed to feeling no waves of emotion, but would often still get flustered by Pei Tingsong.No one had taught him how to get along with people like Pei Tingsong.Jiang Miao and Lu Yuan also hurried back, after which, the whole group and the staff started the first round of demo selection. Fang Juexia\u2019s cellphone vibrated. He looked down to check it and found that it was a message from Pei Tingsong.[Kaleido Pei Tingsong: I mistyped that message. It was supposed to be \u201cnotice\u201d, not \u201cgay\u201d. Sexual orientation may be the only physiological thing in my life that I have to cater to the public with.]At the moment he sent that message out, a thought appeared in Pei Tingsong\u2019s mind\u2014 What if Fang Juexia was gay, otherwise how could such rumors exist, even if they were fake\u2026Fang Juexia stared at the screen and then scrolled up to look at the message he had sent about a notice before. Thinking about it, this kind of mistyping logic made more sense than Pei Tingsong suddenly coming out of the closet, so he naturally accepted it. Just as he was ready to reply, a second item popped up on the chat screen.[Kaleido Pei Tingsong: Of course, I have no objections towards gay people.\u00a0Love is love. I\u2019m just purely explaining what happened.]Fang Juexia\u2019s mind wasn\u2019t as delicate as Pei Tingsong\u2019s. His way of thinking was straightforward and simple, so he didn\u2019t read anything into this sentence, and since He Ziyan was talking to him again, he could only reply with a brief message.[Just a pretty face: Okay.]Okay?Okay???Pei Tingsong was getting worked up even more and more. What straight as steel man, this guy was the definition of real steel. He was completely unaware of the amount of empathy that had gone into the editing of the message for him.He threw his cellphone into his pocket and ignored it.The discussion of the new album lasted the whole afternoon. Originally, it would have been time for them to return to the dormitory for a rest, but the temporarily assigned evening livestream show had disrupted their schedule, and having a live stage to perform on was very rare, so they all desperately practiced until 3 in the morning.Ever since Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia had appeared on the Hot Search, the online discussion about Kaleido had become polarized. Besides their fans, those who had been sucked in or passersby who didn\u2019t care, everyone else still looked down on them, cursing them out as selling rot, and cursing them out as not having any real ability and just selling hype, along with hating them and wishing that they could trample this group, that had just become a bit more popular, under their feet.This was all very normal. Fang Juexia was especially clear-headed about that.They were a boy band. Their strength on the stage would be the thing that could make all these people settle down, not their popularity.They practiced non-stop for two days in a row. Besides their debut at the end of the year award ceremony, this occasion would count as Kaleido\u2019s second large-scale gala since their debut. CloudTV was the largest video website platform in China. Everyone took this job very seriously, even though they were just the backup option.It was only on the 29th day of the New Year, that is, the day of the formal performance, that they found out that the stylists they had always been complaining about weren\u2019t there anymore, and that the company had specially switched in a new stylist team for them.The stage makeup for Fang Juexia also changed now. In the past, most of his birthmark would be covered up with concealer, but the new makeup artist used a red eye shadow, similar in colour to his birthmark, to outline his eyes and then link his birthmark to the corner of his eye. The eyeshadow was applied lightly, being only a bit heavier and more obvious at the corner of his left eye. His brown hair was curled a bit, so that his bangs fluttered down on his forehead, and when paired with the gray satin shirt he was wearing, he looked like a kind of decadent beauty.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t have any high requirements for his style, but he thought that this time, he looked quite special. He glanced at the others through the mirror. The group leader\u2019s blow-dried, temporarily dyed blue hair was eye-catching, and He Ziyan\u2019s red hair also looked very cool. His eyes finally fell on Pei Tingsong\u2019s new style. Usually, all of Pei Tingsong\u2019s stage clothes were selected while aiming for a more youthful look, but this time, his hair had been styled by being blown clean and tidy, with his bangs framing his forehead like commas, and after adding on a pair of gold wire glasses with a narrow frame, he gave off the impression of being an ambitious professional, which suited his dark gray suit coat very well.\u201cYou guys are now hanging on the Hot Search, and in addition to the fact that you\u2019ve attracted new fans, there must be a lot of people out there who are questioning your abilities, which is rather normal.\u201d Cheng Qiang began his daily counselling speech in the dressing room. \u201cThis is a rare opportunity, and with regards to your strength, Ge is at ease. As long as you perform at your normal level, you\u2019ll all be really great!\u201dLing Yi had, for once, gotten the stylist to give him a\u00a0wolf head hairstyle, and was so happy that he almost completely ignored Cheng Qiang\u2019s words and chimed in, \u201cAh, I like this hairstyle, it makes me five centimeters taller!\u201d\u201cFive centimeters is still not enough\u00a0ba.\u201d Pei Tingsong was chewing bubblegum and blew a bubble.\u201cYou shut up!\u201d\u201cStrong Ge, when this is done, can we go get kebabs?\u201d Lu Yuan looked up at Cheng Qiang and asked, his smoothed-out hair making him give off the impression of being clever and well-behaved, a look seldomly seen.\u201cYes, it\u2019s no problem. Let\u2019s give a good performance, and Qiang Ge will treat you all tonight!\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgDue to the sudden change in the original schedule, and the fact that Kaleido wasn\u2019t a heavyweight among the many other guests performing tonight, the fan-allotted seats that could be won by their fans were also very limited. However, the Dominoes present on the scene also tried their best to help out their idols. Each little girl carried a heavy Kaleidoscope lamp and a Klein Blue lightboard as they patiently waited for the six big boys to appear act after act during the whole performance.The gala hadn\u2019t pressed for any rigid requirements for the singing portion during the event, and so, many of the groups or individuals who went before them had performed by only singing live for half of their performance duration, or by lip-syncing the whole time. However, the Kaleido team had insisted that they would sing and perform their song live, with the background vocals being played so lightly that it would be as if they were literally not there.During the rehearsal, Fang Juexia kept feeling that things were not quite right. The earbuds provided by the organizers were not effective, and the sound coming through them was poor. Cheng Qiang, in the end, had simply taken out the six handheld mics that the company had bought at a high price.They knew very clearly where their own strengths lay.This was an occasion where they could use their strengths to clinch the outcome in their favour.\u201cI\u2019m so nervous, so nervous.\u201d Based on the gala program\u2019s schedule, there were two other performances left before it would be their turn. Ling Yi kept trilling his vocal notes in front of the group camera they had brought along with them. \u201cI feel like I haven\u2019t sung live in a long time. What are we going to do if my voice cracks later?\u201dLu Yuan pinched his shoulder and said, \u201cIf you crack, me and\u00a0Shuishui\u00a0will each take over one of your parts.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to continue with his three high notes,\u201d Jiang Miao laughed.He Ziyan said, \u201cHe can do three bass notes instead.\u201d\u201cThen let Juexia do it.\u201d Lu Yuan winked at Juexia and said, \u201cJuexia singing those three lines will sound like water being sprinkled down\u00a0la.\u201dEveryone chatted and played games backstage as they waited, and soon, they were summoned via their earpieces. They cheered each other on and then went onto the stage.\u201cLet\u2019s welcome the new, popular idol group, Kaleido!\u201d The two hosts welcomed them to the middle of the stage, and then announced, \u201cWelcome, welcome, this is Kaleido\u2019s first time coming to the CloudTV gala, right? Greet the audience friends on the scene\u00a0ba.\u201dThe captain looked left and right, at his group members standing beside him, and said, \u201cOne, two, three\u2014Hello everyone!\u201d\u201cWe are Kaleido!\u201d All six men neatly made a K using their hands and then bowed to the audience.\u201cWow, this gesture is really cool.\u201d The hostess imitated them, adding, \u201cThen Kaleido, do you want to take this opportunity to offer a New Year\u2019s greetings to the audience offstage, and to the ones on the livestream? Everyone is really looking forward to it.\u201d\u201cEveryone, say one sentence\u00a0ba.\u201d Jiang Miao glanced at He Ziyan, who was standing at the leftmost side. After understanding what he was indicating at, He Ziyan picked up the microphone and greeted, \u201cHappy New Year, I wish you all to make a fortune throughout this new year.\u201dThere was a burst of laughter from the audience. No one had thought that this group would be so sincere.Next was Lu Yuan. \u201cBe happy and smile often.\u201dJiang Miao said with a smile, \u201cI hope everyone and their families can get together like this and be happy in the new year.\u201dLing Yi said, \u201cThose who want to stop being single, will stop being single, and those who want to stay single, will make a lot of money!\u201dThen came Fang Juexia\u2019s turn. He thought carefully and finally offered a very plain wish, \u201cI wish everyone success in their work and progress in their studies.\u201dIn fact, he was a little curious about what Pei Tingsong would say. After all, taking just one look at his personality, anyone could tell that he had not been a child who would behave himself and give New Year\u2019s wishes to adults.He even seriously imagined this scene in his head.Looking sideways at the boy beside him, Pei Tingsong smiled and held up his microphone. \u201cI hope everyone can realize their dreams.\u201dFang Juexia found this sentence unexpected, but then realized that it was also reasonable.It really was very Pei Tingsong.After this brief interaction, their performance officially began. As the lights changed, the six of them quickly got into their proper positions. The original song had been edited heavily due to time restrictions and during their rehearsals, it had been adjusted to become their debut song of the same name\u2014\u201cKaleido.\u201dIt had been a long time since they had stepped onto a real stage, and so Fang Juexia took a deep breath when he grasped the microphone. His heart was beating very fast; those past few days of intensive practice had been just for this moment, and this event was too important for them, this was the deciding moment they had all been really waiting for.They could only succeed, not fail.The lights came on again, and the familiar opening notes of their song sounded on the stage.Not right.Not right.Fang Juexia squinted. Standing at the starting position of the two main dancers, he quickly exchanged glances with Lu Yuan who was next to him. He raised his finger and pointed to his ear, and Lu Yuan also quickly nodded.There was something wrong with the earpieces; they were full of background noise, almost exceeding the volume of the accompaniment that should have been transmitting through. They weren\u2019t working at all. The fans were very close to the stage, and although there weren\u2019t many people, their screams made it clear that they were very enthusiastic. They could hardly hear the background sound being played on the stage.Such a large open-air venue, with a teeming crowd, and there was no playback coming from the earpieces.His heart sank.\u2014The author has something to say :Go my cubs~How to do the K sign: The first step is to face the palm inward, turn it sideways, and make a peace sign. Pay attention to separate the index finger from the middle finger as far as possible; the second step is to keep the same position but to now stick your thumb out, and then it\u2019s good\u00a0la. Or you can make a gun with your hand, then add your middle finger, and then separate your middle finger from the rest as far as possible.Did you learn how to do it~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16Chapter 16 \u2013 Turn The TideTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksStop the performance?! Are you crazy, this is a national live broadcast!He was now the C position, and the person responsible for kicking off their performance.He had no other choice.When the stage lights came on, Fang Juexia raised his head just as the drumbeats started, and began his performance with the most perfect expression and state of mind, as if nothing had happened. He convinced himself to not panic; as long as his internal clock was accurate enough, there was nothing for him to worry about. This was a song that they had practiced countless times. The accompanying music would come to him naturally and automatically.\u201cNever go for survival of the fittest, the law is trapped within a grimace, the rules are up to me to prove, and the door of life will be broken through with one move.\u201dAfter singing his part, Ling Yi and Jiang Miao quickly took up the song and continued to sing. Their rhythm was right, so Fang Juexia didn\u2019t know if he and Lu Yuan were the only ones having problems with the music coming through their earpieces.[Life is a game of adventure, with rewards and costs for conservative ventures]The electronic disturbance in his ear piece was growing even louder. Fang Juexia continued dancing while glancing at the back-stage and pointing to his ear piece, trying to seek help from them.[However cold reality may be, is how sincere towards your dreams you must be]Jiang Miao finished this sentence and subconsciously looked at He Ziyan, who just slightly nodded his chin. These details were quickly noticed by Fang Juexia, and he quickly understood the situation.At worst, all of them may be having problems with their earpieces.If this was a performance that was just being recorded, then they could have completely stopped the performance directly and recorded it again after the earpieces had been repaired or replaced. However, right now, they were performing a live show, in front of the entire country. Stopping the performance mid-way would be tantamount to self destruction.Fang Juexia, accustomed to the harshness of the Internet, was the person most clear of this fact. If they stopped now, this live broadcast would then be recorded, edited, and spread on various social networks. Even if they released a message saying that the real reason for doing so was because their earpieces were malfunctioning, with their current rising popularity, they would all be pinned with the stigma of possessing poor professional ability. Originally, not many audience members really understood the point of wearing ear-pieces on the stage anyway.So the group members tactically chose to continue their performance.Connecting the main song and the side song were a few lines in English by Pei Tingsong, which had been pre-recorded and then had been processed to sound like a loudspeaker announcement\u2014[Ladies and Gentlemen,Welcome to flight KALEIDO.Next station isFuture]It never rains, but it pours.This monologue suddenly started to cut in and out, and mixed into it was the sound of interfering static. But these were the electronic sounds that went with the song\u2019s accompanying music, so was even the sound system in the venue having problems now?Fang Juexia was suspicious, but he continued to dance with a calm expression, with each movement being clean and neat. Although he couldn\u2019t hear the accompaniment, he still hit his mark at the right moment and moved to the very front. The chorus was going to start immediately, and after Ling Yi finished singing, it would be his part again.The audio system\u2019s failure became more and more obvious, and the background music kept cutting in and out, just like a broken tape, leading the audience below to start an uproar. Although Ling Yi persisted in singing, he was obviously a bit flustered. Fang Juexia could hear the hesitance in his breath.[Unwilling to be mediocre, the pulse of my heart has endlessly argued on setting myself apart]All of a sudden, anxious cursing from the director sounded out through the earpiece, but there was no accompanying music.\u201cCut to the panoramic view! What is the sound department doing?! If you really can\u2019t do anything else, replace the audio!\u201d\u201cStop the performance\u00a0ba!\u201d\u201cStop the performance?! Are you crazy, this is a national live broadcast!\u201d\u201cGet the sound engineers to deal with this quickly!\u201dHe Ziyan was about to open his mouth to start his rap for Ling Yi, when suddenly, all the music completely stopped.The audience below, who were waving glowsticks and lamps, halted their motions in midair, and everyone started talking about the accident with the sound system. Only the accompaniment music onstage had gone silent, but even if it was so only for one second, the silence in this second was enough to destroy the countless late hours they had spent in the practice rooms.Just when everyone thought their group\u2019s performance was going to die here\u2014Fang Juexia\u2019s crystal clear voice broke through this challenge.\u201cThe soul has been burning, scorching with desire,\u201d He directly pulled his earpiece off, holding tightly onto the hand mic they had brought themselves, while still performing every dance action in his best condition, without the beats of the accompaniment, and sang \u201cAnd at this moment, it bursts into flames roaring.\u201dHe knew the value of a stage better than anyone else in the world.Even if everyone else had chosen to give up, he couldn\u2019t just let it end like this.The option of giving up was one that he did not have from the beginning.Fang Juexia\u2019s voice was steady and accurate. His pure voice, without any accompaniment, made the advantages of his timbre even clearer, and this strong pressure radiating from his sound quickly suppressed the noise and uneasiness that had spread throughout the venue. The audience burst out into loud applause and cheers, which came not only from their fans, but also from the many other fans there.\u201cHoly shit, he\u2019s really singing, awesome!\u201d\u201cWhat a wonderful voice\u00a0ah!\u201d\u201cNo wonder they\u2019re all holding mics\u00a0ah.\u201dEven so, if he was the only one who persisted in continuing on, this performance couldn\u2019t be maintained. Although Fang Juexia\u2019s face was calm, and not even the slightest flaw could be seen in his dancing and performance, internally, his anxiety had reached its peak.He was afraid that there would be no one behind him.\u201cSay hello to my ego.\u201dWhile spinning around for one of the dance movements, Fang Juexia was surprised to see Pei Tingsong, who had also taken off his earpiece. He didn\u2019t expect to hear Pei Tingsong start to rap from behind him the moment his high note ended.With a crackle of electricity, the corners of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth quirked up as he looked at him.Fang Juexia\u2019s heart, which had been at the peak of its anxiety, was firmly caught by this bright smile. He couldn\u2019t describe what it felt like, just that it was as if he had been teetering on the edge of a dangerously deep suspension bridge when suddenly, another person had firmly grasped his hand.\u2014Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m behind you.His heartbeat finally settled down.At exactly the right time, Ling Yi\u2019s voice also appeared, and without the accompanying music, his strong singing skills were displayed at their full potential.The disappearance of the accompaniment track failed to stop them from performing. Whether it was the proper stage expressions they should be wearing on their faces or the intensity of their dance movements, not even the slightest bit was left to go lax. Fans close to the stage tried their utmost best to sing for them. These 60 or 70 girls worked very hard to sing with the presence of hundreds of people.Even if it was just for the sake of these children, they couldn\u2019t accept losing.[It\u2019s me who\u2019s ever-changing, unpredictable and freeA myriad colored dream, casting this kaleidoscope]The sharp-as-a-knife group dance during the chorus part took place neatly and straightforwardly beneath the harmony created by the fans and the lead singers. The dance for this song contained complicated positions and a lot of changes. Although everyone\u2019s rhythm was in place, and their strength was being exerted as required, still, their movements would seem strange if there was no accompaniment. Taking advantage of the opportunity offered by the group dance to move to a position behind the rest of the group, Pei Tingsong covered the top of his microphone with his left palm, then motioned to He Ziyan who was about to start rapping, to which He Ziyan nodded in response.At this moment, the sound of a powerful beat appeared in the venue, which was Pei Tingsong beatboxing.The appearance of this sound was akin to a blast of thunder, and the venue started boiling over. The unexpected sound accident, their strong resilience, as well as their daring and courage to turn the tide\u2014all these factors undoubtedly turned this accidental live performance into a powerful adrenaline-rush like stimulant. Every heart in this venue was beating hard at this moment, fighting with this powerful improvised beat.Although these big boys on the stage had been nervous at the start of their performance, they had started to accept their reality and had already come to accept this imperfect stage.It didn\u2019t really matter. For only imperfect things could surprise you.With Pei Tingsong\u2019s assistance, He Ziyan also started spitting out words like a machine gun. \u201cNever concealing my ambitions, disdain in telling you my origins. No matter how high, how fly you sing, your high still can\u2019t match the beat I try.\u201dUsing the cue given by the words being rapped, Ling Yi placed his hands on his hips and let out a dramatic, \u201cWhat?\u201dEveryone began to enjoy the performance on the stage, and the smooth but varied rhythm gave the performers room to display their abilities to the full.He Ziyan stopped Ling Yi with one hand, and with a smile on his face, continued to rap, \u201cVery sorry the road ahead is just one way, if you refuse to obey, that\u2019s not okay, right now just listen to my voice and command hey, and your heartbeat I\u2019ll hold here to stay.\u201d He turned around after this, and stuck close to Jiang Miao, and then the two of them spun around in a circle to complete the exchange of their positions. He Ziyan held up his right hand and pointed to the sky. \u201cHey baby, remember our names. This world has nothing new, it\u2019s so boring, just look around, so why don\u2019t you come see a miracle brew.\u201dAfter finishing his part, he also joined in on Pei Tingsong\u2019s impromptu beatboxing, and the other four members sang the climax of the chorus. The beat was accurate and strong, with each beat perfectly in step with each movement of Kaleido\u2019s dance, and everyone in the audience was trying to quickly capture all this on camera. The effect this brought about on the stage was so good that it was far beyond the director\u2019s imagination.\u201cGroup dance! No. 4 go for a long shot!\u201d\u201cNo. 1, pull in, grab their expressions!\u201d[We gonna fight\uff01 Fight\uff01 Fight\uff01with the face in the mirrorYes we\u2019ll fight\uff01 Fight\uff01 Fight\uff01Never flinch, standing shoulder to shoulder]These words were really in line with the current situation. Originally, it was just a standard hot-blooded boyband song, but with this sound accident, the song felt more heroic and full of momentum and vitality going against the trend.[Fight! Fight! Fight!]The repeated syllables of the chorus sounded like war drums, decisive and powerful. Jiang Miao held his hands up high and led the audience into clapping with them.[Enjoy falling in the wild wind]Ling Yi\u2019s high notes remained as high as ever. He was originally already a high-performance vocalist who had strong resonance and could pull off his own mix of sounds perfectly. Even if he only had a beatboxing accompaniment, he didn\u2019t sound sloppy at all.[Fight! Fight! Fight!]Fang Juexia clenched his hand, and the two lead singers started to sing the high notes together.\u201cYou will remember me after the storm.\u201dKaleido\u2019s popularity wasn\u2019t very high; most of the people sitting beneath the stage hadn\u2019t even heard of the group before. What\u2019s more, prior to their performance, the stage had just been filled with act after act of lip-synching, which had worn away at the audience\u2019s goodwill. Their performance time was close to 11 o\u2019clock, and going on-stage at that time already counted as being at a great disadvantage for the group. Then, adding on the very difficult to control large stage, the pressure of a multi-platform national live broadcast, and finally, the damaged ear pieces and loss of accompanying music.This was definitely the worst situation.This small boyband, which no one was looking forward to or even cared about, had really drawn the card for the most hellish scenario.However now, this audience that had been paralyzed by frustration and disappointment by the previous acts had now reaped a surprise. No one had expected that it would be under the worst circumstances that the best performance would appear. No, they had already forgotten that this was just a performance. The gala venue had turned into a live house with a warm atmosphere, with the cheers almost drowning out the voice of the fans who were diligently chanting out the\u00a0response lines.The rhythm of the beatboxing was now controlled by He Ziyan, and it started to change. The six people changed their dance formation to match the beat, and Pei Tingsong, with one hand in his pocket, strode on his long legs up to the camera amidst the screams, before raising an eyebrow and starting in on his home turf.\u201cWelcome to the start of the gorgeous Kaleido, what are you afraid of, don\u2019t rush to go, from this competitive auction show, haters aren\u2019t qualified to raise their hands, yo.\u00a0Baby\u00a0focus on my voice, all my money rising tall.\u201dHe took off his gold glasses, placed them in his suit pocket, and temporarily changed the lyrics.\u00a0\u201cI am rich, oh, I am fresh. Your little bitches love me so.\u201dWhen Fang Juexia heard the word \u2018bitches\u2019, he nearly lost control over his expression, but it was only for that moment. In the past, whenever Pei Tingsong wrote lyrics, he would completely copy the style of most black artists, but the company had concerns about the songs meeting the standards of distribution, so they could only modify and delete certain words. Therefore, it was normal for Pei Tingsong to change the words temporarily when singing live. Because of this, they were often ridiculed by fans\u2014K\u2019s CDs go through a lot of processing, and the only way to test if their mics were live was by listening to Xiao Pei.\u201cChina swag, China dope. See the sound system mess up the perfect show. The original lyrics have been thrown below, and we\u2019re singing right into the mic, do you have any woes?\u201d\u00a0All of them finished the kicking movement of their dance cleanly, and only Pei Tingsong pulled at the collar of his shirt from his position near the front of the stage.\u00a0\u201cFakers have all been kicked away by me. Please, when picking opponents your standards are too carefree.\u201d\u201cNext stop is my universe,\u201d\u00a0Pei Tingsong opened his right arm, his aura deft and full of provocation as he continued,\u00a0\u201cYou have one second to escape and curse.\u201dAs soon as he turned around, he and Fang Juexia looked at each other again. To his surprise, Fang Juexia, who had started singing the following part of the song, also stretched out his hand and patted his right palm.This brief collision was like a handover ceremony between comrades-in-arms.The lead singers started in on the chorus and stirred up the crowd again, their perfect triple harmony controlling the whole audience. Just after this part of the chorus, when repeating the lyrics, they wouldn\u2019t perform that uniform knifelike dance again. Pei Tingsong walked to the very front of the stage, sweeping through it in an absolutely gangster-like manner. He led his Geges in dispersing to various places on the huge stage, and then took the audience into singing along with them, \u201cWe gonna fight! Fight! Fight!\u00a0Sing together!\u201d\u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201dThe venue was boiling over, and all of the audience beneath the stage joined in. Following their rhythm and constantly repeating these syllables, the atmosphere kept climbing, and the thrilling scene of the sound accident turned into a concert chorus.The whole scene was boiling, and tens of thousands of glowsticks were waving frantically and flashing for them, for the very first time.They finished their final dance under the high-pitched harmony of Ling Yi and Juexia, turning around and switching into their ending formation as they waited for their two lead singers to finish the last bar.Everyone thought it was about to end. But in that instant, the accompaniment track, which had been absent this entire time, buzzed and then returned to normal, playing the last few seconds of the original accompaniment.Completely and absolutely, the dance of all the K members was to the beat of the track, including the last lyrics that came from Fang Juexia.[Just born for passion]As he put down the microphone, he and Pei Tingsong collided and looked up side-by-side in the double C position that was the ending movement of the dance, coming to a stop at the exact moment the last drumbeat of the track ended.The audience was stunned at first, then burst into applause and cheers, looking like a tide surging all around them!This was an imperfect live feast.\u201cThank you everyone!\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s chest heaved violently, and sweat from his forehead was about to drip into his eyes. The stage lighting dazzled his eyes. The audience chanted \u2018Kaleido\u2019 and \u2018Encore\u2019 repeatedly, with each chant growing louder than the one before, and this tide covered up his trembling breath.Finally, they were also like the other groups, now possessing the qualifications to have their name be called out with pride.Everything was like a dream.A complete and wonderful dream.\u201cThank you! Thank you Kaleido for your wonderful performance! It was really such a shock!\u201dTheir nerves, which had been stretched taut, loosened under the control of the host\u2019s voice, and the six of them bowed deeply towards the audience, not straightening up for a long time.Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand tightly held Fang Juexia\u2019s hand, all ten fingers intertwined, as if they had miraculously survived something.It was not until they straightened up that Pei Tingsong slowly let go. He didn\u2019t know why he was so excited. This felt like a flashpoint in his life, and it was also the first time that he felt the satisfaction that an idol stage would bring. He was so excited that he wanted to embrace every teammate, including Fang Juexia.While his thoughts were turning and churning, Pei Tingsong heard Fang Juexia\u2019s very quietly spoken words.Glancing to the side, he saw that this person\u2019s face that was covered with sweat, was smiling, panting and smiling at him.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cNow I think the lyrics you wrote are really good.\u201dYou will remember me after the storm.\u2014The author has something to say :[Super long warning ahead \u2013 I put the full version of \u201cKaleido\u201d lyrics as words, babies who don\u2019t want to read, remember to exit\u00a0oh, thank you! ](Trash lyrics, very sorry, but I can\u2019t write a performance chapter without lyrics.

However, once they stepped off the stage and returned to the lounge, the six big boys all had lingering fears in their hearts, with Ling Yi even directly starting to shed tears.\u201cDid I sing badly?\u201d He reached out in a panic and wiped his eyes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hear what I was singing, what to do, I\u2019m really sorry everyone, I shouldn\u2019t have said anything about my voice breaking before the show.\u201d\u201cAiya,\u00a0it\u2019s okay. You sang so well, and your voice didn\u2019t break. The wails that came out of your throat caused me to directly break out into goosebumps.\u201d Lu Yuan pulled him into his arms, but then energetically rubbed his hair. \u201cPurr, purr, little kitty, there\u2019s no need to get scared silly.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mess up my hair! It took a long time to blow dry it and style it that way! \u201d Ling Yi pushed him away, and his bitter expression just happened to get caught by the ensemble show camera. He immediately covered his face up. \u201cDon\u2019t film me, cut it out!\u201d\u201cCutting it, cutting it, this section has to be cut.\u201d Jiang Miao was about to go up and hug him, but He Ziyan seized him instead and handed him some candy. \u201cDon\u2019t go too fast. You didn\u2019t eat before you went on-stage, and you didn\u2019t crouch or sit down after getting down, so be careful you don\u2019t feel faint later.\u201dPei Tingsong was originally watching the fun when he suddenly realized they were missing a person. Only after turning his head did he realize that Fang Juexia was sitting alone, right by the corner of a wall.He walked up, and although he was concerned, he still used a tone that made him seem completely unconcerned. \u201cHey, there\u2019s a sofa, so why are you sitting on the ground?\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t answer, his head still buried in his arms.Seeing him like this, Pei Tingsong wanted to pull him up, but also felt that if he did so, it would be very strange. \u201cYour ears have been defeated, right?\u201d Saying that, he went to pull at Fang Juexia\u2019s arm but didn\u2019t manage to move it.However, at last, he heard this guy speak.\u201cMy legs have gone soft\u2026\u201dPfft.Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help laughing, and it got to the point where he couldn\u2019t stop. Fang Juexia was a bit dissatisfied and looked up at him as he asked, \u201cIs it that funny?\u201d\u201cEn, funny.\u201d Pei Tingsong crouched down, facing his icy cold face, and replied, \u201cOn the stage just now, you were so bold, leading the entire venue in charging forward. I thought you weren\u2019t afraid at all.\u201dWhen smiling, he looked more childlike. \u201cSo it turns out that you also have times when you panic\u00a0ah.\u201dFang Juexia just kept staring at him, but this look of his just made Pei Tingsong feel that he was cute, and reminded him of the kind of kitty that didn\u2019t like to stick close to people.\u201cAlright, if you let them see this later, they\u2019ll think that I\u2019m bullying you again.\u201d Pei Tingsong pulled at his arm, and propped him up, off of the ground. \u201cIf your legs have gone soft, don\u2019t be arrogant, sitting on the sofa is better than being on the ground.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Thank you.\u201d Fang Juexia sat down, his heart beat still not having returned to normal, and the remnant of a hum from the stage still in his ears. In the situation from just now, all of them had basically been walking a tightrope; any carelessness, and the entire group wouldn\u2019t have any way to make a turnaround.Thankfully, they gritted their teeth and got through it.The makeup artists came into the lounge to help remove their makeup, and they were really excited, even hating that they couldn\u2019t praise these boys up into the skies. Adding on the laptop that was playing the livestream the entire time, the whole lounge had become very lively.A new performance was being shown on the livestream, and it was again a lip-synching performance, with the movements of the performers\u2019 mouths not even matching up to the song. The movements of their mouths were about the same as their expressions for the performance.\u201cAh, it\u2019s lip synching again.\u201d A makeup artist little Jiejie took a cotton swab and went to Fang Juexia, chatting and joking, \u201cAt this time, the sound actually manages to work well.\u201d Fang Juexia just sat on the sofa and let the makeup artist little Jiejie take off his eye makeup without saying a word.Xiao Wen said, \u201cBut it is pretty miserable to appear after you guys now\u00a0la. Anyway, Xiao Pei, your freestyle rap just now, really, I was trembling as I heard it down there.\u201dPei Tingsong declined the makeup artist\u2019s help and took the cotton swab himself. \u201cWhat, I didn\u2019t say anything that wasn\u2019t true.\u201dHe Ziyan smiled and repeated his previously improvised lines, \u201cYour little bitches love me so~\u201dSitting in front of the mirror, Lu Yuan was getting carried away as he spoke up, \u201cNo, no, no, the sentence that was the most awesome was, \u2018The original lyrics have been thrown below, and we\u2019re singing right into the mic, do you have any woes?\u2019 At that time, my heart shuddered and nearly missed a beat. I was worrying whether I would get frozen out because of Pei Tingsong, this little Lao Di.\u201dLing Yi shook his head. \u201cXiao Pei is too shameless. Every time he writes lyrics, if they\u2019re not praising himself, then they\u2019re dissing someone else.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll diss you next time.\u201dJiang Miao interjected, \u201cBut fortunately, Xiao Pei and He Ziyan\u2019s beatboxing was there to save us.\u201dFang Juexia closed his eyes and didn\u2019t participate in the discussion. Whenever someone said something, he would silently nod. Pei Tingsong was sitting in a spot not far away from him, leaning back on the sofa and wiping his face with a cotton swab, joining in on He Ziyan\u2019s jokes sometimes.The lounge was noisy, but it was not as noisy as when they had been on the stage. Fang Juexia\u2019s mind was currently filled with Pei Tingsong\u2019s smile, the scene of him rapping, and the indescribable presence he radiated\u2014which gave off the feel of a newborn calf who didn\u2019t even fear tigers. He wasn\u2019t sure whether he had fallen into the trap of his imagination of them on a suspension bridge from before, but at that moment, he had really been moved by Pei Tingsong\u2019s rap.As time went by, no more accidents happened, and the hosts of the live broadcast read off of the script that had been written for them.Fang Juexia\u2019s little internal clock was also ticking along, pretty much like before, never dragging or stumbling. The second hand moved bit by bit, ten, nine, eight, seven\u2026\u201cXiao Pei will treat us all later.\u201dPei Tingsong threw the cotton swab that he had just used on one side of his face at He Ziyan. \u201cBased on what, are you the Gege, or am I the Gege?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the Gege, and you\u2019re the tyrant\u00a0ah. Look at your pace just now, at the end of the performance, where you were acting as if you were disowning all your relatives and friends, were you taking us to head into a fight\u00a0ah?\u201dPei Tingsong closed his eyes and laughed. \u201cThen you call me Gege, and I\u2019ll\u2026.\u201dA soft, low voice interrupted his banter.\u201cNew Year\u2019s Eve is here.\u201dFrom the laptop came the background sound of the host\u2019s announcement of the time, as well as the large-scale singing and dancing performance that started right on time at 00:00. This noisy and excited madness wanted to get into his brain, occupy his mind, and prod him into joining in the revelry.But right now, he could only hear one person\u2019s voice. Pei Tingsong opened his eyes, which he had closed to douse with make-up cleanser. He hazily saw Fang Juexia\u2019s fresh and clean face. His eyes were also closed, and he looked unexpectedly not ice-cold, but very warm.\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d he said softly.Pei Tingsong fell into a rare daze, while still clenching the cotton swab in his hand. His mind went entirely blank, his usual glib tongue had degenerated into a state of blunt silence, and only his auditory senses felt as if they had grown more sensitive.He had heard Fang Juexia\u2019s words, had heard them clearly and distinctly, with the words even echoing repeatedly in his heart.\u201cThank you\u2026\u201dAs soon as he said it, he regretted it. He felt that he had sounded so weak and not cool at all. He had actually been so dazzled by this guy Fang Juexia that he had even dumbly just said thank you to him.It must have been because that terrifying performance had exhausted all of his energy.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Maybe you don\u2019t celebrate your birthday according to the lunar calendar.\u201dIn fact\u2026 it wasn\u2019t like he couldn\u2019t celebrate it now, after all, they were all Chinese. Pei Tingsong mumbled in his heart\u2014Yeah, he\u2019s Chinese, so he could celebrate his birthday according to the lunar calendar, what about it?This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgPei Tingsong said, \u201cActually\u2026\u201d\u201cYes\u00a0ah! Xiao Pei\u2019s birthday is today!\u201d Ling Yi\u2019s appearance interrupted the possibility of conveying his reply to Fang Juexia. The ability of a lead singer with a loud voice was to call all the people to his side in a flash, and thus this single birthday wish was turned into a wishing carnival by a large group of people.Jiang Miao glanced at the time and said, \u201cHey, then that\u2019s just perfect. We\u2019ll go out and have some delicious food in a moment, and let\u2019s all celebrate together.\u201dLing Yi exclaimed, \u201cHot pot! Hot pot!\u201dLu Yuan retorted, \u201cKebabs! Kebabs!\u201dHe Ziyan raised his hand. \u201cCaptain, I want to drink alcohol.\u201dFang Juexia, who had made this all happen, retreated and was squeezed aside as he quietly watched everyone argue. He just laughed and didn\u2019t speak any more.Pei Tingsong was happy, but he kept feeling as if something was stuck in his heart. It felt really uncomfortable to be forcefully interrupted before he could utter what he wanted to say. He finally understood what it was meant for someone to\u00a0steal his initiative.At this time, Agent Cheng Qiang rushed through the door into the lounge, and exclaimed in an excited voice, \u201cYou guys are on the Hot Search list again!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Lu Yuan quickly logged into his Weibo side account and scrolled through his homepage a bit. A big-name verified entertainment account that he was following was actually forwarding the recording of their performance.[@Wave after wave: Did you guys see Kaleido\u2019s (thank you ppl for telling me the name) completely live singing performance?! F*ck! Too amazing! Watching it, I jumped out of bed like a carp, feeling doughty as a dragon and lively as a tiger, and dashed around like a tiger running down the mountain! They really turned a scene of an accident into a rave, quickly go watch it for me! High energy starts at the 32 second mark! However, we still have to curse out the garbage hardware of a certain platform. They had such a big venue, and yet such an accident could still occur.][@Can I pass the CPA exam this year: Watched it! As soon as the lead singer wearing the grey shirt opened his mouth, I began to break out in goosebumps. The whole group singing into hand-held mics was really awesome, did these six all debut as vocals?][@Little smart guy is me: Two days ago, when they were crazily climbing the Hot Search, I actually thought they were just selling rotten fanservice and was a little disgusted. I didn\u2019t expect my\u00a0reversal\u00a0to come so quickly. PS: CloudTV is as garbage as ever\u00a0ah][@woxiaole: Selling rot is pretty good, but this level of performance already reaches the ceiling of an idol group\u2019s professional ability. After all, some idols find it even hard just to match up the shape of their mouth with lip synching.][@My precious is so Sue: Even me, a person who never pays attention to boybands, by the time I finished watching it, I felt on fire, really wanting to dance! That\u00a0plgg\u00a0with the red at the corner of his eyes is really powerful, his reaction time is amazing!][@Taking 8 days off a week: Before, I didn\u2019t find that this obscure group (fans don\u2019t hit me) was very strong. I just saw that the two faces of the group formed a CP to get on the Hot Search, and I thought they were an empty flower vase, but they turned out to actually be aces. The second when they took off their ear pieces, they looked so hot, I was about to fall over. The rappers are also very strong, and this is the first time I\u2019ve seen such good flow in a boyband. The whole group performed without earpieces, and their rhythm, intonation, and expressiveness weren\u2019t affected. What\u2019s more, was the last fading echoes of background sound there just to magnify their awesomeness XD? Perfectly on point, and even if you\u2019re not a fan, you should praise them, they really brought light to their obscure group.][@Inherit my\u00a0Huabei: You don\u2019t say, but they may not be an obscure group after this. Take a look at how many threads this has spawned\u00a0ba, and they\u2019ve exploded on the Hot Search list. Conspiracy theory wave, this accident couldn\u2019t have been created to make sure things couldn\u2019t result in a scandal\u00a0ba.][@ Smile and don\u2019t talk replying to @Inherit my Huabei: This \u201ccreated accident\u201d is too miserable, not even preventing trouble but causing more popularity hahahah. PS: I fell in love with the main dancer Gege with the slicked back hair, his explosive and controlled moves were so strong! And the Gege with the blue hair, when he smiles, his eyes droop down, and it\u2019s too sweet!][@Hugging close my little obscure K: This fan feels ashamed, can\u2019t praise as well as some passersby, can only silently like their statements.][@LOLLOLlollol: No one mentioned that rapper with the glasses? Holy shit, when he was acting so gangster in front of the camera, he killed me! His beatboxing was infused with soul.][@Pinot Tree Supreme needs to grow well replying to @LOLLOLlollol: I\u2019m here, I\u2019m here. Letting you understand our 19-year-old suit-wearing, gangster-like wolf pup Pei Tingsong\u2014he\u2019s the youngest member of the group, and the lyrics of this song were also written by him! What\u2019s more, his lines changed when he was rapping during the performance, the original version is more harmonious hh][@LOLLOLlollol replying to @Pinot Tree Supreme needs to grow well: The youngest??? WTF, I thought he was the oldest. I was just saying how his words seemed to be satirizing the situation with the mics at the gala tonight. Shit, he can still freestyle under these circumstances, respect\u2026][@Did the little artist post a selfie today: Wasn\u2019t there a group before who had mocked this group as being bargain-bin artists just shoved together, but now it seems that\u2019s not the case\u00a0oh. All the ones carried out seem to be beautiful, strong, pitiful characters.]Later, CloudTV\u2019s official Weibo released the live video of Kaleido\u2019s performance. Very quickly, the video became the first real hard core program to make it\u2019s way out of the entertainment circle that night, under the numerous forwards it was given by many big verified accounts. Kaleido once again appeared on the Hot Search list, becoming truly worthy of being called a Hot Search group. Station B\u2019s video editors matched their live performance that didn\u2019t have any accompanying music, with the original CD accompaniment music for comparison, and the comparison video also appeared on the homepage of the video website.Overnight, the follower count on all six of their Weibos doubled and skyrocketed. The most exaggerated accounts belonged to Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong, who were quickly becoming the favorite of the fan circle. However, these heartless boys didn\u2019t pay any attention to that at all. They forced their family\u2019s youngest to celebrate his birthday, eating and drinking, and then staying at a KTV all night, only returning to their dormitories in the early hours of the morning. Relying on the fact that their schedules were temporarily empty, they all went to sleep the entire day away.They don\u2019t know how much of an online tsunami that performance of theirs had caused.The CloudTV network program group was cursed out by people online until they had no choice but to put out an apology statement for the previous stage accident. The next day, #Star Chart Scout#\u00a0 and #Kaleido member experience# appeared on the Hot Search list. Various marketing accounts appeared on the Hot Search list by picking out and publishing their photos and videos from their debut, and by sharing the clips of Lu Yuan and Ling Yi participating in their competitions, the video of He Ziyan performing at bars, and even Jiang Miao\u2019s guzheng livestreams. Of course, they didn\u2019t miss the news articles of Fang Juexia being selected as his department idol when he was in university, or early posts by a certain official in his old company who had designated him as a treasure that absolutely had to make an official debut.The only mystery was Pei Tingsong, with any explosive headlines about him being deleted in a second. There was also a blogger claiming to be an informed person, who sent an image of an attendance register from a famous American school, and Pei Tingsong\u2019s name was circled in red in it. He vividly described his family background and his legendary childhood of when he had dropped out of school without permission, and had then gotten beaten up and sent to the hospital by his dad because he was mixing in the underground rap scene without his permission, and then had run away from the hospital. However, this post was also quickly deleted, with this person\u2019s Weibo ID even being completely suspended.The power of gossip was infinite. Netizens were more curious about such a combination of mysteries. It seemed that every person in this group had quite a story, which had taken the form for many different styles of \u201cprotagonist\u201d scripts.This group of six beautiful, strong, and pitiful people was completely worthy of its name.\u2014The author has something to say :Happy Valentine\u2019s day, little angels!Next chapter TingJue is going to go do a sweet and cute(cross out) a double person photoshoot\u00a0la!!Thank you everyone for your support of Xiao Paradox! Love you guys~~My six sons, bow to everyone!!! (ZC: Juexia, please press down the head of Pinot Tree Supreme, thank you.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 18Chapter 18 \u2013 Injustice Provokes An OutcryTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksIt seems as if he really isn\u2019t gay.Inevitably, once they became the center of everyone\u2019s discussion, rumors about their group spread rampantly again, especially those about Fang Juexia, who had a stormy and bloody past. The only difference was that compared to before, he now had more fans who were counterattacking the antis, and received more support from the netizens. For the first time, the number of clarification Weibo posts and popular forum posts was more than the rumor posts. Many of the more\u00a0extreme antis\u00a0opined that he was purposefully making himself look pitiful just so that he would have more fans defending him.In reality, Fang Juexia, who was at the center of this whirlpool, had no emotions to spare or time to pay attention to these matters. After the livestream of the accident and their performance, Kaleido\u2019s commercial activities increased rapidly, with big brand companies and major program groups throwing olive branches at them one after another. They had a lot more to do than pay attention to online public opinion.The other members had their own personal schedules, and Fang Juexia\u2019s latest upcoming job was a two-person photoshoot for the cover of a magazine with Pei Tingsong. This cover could count as being his first job in the fashion industry, and moreover, it was also for one of the five major fashion magazines. If the effect was good, it would unlock a whole new circle for them. If the effect wasn\u2019t good, then their plane would have crashed upon takeoff.At 5:30 in the morning, Cheng Qiang came to the dormitory to wake up Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong, so as to get them ready for the photoshoot for the magazine. The weather was getting colder and colder, and it had snowed heavily the previous night.Pei Tingsong\u2019s bad mood at having to get up early was serious, and even after they reached the dressing room, where they had to choose outfits, he was still making a face, not caring the slightest about even pretending to put on the image of being a kindhearted and dedicated idol. Like an overworked demon in hell who was assigned to push others\u2014 this was the novel simile that Fang Juexia\u2019s brain came up with after looking at him.\u201cMorning~\u201d The door was pushed open, and a tall, strong man in a fluorescent colored down jacket entered the room, after which his rough voice pinched sharply up as he greeted, \u201cHi~ I\u2019m today\u2019s modeling director, you guys can call me Andy.\u201d His fingernails were very long, with glitter and small gems on them. Fang Juexia politely smiled at him and greeted, \u201cHello.\u201d\u201cDo you have no makeup on, darling?!\u201d Andy talked in a very exaggerated way, exactly like an actress in a musical. He suddenly drew closer, which made Fang Juexia unconsciously lean back. \u201cWow, you have the palest and most beautiful skin of all the male artists I\u2019ve worked with. Many artists like to say that they\u2019re naturally pale, but in fact, they usually lay on three layers of makeup in private.\u201d Saying this, he suddenly saw the birthmark at the corner of Fang Juexia\u2019s eye and reached out to rub it. \u201cEh, I\u2019ve been surprised this whole time\u00a0oh,\u00a0this mark on your face\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be curious, really.\u201d Pei Tingsong grabbed his hand and pulled it away from Fang Juexia\u2019s face. Pei Tingsong had a fake smile on his face as he said, \u201cAndy Ge, shouldn\u2019t you go find clothes for us?\u201dAndy saw Pei Tingsong, and his expression suddenly turned a little shy. He went along to lightly pat Pei Tingsong\u2019s sleeve as he said, \u201cAiya, yes, yes, yes, going to find clothes. Tingsong is so tall, he should have been a model.\u201d Pei Tingsong was\u00a0rarely\u00a0called that, and so he directly broke out in goosebumps and let go of the other person\u2019s hand. Andy took off his coat and revealed the slightly slim-fitted black T-shirt he was wearing. He reached out to fan himself. \u201cCoco, take out the design plan for the photoshoot.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t have a good or bad feeling about Andy. When they were just an obscure group, he had gotten used to the contempt of the staff. In fact, there had been many times where his face after getting made up looked worse than when he didn\u2019t have any make-up on. Idols were different from other artists, they relied a lot on their stylists, and thus, the status of stylists in this small circle was not low. This Andy was famous, but he didn\u2019t put on any airs, which already counted as very good. He glanced at Pei Tingsong and felt that his reaction was actually much more obvious.It seems as if he really isn\u2019t gay\u2014Fang Juexia thought.Coco, the modeling assistant who distributed the materials, was a girl who talked very fast. \u201cIt\u2019ll be spring soon, so the magazine has decided on a \u2018colorful spring day\u2019 concept. Because the studio picked a greenhouse for the shooting location, we will also do some styling with natural scenery, such as with flowers and plants.\u201dAt this time, Xiao Zhou, the assistant photographer who was responsible for communicating with the modeling department, also entered. He discussed some things with Andy for a bit and confirmed on the style of makeup again.Fang Juexia opened up their plans, and inside the file were some abstract design drafts and color combination schemes. It did look good, but he possessed a good memory. He remembered that the star-making role of the actor who had previously cut him out of this job had been a florist, and this design plan seemed to be tailor-made for him.He flipped forward some more pages, and sure enough, both the concept and the overall style were born out of the theme \u201cflorist\u201d. From the text of the concept, the parts regarding 'spring\u201d looked like they had been added on later, making it all feel as if this design plan had been done in a very impromptu manner.However, Fang Juexia knew that he could not ask too much based on his qualifications. If this was a job on the stage, he would definitely not permit even a speck of dust to enter his eye, and even if there was a slight flaw in the headset, he wouldn\u2019t accept it. But he already wasn\u2019t that enthusiastic about jobs aside from work on the stage, so he naturally wouldn\u2019t put up a fight about this matter.The assistant photographer also cooperated. \u201cYes, the magazine also feels that both of these people fall in line with the concept of spring in terms of image and temperament. The style of young people in florals has been enduring, and recently, the popularity of these two has also been very high, so we would like the two of them to get similar makeup, so as to give the idea of them being twins.\u201dIt seemed that in their desire to make the whole design easier for themselves, they had just fitted this leftover florist-themed design on the two of them. Fang Juexia closed the planning book, vaguely worried about whether this kind of floral concept makeup would make him look feminine or vulgar.\u201cSo we will highlight the similarities between the two with their makeup\u2026.\u201d\u201cExcuse me.\u201d The assistant was interrupted.Fang Juexia looked back and saw Pei Tingsong slowly raising his hand. \u201cCan I join in on this discussion?\u201dArtists from idol groups interfering with photoshoots was a regular occurance, and they\u2019d come across many rude requests, so surprise only flashed for a moment on the assistant photographer\u2019s face before he said, \u201cOf course.\u201dHowever, Fang Juexia understood Pei Tingsong\u2019s personality, and was sure that this person was definitely not going to do something as simple as just joining in on the discussion. From the start just now, his expression hadn\u2019t looked very good.\u201cThen I\u2019ll say it directly, this design is very good.\u201d Pei Tingsong sat on the sofa, raised his head, and smiled before he continued, \u201cBut it\u2019s not suitable for Juexia Ge at all.\u201dFang Juexia was a little stunned.\u201cAlso, I don\u2019t look like him at all. The concept of twins will be very difficult to apply to us.\u201dThe words didn\u2019t count as being the slightest bit euphemistic, and everyone in the room now carried a different expression. Even Cheng Qiang, who had been checking the questions for the interview the whole time, felt the embarrassment that now floated in the atmosphere. He looked up at everyone and immediately laughed while excusing, \u201cThat\u2019s just what our Xiao Pei is like. Having grown up abroad, he says whatever he thinks; everyone can just listen to him speak, but you don\u2019t have to take his advice.\u201dCoincidentally, the door was pushed open at that moment, and this time it was the tardy photographer Lin Mo who entered. His position in the circle was extraordinary, and what he was best at was excavating and magnifying anyone\u2019s most brilliant features. No matter how generic a model looked, the picture he would shoot of them would be absolutely beautiful.The only trouble was that this photographer was eccentric, difficult to work with, and worked only on projects that attracted his attention. The magazine managing to invite him this time was purely due to luck; because of a scheduling problem, a famous foreign actor had canceled their photoshoot, and only then could they take advantage of this vacancy in Lin Mo\u2019s shooting schedule.\u201cXiao Zhou? Are the lights ready?\u201d His tone didn\u2019t sound very nice, and he took a general look at the situation in the room before asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dAssistant Xiao Zhou laughed twice and replied, \u201cOh, there\u2019s no problem, there\u2019s no problem, I\u2019m going to find the lighting technician.\u201d\u201cThere is a problem.\u201d Pei Tingsong looked at Lin Mo, and his tone was neither humble nor overbearing as he stated, \u201cMr. Lin, I just looked through your assistant\u2019s design book. To be honest, it doesn\u2019t look like\u00a0your\u00a0style.\u201dFor Lin Mo, this job was just a job to fill the hole in his schedule. When his assistant had offered to plan it, he had agreed. On the other hand, he was biased against the profession of idols.In his opinion, beautiful faces often had no story to tell, and the photos that he took of them couldn\u2019t speak and possessed no soul. Moreover, the main requirement of these beautiful faces was often \u201cplease make me look more beautiful\u201d, which made Lin Mo unable to realize the true value of his work when shooting them.From the start, this was the attitude with which he had regarded these two boyband members who had become very popular recently. When he heard Pei Tingsong being critical of the design, this view of his solidified further. Lin Mo laughed and looked at Fang Juexia, who hadn\u2019t reacted at all. \u201cDo you also think so?\u201dJust by glancing at him, he could feel that Fang Juexia was more like an exquisitely made, flawless doll, rather than a human being.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgFang Juexia had always been weak in expressing himself.Yet somehow, he had a kind of subtle tacit understanding with Pei Tingsong. For example, just now, when Pei Tingsong had interrupted the assistant, he had immediately understood what Pei Tingsong had meant by \u201cnot suitable.\u201d Originally, he had wanted to compromise, just like how he had done many times before, because he felt that these matters were not important, and that they could all just go through the motions together.However, it was obvious that Pei Tingsong would just not stand down on this matter, and so he had to stand up and lift aside the white curtain here.As a bandmate who had debuted together with him, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t like this kind of solitary courage. So he chose to express himself this time, and even Cheng Qiang was surprised at this.\u201cWhen Xiao Pei said it wasn\u2019t suitable, he wasn\u2019t negating the entire design; it is very good in itself and very suitable for Pei Tingsong.\u201d Fang Juexia kept up a polite smile as he explained, \u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026 If we simply try to combine the two of us in line with recent network trends, that may not be the best solution. We are very different.\u201dLin Mo nodded thoughtfully, glancing a few times back and forth between these two boyband members that he wasn\u2019t familiar with, and then took a design book from the table, flipping it open to look at it.\u201cAs soon as I got the design, I knew that it wasn\u2019t your work,\u201d Pei Tingsong directly laid it bare. \u201cAfter all, you\u2019re the photographer who dislikes assembly line photos the most.\u201dHearing this, Cheng Qiang\u2019s heart was completely on edge; such a statement was directly equivalent to Pei Tingsong slapping the face of Lin Mo\u2019s studio. He wanted to speak, but Fang Juexia, who was standing beside him, gently pulled at his arm to stop his movement.Lin Mo paused in flipping through the book. He raised his head, squinted at Pei Tingsong, then stood up and walked towards him step by step.For a while, the atmosphere in the room dropped to below freezing, and even Andy, a worldly-wise person, didn\u2019t dare take a breath.Only once he walked and stood in front of Pei Tingsong did Lin Mo finally open his mouth and comment, \u201cYou\u2019re quite capable\u00a0ah.\u201dFang Juexia silently breathed a sigh of relief.\u201cXiao Zhou,\u201d Lin Mo turned around. \u201cYou came up with such a perfunctory design for me, so did you think I also regarded this job as just something to go through the motions with?\u201dThese words were very artful, not only separating the matter of this design from himself, but also expressing his attitude towards his work.Xiao Zhou mumbled in agreement. The boss was bad-tempered and cursed him out almost every day. He counted it lucky that he had just been reprimanded and not cursed out today. What\u2019s more, he really had been lazy. Knowing that that leftover design plan was still around, he had just gone to discuss it with the modeling team and had then changed it a bit to reuse it.Lin Mo drew closer to Pei Tingsong, and in a volume that only the two of them could hear, asked, \u201cIf you were photographed using this design, you would still be brilliant, so why did you stick your head out like that?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this a two-person shoot?\u201d Pei Tingsong raised his eyebrows.Lin Mo nodded with a smile. \u201cSure enough, you\u2019re just the way your Jie said you were.\u201dPei Tingsong smiled and replied, \u201cShe definitely didn\u2019t say anything good.\u201dLin Mo turned around and said, \u201cXiao Zhou, change the design right now. We will keep the spring concept only for Pei Tingsong\u2019s shoot.\u201d Xiao Zhou exclaimed in a hurry and flipped open his laptop. He saw the boss walk to a stop in front of Fang Juexia and look at him. He spoke slowly, \u201cJust\u2026. We won\u2019t do spring for you. Fang Juexia\u2019s features are too delicate, and being surrounded by masses of flowers will look too vulgar on him, while making any of his distinguishing features disappear.\u201d Then he asked, \u201cWhat ideas do you have?\u201dFang Juexia had remained so silent all this while that he didn\u2019t seem like an artist, and he didn\u2019t seem to show much emotional fluctuation upon hearing the question.\u201cWinter.\u201dLin Mo\u2019s eyes flashed with surprise. \u201cWhy?\u201dAs Fang Juexia recalled something, the constantly pursed corner of his mouth suddenly curved imperceptibly, giving off an effect totally different from all his previous professional smiles. This was a smile from the heart.\u201cSome people say I look like ice.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, he has been like this since he was a child. In other people\u2019s eyes, he was just a stubborn person who shouldn\u2019t be trifled with. The unexpected thing here was that Fang Juexia had understood him. Originally, he had thought that at the most, Fang Juexia would manage to guess that he was dissatisfied with this sloppy design, but he hadn\u2019t really expected Fang Juexia to completely comprehend his entire thought process.It was as if their two minds had accidentally connected.They were contradictory people. They weren\u2019t a mutual, bionic melding of images, but strong personalities set opposite one another.Fang Juexia had his own temperament and style, which shouldn\u2019t be homogenized in such a rough manner.These ideas seemed to flow through both their minds. Pei Tingsong attributed this kind of unexplained tacit understanding to the two years they had spent together. Even though there was near zero communication between them, nothing in this world was purely isolated. There existeds a subtle connection between him and Fang Juexia, one which was complex and hard to detect.Maybe they had similarities in their logic\u00a0ba\u2014he tried to come up with a reasonable explanation.Lin Mo seemed to be very satisfied with Fang Juexia\u2019s proposal. Images and inspiration appeared in his mind, which greatly improved his enthusiasm for this job. \u201cSpring and winter, very good.\u201d He checked over Fang Juexia\u2019s face, scrutinised it very carefully, and finally came to the conclusion, \u201cYou really do fit the concept of winter. Andy.\u201d\u201cHey~ Coming, I also think this version is better. The end of winter and the arrival of spring are also in line with the season right now, and these two weren\u2019t the same type in the first place. I will have to think hard about the makeup style this time.\u201d Andy had been in the circle for ten years, and he was a real talent. As soon as he looked at Lin Mo\u2019s expression, he knew that this shoot was going to become a big ticket item. The idea he had at the start, of just paddling along and taking it easy, had already disappeared; after all, he was cooperating with a big photographer and two upstarts in the circle this time.The most taboo thing in the entertainment industry was to look down on someone. No one could predict who could turn popular overnight. What\u2019s more, the explosive popularity these two had garnered was as obvious as the nose on his face.They spent more than two hours discussing everything over again. Such a process was not common in the entertainment industry that tended to pursue high efficiency, where everyone hoped to directly start the work and then quickly finish the job. But it was worth it. After all, starting from a perfunctory assembly line design to actually having everyone be seriously involved in creating this design, this kind of experience was rare and interesting enough.The editor, who was noting down the interesting tidbits for the interview piece, was giggling. He usually had nothing to write and had to scramble and just piece something together. Now, this dramatic turn of events was practically just delivering great material straight into his lap.Pei Tingsong\u2019s make-up was clean and simple. Andy also specially highlighted the two moles below his eye and on his lower eyelid. \u201cYour moles are just in the right place. The popular saying for these kinds is that they\u2019re both pure and lustful.\u201dWhen Fang Juexia, who was just coming out of the dressing room, heard that, he felt that it was odd. At the moment, he couldn\u2019t sense that feel coming off of Pei Tingsong at all. However, the semantic meanings of pure and lustful were completely opposite, and this sense of contradiction was totally in line with his personality.\u201cThe scab at the corner of your eye\u2026\u201d Andy looked at his raised scab and worried a bit. \u201cCan\u2019t cover it with concealer, just photoshop it out later\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cDo whatever is convenient\u00a0ba.\u201d Pei Tingsong had begun to feel sleepy again and was too lazy to care about these details.Fang Juexia stared at the huge mirror in the dressing room, through which Pei Tingsong could be seen sitting, and the injury at the corner of his eye could be seen clearly as well. He had changed into a milk brown T-shirt, and his rebellious temperament had softened a lot.\u201cJuexia, coffee.\u201d Cheng Qiang, who had gone out and came back during this time, placed a cup down in front of Pei Tingsong, and then led Fang Juexia, who had yet to start modeling clothes, to sit down in a corner of the dressing room. \u201cSleepy\u00a0ba?\u201d\u201cNot bad.\u201d Fang Juexia discovered that the wooden table in this corner was empty, but on the floor was a small potted plant\u2014a tree made of pink flowers.He carefully looked at the flowering tree while carrying the cup of coffee in his hand. Right then, Coco, the modeling assistant, came to clip up his hair, and he asked softly, \u201cHello, what kind of flower is this?\u201d\u201cThis\u00a0ah, this is a\u00a0winter-flowering cherry tree, which was given to Mr. Andy two days ago. There are so many people here today that we were afraid of it falling over, so we placed it on the ground.\u201dWinter-flowering cherry tree.After getting the last clip affixed to his hair, Fang Juexia squatted at the side of the small flowering tree. The soil of the flowerpot was covered with a layer of fallen petals, all of which looked very soft and light pink.The ensemble show\u2019s camera was still focused on Pei Tingsong. Pei Tingsong grew bored as his makeup was being applied, and he started to chat with the cameraman, \u201cHow about we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses has to tell a story?\u201dThe cameraman shook his camera back and forth in a gesture of refusal.\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of losing. I know.\u201d Pei Tingsong put on a cold expression and stated his judgement, while his makeup was almost close to being done. As soon as he looked into the mirror, he saw Fang Juexia coming towards him. He had changed a loose black shirt, which only served to make the cold paleness of his skin more obvious.He seemed to be looking for a make-up assistant in order to borrow something. Finally, he took a very small bottle and squeezed a bit of something onto his hand.\u201cAlmost done, it\u2019s just this scab that\u2019s troublesome.\u201d As Andy was talking, Fang Juexia suddenly said, \u201cI want to try something.\u201d\u201cTry what?\u201d As soon as Pei Tingsong asked, Fang Juexia had already bent over towards him on his own initiative.The distance between the two people suddenly reduced to less than five centimeters, and the air seemed to have been suppressed solid. As Pei Tingsong breathed in, the rippling smell of ice cream when an ice cream container was just opened wafted over once again. His eyes were full of the red birthmark at the corner of Fang Juexia\u2019s eye, like just a touch of red on a field of white snow.The palpitations of his heart were short-lived, for Fang Juexia\u2019s action was also short-lived, so short that his consciousness had no time to process this feeling before his fingertips lifted off of Pei Tingsong\u2019s skin.After a few seconds of careful study, Fang Juexia straightened up and looked at him again.\u201cHow about this?\u201d After finishing his art, he lifted his head up to look at Andy.Andy held Pei Tingsong\u2019s jaw and looked into the mirror. It was only then that Pei Tingsong discovered that the scab at the corner of his eye was now covered by a pink petal.Fang Juexia\u2019s voice didn\u2019t carry too much emotion, just stating his own point of view. \u201cPerfectly it\u2019s a spring concept, so flowers shouldn\u2019t conflict with it.\u201dAndy looked left and right and was very surprised. He repeated the word \u201cperfect\u201d a few times, then affixed the petal with detachable glue and said, \u201cAnd with this stuck on, it echoes the birthmark on Juexia\u2019s face.\u201dFang Juexia hadn\u2019t thought of this, so he was left stunned for a moment. When he bowed his head, his eyes accidentally met Pei Tingsong\u2019s.Pei Tingsong lifted his eyes, his fingers touching the petal that covered his scar, and he said, \u201cYou did this on purpose\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Fang Juexia refuted quickly. This was quite different to his usual reaction speed.Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes swept lazily across his bare face and finally stopped at his scarlet neck. He didn\u2019t speak and instead looked at himself in the mirror. With the petal at the corner of his eye, he really did have something in common with Fang Juexia.\u201cTingsong\u2019s makeup is more simple, giving the kind of feeling that nothing has been done, but in actuality, a lot of care has gone into the details.\u201d Andy started to make up Fang Juexia. \u201cJuexia\u2019s make-up will be a bit more special.\u201dPei Tingsong lifted his coffee cup and sat in the chair next to him. He had a rare chance to have an honest reason to freely stare at Fang Juexia.Andy didn\u2019t apply any foundation on Fang Juexia. \u201cYour skin is too good, if we put any on, all the natural texture of your face will be rubbed out.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgFang Juexia\u2019s expressionless face was reflected in the mirror.Taking advantage of the time they took to style his hair, Pei Tingsong unscrupulously observed Fang Juexia through the mirror. He realized that, in fact, Fang Juexia\u2019s facial features were heavily idol-like\u2014beautiful, exquisite, and looked unburdened by life. However, the ridge of his brow and the bridge of his nose were very special; they were perpendicular to each other. On that narrow face, was a thin and straight T-shaped shape, making the face seem like something between a man\u2019s rugged cragginess and a woman\u2019s softness and smoothness, just reflecting the image of a solitary pine rising from the ground on a flat snow plain.This kind of lonely and upright bone intensified the stubborn feeling of being cold and alone he gave off.Pei Tingsong thought that if the ridge of his brow and the bridge of his nose were matched with a pair of sweet and bright big eyes, perhaps the cold feeling he gave off could still be neutralized. Yet, he just had to be born with a pair of beautiful cold eyes, with narrow and thin double eyelids, lightly colored irises, and corners that were neither ordinary nor bad looking. They all said that eyes could send speechless messages, but Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes seemed to be separated from the world by a layer of transparent ice. His eyes couldn\u2019t pass on any feelings, just freezing logic and alienation. And all of this was set on pale skin, like a tough yet fragile white flower.That withered branch waiting to be broken, tenaciously using the last of its ability to let a single flower blossom\u2014a sad and gorgeous white flower.Fang Juexia\u2019s eye makeup was not complicated, for Andy did not even put any black mascara on him. Instead, he pulled out a white mascara bottle and brushed it on his long eyelashes. The color was brushed onto his eyelashes bit by bit, to make it seem as if snowflakes had fallen on his eyelashes, and a wintery feeling immediately appeared.Fang Juexia raised his eyes at that moment, and Pei Tingsong had to admit that he was really moved by this pure white beauty. Originally, there had been no escape from Fang Juexia\u2019s inherent coldness, but now, the coldness became even more intense.Even the modeling assistant\u2019s words carried some surprise as he praised, \u201cSo immortal\u00a0ah, immortal and cold.\u201dAndy swept a bit of blush on Fang Juexia\u2019s lower eyelid, extending it all the way to his red birthmark, and then applied a nearly invisible white eyeliner along his lower eyelid, before using silver eyeshadow to draw tear shaped marks under the corner of his eye, allowing them to flow all the way down, just like a trail of frozen tears.It gave off the feeling that he was crying, Pei Tingsong thought to himself.But Fang Juexia probably couldn\u2019t cry. He couldn\u2019t imagine what such an emotionless person would look like if he cried.In the whole of the two years since they debuted to now, he could hardly recall any emotional moments from Fang Juexia. Although their relationship could only be regarded as that between professional bandmates, they hadn\u2019t spent any less time with each other than with the others.While searching through his memory, he actually recalled something.A year ago, when the group had been doing a commercial performance, he had gone out to take a breather before going in for makeup, and had accidentally run into Fang Juexia in the corridor. He had been standing at the side of the vending machine and had been talking on the phone. It seemed like he really hadn\u2019t wanted to be seen, so he had hidden himself behind the machine. Pei Tingsong vaguely heard him call out to his mother and between words, he had mentioned things about his grandfather going to see the doctor.Originally, he had not been interested in listening and had just been struggling over whether he still wanted to buy a drink. However, the other party just happened to turn around at that moment, and the two people\u2019s gazes had awkwardly connected.At that time, a stunned expression had appeared on Fang Juexia\u2019s face, and the corners of his eyes were red, with the ice in his eyes having melted as his eyes shone with liquid. He had held his cellphone, bowed his head, and had left in a hurry, just like a cold wind passing by.It was also that time that Pei Tingsong, who pursued logic and self-consistency in everything, figured out the reason behind the rumors about Fang Juexia and that entire hidden rules situation surrounding him. His family didn\u2019t have it easy, and he had no background, so he was only left with the option of this shortcut. At first, he had been convinced that this reasoning was sound, but currently, he had become more and more suspicious about it, and even wanted to directly overturn it.He just wanted to know why Fang Juexia had never explained the situation.There were too many contradictions that existed in this person. Plainly he was entangled in rumors, and yet, from head to foot, he exuded a detached indifference. Clearly, he was born in summer and called\u00a0summer, but he was like the never-melting snow.For no reason, a poem that Pei Tingsong liked very much suddenly appeared in his mind. His eyes fell upon the pen and paper that the modeling assistant was using to take notes.\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201dOnly after he heard Fang Juexia\u2019s voice did he get up from his chair. Fang Juexia saw him staring at himself, and his eyes widened slightly, with his white eyelashes fluttering. This was the expression he would show whenever he doubted himself.\u201cThe way I look right now.. .does it look very strange?\u201dThe relationship between them seemed to have already eased up, to the extent that Fang Juexia could be relaxed enough to ask him for his opinions. This was truly some gratifying progress. Pei Tingsong remained speechless though, and only the corners of his mouth quirked up. He put a folded piece of paper into Fang Juexia\u2019s shirt pocket, and then left under the assistant\u2019s urging.Fang Juexia stayed in place and opened that piece of paper. The handwriting in it was loose and carefree, with only a few lines written on it\u2014It was a poem.[Rest assured, you mayentertain me with snow:whenever I walked shoulder to shoulderwith the mulberry tree through the summer,its youngest leafcried out.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lin Mo was picky and wanted to shoot real scenes, so the planning team had to seize the time and find a suitable venue. In the meantime, Pei Tingsong would do his single-person photoshoot first, and it had been arranged that Fang Juexia would wait in the rest area. However, for some reason, he wasn\u2019t sleepy, and he kept looking at the paper in his hand several times.[Rest assured, you mayentertain me with snow:]It seemed as if there was a voice in his heart, continuously repeating this line from the poem in his mind.He had always been aware that he hadn\u2019t been born with much of an understanding for gorgeous and romantic words, and was a person completely cut off from literature. But strangely, looking at these words written by Pei Tingsong, Fang Juexia fell into a wild and fanciful reverie in his heart.However, he had no way to express how he felt.Emotions and thoughts were really complex; things that couldn\u2019t be modeled with or reasoned out mathematically were all very complicated for him.Cheng Qiang brought in some hot milk and a down jacket. Fang Juexia placed the paper back into his front pocket and then put on the black sweater handed to him by the assistant. Cheng Qiang advised him to sleep for a little longer, since the photoshoot later would be very hard, but Fang Juexia knew that this opportunity was rare. He wanted to have good enough photos taken of him, so he draped his clothes over himself and went to the studio to watch the photoshoot.Everyone was circling around Pei Tingsong. In order to satisfy the concept of spring, the lighting engineer had tried his best to recreate the warm full light that pervades a greenhouse, thus hitting Pei Tingsong with light from every direction.\u201cXiao Pei was really born to\u00a0do this job,\u201d Cheng Qiang said. \u201cEven if he hadn\u2019t entered this circle, he would still take over an enterprise or something. Then, he would definitely become like that kind of rich second generation who gets onto the Hot Search list because of his good looks\u00a0ba.\u201dFang Juexia nodded, but he couldn\u2019t actually imagine such a scenario. In his mind, Pei Tingsong seemed to have a binding relationship with the stage.However, it was true that he was tall and had a face that could appear either domineeringly handsome or sweetly cute; he was the prototypical example of god-given superior talent. Not only was the basic hardware in place, but he also expressed himself very strongly through his fashion, or in other words, people with strong personalities were always very good at expressing themselves.All Pei Tingsong had to do was just go stand in the greenhouse that had been set up, and the picture already looked pretty good.The camera for the ensemble show was also following them, and Cheng Qiang felt that the way the two of them were acting would show that they didn\u2019t have much team camaraderie, so he pushed Juexia and whispered, \u201cYou also go over and see Xiao Pei.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t really want to do so, but he had already been pushed in that direction by Cheng Qiang. There was no other way out, so he simply gritted his teeth and walked over.\u201cAdjust the light overhead to make it an area light.\u201d Lin Mo checked the frame and without raising his head, instructed, \u201cTry it out first. Xiao Pei, you are free to move as you like, I\u2019ll take some candid shots to try it out.\u201dThe greenhouse was decorated with all kinds of flowers\u2014 clusters of honey-caramel colored roses huddled next to pink tulips and\u00a0clematises, making for an endless spread of aqua blue summer mixed with tiny spots of\u00a0grape hyacinth.Wrapped in a light gray down jacket, Fang Juexia quietly walked up to Pei Tingsong from behind. He didn\u2019t know how to start up a conversation with him, and he didn\u2019t really want to talk. With his makeup on, he looked just like a silent snow spirit.Pei Tingsong, who had his back to him, glanced at the flowers, and discovered a touch of white amidst the overlapping flowers. It had pretty much been squeezed all the way to the inside by the other flowers. He reached out a hand to push aside the other flowers, and the straight green stem of that flower trembled.He was going to save this white flower.\u201cVery good.\u201d Lin Mo took a few pictures and checked them. The quirking of Pei Tingsong\u2019s lips was subtle and not easy to detect. He was very satisfied with this feeling.\u201cWhy pick this one?\u201d Fang Juexia suddenly opened his mouth. It was only then that Pei Tingsong discovered his existence. The flowers here were all freshly cut, and Pei Tingsong also didn\u2019t hesitate in pulling out that white flower. His fingertips pinched and twirled the flower\u2019s stem before drawing\u00a0 it close to his nose, only to discover that there was no ordinary flower fragrance, just a light smell of plants.He asked with a smile, \u201cWhy do you think I did?\u201dFang Juexia lowered his eyes to look at the flowers, and this movement dragged at his long snow-white eyelashes, making them look like two trembling petals.He faintly detected something.\u201cIf I knew, I wouldn\u2019t have asked.\u201d Fang Juexia raised his eyes again.However, who would have known that Pei Tingsong would merely raise his eyebrows and instead of answering, would hand the flower over, not delivering it to Fang Juexia\u2019s hands, but rather, reaching out towards his face, and then placing it against his face.His eyes narrowed slightly, as if scrutinising something.However, until the end, Pei Tingsong did not give out any conclusions. When he took his hand back, the flower, which was in full bloom, brushed against Fang Juexia\u2019s jawline.\u201cI think you know.\u201d He raised his eyebrows, his tone sure and light, and pulled his hand back. With that, his left hand started to scatter the petals of the flower around one by one.Fang Juexia had to admit that he had never felt this kind of feeling before; this kind of push-and-pull conversation had already gone way beyond his barren modes of communication. He and Pei Tingsong were completely different kinds of people; when Pei Tingsong was blunt, he caught people off guard, but when he decided to talk in a roundabout manner, no one could guess what he meant.He had to admit that this boy, who was two and a half years younger than him, was a master of game theory.\u201cVery good, pretty good state.\u201d After taking his fill of candid shots by the side, Lin Mo changed the angle of the camera and told Pei Tingsong, \u201cA little more gentle, closer to the concept of spring.\u201dThe skepticism in Pei Tingsong\u2019s bones broke out again, but he spoke a smile; the way he looked when smiling, however, was really in line with their so-called \u201cconcept\u201d.\u201cMust the concept of spring be gentle?\u201dThis sentence stunned the staff on the scene a little bit.Fang Juexia also raised his head and pulled away from his thoughts. He really admired people with the kind of personality where they could express their views anytime and anywhere; it was probably because of Pei Tingsong\u2019s childhood environment.If one stayed too long in an environment that favored harmony, all skeptics would have lost their edges long ago.\u201cAs soon as anyone mentions spring, they say it\u2019s gentle. A gentle breeze and the warm sun, winter has gone, and spring has come. It seems that the idea of warm spring flowers blooming immediately after winter\u2019s rampage has become a stereotype. It\u2019s really boring, can\u2019t we have some new concepts?\u201d After that, he glanced at Fang Juexia and said, \u201cFor example, the feeble winter has been imprisoned in spring, and will never see the light of day again\u2026 something like that.\u201dThis was a very meaningful glance.Lin Mo stood up straight, not expressing any opinions about Pei Tingsong\u2019s idea for a moment. The other staff members didn\u2019t dare to say anything. Only the magazine editors and the main writer, who were standing at the side, had flowers blooming in their hearts. Besides the fact that it had been easy to get approval for this piece because this StarChart group had become famous, there were no taboo subjects being discussed here, so they were even happier.After a while, Lin Mo began to circle around in place, then stopped suddenly and asked Fang Juexia, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dSuch photographers were not common; most of the big-shot photographers in the circle were arbitrary. Lin Mo fell into the same category, but probably because his expectations had been overthrown by Pei Tingsong once before, his tolerance threshold had widened.\u201cAn aggressive spring,\u201d Fang Juexia affirmed the idea, \u201cI like this saying.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t simply falling in line, he was really interested in this concept. What\u2019s more, in his eyes, Pei Tingsong was not a good and honest person, and completely didn\u2019t comply with the setting of warm spring days.\u201cDid you know?\u201d Lin Mo laughed and told Pei Tingsong, \u201cThe last time someone went up against me and successfully made me compromise was the Grand Slam movie queen. Her aesthetic level was very high, and she had a very proud temperament.\u201dThe implication behind this sentence was clear to everyone, so they let out a breath of relief.Cheng Qiang\u2019s forehead had even started to gather sweat. Although Pei Tingsong had a good background, taking this child, who feared nothing and no one, around to work was even more difficult than walking on a tightrope.The plan was changed again and again, and the final version was 18,000\u00a0li\u00a0away from the original concept. However, none of the staff on-site had not been convinced by Pei Tingsong\u2019s expression. After the official photoshoot started, Fang Juexia left the studio and stood by the monitor.Pei Tingsong sat lazily on the ground, one leg propped up and the other stretched out straight ahead. Surrounded by flowers, all he grasped in his hands was a lonely white flower. The camera started taking pictures from top to bottom. Pei Tingsong\u2019s hair had been blow-dried fluffy, and a few random strands of hair hung down in between his eyebrows. As soon as he raised his eyes, the shape of his eyes narrowed and elongated, and the shadow at the corners of his eyes almost connected with the petal of the winter-flowering cherry tree.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgBut the aggressiveness in his eyes was revealed, and he looked just like a dangerous wild animal about to go on the hunt. With the soft, warm, and fragrant flowers all around, this kind of casual ruthlessness became even more obvious.\u201cVery good. Good eyes.\u201d Lin Mo lowered his body, zooming the camera closer onto his face. The small mole at the corner of his eye inexplicably added some real sense of desire to the picture. Pei Tingsong turned his face to the side, and held the half-bloomed flower up to his mouth.Fang Juexia watched quietly. He thought that Pei Tingsong would kiss it.However, his lips just brushed against it like a dragonfly skimming over water, and then he opened his mouth, and his teeth bit the tender petals. The corners of his mouth drew up, making him look like a beast that had successfully bitten the arteries of its prey. The revelry of a successful hunt was boiling in his eyes and blood.The camera shutter kept ringing.Fang Juexia was a little distracted. He could almost feel the dull pain that the petals would experience the moment Pei Tingsong sank his teeth into them.Somehow, he felt for the flower.Lin Mo was very satisfied, satisfied to the point that he didn\u2019t have time to talk anymore, and just constantly kept clicking down on the shutter whenever Pei Tingsong moved.\u201cDarling,\u201d Andy\u2019s voice appeared again, and pulled Fang Juexia away from his wandering thoughts. He held a powder puff in his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you for a long time, and it turns out you were here\u00a0ah. Your group has such a good relationship with each other\u00a0ah.\u201dTheir relationship was really not very good. Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes turned, and he guiltily smiled at him. Andy fixed his make-up. \u201cThe snow scene has already been found. They said there is a park nearby, and the scenery there is very beautiful.\u201d He touched up his make-up, then stood a little further away and looked him up and down before stating, \u201cPerfect.\u201dAndy had probably put on some cologne when he had gone out, but the cologne\u2019s smell was incredibly heavy, as if he had emptied half the bottle onto himself, and this heavy scent choked Fang Juexia and made his nose itch. He squinted and bowed his head, enduring for a long time, but finally, still ended up sneezing.\u201cAchoo.\u201dThe noise made by this was actually very quiet, but Pei Tingsong\u2019s attention was immediately drawn by this small sneeze, and he raised his head. Fang Juexia also turned his head after sneezing, and their gazes accidentally collided.Pei Tingsong laughed.As luck would have it, this scene was also captured by the camera. His chin and lips were covered with torn flower petals, but the curve of his smiling eyes was very bright.\u201cThis picture is blurry, but it\u2019s very alive,\u201d Lin Mo expressed his satisfaction.He was a photographer who liked to shoot isolated parts of models. This time, his target was Pei Tingsong\u2019s hands. Against the background of flowers, which were in a multitude of colors, Pei Tingsong once again drew out a white flower, his fingertips teasingly brushing along the petals that were so tightly overlapped that it seemed nearly closed, and then he grabbed the petals and tore them apart roughly. They are brutally forced to separate from the cyan colored sepals, and only the stem of the flower was left to stand there alone, as it trembled and shook.Obviously, it was a scene of destruction, but from within the lens of the camera, and also in the eyes of Fang Juexia, this scene appeared to be one of desire in full bloom.The rapid sound of the shutter took on the metaphor for breathing. The pure white petals were crumpled into translucent folds, as if they had been bruised. Light doesn\u2019t lie, and it shone out of these tiny wounds. The fibers inside were all illuminated, and these were the capillaries of the flower.\u201cScatter them.\u201dFollowing the photographer\u2019s instructions, Pei Tingsong stopped his rampage, and his fingers loosened without any regret. Petals, like broken butterfly wings, drifted down from his fingers and palms, completing their mission.The staff had brought over a small bowl of bright red cherries. Originally, it had been a prop from the original design. When it was brought over, Fang Juexia saw that the small bowl was very delicate; it was a translucent, white piece of\u00a0crackle-glazed ceramic.\u201cThis is very nice.\u201d Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help complimenting it.Who knew that Pei Tingsong would walk over and take the bowl from the staff member\u2019s hand.\u201cWhat is nice? This?\u201d With an\u00a0 innocent expression on his face, he sat cross-legged on the ground, and then held the bowl in both hands, as if getting ready to smash it on the ground.Fang Juexia went into a rare panic. \u201cHey\u2014\u201dSeeing that his prank had worked, Pei Tingsong laughed just like a child who had gotten his own way. He then took his hands back, and placed his index finger, which was smeared with liquid from the flowers, into the bowl, and started to stir the small cherries around.Lin Mo, who was currently checking the pictures that had been taken, suddenly caught a glimpse of this scene and ordered, \u201cWait, you keep going.\u201dThe camera was pointed at him again.His fingertips reached deep into this soft redness and stirred it. Pei Tingsong selected a plump and juicy cherry and brought it to his lips. His teeth bit into this perfectly round, agate fruit, and the points of his teeth pierced into its skin, making the fruit look full and plump as its surface tightened. Bright red and sweet juice covered his teeth, and then seeped along the corner of his mouth.\u201cVery good!\u201d The photographer\u2019s high and unstinting tone showed his satisfaction with the scene.In the monitor, Pei Tingsong raised the back of his hand and wiped off the bright red juice from the corners of his mouth, smiling very wickedly all the while. Unconsciously, Fang Juexia\u2019s larynx shifted up and down.In the last frame of this scene, Pei Tingsong\u2019s satisfied eyes almost seemed to pierce through the screen\u2014Straight up to biting at his throat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As more and more people kept arriving in front of the monitor, Fang Juexia instinctively started to step back in order to make room for everyone.He backed up, and accidentally backed right into a person\u2019s arms.Fang Juexia reflexively lowered his head and apologized. However, his shoulders were seized, and he was pulled into this person\u2019s arms.\u201cDo I look good, Juexia Ge?\u201dSince he had just washed his hands, there was still some water on them, so Pei Tingsong simply set his wrists on Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulders, with his hands hanging down emptily. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t even have to lift his head; upon hearing the three syllables of Juexia Ge, he knew that there was a camera next to them.\u201cEn.\u201d He could only cooperate and show some brotherly love.Pei Tingsong, however, just came closer to him, step by step, as he asked, \u201cWhich picture do I look best in?\u201dA particular photo floated up in Fang Juexia\u2019s mind, but he still chose to reply with the safe answer, \u201cThey all look very good.\u201dCheng Qiang was even more satisfied than Pei Tingsong. He kept smiling, and only turned around when he thought of something. \u201cBy the way, Juexia, did you stick on some\u00a0heating pads? It\u2019ll be very cold outside when we have to go out in a bit.\u201dFang Juexia nodded and replied, \u201cStuck some on.\u201d\u201cStick more on.\u201dPei Tingsong was feeling very playful. \u201cStuck on how many? Where did you stick them?\u201d He looked down at Fang Juexia\u2019s sweater, trying to discover some clues from it. Relying on the fact that Fang Juexia wouldn\u2019t resist in the presence of the camera, Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand slid down Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder, caressing his shoulder blade, and then heading further down.\u201cFound it.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes were curved into a smile, while the palm of his hand impolitely rubbed his shoulder blade as he declared, \u201cTwo of them.\u201dFang Juexia wanted to resist, but Pei Tingsong\u2019s appearance right now was completely emulating that of a cute Didi, without a hint of malicious trickery. He also couldn\u2019t interrupt his fanservice in front of the camera.\u201cYou only stuck on two?\u201d Cheng Qiang began to worry again. \u201cTwo won\u2019t do, you need to stick on some more\u00a0ah.\u201dMeanwhile, Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand continued to slide down as he said, \u201cYou definitely have more than that on\u00a0ba.\u201d His motivation was very simple and very naive; that was, he wanted to challenge the threshold of people like Juexia and wanted to try and break through his guard to make inroads with him. Fang Juexia\u2019s shell was too thick; he nearly seemed fake.\u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d Fang Juexia quietly broke away from his half embrace before answering, \u201cI stuck on four pieces, and I have a hand warmer.\u201d His face shrunk down into the collar of the down jacket, and he then looked at Cheng Qiang, trying to change the subject. \u201cWe can go now\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go ask.\u201dFang Juexia accompanied Cheng Qiang. Looking at the way Fang Juexia looked right now, as if he hated the fact that he couldn\u2019t just hide himself away, Pei Tingsong actually found that even more interesting.After finishing the single person photoshoot, the staff members began to take the set apart. Originally, he had thought that it was a shame for all these flowers to be wasted like this, but unexpectedly, the people in the props group started to take them along with them to the next set as well. They were probably going to be used during the two person photoshoot as well. As they passed by, Pei Tingsong asked casually\u2014\u201cWhat\u2019s the name of this white flower?\u201d He pointed to the flower he had just been photographed with.The props assistant replied, \u201cThis one\u00a0ah,\u00a0eustoma.\u201dEustoma\u2026 Pei Tingsong nodded and casually took out his cellphone to search for it.It was a pretty nice name.On the screen of his cellphone, a colorful array of this particular flower appeared. At a glance, the pure white kind still stood out as the most beautiful one. Beneath the pictures was a list of its nicknames, as well as the various meanings people had attached to it.The ensemble show\u2019s camera came close to him, so Pei Tingsong put his cellphone away, tilted his head at the camera, and then adjusted the small monitoring screen attached to the camera to face himself, straightening his hair as he looked into it.\u201cHandsome?\u201dThe camera moved up and down.The magazine staff was almost ready to move to the next location, so Cheng Qiang grabbed their things and said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll drive behind them to get there.\u201d He then asked, \u201cXiao Pei, are you coming?\u201dBy this time, Pei Tingsong had already put on a thick coat, and was going around and around in a circle as he discussed some logic puzzle with the ensemble show cameraman, causing the cameraman to keep having to pan the camera around. Only when he heard Cheng Qiang call out to him did he turn his way.He wanted to sleep and was just about to say no, when Fang Juexia answered for him, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to come\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s cold outside. Then, Xiao Pei, you first head over to the location for the two-person photoshoot and wait for me\u2026\u201dPei Tingson stuck both of his hands into his pockets and said, \u201cI want to come.\u201d He purposefully grinned. \u201cDuring my photoshoot, Gege was nearby. Now that Gege is doing his photoshoot, of course I have to go, otherwise it would be too shameful.\u201dYou don\u2019t have to\u2014Fang Juexia\u2019s head throbbed unceasingly, but he could only recite that in his heart.The snow scenery they had chosen for the photoshoot was a spruce fir forest, and after a night of snow, it really embodied the forest of its\u00a0name. Pei Tingsong, although his words were pretty, started napping as soon as he got into the car and sat down beside Fang Juexia.\u201cIt\u2019s a real pity these photos are for the inside pages.\u201d While saying this, Andy\u2019s tone was exaggerated, but his words weren\u2019t exaggerated at all. Lin Mo, who always had a spiteful tongue, also added, \u201cThe expression is pretty good. Generally, prickly people make really good candidates for modeling.\u201dCheng Qiang laughed along with him. Fang Juexia looked out of the window in silence and felt as the head of the guy beside him started to continuously droop forward, just like a fishing pole.The injury at the corner of his eye had still not healed, and if it went on like this, he\u2019d gain another scar on his forehead. If this had happened in the past, Fang Juexia definitely wouldn\u2019t have cared. But before, Pei Tingsong also would not have sat next to him.When Pei Tingsong\u2019s head started to droop forward again, Fang Juexia\u2019s palm covered his forehead and supported him back, all the way until the back of his head was obediently lying against the seat\u2019s headrest. After finishing this arduous task, Fang Juexia breathed a sigh of relief, and then caught a glimpse of Pei Tingsong\u2019s hands, which were red from the cold.\u201cSeize the time to set up all lights and props, hurry up!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s time to start the shoot!\u201dFang Juexia walked step by step into the depths of the spruce fir forest, according to the instructions given to him. Lin Mo took pictures from behind him and then checked them. The composition of these pictures consisted\u00a0 of the white expanse of the sky and snow, and under clumps of towering black spruce and fir trees, Fang Juexia\u2019s back, dressed in a black sweater, could be seen.His temperament was really cold, it was almost like he was about to become one with the snow here.The photography assistant sprinkled some snow on Fang Juexia\u2019s hair, echoing his white eyelashes. The tip of his nose had turned red from the cold, and the birthmark at the corner of his eye became even redder. In any case, this face was better for close-ups.Lin Mo asked him to lay down in the snow. He pointed the camera down, lying it very low, and then photographed Fang Juexia\u2019s side profile as he was lying on his back. The curve from his forehead to the bridge of his nose, and then to the peak of his lips, looked like a continuous snowy mountain range, and at the foot of these snow-covered mountains was a touch of scarlet, like a leftover wound made by spring before leaving. Lin Mo already had an overlapping\u00a0double exposure composition\u00a0in mind, with such a curve positioned there, which would then reflect the silent spruce fir forest.He was right; Fang Juexia was too suitable for winter.Pei Tingsong kept on sleeping, when his head turned to the right, fell into empty space, and he suddenly woke up. Upon opening his eyes and seeing that there was no one in the car, he vaguely felt that something was off. As soon as he lowered his head, he saw that his hands now contained a small spherical hand warmer, and it was very warm.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgHe pulled open the door and got out of the car. The cold wind poured against his neck, and he woke up in an instant. Stepping on the snow, he headed towards the big group of people step-by-step, and Pei Tingsong spotted Fang Juexia, even from a distance. This person stood in the middle of the snowy forest, not looking like a human being, but rather like a deer lost in the snow.A person\u2019s temperament could actually really be so clean.The temperature outside wasn\u2019t as warm as that inside the studio, so in the middle of the photoshoot, Fang Juexia had to stop in order to get warm. The assistant handed him hot tea and a down jacket so that he could warm up as quickly as possible. Lin Mo saw Pei Tingsong come over, and said in a very satisfied voice, \u201cYou actually are naturally gifted.\u201dPei Tingsong asked with a smile, \u201cIn what area are\u00a0you\u00a0speaking of?\u201d He intuitively knew that what he was referring to was not his expressiveness during the photoshoot.\u201cAesthetic.\u201d Lin Mo paused before continuing, \u201cPerception, creativity.\u201d With that, he handed the camera to Pei Tingsong, lit a cigarette, placed it in his mouth, and vaguely added, \u201cHe really is very suitable for winter.\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s a winter without any aggression.\u201d Pei Tingsong looked at Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes in the photo\u2014 they were straight and tough, hiding a hint of moist softness.\u201cI\u2019ve heard about you from your Jie, and I thought you were a loud-mouthed hip-hop fanatic. I didn\u2019t expect things to turn out like this in front of me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you who is biased against hip-hop.\u201d Pei Tingsong also wasn\u2019t polite. \u201cIts spiritual core is free and profound.\u201dLin Mo nodded, making no secret of his attitude. \u201cThen do you think that it\u2019s a pity you\u2019re an idol?\u201dWhen he asked that, Pei Tingsong\u2019s first reaction upon hearing this sentence actually wasn\u2019t to think that it was a pity, but remembering a dispute between him and Fang Juexia from before.[Dreams are the sort of things that can\u2019t be divided into high or low, but only realized or unrealized.]He let out a long breath, and his white breath curled. He wanted to say that it was a pity, and he should say that it was a pity.His eyes drifted far away, and ten meters away, he saw Fang Juexia dressed in a thick down jacket. The staff around him was getting ready for the next photoshoot and were making changes to the scenery, while he was stepping on the snow, then stepped on it a few more times, seemingly turning his steps into dance steps. Originally, it was just a few silly steps in the snow, but he suddenly began a small dance. Doing this while wrapped up in a large and wide down jacket made him look exactly like a little penguin sliding around.His cellphone vibrated, and Pei Tingsong lowered his head to unlock the screen. It was their band\u2019s groupchat.[Just a pretty face: @DalianHunkLu No, I\u2019ve suddenly thought of a move that is very suitable and can be edited into our performance to become the killing part. When I get back, let\u2019s discuss it.]He had also added an uncool looking sun emoticon.So it turned out that when he chatted, he would also use emoticons. Pei Tingsong looked up at Fang Juexia and found that he had continued to stomp out a few small footprints in the snow, until Andy, who needed to touch up his makeup, stopped him, and it was only then that Fang Juexia\u2019s original appearance of being a small iceberg was restored.Lin Mo saw that he didn\u2019t answer, and squatted down with a smile, putting out his cigarette on the snow. \u201cSure enough, you do think it\u2019s a pity\u00a0ba.\u201dWho would have known that it was then that Pei Tingsong would open his mouth and say, \u201cProbably not\u00a0ba.\u201d He kicked the snow and put his hands in his pockets. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d After saying that, he headed in Fang Juexia\u2019s direction, and he could be heard humming some song, which sounded very nice.Fang Juexia obediently closed his eyes and allowed Andy to apply transparent lip oil beneath his eyes. Unexpectedly, the back of his neck would suddenly feel cold. He abruptly opened his eyes and turned his head around, just to see Pei Tingsong behind him, who then spoke with a smile, \u201cI threw a snowball in.\u201dSeeing Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes widen, Pei Tingsong started to laugh very hard before confessing, \u201cTricked you.\u201dThe shoot went on smoothly. It really was too cold outside, and after just piling up enough snow for a snowman\u2019s head, Pei Tingsong felt so cold that his teeth had started chattering. He kicked at the snowball that he had been rolling together for a long time, then quickly hid himself back in the staff\u2019s shed and sat down there. His eyes were drawn to the pictures being displayed on the monitor. There were two monitors, one on the one left and one on the right. The one on the left was showing pictures straight from Lin Mo\u2019s camera, while the one on the right was from the video being taken for the highlights section of the magazine.In the picture, Fang Juexia was seen laying on his back. Unlike the previous group of pictures, his makeup had been changed, and his eyes now looked damp, with some transparent liquid gliding across his cheek, to give an appearance of tears. Eyelashes as white as snow encircled his confused eyes.His birthmark was red, the tip of his nose was red, and his lips were red as well; they were slightly open, with a glittering and transparent piece of ice that could be seen through the gap, and a cherry frozen inside that piece of ice.This picture was too beautiful. Pei Tingsong stared fixedly at it, only returning to his senses when he heard some noise.He looked at the screen on the right. In the video, the ice kept melting, and water flowed out from the corner of Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth. When Lin Mo said, \u201cOkay,\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s turned his face to open his lips, and the tip of his tongue gently pushed the ice out and straight into his hand. He sat up, his hair scattered with snow, the birthmark at the corner of his eye as red as his lips, and his whole person was smiling as he said, \u201cHow icy\u00a0ah.\u201d Having said that, he put his lips against the back of his hand, then pulled it away and brought it back again and again, repeating that action several times. \u201cMy lips have even turned numb.\u201dPei Tingsong suddenly thought of the sensation he had felt when they had been passing the candy wrapper.Plainly speaking, it had been a long time, but that sensation had not been forgotten.\u201cHe was really born for this\u00a0job\u00a0ah.\u201d A staff member standing not far away behind Pei Tingsong sighed and said emotionally, \u201cThis face looks even better than that of a girl\u2019s.\u201d\u201cYes\u00a0ah. If it was just a woman, how beautiful would that be\u00a0ah. It\u2019s a pity, or else a lot of people would chase after them.\u201d Another male technician\u2019s face showed a meaningful expression as he continued, \u201cNo wonder\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish talking, his shoulder was grabbed, and when he turned his head, all he saw was Pei Tingsong\u2019s simple smile.\u201cNo wonder what?\u201d His tone was kind and curious as he asked, \u201cI want to hear it too.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He could only smile awkwardly and answer, \u201cAh\u2026 Nothing, just felt that it\u2019s a bit of a pity.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Pei Tingsong laughed innocently. \u201cWhy is it a pity when boys are beautiful? I don\u2019t quite understand this kind of logic; it can\u2019t be that you have to be born unattractive in order to deserve any praise?\u201dPlainly it was a very friendly question, but nevertheless, a cold sweat broke out on this technician\u2019s back. He had just seen the power this young male idol wielded, for even the big photographer had deigned to listen to him. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant\u2026\u201d\u201cI see what you mean.\u201d Pei Tingsong released the hand he had on his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s not a pity at all for a boy to be born good-looking, and being good-looking also doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s \u2018no wonder\u2019 something might happen. You wanted to say that, right?\u201d\u201cRight, right.\u201dPei Tingsong nodded in pretend seriousness. \u201cVery good, then our thinking is quite similar.\u201d Letting out a sigh, he said, \u201cI actually thought that the person who was talking was just some low-class straight man who was playing dirty tricks. I had even raised my knife up already, but I didn\u2019t expect it to just be words from friendly forces\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll just take my knife back\u00a0ba,\u00a0to avoid any accidental injuries.\u201d Pei Tingsong laughed. \u201cI\u2019m a famously\u00a0obnoxious\u00a0person. When I take action, my impact is very heavy.\u201dThen he put both his hands in his pockets, turned away, and left.After listening to all this, the two staff members were already dripping in cold sweat. Most of the people in the circle knew that Pei Tingsong was not someone to tangle with. That had been established as a fact from before, much less now that he had become popular. However, they had thought that Pei Tingsong was just like rumor said and didn\u2019t get along with Fang Juexia; they totally hadn\u2019t expected him to come out and take action. But in any case, they didn\u2019t want to end up losing their jobs because of their stupid mouths, so they could only resentfully eat this setback and go hide to one side.As it was getting late, the orange sunset drifted down into the fir trees, and the snow was set afire under the twilight.Pei Tingsong had now gotten warm, and so he walked a few steps toward the shooting site. From a distance, he could see Fang Juexia, who was wearing a black sweater, walk forward continuously under Lin Mo\u2019s guidance.\u201cGood, now turn your head and smile.\u201dAt that moment, he saw Fang Juexia look back, and his smile looked even brighter than the light reflecting off the white snow.Stepping steadily on the snow, he kept walking closer towards him, and it seemed as if his gaze was already out of his consciousness\u2019 control, as it tracked Fang Juexia\u2019s figure through the gaps revealed in the crowd.Snow covered him from head to foot, and his face glowed with the vivid color of his blood under the light of snow and sky. As soon as he looked up, the red at the corner of his eye spread out, like a wound. His clear eyes were half covered by his snowy eyelashes, and in the close-up shot, his infiltrated eyes reflected that snowy-white color, giving a transparent feel, looking just like ice about to melt.Lin Mo directed from the side, \u201cWalk back inside, Juexia.\u201dBased on his words, Fang Juexia headed into the snowy fir forest step by step, and did not stop until he was told to, which was upon reaching a fir tree.\u201cTurn around, hide half of your body behind the tree, then lean over some more.\u201d Lin Mo held his camera while instructing, \u201cYes, only expose half of your face.\u201dPei Tingsong also started walking in that very direction, although he didn\u2019t know why he wanted to walk over there. Maybe it was because he was curious, just like those times when he was a child and had wondered whether life could be seen within the broken-off section of dead branches.\u201cYour eyes, they\u2019re a bit too cold now. They need to have a bit of emotion, tap into your instincts\u2026\u201dPhotographers always spoke very abstractly. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t know exactly what kind of feeling it was that he was describing, and just felt confused. This was a strange concept; he didn\u2019t know what it was like to be imprisoned, or what instincts he was supposed to have.Pei Tingsong went to Lin Mo\u2019s side and looked at Fang Juexia from Lin Mo\u2019s perspective.\u201cLook over here, yes.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s gaze had indeed fallen onto another person.Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes shifted away from the camera, and he raised his head to see Fang Juexia standing not far away. That pair of beautiful eyes looked straight at him as ever before, whilst carrying the same final resistance those dead branches of his childhood had.\u201cYes, just like that,\u201d Lin Mo\u2019s voice carried a hint of surprise as he said this, and he quickly seized the opportunity to take a few photos before checking the results.\u201cVery good, even though this look isn\u2019t the same as what I had in mind, but it is really good.\u201d Lin Mo was so pleased with himself that he brought it over to Pei Tingsong to view as well, while praising, \u201cLook, how is that? This face is too photogenic, and it\u2019s even more expressive than I thought. He could switch jobs to become a model.\u201dIn the picture, Fang Juexia was half-covered by dark tree trunks. The left exposed half of his face had a calm expression, and his red birthmark was the only color in this field of black and white. The eye that was revealed shone with a clear light, just like a reflection of the shining moon cast on top of a frozen pond.This was the hard-to-come-by emotion that Lin Mo had been talking about\u2014the last struggle put up by Winter before he fell into a trap.However, this struggle was akin to a thin layer of fragile ice, and it would be shattered with just a gentle pinch. Once the warm currents invaded, this winter would no longer have any place left to hide. He would only be forced to melt, to strip himself bare, and thereby reveal his original shape.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you saying anything?\u201dPei Tingsong had been engrossed in the picture, and only after being asked did he return to his senses and nodded as he replied, \u201cIt is very good. He\u2019s very suitable.\u201dHe looked up and then over at the person being discussed, only to see that Fang Juexia was already wrapped in a big coat and was laughing quietly because of the staff member\u2019s teasing. He also reached out and plucked off half of the leaves on the assistant\u2019s head.Pei Tingsong could not deceive himself anymore; when connecting this person in front of him right now with those rumors of the past, another voice appeared in his heart.Maybe, at the bottom of his heart, he had never really believed those rumors. He had just been trying to find a valid reason to alienate himself from this person, just the way this person had kept him at a distance.Whether the voice was right or wrong, he already couldn\u2019t judge. Their prejudice and stubbornness evident on both sides had already pulled the distance between them too far.The last bit of light in the sky disappeared. As the setting sun jumped into the snowy forest, annihilating the scene behind Fang Juexia, Lin Mo used his camera to preserve it.\u201cTroubled all of you.\u201d Fang Juexia, who had finished his photoshoot, bowed to the staff, and walked back on uneven steps while dressed in his down jacket. When he came to a stand by Pei Tingsong\u2019s side, he didn\u2019t say a word.At this moment, Pei Tingsong even felt that something was blocking his heart.\u201cHey, are you not afraid of falling over when walking so fast\u00a0ah?\u201dAfter he said that, he felt a little regretful. It was as if he had done something on his own initiative, as if he had helped Fang Juexia in his heart while accompanying him all the way back to the garage.However the other party didn\u2019t even turn his head while replying, \u201cNot walking fast.\u201dBack in the studio, Fang Juexia stamped his feet while looking at his own pictures. He had been freezing in the snow for so long that his limbs had all turned numb.Pei Tingsong saw that his nose and ears were all red from the cold, that his cheeks were also bright red, and that he kept rubbing his hands together. Pei Tingsong wanted to give Fang Juexia the hand warmer he had passed to himself before, but when he put his hand into his pocket, he realized that the pocket was warm, but the hand warmer didn\u2019t contain any warmth any more.\u201cThis one is good, and so is this one.\u201d Lin Mo was very satisfied. \u201cYou could even create a MV using your highlights video, the artistic conception is very good. These are the cleanest major pictures I\u2019ve taken recently.\u201dFang Juexia was a little embarrassed after being praised. \u201cThank you\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me, you are very photogenic. Basically, we didn\u2019t waste any film, and that\u2019s very rare. And your temperament is very special, it\u2019s actually really a pity you didn\u2019t become a model.\u201dFang Juexia was neither good at being sociable nor did he like being sociable. In the face of getting so much praise heaped onto himself, he wasn\u2019t sure about how to deal with it. Like a robot, he scoured his barren database for words that could be applied to this situation.Just when he was struggling, his hand was suddenly grabbed. Fang Juexia instinctively turned his head and saw Pei Tingsong standing beside him. His frozen fingers were then suddenly wrapped up in warmth.It was Pei Tingsong who had grabbed his hand and stuffed it into his warm coat pocket.\u201cI also think the same, and I even took out my cellphone just now to take two pictures.\u201d Pei Tingsong freely stuck himself into the conversation and changed the subject as he said, \u201cThe snow scenery here is also very beautiful, it\u2019s like\u00a0adding flowers to brocade.\u201d Then he looked at Fang Juexia and asked with a smile, \u201cRight?\u201dFang Juexia still hadn\u2019t pulled away from this unexpected gesture, so just replied, \u201cEn\u2026\u201d\u201cYour handwarmer has already gone cold.\u201d Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t look at him before continuing to whisper, \u201cJust put up with this\u00a0ba.\u201dSo it was because of this reason.He\u2019d just put up with it then.Fang Juexia chewed over Pei Tingsong\u2019s words repeatedly in his heart. His thought process was simple and straightforward, and he often couldn\u2019t understand the meaning of Pei Tingsong\u2019s words immediately. However, this didn\u2019t impact the confusion he was experiencing in his mind. It seemed that his brain and his heartbeat had already established their own individual systems and were no longer related to each other.His frozen fingers gradually regained feeling, and the heat from the other hand seeped into his skin, surging through his capillaries and flowing into his fingertips.That was the warmth of another person.Every word spoken by Pei Tingsong was akin to a trap gleaming with cold light. He was already used to avoiding it, so he tried to break free every time, although it ended up being in vain every such time.He was still hesitating over whether to pull his hand away when Pei Tingsong went ahead and released the hand holding his wrist, depriving him of even the chance to break free.In this small, narrow, and warm pocket, were two wildly different souls squeezed together.All the photos that had been taken were roughly confirmed, and without taking any time to rest, everyone ate something casually while they were in the car as they immediately rushed to the two-person photoshoot site. Both of their styles were changed for this; they wore the same type of shirt now, but Pei Tingsong\u2019s was black, while Fang Juexia\u2019s was white. However, Fang Juexia\u2019s shirt was a bit too big for him, so he wore it a little loose.This time, the set for the photoshoot was very simple. The studio\u2019s floor just contained a bed covered with white velvet, which looked very soft.Fang Juexia, who was dazed upon looking at this bed, heard Pei Tingsong chuckling and joking carelessly, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect the first bed scene in my life to arrive so quickly.\u201dFang Juexia couldn\u2019t laugh.He couldn\u2019t imagine how a two-person cover for a big-name magazine could be taken on a bed.Seeing Lin Mo enter the studio, Pei Tingsong, who was full of curiosity, immediately asked, \u201cWhat\u00a0position\u00a0should we do? Me and Juexia Ge.\u201dAs soon as he said that, the little Jiejies from the props group, who had walked over, all covered their mouths and started to laugh. Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t know what was going on, and so looked at Fang Juexia doubtfully. On some occasions, this boy who grew up abroad would occasionally use the wrong word because of a situation mismatch, even though he had high literacy accomplishments and a strong learning ability.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t know how to explain it, so he simply said, \u201cThe word position can\u2019t be used casually.\u201dPei Tingsong, with an innocent expression on his face, asked\u00a0why. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t want to answer because he didn\u2019t want to discuss adult topics while the ensemble show camera was following them around and have it get recorded for the ensemble show broadcast.\u201cWhy?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked again.Fang Juexia said helplessly, \u201cI don\u2019t know, stop asking.\u201dPei Tingsong frowned., \u201cYou don\u2019t know, and you\u2019re still talking about me?\u201dFang Juexia: \u201c\u2026\u201dLin Mo didn\u2019t allow them with much time to discuss this \u201cposition\u201d issue. After discussing the lighting problem with the lighting supervisor, he called Fang Juexia over and asked him to lie down on the big velvet bed. Fang Juexia\u2019s attitude towards work was serious, so he just lay on the bed without saying a word.\u201cTurn your head, face this way, yes.\u201dAfter confirming Fang Juexia\u2019s position, Lin Mo told Pei Tingsong, \u201cYou, turn to face the other way and lie down.\u201d He also made a gesture of turning around.For some reason, another burst of laughter f spread through the surrounding staff. Pei Tingsong felt that all of this was inexplicable, but it was work after all, so he still did what Lin Mo instructed.\u201cXiao Pei, go down, go down some more. Your head needs to be near Juexia\u2019s head. Yes, place your heads to the side, face to face.\u201dUpon hearing the instruction to lie on his side, Fang Juexia, who was lying on his back, consciously turned his face, but this action made the distance between them shrink to nearly nothing. The tip of his nose almost touched the bridge of Pei Tingsong\u2019s nose, so he immediately shrank back and pretended that nothing had happened.They were half curled up on their sides, lying on this big, circular velvet bed, their bodies a bit staggered from each other, with their faces close together, whilst they were facing one another.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cStill not close enough.\u201d Lin Mo stepped forward and adjusted them himself while explaining, \u201cI need the lines of both your side profiles to give off a sense of fitting together. The kind where, if you compress this distance to the very minimum, you would fit together perfectly. Understand?\u201dLin Mo was only describing the effect he wanted to achieve, but this description was inevitably intriguing.\u201cEspecially the straight line of the bridge of the nose, I hope you guys can be parallel here, with one person\u2019s body going from top to bottom of the bed, while the other\u2019s body is in the reverse direction, going bottom to top.\u201dPei Tingsong and Fang Juexia kept drawing closer under his request, like two meteors on mutually exclusive paths. They leaned into each other as if they were doing tai chi, and their bodies seemed to extend in opposite directions. Even when they were in balance, they were the unity of opposites.\u201cVery good, just like that.\u201d Lin Mo went far away from the big bed and checked the position again. \u201cVery good, bring out the props.\u201dPei Tingsong naively asked, \u201cThere are even props?\u201d The people around him laughed again, and even Cheng Qiang helplessly supported his forehead with his hand.Fang Juexia, the one closest to him, just wanted to shut him up.The props group brought out a long green vine. There seemed to be flowers on it, but they hadn\u2019t bloomed yet and were just small buds.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Fang Juexia reached out and touched it.The staff member hadn\u2019t even opened his mouth before Pei Tingsong spoke up, \u201cHoneysuckle.\u201dFang Juexia was a little surprised at his strange knowledge base and asked, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d\u201cWhen I was a kid, there were some in my home\u2019s garden.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s answer was very simple.Honeysuckle.Fang Juexia recited the name in his heart and thought it was very wonderful. The wonderful part was how well it fit with the concept, and also seemed to exceed it.They twined the green honeysuckle vine around Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong, and they kept going up, all the way up to Pei Tingsong\u2019s arms, making it seem as if these vines had grown out of Pei Tingsong.\u201cI feel like a tree spirit.\u201d\u201cNope, not that, you\u2019re a flower fairy.\u201d Andy fixed several clematises using hair gel on Pei Tingsong\u2019s head, and then placed flowers on his ears, shoulders, and arms.Lin Mo came to the bed again to help them get into the right arrangement. \u201cXiao Pei, hold the back of his neck with your hand.\u201dPei Tingsong understood what he meant very quickly. His arm went around the back of Fang Juexia\u2019s head and grasped his slender neck.\u201cVery good.\u201d Lin Mo leaned against his chair and took a picture. \u201cMake your expressions more natural, look at each other.\u201dBut even after several attempts, none of the pictures reached the feeling Lin Mo wanted. He always felt that there was something that didn\u2019t breathe well in the pictures. \u201cSomething\u2019s still missing, there\u2019s not enough tension. Xiao Pei, relax a bit.\u201dNot knowing why, Fang Juexia once again thought of the honeysuckle. He silently recited the word \u201cendure\u201d in his heart, and a new idea arose. He sat up and looked at Lin Mo before saying, \u201cMr. Lin, I have some ideas.\u201dCheng Qiang, who was standing to the side, was a little surprised that it was Fang Juexia, and not Pei Tingsong, who had opened his mouth.After all, in his limited memory, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t have the kind of personality that could easily put forward his own opinions.Having had the experience of his original plans being overturned by Pei Tingsong several times by now, Lin Mo had already become used to this working method, and so said, \u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cI saw the honeysuckle, and I thought of an issue. We seem to have made a hypothesis at the beginning of the shoot.\u201dPei Tingsong, who was still lying on the bed, looked up at the sitting Fang Juexia. All of his words carried rigorous logic.\u201cWe have been assuming this entire time that in this sort of confinement, it is Winter that has to endure, but what about Spring?\u201dFrom Pei Tingsong\u2019s perspective, Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes were looking up, and with the light hitting him at the right angle, his whole face seemed to shine brightly. \u201cThen what if we break this\u00a0a priori\u00a0condition and look at this relationship again?\u201dWhile speaking, Fang Juexia\u2019s snow white eyelashes fluttered. \u201cIn fact, Spring is also enduring something\u00a0ba.\u201cThe appearance of this sentence struck straight into the ground and caused Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart to leap all of a sudden.What does Spring endure?\u2014Endures personal gains and losses, and endures wanting but not getting.\u2014Endures the fact that as soon as he draws close, he has to watch as Winter melts and loses his original form with his own eyes.He had to admit, at this moment, he was emotionally eclipsed by Fang Juexia\u2019s point of view. He realised that Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t just a silent formula, and his spirit was actually hidden within the rules of arrangement and combination.The resonance of inspiration during any creation process is silent. Lin Mo reached out with his index finger and pointed at Fang Juexia several times in a row. \u201cYes, you are right. This kind of mutual emotion is right.\u201dTension didn\u2019t always have to mean the display of restraint and resistance in a situation where daggers were drawn, it could also be that desperate desire to draw close to the ice and snow, but unfortunately, because of reason, he had to endure. Logically, Winter knew he had to avoid warmth, but he still couldn\u2019t control that heart of his that wanted to pounce on Spring.Fang Juexia lay down again.Having thoroughly understood the concept, this time, Pei Tingsong did not reach out to grasp the back of his neck, but instead backed away a little. He reached out to the side of Fang Juexia\u2019s cheek with his hand, his fingers looking long and clean. His fingertips then pulled at the muscles and veins at the back of his hand, and the illusion of him enduring something came into being.All of a sudden, Fang Juexia called out Andy\u2019s name. When he came over, Fang Juexia asked, \u201cCan his hands be painted with frostbite?\u201d\u201cFrostbite?\u201d Andy\u2019s eyelashes flickered.\u201cEn, and not just that.\u201d Fang Juexia continued, \u201cPlease wrap some more of the honeysuckle vine around me, all the way, stretching up to just beneath my chin. Then Andy Ge, please draw some small cuts on my neck and face, just like I have been cut by the honeysuckle vine.\u201d\u201cEn!\u201d Lin Mo hurried to nod even before he had the chance to swallow the coffee in his mouth. \u201cYes, yes, this is very good.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Pei Tingsong actually knew the answer, but still wanted to ask.Fang Juexia replied simply and plainly, \u201cOnly those who have paid the price can be termed as having endured something.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t just a beautiful waste of skin, Pei Tingsong had to admit.Everything was carried out in accordance with the design they had discussed just now, and Lin Mo was very satisfied. He needed to connect the theme of this two-person photoshoot with the solo pictures he had taken before, so he sprinkled eustoma petals, which had featured in the previous photographs, between Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia.The camera was then focused on the scene, and he felt that everything was in place. \u201cVery good, let\u2019s start.\u201dIn the close-up focus shot of the camera lens, there were two side profiles. They were pressed close together, but they also seemed to be resisting one another. Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand was stretched out, his fingers blue from frostbite. His fingertips were only a milimeter away from Fang Juexia, but he couldn\u2019t touch him. Even in a static frame, it seemed as though his hands were shaking.Bound from top to bottom by the spring-charged honeysuckle, looking seemingly completely enclosed by a woven green cage, Fang Juexia had his eyes closed and was frowning slightly, seeming to be too exhausted to even breath.The birthmark at the corner of his left eye was the only color on his face. It was like a petal, and also like a cruel scar. It was mirroring Pei Tingsong, who lay opposite him and had a fallen winter-flowering cherry petal at the same location.When Lin Mo pressed the shutter\u2014Fang Juexia, with his eyes closed, revealed a delicate smile.It was no accident that the editor-in-chief of the magazine designated this photo as the cover on the spot. There was absolutely no need to choose any more; experience and instinct told him that this was the best one. What made it good was that this Spring, who had long wanted to monopolize and engulf Winter, was holding onto the last bit of his control with great difficulty.What made it even better was that this Winter, who had been imprisoned and abused, was finally willing to be happy in his own degeneration.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The secular prejudice he had held against idols was broken at the moment when these two bravely collided all their thoughts together and released amazing creativity.They weren\u2019t like usual idols, but they seemed to deserve the title of an idol even more.\u201cI can already imagine the scene when this set of pictures gets onto the Hot Search list,\u201d said the editor-in-chief to Lin Mo. Lin Mo just lit up a cigarette before saying, \u201cYou should think more about the scene when people are frantically trying to seize copies of the magazine.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. When I changed the cover, I just saw their potential.\u201d The editor-in-chief laughed and continued praising, \u201cThey\u2019re topical, beautiful, and they have real skills; in this circle, such children will only become more and more popular.\u201dImmediately following after the photoshoot was the magazine interview. Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes felt a bit uncomfortable, so he removed his eye makeup first before coming back and sitting down beside Pei Tingsong. At the beginning, there was a quick Q&amp;A session, in which the host, from behind the camera, asked the two of them questions one by one.\u201cWhat\u2019s the food you can never get tired of eating?\u201dPei Tingsong said offhand, \u201cCheeseburger, without pickles.\u201dFang Juexia said with a look of hesitation, \u201cShrimp dumplings\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cWho is the most caring person in the group?\u201dPei Tingsong didn\u2019t even think about it before opening his mouth, \u201cMiao Ge, his special hobby is taking care of people.\u201d Saying that, he then added, \u201cThough He Ziyan also takes great care of Miao Ge\u2026 But if we\u2019re talking about who is the most caring person in the group, it\u2019s still Miao Ge.\u201dFang Juexia also agreed. \u201cCaptain, maybe because he\u2019s taken care of his little sister since childhood.\u201d\u201cWhat are the most common recreational activities in the dormitory?\u201dFang Juexia replied, \u201cEn\u2026 Playing games?\u201dPei Tingsong shrugged. \u201cSorry, I just moved into the dormitory, so I\u2019m not fit to answer this question.\u201dThe host laughed loudly. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite book recently?\u201dPei Tingsong picked up the tail of a small dinosaur pillow on the sofa. \u201cThe Roots of Romanticism,\u201d Then, he looked at Fang Juexia and added, as if on purpose, \u201cRecommend it for you.\u201dFang Juexia knew that Pei Tingsong was implying that he wasn\u2019t romantic, but he didn\u2019t refute his remark at all. After all, there was nothing wrong with this statement. He simply raised his right eyebrow, in a rare fashion, and answered the previous question as if nothing had happened. \u201cRecently, I\u2019ve been reading\u00a0The Outsiders.\u201d After saying that, he also looked at Pei Tingsong on purpose and countered, \u201cVery suitable for you.\u201dThese two people seemed to be battling over something, for it was obvious that their two disjoint magnetic fields were differentiated and repelling each other. Even the host started laughing. \u201cNext question, what do you guys do when you have insomnia?\u201dPei Tingsong replied, \u201cListen to songs, read books, write something.\u201dFang Juexia replied, \u201cPlay Sudoku or Rubik\u2019s cube.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the fun of a Rubik\u2019s cube?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked.Fang Juexia smiled and responded, \u201cIf you have memorized most of the formulas for the Rubik\u2019s cube, you can experience the fun of it.\u201d\u201cCoffee or tea?\u201dPei Tingsong replied, \u201cCoffee.\u201dFang Juexia answered, \u201cBlack tea.\u201d\u201cThe preferences you guys have are pretty far apart, eh.\u201d The more the host asked, the more interesting she felt this was. Obviously, they were two people in the same group, and they were a CP pair that was quite hot right now, but their interests and hobbies were poles apart.\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite variety show?\u201dJust after feeling how could they not match at all, an unexpectedly unanimous answer arrived\u2014 \u201cEscape For Your Life.\u201dThe host asked, \u201cIs it because one of the regular guests is your senior brother Shang Sirui?\u201dFang Juexia explained with a smile, \u201cOf course, but the program itself is also excellent. When watching, all of us will become very nervous. Before, when the first season was airing, we would chase after updates in the dorm, and everyone would discuss the plot and the identity of the killer.\u201dPei Tingsong was very straightforward with his answer. \u201cSome of the script settings are very interesting, and there are a lot of word games, so it\u2019s more interesting than most reality shows.\u201dHis words were too straightforward, but it seems that everyone was used to it by now. The host said with a laugh, \u201cThe program group and the screenwriters for \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019 should be very happy when they hear that. Last quick Q&amp;A question, what\u2019s your favorite movie?\u201dPei Tingsong quickly answered, \u201cDead Poets Society,\u00a0the Chinese name seems to be\u2026\u201d\u201c\u300a\u6b7b\u4ea1\u8bd7\u793e\u300b,\u201d Fang Juexia answered for him.Pei Tingsong nodded. \u201cYes,\u00a0\u300a\u6b7b\u4ea1\u8bd7\u793e\u300b.\u201d He was a little surprised. Did this mean that Fang Juexia also liked this movie?The host asked again, \u201cThen what\u2019s Juexia\u2019s favorite movie?\u201dFang Juexia replied, \u201cEn\u2026\u00a0Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem.\u201dPei Tingsong asked, \u201cIt\u2019s a movie?\u201dFang Juexia nodded. \u201cA documentary.\u201d\u201cWhy do you like this one?\u201d He was simply curious.Fang Juexia lowered his eyes, which was the action he often employed when thinking through things. He tried to explain simply, \u201cBecause it really moved me.\u201d With that, he added, \u201cEvery time I watch it, it moves me.\u201dPei Tingsong still wanted to keep asking about this because he was really curious. He wanted to know why a documentary named after a mathematical theorem would move Fang Juexia to such an extent. However, the host had already cued up for the next stage and was ready to start the questions for the formal interview section, so he had to give up.Cheng Qiang had already read the outline of the questions prepared for the interview, and there weren\u2019t any very difficult questions. However, Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t really a person who was good at interviews, so most of his answers to the questions were pretty shallow. Although Pei Tingsong was much younger, he was never afraid of expressing himself and always seemed to be in control of the whole situation.The host began to ask, \u201cA few days ago, Kaleido performed their debut song at a broadcasted gala. En, as we all know, a little accident happened that day. We are all very curious about what kind of mood or state you guys were in during the moment of the accident? Is there anything you can share with us?\u201dThey all knew that they couldn\u2019t escape this question, the magazine was just like a\u00a0waterfront tower being the first to catch the moon, and so they became the first party to raise this question.Fang Juexia was a little worried that Pei Tingsong would be too frank while answering, so he went first, \u201cFirst of all, we are very grateful to the organizers for giving us this opportunity. Yes, in fact, our group has had a long gap period, and this was a very hard to come by stage, so we all practiced for a very long time. In fact, when the accident happened, we were actually very nervous, and there was no time to actually think about too many things, so our first reaction was to continue the performance. We also believed that the backstage staff were working hard to try and repair the sound system, so we couldn\u2019t give up that easily. At that time, our mentality was quite simple.\u201dWhat he said was very polite and gave CloudTV enough face, as if they had prepared for an incident like this in advance because they knew there would be such a problem. Of course, Pei Tingsong knew why he had said that, and he also knew that Fang Juexia would be more worried than others about this matter. He was often the representative for the entire Kaleido group, and he had to be responsible for it.If this interview had happened before, Pei Tingsong would definitely have happily said whatever he wanted to say, but upon seeing the person next to him, even he began to worry about this matter.The host then asked, \u201cAfter the performance, this song has also become a popularly searched song on major music platforms, and it\u2019s now ranked #1 on the basis of\u00a0 the number of clicks and downloads for it. I also went to listen to it, and then I realized that some of the words in the rap seemed to be different from the studio version of the song. Did you change the words on-stage?\u201dSensitive questions were suddenly being posed. Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help but look at Pei Tingsong.Pei Tingsong just laughed calmly and replied, \u201cYes, I was getting high from singing at the time, so I changed it a bit. I often change words on the spot. You know, people\u2019s inspiration often comes from strong emotional collisions. When you\u2019re on a live stage, with people\u2019s emotions so full and intense, that moment is very suitable for freestyle.\u201dFang Juexia also added, \u201cHe\u2019s often like this, and he also really likes to liven up the atmosphere of a performance. He doesn\u2019t really like for us to have the exact same performance every single time.\u201d\u201cHowever, boybands still tend to emphasize an overall consistency in their performances, and there isn\u2019t much free space for them to maneuver in. In this case, why did Tingsong choose to join a boyband?\u201d The host took the opportunity to throw out a new hot potato, one that hadn\u2019t been written down in the outline of the questions for the interview.Standing behind the camera, Cheng Qiang immediately went on alert. After all, Pei Tingsong really hadn\u2019t volunteered to make his debut with a boyband. If this guy told the truth again, they would be in trouble.On one hand, Fang Juexia was as worried as Cheng Qiang, but on the other hand, was also a bit curious about Pei Tingsong\u2019s answer. He felt that he himself was acting strange. Pei Tingsong was just like a knife, and whenever he drew closer to him, he would be afraid of this weapon, but also would be even more enraptured in wondering if this knife was sharp or blunt.\u201cI just talked about my favorite movie\u00a0ba,\u00a0Dead Poets Society. There is a line in it, and since I have only seen the original version, I can only recite the line in English\u2014 \u201cI\u00a0went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life\u2026to put to rout all that was not life; and not, when I had come to die, discover that I had not lived.\u201dWhat Fang Juexia found amazing was that he was also impressed by this line.[\u00a0I\u00a0went\u00a0to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life\u2026to put to rout all that was not life; and not, when I had come to die, discover that I had not lived.]Pei Tingsong continued, \u201cThe woods in my heart belong to more than one kind of forest. It could be fir, or it could be cedar. I\u2019m so young, so why shouldn\u2019t I go from a fir forest to a cedar forest, and maybe in the future, there will also be a maple forest, a cherry forest\u2026 I want to try living all kinds of life\u2014being a poet, a writer, a hip-hop artist, a boyband member\u2026 There are countless woods on my wish list, and I want to live like this, so that\u2019s why.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgWhat he said made Fang Juexia come to the realization that this usually arrogant and childish person was indeed nourished by and had grown up in a humanities environment. He was free, and was extremely proud of his ability to pursue this kind of freedom. Even if it was just to cover up the facts and deal with the interview, he could still say something poetic and true.What if this was directed to him?The stage was the only forest he wanted to go deeper into.It seemed that the host had not expected for Pei Tingsong to reply with such an answer. She was slow in replying by half a beat and couldn\u2019t help sighing emotionally. \u201cI never thought it would be such an answer, it\u2019s truly worth pondering over.\u201d This impromptu question was originally posed to make things harder for Pei Tingsong, but the way he just defused the entire situation like that and persuaded everyone with his reasoning was really surprising.He really wasn\u2019t just a regular idol.\u201cNext question: Both of you are members of a male idol group, and nowadays, there is a generally accepted notion that idols are selling fantasies. What do you guys think of this?\u201dThis question seemed very ordinary, but in fact, it had always been a hotly discussed topic online, and the opposition to this view was also quite strong. For idols like them, answering such a question was akin to walking on thin ice.Pei Tingsong only briefly thought for a few seconds before putting his opinion forward, \u201cI understand this kind of statement. Since idols, to some extent, are different from the kind of occupations other artists have; the sense of distance is less with an idol, and they\u2019re compared to a perfect image that\u2019s far away from human nature, so idols are more like beautiful goods in the window. People like you because your perfect image creates a kind of illusion that stimulates their desire. Most of the time, it\u2019s not really the real you they are seeing; they won\u2019t see your shortcomings and bad habits, or the dark side of your human nature.\u201d\u201cThey actually fold that part of themselves away in order to be like an idol, so once all of an idol\u2019s real traits are spread out, the people will definitely see a considerable gap from their expectations. To be honest, saying that idols sell fantasies is also true. The more you prune and shape your external image to be closer to perfection, the higher the fantasy value, and the heavier the burden you have to bear. \u201cWhat he said was very straightforward, and the strict logic of his argument laid all the facts out under the bright sun\u2014 it seemed as if he totally wasn\u2019t a member of the idol circle. Thus, when he finished talking, all the staff members present were surprised. However, this person, Pei Tingsong, could not be measured or predicted using common sense.\u201cWhat about Juexia? What do you think?\u201d The host tried to cue Fang Juexia into responding, because he had always been very\u00a0reticent\u00a0in the face of every single question before.\u201cObviously,\u201d said Fang Juexia, \u201cthis is already the mainstream view. However, I still may have to refute it a little bit.\u201dThis was a rare scene, especially, the word \u201crefute\u201d seemed very explosive, and even the host was excited. \u201cReally? What do you think?\u201d\u201cIt is true that the kind of situation Tingsong just spoke of exists, and its universality cannot be tested. In fact, for many fans, their liking is not as simple as some kind of stimulated desire, but is actually very complex. Of course, I don\u2019t deny the existence of this kind of stimulated like; it is very normal, and liking something itself is a kind of desire. No matter how it is classified and explained, the emotional essence of liking something belongs to the category of desire. It\u2019s just that there is a difference in the proportion of how much desire for something in particular exists in someone\u2019s liking. For example, maybe I like an idol, and in my liking for him, desire only accounts for 10%, while for my friend, the proportion of desire in his liking is 80%.\u201dPei Tingsong listened and became interested in his point of view. Fang Juexia always seemed to be able to quantify his thinking in a certain manner, as if he was in pursuit of accuracy and precision, which was amazing to him.Fang Juexia continued, \u201cI think for most fans, the proportion of desire in their liking is not as high as the public imagines. It may also satisfy the\u00a0normal distribution, with it being less at both ends and significantly more in the middle. Therefore, idols are not so much selling fantasies as they are embodying dreams; they are not stimulating desire, but actually providing emotional motivation.\u201dHe realized that his manner of expression might not be easy enough to understand, but he had already done his best, so he paused and put it more bluntly, \u201cReal life is pretty hard, and everyone has their own difficulties. There are so many occasions during which the word \u2018dreams\u2019 feels far away and rather empty to everyone. Therefore, people begin to feel that their dreams are out of their reach. In my opinion, idols who succeed are actually the embodiment of a dream. They are like a proof, and with the existence of this person, everyone can really see the existence of the dream as well.\u201d\u201cIs its existence very important?\u201d Pei Tingsong suddenly asked.\u201cOf course, its existence means that there actually also exists a realistic path to the final answer, which proves that dreams can be realized.\u201d After saying that, he showed a smile and stated, \u201cIn this hard world, that is something really amazing.\u201dHis manner of expressing himself was more vivid than ever, especially his last phrase, which basically showed that he was in high spirits.It was as if he was saying\u2014You see, that\u2019s why I wanted to be an idol.I will be the proof of that existence.Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help being stunned at this and looked at him, completely entranced.He thought that of the moment when Lin Mo had asked him if it was a pity that he had become an idol. If it had been in the past, he wouldn\u2019t have hesitated to say what a pity it was, because this really wasn\u2019t the path he had wanted to choose. If it wasn\u2019t because he felt responsibility towards the group, he wouldn\u2019t have been afraid to say it.But then he had seen Fang Juexia, who had been pondering dance moves while stepping through the snow, after which he couldn\u2019t utter the words, \u2018it\u2019s a pity.\u2019The existence of this light had shaken his once firm judgment.The atmosphere turned a little subtle, and the host said with a smile, \u201cIt seems that although you guys are in the same group, you often have completely different views\u00a0ah.\u201d She jokingly mentioned the anti-materials that were spreading online, \u201cI think the rumors on the Internet that say that you don\u2019t get along are actually\u2026\u201dCheng Qiang was very sensitive to this kind of topic, and for the purpose of protecting his artists, he tried to interrupt, \u201cThis one, we\u2019ll just\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Pei Tingsong said with a clear smile, \u201cQiang Ge, what can\u2019t be said here?\u201dIf it was only Fang Juexia alone here, he would actually have a hard time dealing with such a topic. This rumor wasn\u2019t like the groundless wind that he was used to facing from before, the discord being discussed here between them was true; they really had maintained a cold war relationship for two years. It was hard for him to smile and lie to everyone about how deep their friendship was and how close they were.Yet, at this time, he had become very contradictory. On one hand, he couldn\u2019t answer this, but on the other hand, he was curious about what Pei Tingsong would say. Plainly speaking, this person was usually the one who hated lying the most.Would he admit to it directly?Fang Juexia\u2019s palms were braced against the sofa. He warned himself to be psychologically prepared, because with Pei Tingsong here, anything could happen. It was only because everyone knew about Pei Tingsong\u2019s trait of always being an explosive subject that he had become the focus of the interview.He heard Pei Tingsong say, \u201cThe rumors that we don\u2019t get along, I understand\u00a0ah. After all, the modern Internet is so developed that the cost of creating rumors is also reduced. Probably, when everyone sees the scene from before, they will become even more sure of the fact that we don\u2019t get along\u00a0ba.\u201d Saying this, he started laughing and then continued, \u201cHowever, when you look at Aristotle and his mentor, Plato, did they also not erupt into a war-like debate over the concept of \u2018universalism\u2019?\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s education had made him used to seeking out examples for his arguments himself. \u201cAnd Brutus, did he not love Caesar? After his successful assassination of Caesar, he said frankly, \u2018I love Caesar, but I love Rome more.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s fingers relaxed. He hadn\u2019t expected such a result.These examples were too cunning, and it was only Pei Tingsong who dared to make these kinds of analogies without blushing or feeling his heart race.Saying that, Pei Tingsong looked at Fang Juexia and quoted one of the famous sentences handed down by Aristotle, the ancient Greek sage\u2014\u201cPlato is dear to me, but dearer still is truth.\u201dI love my teacher, but I love the truth more.\u201cYou\u2019re the same, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He laughed as he called out, \u201cJuexia Ge.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 24Chapter 24 \u2013 Loosened ShellTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksThis world needed different methods to arrive at solutionsFor a moment, and for the very first time, Fang Juexia felt that they were similar.This was very strange because, when considering either their outward appearances or inner logic, they were like two arrows travelling in opposite directions, but they still resonated together in some subtle way.Facing Pei Tingsong\u2019s question, Fang Juexia nodded. In fact, he knew that he didn\u2019t have to explain anymore, but he still wanted to say something.\u201cYes. Maybe everyone has different definitions for social relationships. Perhaps, in the eyes of many people, harmonious social relationships are those where people communicate and get along well without there being any dispute or friction between them. In fact, this kind of a social relationship is very likely to be an illusion of harmony created and maintained by both sides. People are inherently different from each other, so no matter if they are very similar or close to each other, they will always have different views.\u201dPei Tingsong was a bit surprised. Originally, he had just given free play to his words in order to diffuse the idea that they didn\u2019t get along. He hadn\u2019t expected Fang Juexia to be able to add on some orderly logic to his explanation so quickly. He couldn\u2019t help thinking that maybe Fang Juexia was not nearly as unsociable as everyone thought he was.He was just very precise in picking, choosing, and managing his social relations.Fang Juexia continued, \u201cWe are able to stick to our own points of view and yet, at the same time, are at ease when boldly colliding against the other person\u2019s ideas. We express our own opinions and defend our own held truths, but at the end of the day, we will not be estranged by this fierce debate, but in fact, we will know each other better. This is what I think makes for a good social relationship.\u201cTo put it simply, it\u2019s like a math homework problem: you have your method, and I have my method, but we are all pursuing the goal of getting the right answer. During class, math teachers also encourage everyone to try to obtain the solution by using various different methods, and that\u2019s because this world needs all kinds of voices and needs all kinds of people. I won\u2019t submit to your method just because I\u2019m afraid of destroying my friendship with you; instead, I\u2019m going to take out my method to discuss it with you. Having this kind of confidence speaks to deeper feelings, doesn\u2019t it?\u201dHaving said this, Fang Juexia started to laugh and then added, \u201cSo us getting along in this way doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not amicable. We are just affirming our own thoughts and respecting each other\u2019s freedom of self-expression.\u201dAs soon as his words landed, Pei Tingsong actually started clapping. Fang Juexia turned his face to look at him, just in time to see Pei Tingsong use his right hand, that was holding a plushie, to give him a thumb\u2019s up.Fang Juexia quickly turned his head away, with the corners of his mouth quirking up.The editor-in-chief, who was listening to the interview from behind the scenes, continuously nodded. The thoughts these two young boys had displayed previously had already made him re-evaluate them, for they had gone beyond the concept he held of idols, but after listening to their interview, he couldn\u2019t help thinking\u2014Why did he think that idols weren\u2019t able to say such things?Just as Fang Juexia said, this world needed different methods to arrive at solutions, so the issue regarding idols also required different kinds of methods.There was not only one formula through which these young people could shine on the stage.The host nodded repeatedly. If it wasn\u2019t for professional ethics, she would have exclaimed loudly, but she still managed to hold herself back when she spoke, \u201cYou put that across really well. I have also reaped a lot from today\u2019s interview, which is also the meaning of my job.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d After answering that question, Fang Juexia took a sip of water from the cup on the table. When he put the cup back, he realized that Pei Tingsong\u2019s cup was placed very haphazardly, so he quietly moved the two cups to stand on the same horizontal line. He seemed to have transformed back into the little idol with the cold appearance.Seeing his series of movements, Pei Tingsong was amused. He rubbed the head of the small dinosaur plushie in his hand, and the more he thought about it, the funnier it seemed to him, so he ended up bowing his head and started laughing.The host flipped through some cue cards and continued, \u201cWe went really deep into the last few questions, so let\u2019s tackle a more relaxed subject for our last question\u00a0ba. We used a lot of flowers and plants in the photoshoot today, and even our modelling set was like a botanical garden, so I\u2019ll ask about a more interesting topic\u2014 If you were asked to choose a plant to represent each other, which one would you choose?\u201dFang Juexia asked, \u201cYou\u2019re saying the plant most like him? We\u2019re not picking for ourselves?\u201d\u201cYes, a plant that you think is very similar to the other person, or a plant that could represent them best.\u201dFang Juexia glanced at Pei Tingsong, who also tilted his head to look at him. Fang Juexia\u2019s brain soon came up with a plant. \u201cUm\u2026. Although Pei Tingsong has the nickname \u2018Pinot Tree Supreme\u2019\u2026\u201d After saying this, he couldn\u2019t help but start laughing.The host was a bit doubtful. \u201cPinot Tree Supreme?\u201dFang Juexia chuckled. \u201cBecause the initials of Pei Tingsong\u2019s name in pinyin is PTS, and the word that would frequently appear through auto-complete when typing is \u2018Pinot Tree Supreme\u2019, so everyone calls him that.\u201dPei Tingsong immediately faced the camera. \u201cSee that? We all know what you guys usually say. Don\u2019t speak ill of me, or else I\u2019ll follow the wires back to your house and unplug your Wifi.\u201dHis joking around like that made Fang Juexia want to laugh even more, but he still remembered that he hadn\u2019t answered the question, so he tried to turn serious. \u201cEn, if I\u2019m supposed to pick a plant to represent him, I think he is more like a cactus.\u201dHearing that, Pei Tingsong picked up the small dinosaur plushie by its tail and started to swing it around at him. Fang Juexia immediately pointed at Pei Tingsong and said, \u201cJust like right now, they\u2019re very alike\u00a0ba.\u201dThe host laughed. \u201cSo Juexia feels that Tingsong is a lot like a cactus because he\u2019s very prickly, is that right?\u201dFang Juexia ignored Pei Tingsong\u2019s tail attack and nodded. \u201cEn.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re even \u2018en\u2019ing?\u201d Pei Tingsong was pretending to be fierce, but his voice was quite small.\u201cBut,\u201d Fang Juexia grabbed the dinosaur\u2019s little tail and looked frank and serious as he explained, \u201cCactuses look like they have a lot of hard thorns on the outside, but in fact, they are very soft on the inside. Can you imagine, the water content in a cactus is 85% to 90%. Because of its harsh environment, it is always absorbing and saving water; it\u2019s a plant that is very seriously working hard to try and survive.\u201dHearing this, Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand froze, and he forgot to pull the toy\u2019s tail back.\u201cHe\u2019s a lot like that too.\u201d Fang Juexia released his hand and smiled at the camera.\u201cSo it turns out that it has such a deep meaning\u00a0ah.\u201d The host laughed and looked at Pei Tingsong as she asked, \u201cThen what kind of plant does Tingsong think Juexia is like?\u201dPei Tingsong leaned back against the sofa and began to pull at the spikes on the dinosaur\u2019s back. \u201cI used to think he was more like a cherry blossom or something. You know,\u201d He looked sideways at Fang Juexia, and even put his hands beside his own face in order to create some shadows for contrast as he continued, \u201cthis face is very beautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201dFang Juexia was a little embarrassed. He let go of the hand that was holding the dinosaur\u2019s little tail and tilted his head away from Pei Tingsong.The host nodded, unable to hide the smile that crept onto her face. \u201cThere is a bit of that cherry blossom feeling.\u201d\u201cBut now I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Pei Tingsong began to toss the little dinosaur\u2019s tail around again. \u201cI think he\u2019s a white eustoma.\u201dSince he was being so specific, Fang Juexia became very curious and asked, \u201cWhy?\u201dPei Tingsong flicked the little dinosaur tail at him one last time, then raised his eyebrows. \u201cNot telling you.\u201dFang Juexia nodded, and then began to clap slowly. Pei Tingsong was amused by this and also started to clap with him. He clapped and clapped, then abruptly switched to banging on the table. \u201cOkay, that was the last question, we\u2019re done!\u201d\u201cHard work, everyone.\u201d Fang Juexia stood up and bowed to the staff.After the end of the interview, they changed out of the outfits they had worn for the photoshoot and got ready to leave.In the dressing room, as Fang Juexia took off the sweater, static from the yarn crackled all around him. He then recalled something, reached into his shirt pocket, took out the piece of paper with the poem written on it, hesitated for a bit, then didn\u2019t look at it again before folding it and placing it into the pocket of his down jacket.After leaving the location of the photoshoot, they headed for the company. On the way, Cheng Qiang praised and extolled their performance until Fang Juexia felt embarrassed and stopped talking again. He just listened to Pei Tingsong chat with Cheng Qiang, replying in a desultory fashion every once in a while.\u201cIf the sales of the magazine go up this time, more job opportunities in the fashion world will open up for you guys in the future.\u201d Cheng Qiang\u2019s face was filled with a smile. \u201cYesterday, Xiao Miao and Ling Yi\u2019s variety show ratings also went up, while at the same time, Lu Yuan received an invitation from the dance variety show that he wanted the most, and Ziyan was also invited to collaborate on a feature track, which is still being discussed right now. Step-by-step, everyone is on the right track now\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cStrong Ge\u2019s old mother\u2019s heart has finally paid off.\u201d Pei Tingsong laughed and complained, \u201cExcept for the two of us, everything is going well.\u201dFang Juexia also laughed with him, but Cheng Qiang said, \u201cYou two? Don\u2019t even mention it, all the jobs are looking for the two of you now, there\u2019s a giant heap of them, all of them requiring both of you to participate together.\u201dThese two people looked at each other at the same time, but because of this tacit understanding, they felt some embarrassment and so looked away at the same time. Clearly, when shooting for the magazine, they seemed to have gotten much closer, but after leaving that situation, they still couldn\u2019t interact naturally like ordinary bandmates.Pei Tingsong\u2019s childishness rose up again. \u201cIf it\u2019s not something with hip-hop, I\u2019m not going.\u201d\u201cThere aren\u2019t any hip-hop jobs for the time being.\u201d Cheng Qiang turned the steering wheel. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through all of them, and there\u2019s nothing particularly good right now, so we can wait some more. When we get back, you guys also have a look at them. If you want to do something, you should do something that is suitable for both of you and is a high-quality program with an equally high-quality team behind it. Otherwise, it\u2019ll be too much of a waste if you guys work hard and don\u2019t get commensurate returns in the end.\u201dCheng Qiang was a good agent who was focused and cared a lot about his artists, and Fang Juexia had been clear on this for a long time. In fact, he didn\u2019t have much expectations for variety shows and reality shows; to begin with, he didn\u2019t even like them very much. In addition, he had a quiet personality, so he wasn\u2019t the kind of talent that reality shows needed to bring in to create obstacles or comedic moments. What\u2019s more, he also didn\u2019t like the exaggerated methods used by reality shows to attract attention.But he was also aware of the fact that variety shows were an essential factor for maintaining exposure and improving their national popularity.Cheng Qiang concentrated on driving and didn\u2019t speak any further. Fang Juexia took out his cellphone to deal with his unread messages, and suddenly, remembered the last question from the interview just now. So, he opened up a search engine to look up \u2018eustoma\u2019.Wasn\u2019t this the white flower that Pei Tingsong was holding during the photoshoot?Once he made this connection, the strange emotions during the photoshoot started to flow through him again.Pei Tingsong had just put his earphones on when his cellphone vibrated. Unlocking it, he found that it was actually a message from Fang Juexia, who had never taken the initiative to send him messages before.[Just a pretty face: Why a eustoma?]He was also strangely persistent.The corner of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth involuntarily quirked up. Clearly, he and Fang Juexia were sitting right next to each other, but Pei Tingsong still turned over and typed his reply with his back facing him. A big and tall 1.8m guy sitting sideways in a car made for both a strange and funny scene.Fang Juexia also felt puzzled, but he was quickly getting used to Pei Tingsong\u2019s confusing behavior. As usual, he gazed at the nighttime scenery through the car window, while the little clock in his heart ticked away. After 4 minutes and 50 seconds had passed, his phone vibrated.[Kaleido Pei Tingsong: [Cactus emoticon]]Pfft.After holding back for such a long time, how is it that you\u2019re just sending this?.But before long, another message popped up\u2014[Kaleido Pei Tingsong: In fact, there is another name for the eustoma, it is also called the\u00a0prairie gentian; its native environment is\u00a0limestone. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s very wonderful? It is a flower that looks very delicate and very fragile, but in fact, contains the courage of a dragon and grows amongst the rocks.]After that, he also sent a small dinosaur emotion.The courage of dragons.Flowers blooming amongst the rocks.The top of the chatbox showed that he was still typing, but after a while, the \u201ctyping\u201d notice disappeared, and then appeared again.Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t help but stare at this notice that kept changing, all the way until new content popped into the chatbox once again.[Kaleido Pei Tingsong: Anyway, it\u2019s a bit like you.][Kaleido Pei Tingsong: If you don\u2019t feel like it is, then forget about it, I\u2019m just talking nonsense.]\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Cheng Qiang backed up the car and told them, \u201cGet dressed and get out of the car, hurry up, hurry up.\u201d He casually glanced into the rearview mirror. \u201cYi? You two didn\u2019t sleep\u00a0ah.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s train of thought was suddenly interrupted. He held his cellphone tightly and said, \u201cNo\u2026\u201d\u201cThen get out of the car quickly\u00a0ba, and wait for us.\u201dUnder Cheng Qiang\u2019s urgings, Fang Juexia could only quickly put on his coat, open the door, and get out of the car.Seeing his rapid movements, Pei Tingsong actually felt a little uncomfortable.He finally glanced at the words he had just sent out, threw his cellphone into his pocket, closed the car door with a black expression, then slouched around at the very back as he even started complaining about Cheng Qiang, \u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry? You\u2019re rushing as if you have to give birth to triplets\u00a0ah.\u201dOnce they were back at the company, before they could get any time to rest, they were called in to participate in the screening of the first round for the demo music with the other members. As soon as everyone got together, the atmosphere turned noisy, with Ling Yi pulling Fang Juexia over to eat some new snacks he had bought.Even with all this, Fang Juexia\u2019s feelings kept returning to that moment in the car, when he was still holding his cellphone, reading the message Pei Tingsong had sent him.Eustoma.He couldn\u2019t describe the kind of mood he was in now. Maybe it was because the Pei Tingsong in his impression had always faced him with a hostile attitude, so he subconsciously avoided him.But now he had begun to praise him\u2014right\u00a0ba, that should be regarded as praise?This change made Fang Juexia feel very unused to it; this person Pei Tingsong had no rules, so he just wasn\u2019t able to discover a way to deal with him.But there was also a slight pleasant feeling that lingered in his heart. Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t the kind of person desperate to be praised by others; on the contrary, most of the external evaluations of him couldn\u2019t affect his judgment of himself. He knew clearly what kind of person he was and what he needed to do. His inner world was stable and consistent.So when his mood became affected by Pei Tingsong\u2019s simple words, Fang Juexia felt that this was inconceivable.\u201cEveryone is here\u00a0ba?\u201d Chen Zhengyun sat down. \u201cThen let\u2019s start\u00a0ba.\u201dIn addition to the demo provided by He Ziyan, this first round of songs also included some songs the company had bought, and they screened them all together. There were many aspects to consider when selecting songs for an album: how well they matched with the concept of the album, the diversity and consistency of the song styles, the balance between dance music and ballads, etc.Fang Juexia was hesitating a bit. He had a ballad he had composed himself, but he wasn\u2019t sure whether it fit in line with their new album\u2019s concept. After all, this was his first attempt at composing music. Unlike when it came to matters about his strong points of singing and dancing, he wasn\u2019t 100% sure about this. Ever since he created the demo for it, he has been carrying it in a USB flash drive with him the entire time, for he had wanted to discuss it with the boss or a composer in private and listen to their suggestions. However, he hadn\u2019t expected that there would be so many new jobs for them. His plan was disrupted, and in a blink of an eye, the company had already started to pick songs.The meeting lasted for three hours, because all the group members had gotten together, and their current momentum was akin to wheels and axles rotating and working smoothly with each other to move forward. Although it was hard, they all enjoyed this process, for it was for the sake of the new album. This was the first album that they had all been involved in the production process for, and it was very meaningful.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgPei Tingsong had made up for some of his lost sleep during the freetimes during the photoshoot, so he still counted as being pretty awake during the meeting. He glanced at Fang Juexia, only to find that this person was distracted. This was very abnormal; based on normal circumstances, Fang Juexia should be the most serious one here.Strange.The stranger he was, the more Pei Tingsong wanted to observe.The boss, who had heard several songs, commented, \u201cThese songs are all pretty good, but there are no bright spots in the compositions of the second and third demo songs, though it\u2019s probably very difficult to save that. Pass them first, and the rest will be decided pending the second round. This time, we\u2019ll also do our best to promote the non-title songs, so everyone can rest assured. Is there anything else, Xiao Cheng?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s another song for the first round of song selections.\u201d\u201cWhat style?\u201d\u201cR&amp;B ballad.\u201d Cheng Qiang said, \u201cThis composer is very good, he has written several hot OST songs.\u201dPei Tingsong discovered that Fang Juexia\u2019s fingers seemed to be holding onto a small square metal item. He was also leaning forward, which was a very clear sign of him wanting to take action.\u201cThis album is focusing on electronic and dance music, so ballads should be limited to just one or two. We can\u2019t have too many.\u201dFang Juexia clenched his hand and pulled it back.Pei Tingsong keenly captured this movement. He spun the pen in his hand, and his eyes fell on Fang Juexia once again.The meeting didn\u2019t end until 1 in the morning, and by then, everyone\u2019s energy had reached their limits. They got into the van to return to the dormitory to rest. The one who was usually the most energetic, Ling Yi, also managed to ask only two questions about what had happened when they were doing the magazine photoshoot before falling asleep. Ever since Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong began to sell their CP, they even had to sit next to each other in the van to ensure that they appeared together in the daily livestream.Once he finally reached the dormitory, Cheng Qiang woke the sleeping members up one by one, just like he was waking up a litter of puppies. Of course, there was a wolf cub mixed in with them.\u201c\u2026\u2026we\u2019re here?\u201d\u201cSo fast\u00a0ah~\u201d\u201cAh, I slept in a weird position, and my neck hurts\u2026\u201d\u201cWhere am I? Where is this\u2026\u201dEveryone got out of the car one after another. Fang Juexia, who had woken up first, got out of the car with his coat gathered in his hands. Pei Tingsong was also getting ready to get out when he inadvertently spotted a metal USB left on the seat beside him.There were only two bathrooms in their collective accommodations, which was not very convenient. Fang Juexia took a bath as quickly as possible, and when he came out, he found Pei Tingsong sitting alone in the living room.Did he want to take a bath?Fang Juexia thought about it for a moment, but finally he didn\u2019t actually ask the question. He wiped his hair with a towel and prepared to go back to his room. However, as soon as he put his hand on the door handle, he saw a palm press against his door. Only when Fang Juexia turned around did he discover that Pei Tingsong had already surrounded him from behind.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d His tone was flat.Pei Tingsong stretched out his right hand, from which a USB swayed and dangled in front of his eyes, and said, \u201cYou dropped something.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s eyes changed slightly. He hastily thanked him and wanted to grab it, but Pei Tingsong was faster and clutched the USB back into his palm, before laughing and saying, \u201cYou want it? Beg me.\u201dThey had already crossed the safe distance between them.Fang Juexia looked up at him with his damp hair, and that familiar look appeared in his eyes again. \u201cDon\u2019t want it, so you take it\u00a0ba.\u201dSure enough, Pei Tingsong was still that devil who craved to see the world plunged into chaos. It was he who had thought too much and had become captivated by his clever words during the interview.Pei Tingsong suddenly felt excited, because this was the first time that Fang Juexia had shown an outwardly strong but inwardly weak side in front of him. Right now, he was acting brave and trying to speak angrily.\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d The corners of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth hooked up, and he deliberately lowered the voice as he said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it just a song?\u201d As he spoke, the fragrance of Fang Juexia\u2019s shower gel filled the space between them; it was a very clean smell.Fang Juexia frowned. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to guess\u00a0ah. You held onto it without letting go of it during the meeting, and then hesitated for so long.\u201d Pei Tingsong continued to guess, \u201cIt\u2019s not just any demo, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a ballad.\u201dFang Juexia felt both angry and amused. What kind of an evil fate was this\u2014every time he had no confidence, he would fall straight into Pei Tingsong\u2019s hands. Sure enough, he couldn\u2019t deal with this guy, Pei Tingsong.While they were confronting each other, Ling Yi\u2019s voice sounded out from the main bathroom as he yelled, \u201cJuexia! I forgot to bring in my pajamas. They\u2019re just on my bed, help me get them\u00a0ba!\u201d\u201cI just wrote it casually. If you want to listen to it, then fine; give it back to me when you\u2019re done.\u201d Fang Juexia turned to open the bedroom door and did not continue to tangle with him. In any case, all that would happen was that Pei Tingsong would just listen to it, then ridicule him a bit; it wasn\u2019t some big loss.Bang. Just like that, Pei Tingsong had the door slammed in his face. Originally, he had thought that as soon as Fang Juexia said a soft word, he would return the USB to him. Who had known that it would turn out like this? Staring at the door, Pei Tingsong felt bewildered with this unexpected event.This was really a very hard branch.This was not a eustoma, but a solid prairie gentian.No, a glacier gentian.Even after gaining the combat experience of repeatedly running into a stone wall, Pei Tingsong still didn\u2019t give up his confidence in continuing to face this kind of confrontation. Instead, even more than ever, he now wanted to understand what kind of temper Fang Juexia had.His curiosity was growing as their relationship grew ever closer.After helping Ling Yi, Fang Juexia sat at his desk and opened his Sudoku book. He did two puzzles in a row, but his mood didn\u2019t calm down as fast as he thought it would. Fang Juexia seldom had times when he couldn\u2019t restore his own emotions to their original state, and he didn\u2019t even know what he was angry at right now, or why he was unable to calm down even after this long.He sensed that he had changed. It was like his state of equilibrium had been broken, with his entropy increasing, and things were now starting to incline towards randomness. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t like this at all. He didn\u2019t like randomness, he liked his state when at equilibrium.He considered the possible reasons for this, investigating them one by one, until he was left with only the last one option\u2014he had mistakenly thought that the ice had already been broken in the relationship between him and Pei Tingsong, when that wasn\u2019t actually the case.As he was immersed in his thoughts, the tip of his pen seeped ink into the space where a number should have been filled in. Black ink continued to spread and stretch along the trails of the paper fiber until a WeChat prompt sounded.[Kaleido Pei Tingsong: Shared a video.]Fang Juexia felt that this was strange and clicked it, only to realize that it was actually a video of him shot during the outdoor photoshoot during the day. It was just that this was something that had obviously been taken by a cellphone, and was not from the official shooting angle.In the video, he was lying quietly on the snow for a close-up shot. When Lin Mo called out \u201cOK\u201d and pulled the camera\u2019s focus away from him, he immediately sat up and shook off the snow on his head. Snowflakes fluttered down from his fluffy hair. In the video, the tip of his nose was red, his hands were held in front of him to warm himself, and he laughed resplendently.The Fang Juexia watching the video currently thought he heard something, but it wasn\u2019t very clear, so he put his ear closer to his phone.\u201cFrozen silly\u00a0ba.\u201dIt was Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice. It was very light, and it was something that he said to himself as he was filming this video.\u201c\u2026Laughing like this.\u201dFang Juexia shut the video and quit WeChat, cleared out all the running apps on his phone, quickly turned off the desk lamp, and went to bed.Ten minutes later, yes, the little clock in his heart told him very accurately that it was ten minutes, Fang Juexia opened up his cellphone again.A burst of cold white light quietly cut through this dark space, and his chest also opened a small crack, revealing his lively heart beating inside.Across the wall, Pei Tingsong was lying on his bed tossing and turning as he waited and waited\u00a0ah, waiting until even his favorite book had become boring. He was waiting for a message.[Just a pretty face: Please give me some advice after listening to it.]He couldn\u2019t help laughing, and then even read these nine words from the little ice cube out loud again.How could this person be so frozen? He could even imagine the expression on Fang Juexia\u2019s face while he was typing these words.He was just getting ready to reply when another message came from the other end\u2014[Just a pretty face: Don\u2019t film me again.]With a thump, Pei Tingsong closed the book that he just couldn\u2019t get through, and then lay on the bed with his head propped up. He opened the video he had sent through the chatbox again, rewatched it for the nth time, and soon replied with a smile\u2014[Kaleido Pei Tingsong: [Cactus emoticon]]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He tossed and turned until the clock struck 3:30 a.m., then got up to sit at his desk and turn on his computer. That USB drive was lying on his desk. Thinking about Fang Juexia\u2019s piqued words, he picked up the USB drive and stuck it into his computer.However, just when the pop-up for the USB drive appeared on the screen, Pei Tingsong hesitated.Right now wasn\u2019t a good time yet.He could see that Fang Juexia cherished his creation, and he could completely understand this frame of mind as a creator. A\u00a0painstakingly\u00a0created work required better treatment.After pulling the USB drive out of the computer, Pei Tingsong lay on his desk, and recalled the scene of the interview as soon as he closed his eyes. They had given different answers for almost every question. Fang Juexia was like a window; by just pushing it open a little, he had already seen a world completely different from his own.He had never seen such a person, one who lived both silently and soberly, who did not need to shout any slogans, or needed to show off any rebellious spirit; it was as if being self-sustaining was his natural ability.Remembering something, Pei Tingsong sat up and found the documentary about the proof process of Fermat\u2019s last theorem.Since he was a child, he knew little of mathematics, and also wasn\u2019t very interested in it. Before watching the documentary, he didn\u2019t expect his viewing experience to be very good. But unexpectedly, he actually seriously kept watching it and actually got quite deep into it.Clatter\u2014\u2014Suddenly, a loud noise came from outside.Pei Tingsong stopped the movie, took off his earphones, and walked out the door quietly. The source of the sound seemed to be coming from the living room. He went out and walked along the corridor, but unexpectedly, he actually saw Fang Juexia there.He was still wearing the sweater that Ling Yi had given him, while squatting furtively at the entrance to the corridor. Pei Tingsong wanted to scare him a bit, but was also afraid that if he really did get scared, he would yell and wake up the others. So he simply stepped closer and quietly squatted beside Fang Juexia.In this way, the two of them crouched side by side, blocking the entrance to the corridor.Regarding the sudden appearance of an extra person, Fang Juexia was completely ignorant of his presence. At the moment, he was trying to sort out a pile of books that he accidentally knocked down when he was passing by. On top of the books had been an old copper vase. He had been walking along the hallway, and had run into it as soon as he had turned the corner. The vase had crashed down, startling him into jumping up.Fang Juexia stood the vase upright and set it next to his hand. Most of these books were so old that their pages had started to curl, which may be why they were being pressed down by the vase like this.It must be from when Pei Tingsong had moved here and had no place to put these, so he had just piled and left them here. Fang Juexia\u2019s obsessive-compulsive disorder compelled him to organize it for him, which he did until there was only one book left. A rectangular bookmark had been placed on the open page, and under the light of the lamp, he recognized the handwriting.It was Pei Tingsong\u2019s.Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help but read out in a low voice, \u201cA robin redbreast in a cage, puts all heaven in a\u00a0rage\u2026\u201d\u201cCough.\u201cThe sudden cough scared Fang Juexia into directly sitting down on the ground, and his hand accidentally knocked the vase over.Oh no\u2014\u2014The vase didn\u2019t fall down the way he had thought it would; the corridor was still very quiet, so quiet, to the point where Fang Juexia could hear his heartbeat clearly.The dim light of the floor lamp brightened the face that was so incomparably close to him. Pei Tingsong was very near him, and with one of his hands on the wall of the corridor, they were face-to-face as he encircled him.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cShh.\u201d Pei Tingsong relaxed the hand that was against the wall, stabilized his center of gravity that had tilted forward from having to save the vase, and then set the vase down gently.Fang Juexia blankly held the bookmark in his hands, and his eyes were wide open as he stared at Pei Tingsong without moving a muscle, looking just like a badly frightened hamster.Seeing him like this, Pei Tingsong held back a smile and pulled the bookmark away from him. He pretended to be angry and stared back at Fang Juexia, then lowered his voice and said, \u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the night, and you\u2019re not sleeping just to steal a peek at my bookmark?\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s expression currently was a little innocent.After all, he was innocent.\u201cNo\u2026\u201d He also lowered his voice. \u201cI was a little hungry and wanted to eat something, but then I accidentally knocked into it.\u201dPei Tingsong nodded meaningfully, stuck the bookmark back into the last open book, and placed it back on the top of that pile of books.Fang Juexia supported himself against the wall as he got up; he had been really scared by this person just now.\u201cI\u2019m hungry, too. Is there anything to eat?\u201d It was too dark, so Pei Tingsong turned on the light in the dining room.\u201cEn.\u201d Fang Juexia started to work quietly.Their kitchen had a semi-open layout, separated from the rest of the space by a small bar. Pei Tingsong sat in front of the bar and poured himself a cup of juice. He also poured a cup for Fang Juexia and set it across from him.He quietly watched Fang Juexia busy himself in front of the kitchen counter. This was a rare scene for him; from his childhood to his adulthood, he had only had nannies who were responsible for his daily necessities, and they did not, and also could not, eat together with him at the same table. He had already gotten used to the loneliness of dining alone since he was a child, especially after his grandfather had died.\u201cDo you want to eat fried eggs?\u201d Fang Juexia turned and asked him in a low voice.Pei Tingsong shrugged. \u201cAlright.\u201dNot long after, Fang Juexia carried over some dishes and set them on the bar. There were six crystal clear shrimp dumplings, two runny fried eggs, and a dish of\u00a0radish cake.\u201cYou cooked so fast?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked.\u201cIt\u2019s just a midnight snack,\u201d Fang Juexia knew he was an otherworldly young master, so he explained, \u201cThe shrimp dumplings were quick-frozen, but they still taste pretty good. As soon as they\u2019re steamed thoroughly, they can be eaten.\u201d He pointed to the radish cake. \u201cMy mom sent this to me some time ago, and she made it herself. You can try it.\u201dAlthough Pei Tingsong was born with a gold spoon in his mouth, he was rarely particular about things. Even though he had been forced into StarChart to suffer, he had seldom complained about it.He picked up a shrimp dumpling and stuffed it into his mouth; it was delicious, going way beyond his expectations. When Fang Juexia saw that Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes had even brightened, his mouth quirked up in a slight smile.\u201cThis is really delicious, no wonder you like to eat it.\u201dFang Juexia froze for a moment before remembering that that was a question they had answered in the rapid-fire Q&amp;A session. He used his chopsticks to break open the fried egg and let the yolk flow out. \u201cThe ones from dim-sum at the teahouse are even better.\u201dPei Tingsong then picked up a radish cake. He was very curious what this rectangular, soft, and glutinous thing tasted like.\u201cThis is delicious, too.\u201dSeeing his satisfied expression, Fang Juexia felt a bit happy inside.This person ate just like a child. But that was right, he was a child who had just turned 20 a few days ago anyway.Thinking that this dish of radish cake was made by Fang Juexia\u2019s mother, Pei Tingsong felt a little envious and a little curious. \u201cWhen you were a child, did you eat meals made by your mom every day?\u201dFang Juexia drank a mouthful of juice before replying, \u201cNot necessarily.\u201d He hesitated for a few seconds, then explained, \u201cMy mom is a middle school teacher. When I was in primary school, I couldn\u2019t wait for her to come back to cook, so she would give me money and let me go downstairs to buy\u00a0roasted pork rice\u00a0or something. But as long as she had time, she would cook for me.\u201dSo his mom was a teacher. Upon hearing Fang Juexia talk about his family and childhood himself, a sense of joy inexplicably appeared in Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart.Fang Juexia seemed to think of something. He looked up at the camera installed in the corner of the kitchen. \u201cThey\u2019re also recording at night\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Pei Tingsong picked up another shrimp dumpling. \u201cWe\u2019re not wearing mics, so they can\u2019t hear anything.\u201d\u201cBut they will see us sneaking a midnight snack.\u201dPei Tingsong said ambiguously, \u201cYou were so hungry that you couldn\u2019t sleep, and you\u2019re still caring about that.\u201d Having said that, he glanced at Fang Juexia again. \u201cAnd on that topic, look at you, so thin you\u2019re about to die.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgFang Juexia choked. He just knew that this guy couldn\u2019t speak any good words. He changed the subject and stretched out his chopsticks to get the last piece. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you sleeping? It\u2019s not like you\u2019ve gotten a lot of sleep already.\u201d\u201cI was watching Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem.\u201dUpon hearing his words, the shrimp dumpling that Fang Juexia had just picked up accidentally fell down. He really hadn\u2019t expected that this person in front of him would actually go and watch a mathematical documentary just because he had mentioned it.Pei Tingsong supported his chin with his hands and looked at him. \u201cIt\u2019s better than I expected.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Fang Juexia put down his chopsticks. \u201cI thought you would find it boring.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of places where I can only half-understand what\u2019s going on. After all, I\u2019m not good at math.\u201d Pei Tingsong added, \u201cI only wanted to see it because you said it moved you.\u201dThis sentence fell on his ears, and they started to feel faintly warm.\u201cBut my level of understanding is limited, and so my experience after watching it must be different from that of yours. So I wanted to ask you,\u201d Pei Tingsong looked him in the eye. \u201cWhy do you like it so much? Is it because of that kind of academic spirit?\u201dFang Juexia lowered his head, picked up the remaining small pieces of radish cake, and packed them together neatly, one by one, as he answered, \u201cEn, after all, for more than 300 years, so many people have gone one after another to prove this theorem. This process is very hot-blooded.\u201d\u201cAnd,\u201d he raised his head and spoke, \u201cWiles\u00a0dreamed of proving Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem since he was ten years old, and he really did so after becoming an adult. Can you imagine that feeling?\u201dThe light that shone in Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes as he said this made it seem as if his whole person had come alive. Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help but nod, wanting to affirm his statement.\u201cOf course,\u201d Pei Tingsong said, \u201cYour expression right now is very similar to the one he had when he was talking about that in the documentary.\u201dFang Juexia was a little embarrassed. He composed his facial expression and drank a mouthful of juice. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just that every time I think about it, I feel that it\u2019s very inspiring.\u201dAlmost immediately, Pei Tingsong thought back to Fang Juexia\u2019s definition of an idol during the interview.\u201cSo, this is the embodiment of a dream that you were talking about.\u201dFang Juexia nodded, his face showing a\u00a0peaceful\u00a0calmness. \u201cAt least this existence allowed me to dare to dream when I was a child.\u201dPei Tingsong felt that this was inconceivable. \u201cWhen did you start to think like this?\u201dFang Juexia finished the juice in his glass. \u201cThe first time I saw this film was when I was in junior high school. I still remember the beginning scene of the movie to this day, and I\u2019ll probably remember it for the rest of my life.\u201d\u201cThat monologue?\u201dHis eyes softened as he recalled, \u201cI remember the background sound for that scene was the ticking of a\u00a0clock. Wiles then said, \u2018Perhaps\u00a0I can best describe my experience in mathematics as entering a dark mansion. One goes into a dark room; it\u2019s dark, completely dark, and he stumbles into the furniture.\u2019\u201dThis was surprisingly similar to the unexpected and startling experience they had just had.\u201cGradually, you learn where each piece of furniture is. And finally after six months or so, you\u2019ll find the light switch and turn it on, and suddenly, it\u2019s all illuminated, and you can see exactly where you were.\u201dFang Juexia stopped, and after a period of silence, he added, \u201cI know I\u2019m in the dark right now.\u201d\u201cBut one day,\u201d he said, looking up at Pei Tingsong with a quiet smile, \u201cI\u2019m sure I can turn on that light, too.\u201d\u201cThat day, I\u2019ll see where I am, and will let everyone see me too.\u201d\u2014The author has something to say :A robin redbreast in a cage, puts all heaven in a rage \u2014\u2014from\u00a0The Roots of RomanticismLittle K Group Omake :At the same time Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia sneak into the corridor\u2014\u2014The group chat of four people in Kaleido, minus #4 and #6, flashes red:[Kaleido\u2019s #1 Boss 01: Juexia actually ran out without sleeping.][National first-class flower hand dance performer: What are you saying, aren\u2019t you also not sleeping?][Kaleido\u2019s #1 Boss 01: I slept too much in the car, I\u2019m hiding in my quilt and reading novels right now.

    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 26Chapter 26 \u2013 Thoughts SpirallingTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksI believe you.At this moment, Fang Juexia\u2019s entire body seemed to be glowing.Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t describe what that feeling was. Obviously, they were both pursuing their dreams, but the ways and means with which he and Fang Juexia chose to go about doing so seemed to be completely different.He was directly rushing up and dashing his head bloody against the bars of his cage, wanting to see a freer world.Fang Juexia groped around patiently in the dark, looking for the button that would trigger the light.Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help laughing out loud. \u201cThis world really has many solutions.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t understand the meaning of his words, but he realized that he had said too much.Plainly speaking, his relationship with this person in front of him had been just like that between fire and water a few weeks ago, but now, he could actually tell him about how his\u00a0train of thought\u00a0had developed, something that he had never shared with others before.This wasn\u2019t like him at all, he wasn\u2019t a person who would casually share such things with others.\u201cI didn\u2019t actually think you would answer my question,\u201d Pei Tingsong said.Fang Juexia was internally surprised by this tacit understanding, but his expression was indifferent as he replied, \u201cI also didn\u2019t think you would go watch that movie.\u201d\u201cYou said it moved you.\u201d The corners of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth carried a smile. \u201cI was very curious, what kind of thing could move you?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that easy to shake an iceberg.\u201cYou are so curious.\u201d Fang Juexia began to clean up the dishes, putting all the dirty plates away, in preparation to leave.\u201cSince you already said that,\u201d Pei Tingsong said, \u201cI have another question.\u201dFang Juexia put the plates into the sink and quickly washed them.Pei Tingsong directly took his silence for acquiescence. He went over and leaned on the kitchen counter.The\u00a0shualala\u00a0sound of the water didn\u2019t manage to drown out Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice.\u201cWhat actually happened when you were at Astar?\u201dAfter asking this question, Pei Tingsong felt that this was incredible of him. In the past, he definitely would not have been so careful when questioning someone, it was completely impossible for him. Right now, not only was he thinking about how to make the wording of his question more euphemistic, but was also eager to not be misunderstood.Most of all, after he asked that question, he actually felt uneasy.Fang Juexia took the plates out of the sink, turned off the tap, dried his hands, and then looked up at Pei Tingsong as he said, \u201cThis question, I may not be able to give a detailed answer to you.\u201dWhen he saw Pei Tingsong\u2019s puzzled expression, he added, \u201cIn fact, if you ask me directly whether I have really participated in the hidden rules business before, I can answer that clearly.\u201dHe looked straight into Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes and said, \u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201dPei Tingsong instinctively blurted out, \u201cI know.\u201d He then realised that he had reacted too fast, so he paused before speaking again, \u201cI mean, I believe you.\u201dThe tone with which he said these words was so certain that Fang Juexia was almost shaken.\u201cThat\u2019s not what you used to be like.\u201d Fang Juexia laughed and took the dishes back to the cupboard.Pei Tingsong immediately replied, \u201cPeople\u2019s cognitive processes regarding things are always spiralling.\u201dFang Juexia stopped and turned to look at him. \u201cThings?\u201dWhen Pei Tingsong thought of the \u201cice\u201d, \u201cwood\u201d, 'silly goose\u201d, and other assorted metaphors he had come up with for Fang Juexia, he felt a little guilty. \u201c\u2026.and of people.\u201dFang Juexia closed the cupboard door and asked, \u201cSo how can you be so sure that I\u2019m not lying to you right now?\u201d\u201cIf you are, then you are too cunning.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice carried a bit of a complaint here.Fang Juexia let out a rare audible laugh. \u201cOne good turn deserves another.\u201d But he soon restrained his smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie to you. However, I can\u2019t tell you what happened back then. The only thing I can say is that I haven\u2019t done anything I feel ashamed about. I left AS simply because I didn\u2019t want to change myself.\u201dPei Tingsong believed this sentence, because it was completely in line with Fang Juexia\u2019s philosophy.He knew that his relationship with him wasn\u2019t close enough for him to speak his mind freely, so he didn\u2019t press on.Fang Juexia\u2019s frankness at this moment was already a surprise to him.The blue light of day gradually leached into the dark night outside the window. None of them thought that they would actually be able to spend such a long time with each other, and even get along with each other peacefully during it.\u201cGo back to bed\u00a0ba. It\u2019s almost light outside.\u201d Saying that, Fang Juexia got ready to leave, but Pei Tingsong grabbed his wrist again. Only this time, he could clearly feel that Pei Tingsong wasn\u2019t using much strength.He was just holding on gently.\u201cThat song you wrote, I haven\u2019t listened to it yet.\u201dPei Tingsong explained himself, \u201cI just wanted to tease you at that time. Originally, I was going to return it to you, but I didn\u2019t expect you to just throw it at me with angry words accompanying it.\u201dYeah\u00a0\u2014Fang Juexia internally complained. He also hadn\u2019t expected that he would get angry.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. If you don\u2019t want to listen to it, then just\u2026\u201d\u201cI actually do want to listen to it.\u201d Pei Tingsong interrupted his sentence mid-way, \u201cBut I want to ask for your consent first, so that it\u2019s not out of a fit of pique, but that you\u2019re really willing to let me listen to it.\u201dFang Juexia suddenly froze.\u201cAre you willing?\u201dInsomnia and hurriedly coming out to resolve his hunger, coupled with more than ten hours of work\u2014all of these factors had led to his mind becoming fuzzy.Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t very clear-headed right now.He nodded but didn\u2019t know why he was doing so.This song hadn\u2019t been heard by anyone else but him since its birth. When he first wrote it down, he had never imagined that the first audience member to hear it would be Pei Tingsong, a person diametrically opposed to him.\u201cThen I\u2019ll listen to it thoroughly.\u201d Pei Tingsong released his hand and said, \u201cI\u2019m done talking.\u201d He made way for Fang Juexia as he added, \u201cYou can go back and rest.\u201dWith the residual warmth on his wrist, Fang Juexia headed towards his room. They walked back together, with him in front, and Pei Tingsong behind, and as soon as they got to the door, Fang Juexia suddenly turned around. He hadn\u2019t expected Pei Tingsong to be so close to him, and ended up nearly colliding into him.Pei Tingsong was obviously also startled, and he reflexively caught hold of Fang Juexia\u2019s elbow and whispered, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d He thought that Fang Juexia had left something outside.In the dark, Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes, which were looking straight at him, seemed especially bright as he said, \u201cI want to read that book.\u201dBook? Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t understand, but he saw Fang Juexia nod, and then continue in a very quiet voice\u2014\u201cThe Roots of Romanticism.\u201dPei Tingsong let go of his hand.For the first time, he found that the title of this book could actually sound so nice when said out loud.Their busy schedule made it so that none of them were able to even remember the date, so a week passed by in the blink of an eye, and it seemed as if their insomnia driven nighttime chat had just taken place.If the magazine hadn\u2019t gotten in touch with Fang Juexia midway through and asked them to help put together a monologue, he would have remained under the impression that they had just finished that job.Fang Juexia finished the recording according to the materials distributed by the magazine, and then gave Cheng Qiang full authority over everything else related to it without any further questions.Kaleido\u2019s popularity was climbing higher and higher. With the industrious efforts of their agent Cheng Qiang, the whole group had recently won a highly nationally recognized food brand\u2019s spokesperson job. The last spokesperson for this brand had been a well-known singer. Coincidentally, on the day everyone was shooting the advertisement for this job, the magazine released a promotional trailer and some highlights from the photoshoot. Pei Tingsong\u2019s clothes weren\u2019t the right size, so he was waiting for the replacement while everyone else was getting their make-up done. Ling Yi suddenly cried out, \u201cWow, Juexia, Xiao Pei, the magazine you guys did a photoshoot for last time just released some stuff! How wonderful!\u201dLu Yuan was playing a game, but his hand slipped because of Ling Yi\u2019s howling. \u201cAh, Ling Yi, don\u2019t cry out like a pig, I was about to carry this match\u00a0ah!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one crying like a pig! If you have the ability, open up your mic, and I\u2019lI howl until your teammates shoot you!\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgAlmost at the same time, Fang Juexia received a message from Cheng Qiang, who was asking him to forward the magazine\u2019s ad on his Weibo.He Ziyan was quick. \u201cReally, it\u2019s a video.\u201d\u201cSo fast\u00a0ah?\u201d Jiang Miao said, \u201cI\u2019ll go and give it a like.\u201dFang Juexia clicked on the Weibo link they had sent in the groupchat and opened up the highlights video that had been posted.Ling Yi stressed, \u201cYou must put on earphones, you must!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Fang Juexia took out his earphones and put them on.The beginning of the video was pitch black, and the faint sound of wind whistling appeared in his ears, making it seem as if he had entered a cold winter day. Two or three seconds later, in the center of the screen began to appear a horizontal gap, and within that gap was a vast expanse of white. He could faintly hear a voice saying the word \u201cwinter\u201d repeatedly. The voice was very light and deep, and he could almost imagine the image of the tip of his tongue touching the back of his teeth while articulating this word.Gradually, the scene on the screen widened, and what appeared was actually him with a silly smile on his face while he was sitting on the snow.It was that particular scene of his that Pei Tingsong had taken.Accompanying this was a red, handwritten English word in the middle of the screen\u2014Imprisoning.Imprisoning.All of a sudden, the wind stopped. Once again, the image disappeared, and the screen turned black. He heard the low voice again, and it was one that he couldn\u2019t be more familiar with, only this time, he was sure of who it was.\u201cBeg me.\u201dThe sound of music appeared, and every picture that flashed by was stuck between low drum beats \u2014his back as it was hidden by the snowy forest when he entered it step-by-step; a pair of slender hands pushing aside the array of colorful flowers to find the trembling eustoma; him glancing backwards through the cold and dense fog; in a room full of spring colors, a stem that was being held and twirled around; him lying in the snow, his eyelashes trembling as he closed his eyes; the close-up shot of lips and teeth biting into the plump and white flower petals.Being sensitive to music, Fang Juexia quickly recognized the sounds hidden in the background\u2014 of broken glass and of chains being dragged on the ground.The camera kept zooming into the torn white petals, eventually transitioning into a field full of white daytime sunlight. The music had also changed, and a romantic and tender guitar tune now played in the background.Fang Juexia\u2019s own voice then sounded out from his headset.\u201cSpring\u2026\u2026\u201dThe sound had been processed into a worn-out sound\u2014 it was very light, and when repeated slowly, sounded like a whisper, or more like a cry for help. Under the swaying sunlight, the image shifted and cut to a sunlight-filled greenhouse. Pei Tingsong, who was sitting inside, looked up at the camera. Superimposed by using a double exposure shot, on the fresh flowers behind him appeared the faint image of the cold snowy forest, and of Fang Juexia as he lay in the middle of that snowy forest.The narration appeared again. It was still Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice, but he wasn\u2019t speaking in Chinese or his American English, but instead spoke in Spanish. Subtitles appeared at the bottom of the video\u2014\u201cYou\u00a0are more than this white head that I hold tightlyAs a bunch of flowers, every day, between my hands.\u201dIn the next scene, he mercilessly tore off the snow-white petals. The next second, a close-up of Fang Juexia\u2019s face appeared. His eyelashes, which were brushed with snow, quivered faintly, and the look in his eyes was perfectly straightforward\u2014both fragile and tough\u2014very contradictory.\u201cYou are here. Oh, you do not run away.You will answer me to the last cry.Curl round me as though you were frightened.\u201dThe torn petals fell down in slow motion. The sound of the piano that played in the background sounded just like how cold beads of water dripped after the ice and snow melted, and they fell faster and faster, faster and faster.The next images cut back and forth with the sound. Fang Juexia having difficulty breathing in the snow and exhaling white breath with his mouth open; a close-up of Pei Tingsong\u2019s finger going deep into an agate like red object; the melting ice-cube on his soft lips; a body bound with vines; countless beautiful flowers that couldn\u2019t be named.\u201cI will bring you happy flowers from the mountains,bluebells, dark hazels, and rustic baskets of kisses.\u201dThe music stopped, and the background sound shifted to the sound of rapid breathing. The next close-up shot showed the tip of Fang Juexia\u2019s tongue as it pushed out the ice cube that was making his lips red. The image gradually moved up to the red birthmark next to the wet corner of his eyes. A drop of blood dripped onto it, and the scene cut to a cherry lying in the palm of a hand.Pei Tingsong picked it up, and his sharp teeth bit through the membrane and went deep into the flesh of the fruit, with bright red juice flowing down his lips.\u201cI want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees.\u201cThe screen went dark for the last time, the background music disappeared, and all that was left was just the sound of wind and snow whistling, as it had been at the beginning of the video. An image gradually emerged\u2014 a pair of legs walking in the snow.Fang Juexia\u2019s unique cool voice appeared, narrating the ending.\u201cI\u2019m the\u00a0last\u00a0on your path.\u201dThis person took one step, then another. The trampled snow let out a creaking cry for help.\u201cThe last springtime.\u201dHe stopped, bent, and picked up something lying in the snow.\u201cThe last snow.\u201dThe camera moved up, and there was a snapping sound.\u201cThe last struggle not to die.\u201dSurrounded by snow, he broke a dead branch into two.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In addition, there was the word \u201cwinter\u201d crooned at the beginning and then the word 'spring\u201d appeared later, so it\u2019s very likely that they\u2019re representing winter and spring respectively.][@Beautiful\u00a0Fine Jewellike Xeriscape\u00a0replying to @7654321: What kind of immortal description is ice-water tone!

This time, almost all the concept plans were put forward by them, and everyone was involved in all those discussions. It was a brand-new work experience.

Moreover, he even ordered hot\u00a0Ovaltine\u00a0and pizza for all of us staff members on site. He was pretty much an angel! [Highlight: The narration here was voiced by Xiao Pei and Juexia.

Suddenly, his cellphone vibrated.[Kaleido Pei Tingsong: [Cactus emoticon]][Kaleido Pei Tingsong: Forward the Weibo post]It was only then that he remembered the task he was supposed to do. When he slowly opened the forwarding interface, he found that Pei Tingsong had already forwarded it.[@Pei Tingsong:\u00a0Imprisoning winter.]Only after the clothing problem was solved did Pei Tingsong return to the dressing room, and he was currently seated on the outermost seat, separated from Fang Juexia by four people. He took out his cellphone to refresh the Weibo page and saw Fang Juexia\u2019s latest forward.[@Fang Juexia:\u00a0Waiting for spring.]This person was actually quite good at copying homework.Their forwards quickly attracted a large number of fans, and the video grew even more popular.[@Putuo Temple Site\u2019s Fine Jewelike Xeriscape: Ahhhhhhh even their captions match so well!][@TingJue is real: These double aces really have super good sense!

The attitude of the advertisers and producers towards them was already completely different from before; they had a lot of assistants, their modeling positions were good, and they weren\u2019t even scolded for making mistakes during the shoot. This circle was very realistic, and those who had been ignored before would see it more clearly.\u201cHard work, Kaleido\u00a0la, enjoyed our cooperation!\u201dAfter they finished the job and got into the van, Xiao Wen reported the latest schedule to them, after which he started to falter as he said, \u201cBy the way, there will be a charity gala in a few days, and you guys are invited. Of course, there will be some other groups there too\u2026\u201dOther groups? Fang Juexia soon realized that something was going on. He was about to ask when Xiao Wen said, \u201cHighFive is also going.\u201d\u201cSenior brothers are also going!\u201d Ling Yi\u2019s spirits suddenly rose.\u201cWhat are you so excited about\u00a0ah?\u201d Xiao Wen fastened his seat belt and started the car. \u201cYou guys are also going to be going as distinguished guests to your senior brothers\u2019 concert in a few days.\u201dThis sentence made this nest in the car boil up with excitement. Although StarChart was poor, it did really create music and cultivate its artists properly. Therefore, the relationship between the artists in the company was very good, and theirs with their senior brother group HighFive especially more so, for they had taken care of these juniors since their trainee days.Kaleido used to livestream almost twice a month, but recently they had been too busy, and they hadn\u2019t livestreamed since the New Year\u2019s. During the ride, Jiang Miao logged into the official account of their group\u2019s livestream. Due to the widespread popularity of the promotional materials that had just been released by the magazine, their livestream room was at bursting capacity.\u201cGood evening\u00a0ah,\u201d said Jiang Miao, who was sitting in the front seat of the van and holding a selfie stick. \u201cWe just finished our work. Can you guys see us clearly?\u201d Saying that, he then asked the driver, \u201cXiao Wen, can you turn on the lights for us again?\u201d[AHHHHHHHHH GEGES I\u2019M COMING!][We can see! It\u2019s Geges\u2019 beauty that lights you guys up for us!]\u201cPfft,\u201d Ling Yi was successfully amused and asked, \u201cWhat is this advanced rainbow fart hahaha, Gege, am I a light bulb?\u201d His voice was a little hoarse, and he coughed a few times before explaining, \u201cToday\u2019s song recording lasted for the whole morning, so I\u2019ve gotten a duck\u2019s voice now.\u201d[01 Gege, your OST is on the download list again!! 01 is awesome!]He Ziyan commented, \u201cA light bulb of the male duck brand.\u201d[Heart aches for Yiyi][Hahaha, as always, Fire Ge is in charge of complaining][11\u00a0is sandwiched between several pairs of CP every time, he really feels like a\u00a0light bulb\u00a0hhhhh]Fang Juexia sat in the very back. Somehow, he felt and found a candy on the seat cushion, and then examined it in the dim interior light for a long time.\u201c\u2026\u2026White Rabbit candy?\u201d As soon as he was sure of what it was, Pei Tingsong, who was sitting to the side, took it out of his hands, quickly stripped off the wrapper, and tossed the candy into his mouth.Fang Juexia failed to react in time, his hand still stuck in the posture of holding the candy.Pei Tingsong stuck his tongue out at him and pressed down on his fluffy fisherman\u2019s hat.Fang Juexia blinked. He felt that his life had begun to turn into a complete assortment of the different confused reactions he had to Pei Tingsong. He put his hand down, though he didn\u2019t know that the barrage had already started boiling over at this time.[Did Xiao Pei snatch Juexia Gege\u2019s candy just now?!][Pei Tingsong, this bratty kid, what\u2019s up with him?! Hahahahaha I\u2019m laughing to death!][I don\u2019t see you eating candy normally\u00a0ah? What\u2019s in Gege\u2019s hand is more fragrant, right?!][Pinot Tree Supreme, I\u2019m laughing to death. When you were doing the magazine shoot, weren\u2019t you so alpha\u00a0ma,\u00a0why are you so elementary kid-like now?!][AHHHHHHH the magazine! I want to buy it so bad! Quickly let me buy it!][Juexia was in a daze just now hhhhh][Teacher\u00a0Yuan, stop listening to the song, quickly look at me!]Up front, Jiang Miao was chatting with the fans. He and He Ziyan were the group members who always managed to best control the scale and rhythm of a conversation, and they spoke with ease. Ling Yi and Lu Yuan possessed a talent for comedic timing, so they were usually the ones who had the most offers for variety show jobs. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t like to express himself, while Pei Tingsong often slacked off and took it slow, so these two members, who were the best at attracting fans, had to rely on their faces and stage performances to do so. Now, of course, their CP had also become a huge source of popularity.\u201cThe broadcast time of the ensemble show? The first episode of the ensemble show should be released this weekend\u00a0ba. It\u2019ll depend on our backstage little Ge\u2019s work efficiency, everyone is a bit slow right after the New Year, haha,\u201d Jiang Miao answered the fans\u2019 question, \u201cIn fact, I think this ensemble show is quite meaningful.\u201dHe Ziyan quickly got what he meant to say, and added, \u201cYes, everyone may have already guessed that our new album has also been put on the agenda.\u201d[AHHHHH A NEW ALBUM!]In tacit understanding, Ling Yi and Lu Yuan started to make gong and drum sound effects at the same time while sitting in the last row.[The ventriloquist team is online again!]Fang Juexia, who was at the very back, gestured with a conductor\u2019s motion of ending a concert while saying, \u201cThe End.\u201d However, this situation wasn\u2019t that easy to control, so after his first failure, he coughed again, then pretended like nothing had happened, and tried it once more.[Hahahahahahaha our little conductor Juexia~][Mr. Fang: I\u2019m so tired that I can\u2019t control the little crazy people in my family.][It\u2019s so cute how he checks their expressions when he coughs!]\u201cSo,\u201d He Ziyan regained his composure and went on to say, \u201cThis time, a lot of the new album\u2019s production process will also appear in the ensemble show, with the exception of some parts that can\u2019t be broadcast.\u201dThe barrage soon went crazy.[AHHHHHHHH what can\u2019t be broadcast?! Let me seeeeeeeee!][I just want to see what can\u2019t be broadcast! No cutting anything out!][We\u2019re not lacking for that little traffic! StarChart entertainment! Kaleido! Broadcast it for me!]Pei Tingsong clapped He Ziyan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAsking you, what part can\u2019t be broadcast?\u201dLu Yuan also followed the rhythm of the group bully and patted He Ziyan\u2019s other shoulder as he repeated, \u201cYeah, what can\u2019t you broadcast?\u201dLooking at how the barrage on the screen scrolled even faster, He Ziyan helplessly explained, \u201cThe parts I said couldn\u2019t be broadcast are the parts about the new album that need to be kept secret, such as the music, choreography, dance, and stuff. After all, we do have to surprise you guys\u00a0ma.\u201dJiang Miao held back a smile and nodded. \u201cEn, this time, all of us have participated in those parts, and we also hope that everyone can witness the birth of this album!\u201dThe streets were a bit jammed, so after chatting on the livestream for a while, these several people began to play the \u201cExpressionless Challenge\u201d game to pass the time.\u201cWait!\u201d Ling Yi raised his hand. \u201cJuexia is the best at being expressionless, so for this game, we must exclude him!\u201dWhen Fang Juexia heard that they were going to exclude him, he rubbed his face. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad\u00a0ah, I don\u2019t have facial paralysis.\u201d[Ah hahahahahahahaaha Fang Juexia, why are you so cute?!][FJX is really serious in everything he does\u00a0oh]Lu Yuan comforted him, \u201cYou don\u2019t have facial paralysis, you\u2019ve just collected too few expressions.\u201dIn any case, they all ruled out Fang Juexia, and assigned him the position of the referee, along with making him the person holding the tasks to be drawn. Although it wasn\u2019t some important task, he was still conscientious, so he shook the stack of notes everyone had written in his hands for a long time before offering it up to everyone to choose.\u201cXiao Pei, go first!\u201d Ling Yi said.He Ziyan said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to show your real skills.\u201dPei Tingsong clicked his tongue before drawing a piece of paper from Fang Juexia\u2019s hands.Since Fang Juexia possessed a powerful memory, he immediately knew that things weren\u2019t going to be good.\u201cWhat is it? Quickly show me!\u201d Ling Yi grabbed the note from his hand, and suddenly let out a groundhog scream, \u201cAh!!\u201d\u201cEating a lemon!!!Pei Tingsong had a completely confused expression as he asked, \u201cNo, where in the car are you going to get a lemon from?\u201d\u201cI have some.\u201d Their group leader took out a small box filled with fresh lemon slices from his bag. \u201cI drink lemon water every day, so I bring some along.\u201d\u201cYou even do that?\u201d Pei Tingsong was in despair.Lu Yuan said, \u201cCome, come, come, send a few comments to the barrage, Xiao Pei is eating some lemon, so old iron bros send a 666\u00a0ah!\u201dLing Yi shook his head. \u201cIf his feelings are deep! Stuff the whole thing in his mouth! If his feelings are shallow! Just lick it!\u201dJiang Miao sort of didn\u2019t have the heart to go on and suggested, \u201cI\u2019ll find you the thinnest slice\u2026\u201dHe Ziyan snatched up the box all of a sudden. \u201cThat\u2019s no good. I bought the lemons, so I\u2019ll pick!\u201d\u201cWhy is it always you?!\u201d Pei Tingsong grew angry.Fang Juexia raised his hand and asked, \u201cIs there any punishment for failing?\u201dPei Tingsong covered Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth.\u201cWuwu\u2026\u201d[Hahahahahaha with every game segment comes the time for the serfs to turn on the group bully!][That moment he covered up his mouth was so alpha\u00a0ah~]\u201cLet go of Juexia!\u201d Ling Yi strenuously dragged Fang Juexia out of the other\u2019s grip.Jiang Miao said while laughing, \u201cHow\u2019s this\u00a0ba, the person who wins in the end will get a reward, but if someone loses, he will not be punished.\u201d After saying that, he then added, \u201cLest Xiao Pei is left with some lingering trauma.\u201dPei Tingsong covered his chest and confessed, \u201cI already have it, captain.\u201dHe Ziyan asked, \u201cReally, how many months has it been around for?\u201dLu Yuan added, \u201cWhose is it? Daddy will take you to beat it out!\u201d[Hahahahahahaha going crazy]In the car, after this burst of conversation, akin to chaotic chickens pecking each other, the game officially began. He Ziyan deliberately picked a thick slice of lemon for him. \u201cCome on, real men never frown while eating lemons.\u201dUnder heavy pressure, Pei Tingsong put the entire lemon slice into his mouth, and the results were obvious.He failed in being a real man.[Hahahahahaha this twisted expresion!][Screenshot it, what\u2019s going on, why is it frozen?!][ThisIsMeBeingJealous. JPG][Juexia just looked from the side and started frowning involuntarily hahahaha]Pei Tingsong hurriedly started rubbing his face against his own body, which is when Fang Juexia realized what was going on and handed him a napkin with good intentions, allowing him to spit the lemon out.With a drumroll, Ling Yi announced, \u201cOkay, Pei Tingsong, challenge failed!\u201dThey drew notes again and started up a new game, with Ling Yi, Lu Yuan, and He Ziyan participating in a laughter challenge this time. Seated up in the front, these people played merrily, with Jiang Miao using his iPad to show them the most popular funny video collections online, seeing who could hold his laughter to the end.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgFang Juexia, who had finished his task by letting the people draw tasks, began to fish around. He leaned forward and earnestly watched the small cellphone screen in front of him, wanting to see what everyone was saying.[Xiao Pei, weren\u2019t you so handsome when you ate cherries? How come when it\u2019s changed into lemons, you turn into a comedian hhhh][hahaha his main gong image was destroyed by a lemon!]Seeing this, Fang Juexia accidentally let out a laugh.Pei Tingsong turned toward him, originally wanting to appear a bit fierce, but that lemon had been so sour. \u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201dFang Juexia chuckled. This time he didn\u2019t shake his head as usual and say \u201cnothing\u201d, and instead looked at him and said, \u201cLaughing at you.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Pei Tingsong lowered his hat a little, looking just like a rebellious adolescent kid acting cool. Fang Juexia turned his head and looked out of the window, and because of that line in the barrage that made him laugh, he couldn\u2019t help but think of the magazine\u2019s promotional video.He suddenly turned his head. Pei Tingsong wasn\u2019t too far from him, so Fang Juexia whispered, \u201cWhen did you record it?\u201dPei Tingsong glanced at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cNothing\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia stopped talking for a while, and then asked, \u201cHow did you know how to speak Spanish?\u201d\u201cWhat are you two clucking and pecking away at behind our backs?\u201d The first one who had lost the laughter challenge, Lu Yuan, turned his head to look at them.At this moment, Fang Juexia had the feeling of being caught while doing bad things, and with it being so all of a sudden, he was a little flustered. \u201cAh? No\u2026.\u201d\u201cJuexia Ge asked me why I was so good at speaking Spanish.\u201d Pei Tingsong seemed to be in high spirits, for he suddenly sat up straight while also popping out his collar.[AHHHHHHHHH FLUFF IS HERE!][Xiao Pei, this stinky little kid!][What kind of an adorably cute showing-off expression is this\u00a0ah?! The youngest is really amazing!]Whoever posed the question like that? Fang Juexia died for no reason; this embellishment was too much.Ling Yi mimicked the gesture of carrying a microphone with his hand and propped it in front of Pei Tingsong. \u201cThen why don\u2019t you say why?\u201dPei Tingsong replied in English, \u201cBecause I am a genius.\u201dThe car was full of hissing noises.With this non-serious answer, everyone soon launched into a new crosstalk program. The car was still moving forward slowly, and the crowded traffic seemed to reflect Fang Juexia\u2019s blocked heart.All of a sudden, his cellphone vibrated several times.[Kaleido Pei Tingsong: The nanny who took care of me as a child was of Mexican origin.][Kaleido Pei Tingsong: When there was no one else in the house, I would secretly talk to her in Spanish.][Kaleido Pei Tingsong: Understood?]The car moved suddenly, and Fang Juexia\u2019s heart moved along with it. He kept staring at the three messages he had just received, not moving his fingers.Only after He Ziyan defeated everyone and became the champion of the \u201cExpressionless Challenge\u201d did Pei Tingsong, who was watching the competition and\u00a0eating melon\u00a0on the sidelines, feel his cellphone vibrate.[Just a pretty face: I can\u2019t imagine what you were like as a child.]He couldn\u2019t help laughing; Fang Juexia had held back for so long, only to come up with such a sentence.The CP fans in the barrage possessed very sharp eyes, and they just kept staring at the two people who seemed to have no interaction between them.[Since the game started, Juexia Gege has been looking at his cellphone. Are cellphones more fun than bandmates hahaha][Mr. Fang may be watching the livestream on his cellphone][Ahhhhhhh Two Fire is the best!][Mr. Yuan is too cute hahahahahaha still not managing to get back on his feet after this long][Xiao Pei just looked at his cellphone, and he even laughed!][Ahhhhh could it be that Xiao Pei and Juexia Gege are chatting secretly?!!!\u00a0Kswl\uff01][CP fans reel it in a bit\u00a0ba, forcing the idols to read this\u2026.][AHHHHHHH I DON\u2019T CARE! I\u2019LL SHIP IT AND STRIKE FIRST!]The group members were having a fun time, and didn\u2019t care much about keeping an eye on the barrage. By the time they did look at the comments carefully, the topic about the cellphones had already scrolled past. However, having just witnessed these two people\u2019s \u201cunusual\u201d behavior during the group game, it was inevitable that these magnifying-glass wearing TingJue girls would add a whole big scene onto it, write a small piece about it, make a post, and then spread it around as fluff.It was just that even those girls, who had gone crazy while shipping this, didn\u2019t know that this really was the case.Because Juexia hadn\u2019t participated this whole time, Ling Yi pulled him up again. \u201cWe\u2019re still stuck in traffic right now, so let\u2019s livestream some more, and Juexia will also come and play!\u201dLu Yuan clapped his hands and suggested, \u201cWe haven\u2019t played that game for a long time, the one where two people wear headphones, and while one describes something, the other one has to guess the word!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll play that one!\u201d Ling Yi nodded wildly, and started making notes so that everyone would draw the names of their partners.Pei Tingsong suddenly opened his mouth, \u201cDon\u2019t draw, if you keep doing this drawing thing, I\u2019m going to start drawing and quartering people.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019ll go with Fang Juexia.\u201dHe Ziyan uttered in a voice full of magnetism, \u201cWow.\u201d[This wow is very soulful hahahaha]Jiang Miao laughed. \u201cAlright\u00a0ah. Anyway, Xiao Pei was the first one to be eliminated last time, so it\u2019s perfect they play together\u00a0ba. Come on, put on the headphones.\u201dLu Yuan and Ling Yi contributed their noise-cancelling headphones. They chose some dance music, turned the volume up, and only after verifying that they couldn\u2019t hear any outside sounds did they put them on the two chosen people.[Want to see Two Fire write the prompts!!!][Seconded!]\u201cSatisfying you guys then.\u201d He Ziyan took out his cellphone and spoke, \u201cBut in view of our classmate Pei Tingsong\u2019s status of being a gaming black hole, it would be shameful of me to choose a word that\u2019s too hard.\u201d With that, he typed a word, handed it to Pei Tingsong to look at, and then raised it up for the barrage to see.It was \u201crapper\u201d.[Ah, this is so simple! Two Fire has shown mercy!][Two Fire showing mercy sounds so\u00a0strange\u00a0hahahaha][Don\u2019t worry, no matter how simple the prompt is, it will become extraordinary in Pei Tingsong\u2019s hands.]Pei Tingsong used his hands to flash an OK. After the timer started, he pointed to Fang Juexia before pointing to his own mouth and saying, \u201cRapper,\u201d he emphasized again, \u201cRapper!\u201dFang Juexia nodded his head earnestly and said, \u201cRare fur!\u201d[Hahahahaha what is rare fur?!]He didn\u2019t know what part of this was making Lu Yuan laugh, but since he was leaning back and laughing nonstop, Pei Tingsong understood that something must have gone wrong, so he said it again, making his movements slower and more obvious this time, and even added an explanation, \u201cEnglish, it\u2019s in English.\u201d\u201cEnglish\u00a0rare fur!\u201d Fang Juexia gave a firm answer again.[Hahahaha, how come this Ge is so serious and funny every time\u00a0ah]Pei Tingsong gave up; this prompt was more difficult than he had imagined, so now he tried to explain it in Chinese, \u201cHip-hop, hip\u2014hop\u2014\u201d He tried to emphasize the shape of his mouth when saying this, in order to make it more obvious.Fang Juexia\u2019s face showed a puzzled expression \u201cHip hip? Hip shop!\u201d His face showed a rare expression of excitement, and he quickly looked at He Ziyan and Jiang Miao as he asked, \u201cHip shop! Am I right?\u201dUpon seeing his confident expression, Pei Tingsong also thought that they had succeeded. \u201cYes!\u201d\u00a0 He stretched out his hand to high-five him, but it was caught by Lu Yuan. \u201cHey, hey, hey, you\u2019re still playing, and you want to high-five?\u201d[Hip shop hahahahaha][Putuo Temple Site is taking out a loan for a high five hahahaha][What kind of beautiful fool is Fine Jewelike Xeriscape!][Seriously, they are called TingJue because their\u00a0hearing\u00a0is bad\u00a0ba\u00a0x]He Ziyan used his fingers to form an X in front of him, thereby shattering little friend Fang Juexia\u2019s beautiful dream. Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth puckered up, and his recently-found happiness was cleanly swept away.Pei Tingsong realized that he hadn\u2019t guessed right, and the urge to win swept up in him again. \u201cHip! Hop!\u201d\u201cHa? Ha, what?\u201d Fang Juexia tried very hard to recognize his exaggerated expression.Ling Yi began to make trouble by interrupting, \u201cHa, Mount Ali\u2019s girls are as beautiful as pictures\u00a0ya~\u201dPei Tingsong took a deep breath, pointed to himself and said, \u201cI, what am I\u2026\u201d But before he could say the word \u2018position\u2019, Fang Juexia, who thought he was proficient at reading lips, stopped him.\u201cWhose mom am I?\u201d[Hahahahahahhahaha I\u2019m your mom!][Hahahahahahahahaha what kind of deafness is this!][Shit, I\u2019m going to start speaking passionately!

What am I? What is Pei Tingsong?\u201d[He\u2019s frantic he\u2019s frantic he\u2019s frantic he\u2019s frantic he\u2019s frantic!]Fang Juexia vaguely recognized some of the words out of the long string of words he had just uttered. \u201cHip\u2026.am, no, no\u2026.ah\u2026.\u201dJust when he was confused, Pei Tingsong pointed at himself crazily and gave him the last hint he needed.\u201cI see!\u201dFang Juexia suddenly realized something and looked at everyone with a smile.

Newly arrived friends, these people are actually the runner-up (not first due to insider plots) of a singing contest, a hip-hop dance champion, a real DJ, an excellent student of folk music, a student of P University, and a student of Beijing Normal University. Everyone, please believe me][Don\u2019t believe it, upstairs is a liar][Don\u2019t believe it, liar, liar, these are six crosstalk actors, and we\u2019re in talks with the\u00a0Happy Comedian\u00a0show][It\u2019s over, that theme song is already rolling around in my head]In the end, they finally failed at this game. Pei Tingsong, who had pinned all his hopes of a comeback on this one game, failed to get rid of his title of being a gaming black hole. Instead, he also managed to drag Fang Juexia into this black hole.Over the next few days, Kaleido had activity after activity and was so busy that their feet hardly touched the ground. They filmed two commercials, then flew to their senior brother group High Five\u2019s concert in Nanjing as VIP guests, which was followed by a charity fashion show and party.Apart from the true and false numbers online, the most direct manifestation of a group\u2019s popularity was the wave of people present for an airport meetup. Previously, Kaleido also naturally had fans organising airport meetups, but there weren\u2019t many people participating in them, so they had never walked through the VIP aisle before. To their surprise, when they caught their flight to Nanjing, the number of people who sent them off at the Beijing airport was really large\u2014the group members were crowded in by the fans so tightly that they nearly couldn\u2019t even move their legs to step forward.After great effort, when they finally got on the plane, Pei Tingsong went to sit by the window. Having worked hard for several days, the other members were very tired and went to sleep soon, but only he was left feeling sleepless.Glancing at Ling Yi, who was sleeping with his neck askew, Pei Tingsong opened his laptop and clicked on the FJX folder on his desktop. Inside it was Fang Juexia\u2019s demo, and he hadn\u2019t gotten the chance to properly listen to it until now.However, this demo was named in a very Fang Juexia style. It was just a string of dates and numbers, which was probably the time when the song had been completed.Putting on his earphones, Pei Tingsong clicked play.Surprisingly, there was no prelude in the beginning. The first second was just a short breath, quickly followed by Fang Juexia\u2019s voice. He didn\u2019t have any lyrics and was just humming. Ten seconds later, a soothing piano sound appeared. It didn\u2019t sound anything like a played sample or a synthesized sound, but sounded as if the person had recorded himself playing it.Fang Juexia\u2019s voice was very special\u2014 it was cold, and contained within it a real sense of space. Pei Tingsong closed his eyes, and it was as if he could see the person himself sitting in front of the piano, humming out this tune.The melody of the chorus part was very good, very catchy, and you only had to listen to it once to remember it. Although it was a flawed piece of work, Fang Juexia\u2019s aura was vividly displayed in this piece of music. Most ballads were connected to the subject of love, with most of them being associated with the sad themes of being frustrated and lovelorn, and it was rather easy to fall into a conventional pattern with such music.But Fang Juexia hadn\u2019t done so. He was an excellent singer, and the alienation and calmness in his voice were obvious from the start of the song, making it clear that his emotions were very restrained. Then, from the second time the chorus played, he deliberately increased his breath, and the ending notes lasted slightly longer than the previous times. In the end, even the sound of the piano exploded before finally stopping abruptly, and the song ended with his deep trembling breath.Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help but think of a common and sad opening line\u2014 \u201cI have a friend who has not had a good time lately.\u201dEvery single line of his, and every single pronunciation of a note, all of it seemed to be showing off some false bravado. He was telling you repeatedly that this was someone else\u2019s story and had nothing to do with him; he was just a poor narrator, who was unable to maintain his own state or disguise his own vulnerability. It wasn\u2019t until the end of the song that his emotions were on the verge of collapse and defeat.Pei Tingsong was really impressed.There were countless singers who possessed good singing skills, but what was rarer were those who could wield their skills almost invisibly, those excellent singers who could accomplish great tasks with subtle maneuvers.Being able to create a sense of narrative in a song without having any lyrics and just by humming along\u2014he finally understood why the company had to let Fang Juexia be a lead singer; even if he had many burdens and may cause doubts, they had insisted on it.But that was because Fang Juexia fully deserved this position.Pei Tingsong turned his head and looked at Fang Juexia, who was sitting in the back row. He was sleeping while resting his head against the back of the seat. He was also wearing a blue eye mask that he had received from his fans, and his skin looked so pale against it that it nearly shone.The demo continued to play through his headphones.Suddenly, Pei Tingsong had the urge to write some lyrics for him.When the plane landed, they were greeted by an even more exaggerated number of people than they had seen at the Beijing airport. Five out of the six members had fallen asleep on the plane, just leaving the somewhat calm youngest member. The company hadn\u2019t expected this many people and thus hadn\u2019t prepared enough bodyguards in advance, so both Cheng Qiang and Xiao Wen had to also come up to protect the group members after they disembarked.\u201cExcuse us, let us pass. Please let us get out first\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cExcuse me, move a little.\u201dWhenever Fang Juexia had some spare time, he would use it to practice some more, so he was very short on sleep. However, he didn\u2019t get better after sleeping on the plane, instead, he was suffering from a headache now. Many of the non-fan\u00a0proxy-photographers\u00a0in the crowd were squeezed together with big cameras in their hands, and their flashes were so strong that he was unable to open his eyes.Soon, fans started yelling, \u201cDon\u2019t turn on the flash!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t fight okay? Don\u2019t crowd them!\u201dSince everyone was squeezed together, a girl was accidentally pushed down by the people behind her and she fell against Fang Juexia. Fang Juexia immediately bent down to help her.\u201cYou okay?\u201dThere was chaos everywhere around them, so the little girl grabbed Fang Juexia\u2019s arm before coming to a firm stand. She nearly had tears coming out as she said, \u201cTh-Thank you, Juexia Gege.\u201d Unfortunately, other people were still crowding in, and before he knew it, the crowd had separated him from the rest of his group.With his name being shouted from every direction, and white light continuously flashing in front of his eyes, Fang Juexia\u2019s headache grew even more excruciating.\u201cJuexia Gege!\u201d\u201cFang Juexia, look here!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t push forward any more!\u201d\u201cJuexia Gege, how many days are you guys staying in Nanjing for?!\u201dSuddenly, his arm was caught. There was a figure in the crowd moving in the wrong direction, pushing aside the noisy waves of people, and coming towards him.\u201cAhhhhhh it\u2019s Pei Tingsong!\u201dBefore Fang Juexia could react, Pei Tingsong had already taken off his baseball cap and stuck it firmly on Fang Juexia\u2019s head. The brim of the hat was first lowered to cover the upper half of his face, after which Pei Tingsong pulled Fang Juexia to stand in front of him. Then, with one of Pei Tingsong\u2019s arms separating him from everyone else and the other supporting his shoulder, they both started walking forward.The drowning man, who had been caught in a huge wave, was suddenly rescued and dragged onto a boat.Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t say a word, his expressionless, sunglass-wearing face kept looking straight ahead, and he didn\u2019t release his grip on Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder the whole while.These two people, who had been left behind from the rest of the group, managed to escape after going through untold hardships and finally got into the van.As soon as the car door was opened, Cheng Qiang asked, \u201cIs Juexia okay? He isn\u2019t hurt\u00a0ba?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, it was a fan who had fallen down.\u201d Fang Juexia sat down, and Pei Tingsong followed him closely after. Only when he saw this person sitting down beside him did Fang Juexia take off his hat and hand it back to him.Pei Tingsong pushed his sunglasses up to the top of his head and said lightly, \u201cWear it\u00a0ba, you look pretty good in it.\u201dFang Juexia was a little confused. He was about to speak when Pei Tingsong opened his mouth again, and he heard\u2014\u201cAnyway, I still have some of your clothes.\u201dThe other group members all kicked up a fuss upon hearing this, which Pei Tingsong thought was just funny. It was like being back in middle school, when the class would kick up a fuss about the two people who had an ambiguous relationship.No, why did he even think of something like that?In order to ensure that that there would be no problems, Kaleido made it to their destination by noon and participated in the rehearsal with their senior brother group. While their senior brothers performed on the stage, these six people watched from below.It would be a lie to say that they weren\u2019t envious. Fang Juexia looked up at the huge stage, and when he saw his senior brothers performing with perfect tacit understanding between themselves, certain emotions surged up in his heart.\u201cWhen will we ever be able to have our very own concert\u00a0ah?\u201d Ling Yi sighed.Jiang Miao put his index finger against his lips and said, \u201cShh\u2026\u201d He Ziyan saw this, smiled, and took hold of Ling Yi\u2019s small shoulder. \u201cSoon, as long as we work hard enough.\u201dLu Yuan said with a smile, \u201cWhat are you worried about\u00a0ah,\u00a0Xiao Ling\u2019er, didn\u2019t you just have a solo at the T.V. station\u2019s end of the year party?\u201d With that, he winked at Pei Tingsong. The youngest member, who always liked to muddy the waters, quickly added, \u201cYeah, just now, the milk tea shop next to the stadium was playing the songs you sang for the TV series. Ling Ge is really popular. \u201cThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cThat\u2019s all because of the T.V. show\u2019s popularity.\u201d Ling Yi grabbed Fang Juexia\u2019s arm like he was grabbing a life-saving straw, and shook it back and forth while complaining, \u201cJuexia, they\u2019re all bullying me.\u201dLing Yi was making so much noise that it was hard for Juexia to hide his smile, but he didn\u2019t know how to help him. After thinking for a long time, he ended up asking, \u201cThen what should I do?\u201dAll of a sudden, everyone started laughing even harder, and only Ling Yi was left feeling angry, to the extent that he even wanted to stamp his feet.They laughed, but when they really started working, out of the six of them, none of them acted perfunctorily. Although they didn\u2019t have many performances, they rehearsed even more seriously than HighFive, whose concert it actually was. After going through their two songs over and over again, they were completely familiar with the choreography and positions which had been rearranged just 24 hours ago, and all the staff on the scene were full of praise.Once the concert officially started, the six members of Kaleido waited in the lounge backstage. Their senior brothers\u2019 performances were being shown on the broadcast screen, and everyone watched it seriously. Pei Tingsong had always been rather uninterested in the kind of singing and dancing done by idols, even if he was in this line of business now. However, when he looked at Fang Juexia, who was sitting at the other end, he found this person fully absorbed in the performance. The gorgeous visual effects being displayed on the screen were projected into his eyes, flashing across them. His pupils looked like beautiful glass beads that had a fire burning within them.He liked it that much?Fang Juexia was sitting on the sofa, but he couldn\u2019t help but follow along with the dance beats of the song. He was making very small movements, and he actually looked kind of cute while doing so.Right before they went on stage, they rehearsed once again just to be on the safe side.In their previous performances, Pei Tingsong would pretty much have no interaction with Fang Juexia on-stage. Even more so, as soon as they got off-stage, they would place themselves at opposite ends of the group; every time they went out, all the other Kaleido members would be inserted between them. Nowadays, as long as they appeared at a place at the same time, Cheng Qiang would start crazily dropping hints, reminding them even if they were just a little bit far away from one another, worrying that if they didn\u2019t conform to the rumors, trouble would get\u00a0stirred up again.But right now, Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help himself from looking over at Fang Juexia, especially at a time like this, when they were just practicing.Everyone gave off a different feel when they were dancing.Fang Juexia was 1.8 meters tall, with long hands and long feet, and was very eye-catching when dancing. His temperament on-stage was also cold, but was more freely aggressive than in private. \u201cThe Fang Juexia on-stage is the most alpha\u201d was a sentence most often said by fans.The company\u2019s dance teacher had said more than once that both Lu Yuan and Fang Juexia could dance, but they were different. Lu Yuan had hustled for his street-dancing skills, and on a technical level, even this teacher felt a bit guilty that he wasn\u2019t at his level, and the two of them asked each other for advice.In contrast, Fang Juexia was a born dancer. The true ability of a dancer was to be able to seize the audience\u2019s heart when on the stage. Juexia was able to pretty much completely crush this point. He possessed the best inborn qualities, a stage temperament that couldn\u2019t be copied, and an excellent appearance\u2014 all the talents that others couldn\u2019t achieve even after going through thousands of hours of training sessions. His limbs, his muscles, and even his shoulder blades, hidden and secretly rippling through the flesh of his back, all of it could dance.Pei Tingsong had regarded this kind of description as beneath contempt before, finding it to be too mysterious. However, now, only when he really put down his prejudice and looked properly, did he discover that he was really fascinated by him dancing. It held an uncontrollable gravitational pull on him.\u201cHey, hello!\u201dLing Yi\u2019s loud voice suddenly awakened the distracted Pei Tingsong. He followed the direction of Pei Tingsong\u2019s gaze and saw Fang Juexia, who was adjusting his microphone.\u201cOh! You were looking at Juexia!\u201dLing Yi\u2019s voice was so frighteningly piercing that as soon as he cried out, everyone turned around to look at them, including a blank-looking Fang Juexia himself.Pei Tingsong quickly disassociated himself from the situation. \u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not talking nonsense!\u201d Ling Yi really didn\u2019t let it go. \u201cYou were staring so hard just now that your eyes nearly froze, and when I was talking to you, you didn\u2019t even notice me!\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong glanced at Fang Juexia again and found that he had already turned his head away and wasn\u2019t looking over in their direction anymore. So, the words in his mouth changed, and he said, \u201cOkay, okay, okay, you are Yi Ge. Whatever you say is right.\u201dFang Juexia watched Pei Tingsong through the mirror and just saw him shrug and stop entangling with Ling Yi. He also didn\u2019t look at him again.Jiang Miao confirmed the time, \u201cIt should be our turn soon.\u201d\u201cTen minutes! Kaleido stand by!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dThe staff took them to the lift platform. Fang Juexia was walking at the very front, and he wasn\u2019t very fast, but pretty much kept sticking close to the staff around him. The lighting in the lift walkway couldn\u2019t be called bright, and there were ground pipelines crisscrossing the walkway as well, so it wasn\u2019t easy to traverse. The six of them arrived at their designated spot and stood according to their positions. Kaleido had an even number of members, so the choreography mostly adopted a double C position design\u2014 which usually meant there were two main dancers or the two aces in turn.There were two main dancers who would be starting off the performance this time, so Fang Juexia, and Lu Yuan, who was standing beside him, looked at each other and took a deep breath.\u201cDon\u2019t forget that you will return from here. The lights will flash on the stage floor.\u201d Under the cover of the chaos reigning underground, the staff member yelled into the walkie talkie, \u201cKaleido in place!\u201dTheir time on the stage was very short.From the moment the lift rose slowly to when Pei Tingsong stood shoulder to shoulder with him at the end of the performance, Fang Juexia felt that only one second, or even less, had passed. At this time, the little clock in his heart had been smashed by the infatuation he had for the stage, and had thus stopped functioning, all because he loved this place so much.All the things he liked possessed a very short shelf life.Looking at the vast array of light boards in the inky darkness spread out below the stage, which, in the blink of an eye, seemed to turn from the dazzling orange HighFive support light colour into the brilliant Klein Blue Kaleido support light colour. The people under the stage twirled the lights around in their hands, projecting magnificent and colorful shadows that belonged only to them.\u201cHello, everyone.\u201d Jiang Miao raised his head, and all the six people raised their left hands to make a sign, as he greeted, \u201cWe are Kaleido!\u201dEvery time he stood on the stage and said this sentence out loud with everyone, Fang Juexia felt that his flimsy life had gained some weight, along with feeling a sense of belonging.He loved the stage, and loved this group that had gone through all the highs and lows together with him.With their mission fulfilled, the six big boys of K rushed back to the initial lift platform located at the very back of the stage, where they stood and bowed to the stage hand-in-hand. The flashing light on the platform was akin to the second hand on a clock approaching 12 o\u2019clock in fairy tales, reminding everyone that time was up.As the lift slowly sank downwards, so did his nervously palpitating heart. Fang Juexia, who was completely spellbound, forgot to let go of the hand he was holding. He even forgot the identity of the person who was closest to him as one of the double C positions at the ending of the song, and whose hand he was tightly pulling at.His vision was getting dimmer and dimmer, while the staff members in the walkway below were still hastily shouting and coordinating things.\u201cHey.\u201dSuddenly, he heard a low voice. The next second, the hand that he was tightly holding onto lifted his own up high, and with his voice seemingly carrying a smile, he asked, \u201cHow long do you want to hold onto it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hey! Over there! Quickly move the props over here!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d\u201cIs this the prop?\u201dThe group members evacuated the platform one after another, and the noisy environment caused Fang Juexia\u2019s heart to quake violently in his chest.He had actually been holding Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand the entire time.Aware of this point, Fang Juexia hurriedly made his way off of the platform of the stage lift. Unexpectedly, he tripped over one of the numerous pipes on the ground and fell to the ground unprepared.\u201cHey, Fang Juexia, are you ok?\u201dHe could hear the concern carried in Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice, and he also realised through the increasing volume of his voice that Pei Tingsong was drawing closer to him, but Fang Juexia was currently a little flustered. Everything in his vision was fuzzy and dark, and his surroundings were chaotic.This isn\u2019t the first time\u2014 he tried to calm himself down while thinking this.Don\u2019t panic, don\u2019t panic. He reached out and fumbled around on the ground before managing to feel the pipe running in front of him, and then tried to get up carefully. After standing up steadily, Fang Juexia squinted. There were many dark shadows flashing back and forth in front of him, and he couldn\u2019t make out anything else.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Pei Tingsong immediately noticed that Fang Juexia didn\u2019t seem right and was behaving very strangely. Right now, he just looked like\u2026.The word that flashed unconsciously in his mind gave him a sudden pause.Pei Tingsong went up and caught hold of Fang Juexia\u2019s arm. \u201cDo you have night blindness?\u201dHe was also unaware of what was going on, but as soon as he asked that question, Pei Tingsong immediately thought back to that early morning insomnia incident, where Fang Juexia had accidentally knocked over that pile of books.How could they have been knocked over? Even if the lights were not turned on, the room wasn\u2019t completely dark.If he hadn\u2019t walked while supporting himself against the wall, he wouldn\u2019t have hit it.Yes.All those irrational details could now be explained.The situation when they had been locked up in the closet together came to his mind again. At that time, he had wanted to force Fang Juexia to look at him, but had only received one sentence in return\u2014[I can\u2019t see.]He hadn\u2019t lied; he really couldn\u2019t see.\u201cYes.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s tone while admitting to this was also extremely calm. His mood gradually became tranquil, although he still couldn\u2019t see his surroundings clearly.The other group members had already walked far away. The dark and crisscrossed passageway, coupled with the staff urging them forward, caused everyone to subconsciously only look in the direction ahead of them, and made it very difficult for them to notice that they had lost some people. Pei Tingsong was very surprised, and thinking back to the way Fang Juexia looked after he had fallen, he even started to inexplicably feel a bit angry. He couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say that you have night blindness?\u201dAs soon as he posed that question, he regretted it. With the cold relationship he had had with Fang Juexia for the past two years, how could this already icy cold person tell him about such a private matter? Even a fool would know that he would not say anything.The relationship between them had completely never reached the level of being frank and honest with each other.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Upon hearing the voice of another staff member come from behind him, Fang Juexia tried to break away from the grip Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand had on him and pretend that nothing had happened.This reaction of his gave Pei Tingsong a hint.\u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d Saying this, Pei Tingsong tightened his grip even further, and went to the extent of stretching out his other hand to wrap it around Fang Juexia\u2019s waist. \u201cHe came over to find something just now and tripped.\u00a0You\u2019re busy\u00a0ba, I\u2019ll help him back.\u201d\u201cReally? Be careful\u00a0ah, it\u2019s a bit messy down here.\u201dAfter seeing the staff member leave, Pei Tingsong, who was now completely supporting Fang Juexia, drew close to his ear and in a lowered voice, asked\u2014\u201cSo reluctant to ask me for help?\u201dAs the warm breath drifted across his face, Fang Juexia smiled bitterly in the dark.Since he had anticipated that Fang Juexia wouldn\u2019t say anything more, Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t expect any response. He simply continued supporting Fang Juexia as they moved forward step-by-step, letting him know in a soft voice when to avoid all kinds of obstacles. Just when he thought that this guy had finally put down his hard shell and compromised to move slowly forward in this darkness , Pei Tingsong suddenly heard his voice.\u201cIt\u2019s so strange.\u201dTheir steps paused one after the other.\u201cWhy is it you every time?\u201dA brief silence fell between them.Fang Juexia\u2019s smile looked bleak. Perhaps Pei Tingsong also felt that he was an unlucky star, getting forced into binding himself to him, and then running into him just when he was being menaced by a hidden rules situation. Even the night blindness problem that he had been keeping well-hidden this entire time had been exposed to Pei Tingsong.Why? Plainly he\u2019d been able to hide this fact well every single time prior to this incident, to the point that he was already used to the dark.If, just now, he had still been holding onto that other hand tightly and had not let go of it\u2026.He traced the illusory path of choices offered by this butterfly effect, all the way until his train of thought was broken by Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice.\u201cMaybe I spoke too presumptuously on that phone call last time, saying that you and I are bound together.\u201d\u201cAs soon as God heard this, he really tied you and me together.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice carried a hint of a smile as he stated, \u201cMaybe God also ships our CP.\u201dFang Juexia was stunned by this sudden statement.What God or not\u2026.\u201cDon\u2019t joke around.\u201d He still tried to escape from Pei Tingsong\u2019s grip on his hands, but the hand wrapped around his waist gripped tighter and tighter instead, and his tone was serious as he said, \u201cNot joking around. I do usually really like to tease you, but I also have a bottom line.\u201dFang Juexia glanced at him. \u201cYour bottom line exists somewhere in the\u00a0third quadrant\u00a0of a graph.\u201dWhen he heard this, Pei Tingsong was stunned at first, and then he burst out laughing, like a high school student.Fang Juexia\u2019s ears were filled with Pei Tingsong\u2019s bright laughter. It was strange to say, but it felt like his tension simmering in him seemed to have suddenly been relieved.Thinking with his emotional side, he even began to consider taking a chance. Maybe he could really trust this demon-in-human-shape, with whom he had just repaired the broken relationship between them, even letting him know his biggest secret.But his reason admonished him to not so easily give up what he had held onto for such a long time.If he knew it, then he knew it ba\u2014Fang Juexia comforted himself. In any case, it had always been his rule in life to be content with whatever happened to him.Under these circumstances, he more and more couldn\u2019t learn how to calmly consider things.\u201cIf it\u2019s in the third quadrant, then it\u2019s in the third quadrant\u00a0ba.\u201d Pei Tingsong tilted his head at him and said, \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing.\u201dWith his support, Fang Juexia kept moving forward bit by bit. From time to time, his toes would bump into a pipe on the ground, and then he stumbled and tripped, just like the way he had fumbled and groped around in the darkness surrounding his path these past few years.Pei Tingsong\u2019s body temperature was very high, and his arms were wrapped around Fang Juexia\u2019s back in order to support his entire person, so Fang Juexia was being heated up and he started to feel a bit uneasy. In the dark, he heard Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice ask, \u201cYou\u2026really can\u2019t see anything at all?\u201d He quickly added, \u201cI mean, after things get dark.\u201dHe had very seldomly heard Pei Tingsong talk so hesitantly, in such a manner. This boy, who was three years younger than himself, was always determined and ostentatious, as though there was nothing in life he was afraid of.\u201cBasically.\u201d Fang Juexia added a relatively accurate figure. \u201c80 percent.\u201dPei Tingsong nodded and repeated his words in a low voice, \u201c80 percent\u2026\u201dThe narrow walkway compressed the surrounding air into a slow flowing viscous fluid. Fang Juexia felt a weak breeze in front of his face, making it seem as if the trajectory of the fluid had changed.He raised his hand and reached out into the darkness.Pei Tingsong was stunned, and his footsteps stopped right then and there. He had just stretched his hand out in front of Fang Juexia\u2019s face and waved it in front of him a bit, but Fang Juexia had caught him just like that.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you can\u2019t see?\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s tone was a bit surprised and accidentally sounded a little childish as well, just like that of a little kid who got caught doing bad things.Once again, a smile appeared at the corner of Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth.\u201cI really can\u2019t see,\u201d he said, releasing Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand. \u201cBut I do have powers of foresight.\u201dPei Tingsong let go and also laughed.Fang Juexia was indeed much smarter than he had thought.He pulled Fang Juexia forward and asked, \u201cSo, have you been hiding for so long by relying on your powers of foresight?\u201dWithout waiting for Fang Juexia to answer, Pei Tingsong asked, \u201cWhy do you want to hide it from everyone? It\u2019s not a very special disorder, and it doesn\u2019t affect other people.\u201dFang Juexia knew that he would not understand, and that was very normal.He could only explain to him by using his own experience as an example.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cI learned dance, both folk dance and modern dance, for a while as a child. When I was seven years old, my mom took me to the Guangzhou\u00a0Junior Dance Troupe\u00a0to take part in the selection process for their seeded dancers. At that time, all the adults told me that I was the child with the best conditions and would definitely be selected.\u201dSuch narration in the beginning always implied that the inverse of it would take place.\u201cFor the last assessment, we went onto a real stage, which wasn\u2019t quite the same as the prior assessments. It was very big, very dark, with only one spotlight.\u201dPei Tingsong understood the situation soon enough; he could pretty much see the events of that scene in front of his eyes.A little boy, confused and helpless, standing on a dark stage.\u201cYou\u2026.didn\u2019t get picked?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s tone was rather flat, as if nothing had happened. He walked forward step by step as he continued, \u201cI tried my best, but I still fell off the stage and even broke my left leg. Only after I went to the hospital that time did everyone realise that I have night blindness.\u201d\u201cYou were very disappointed back then\u00a0ba?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked.\u201cNo actually. As soon as I woke up, I asked my mama what the results were. She told me they would send me a message later. After that, there was no such thing.\u201d The corners of Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth helplessly hooked up. \u201cMaybe the adults thought that children don\u2019t remember things, and after a period of time passed, they\u2019d forget. But I have a very good memory. I ate very seriously, recuperated, and was very obedient, thinking that as long as my legs got better, I could join the dance troupe and could become a dancer.\u201dIn the dim light, Pei Tingsong looked at him. There wasn\u2019t much expression on his delicate face, and he really didn\u2019t look like a person who was recalling their past regrets. However, this was Fang Juexia, and all this became reasonable.But when he listened to his story, his mind even came up with the image of a child obediently and cleverly recuperating.When he was a child\u2026.he should have been very good-looking then too\u00a0ba.\u201cAnd then?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked.\u201cThere was no \u2018and then\u2019,\u201d Fang Juexia said coldly, \u201cMy\u00a0grandfather\u00a0told me about the night blindness, so what else could I expect. How could a person with a high probability of going blind on the stage become a dancer?\u201dPei Tingsong knew that he should comfort him at this time, but he didn\u2019t know how to comfort him, and all of a sudden, he even started to fumble his words. He could only sigh and say from his heart, \u201cWhat a pity.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a pity.\u201d Fang Juexia said, \u201cAfterwards, I accidentally heard the adults talking, and only then did I know that even if I didn\u2019t have night blindness, I wouldn\u2019t have been selected.\u201dPei Tingsong didn\u2019t understand and asked, \u201cWhy?\u201dFang Juexia turned his head, glanced at Pei Tingsong through the darkness, raised his finger, and pointed to the corner of his eye as he replied, \u201cBecause of this.\u201d\u201cA dancer can\u2019t have any obvious marks on their face.\u201dUnlike idols, they didn\u2019t need to be recognized.\u2014No matter how beautiful they were.With just this glance of his, Pei Tingsong\u2019s mood was shaken. He didn\u2019t know what to say, so he just supported him through the last small dark passageway in silence.Their stages also weren\u2019t completely illuminated, but most of them did have lights. He couldn\u2019t imagine how Fang Juexia managed to never make a single mistake, so that no one could find out that he was different.Pei Tingsong remembered that when he first entered the company, the first internal legend he had heard was about Fang Juexia. Everyone had said, \u201cDon\u2019t look down upon how StarChart is a small company, there is a trainee practice god inside.\u201dThe amount of Fang Juexia\u2019s negative news was directly proportional to his well-known level of hard work. Everyone knew that he pretty much lived in the practice room. No matter when you went to the company\u2019s practice room, you would definitely find him, and he would definitely be dancing in there.At that time, Pei Tingsong had just felt that all of these things were exaggerated. He didn\u2019t understand why a person, who everyone defined as possessing rare natural talent, should basically utilise basically the intensity of self mutilation to force himself to get better.Now he understood.In terms of pursuing his dreams, he counted as being a person who had already failed once.He finally understood why Fang Juexia was moved by the opening of that documentary.No matter in which sense it was, he was in the dark. And in that dark little house, Fang Juexia totally had no way out.The end of the passage led to the lobby underneath the stage. With the gradually increasing light, Fang Juexia consciously, and slowly, retreated to a safe distance from Pei Tingsong. It was as if he stepped out of the deep sea, and was dragging behind him a trail of heavy footsteps as he returned to dry land.\u201cYou\u2019re not afraid that maybe one day you\u2019ll fall off the stage, just like how you did when you were a child?\u201dHearing Pei Tingsong\u2019s question, Fang Juexia calmly and confidently said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid. So I have to ensure that every move I make is so accurate that there is not a single deviation in terms of distance on the stage.\u201dJust as he said this, the dim yellow light hit his face, lengthening the shadow of his eyelashes, making them flutter across his cheeks like butterflies.\u201cThe fault tolerance rate in this circle is close to zero, but unfortunately, I was born with the wrong mark, and I was also born as a person who tends to make mistakes.\u201dHe showed Pei Tingsong a cool smile. \u201cI can only work hard to try and pretend that I won\u2019t make any mistakes.\u201d\u201cJuexia! Xiao Pei!\u201dCheng Qiang came running over to them from not far away, and he was panting, as if he had been looking for them for a long time. His appearance interrupted Fang Juexia\u2019s self analysis, and he gathered up his emotions before facing Cheng Qiang.He also didn\u2019t really understand why he would say so much to Pei Tingsong; he didn\u2019t understand it every time this happened.He thought, perhaps Pei Tingsong also felt very puzzled by this, because what reason was there for him to have to listen to all this stuff about his past, and even his heartfelt thoughts on top of it all? Would Pei Tingsong see this as some kind of ploy to ingratiate himself to him by showing weakness? It was a bit like those contestants on talent shows who tearfully spilled their tragic pasts to everyone, using their deceitful tears to enrich their own characters.What would Pei Tingsong think of him?\u201cWhat are you two doing? I\u2019ve been searching for you guys in circles.\u201d As Cheng Qiang got closer and closer, Fang Juexia considered whether to use the excuse Pei Tingsong had just used to get rid of that staff member. Unexpectedly, he suddenly heard the person beside him speak up.\u201cI have one last question for you.\u201dHe looked at Pei Tingsong, a bit puzzled.Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes were very sincere as he asked, \u201cHow many other people know your secret?\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple rolled as he stared at the person in front of him. But, as though feeling that there wasn\u2019t enough time, Pei Tingsong quickly changed his words before Cheng Qiang could arrive, \u201cForget it, let me go again.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s slightly raised eyebrows indicated his doubts.\u201cI\u2019ll go again and say one last thing.\u201dThat young face, which always failed to show any restraint, looked at him, and there was a soft light shining in the depths of his eyes.\u201cYour birthmark isn\u2019t a wrong mark. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was as if he was stuck in slow-mo, stopping at Pei Tingsong\u2019s last sentence repeatedly, echoing that scene again and again.Pei Tingsong woke up, and it seemed inconceivable that\u00a0 he had just blurted out such words. Exactly how possessed had he been to say something like that to Fang Juexia? He had completely lost his head.He couldn\u2019t figure out his motive for saying something like this at all.\u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d Cheng Qiang asked as he ran over to them, then bent and panted for breath.Fang Juexia lowered his head immediately and took a deep breath. Pei Tingsong opened his mouth and explained, \u201cHe just sprained his foot when coming off the platform, and I helped him in walking over here.\u201d\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Cheng Qiang asked him in a hurried tone, \u201cIs it serious? There\u2019s a doctor backstage, I\u2019ll take you there to get it looked at.\u201dFang Juexia shook his head. \u201cNo need\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Seeing that the base of his ears were completely red, Cheng Qiang felt something was wrong, so he asked, \u201cHow did you suddenly trip? Did you catch a cold during the photoshoot a few days ago, do you have a fever?\u201d He was about to stretch out his hand, but Fang Juexia avoided it. \u201cIt\u2019s really okay. No injuries, and no cold.\u201dSaying that, he walked towards the elevator located in the underground lobby, leaving Pei Tingsong and Cheng Qiang to look at each other.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Cheng Qiang looked back at Pei Tingsong and asked, \u201cKid, are you bullying Juexia again?\u201dPei Tingsong felt wronged to death, but couldn\u2019t explain things clearly, so he just complained, \u201cWhy is it that I\u2019m the one bullying him? You are so unjust. Be careful, or else I\u2019ll quit and not do this anymore.\u201d Saying that, he also ran away.The underground lobby also didn\u2019t have good lighting, and he was still a bit worried about Fang Juexia, so he pretended to get angry and then chase after him.\u201cHey, it\u2019s not that, you\u2026\u201d Cheng Qiang, who was left behind, wiped off a full forehead\u2019s worth of sweat and kept repeating to himself, \u201cHoly crap, my job here isn\u2019t easy. I have to provide for six Buddhas all at once.\u201dFang Juexia walked forward step-by-step. Ever since he was little, his steps seemed to be measured, and each step was very accurate. He was a person with\u00a0rules\u00a0in his heart, and he had a very low error acceptance rate.But, at this moment, he felt something disturbing his emotions, something that made his heart quake and caused his steps to become flustered.His gaze fell on the long shadow on the ground that was getting closer and closer to himself.He pressed the up button to call for the elevator and stared at the glowing floor numbers.\u201cHey, are you alright?\u201d His voice was very close by.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t open his mouth until he felt Pei Tingsong come to a stop right next to him. He didn\u2019t look sideways, just kept staring straight ahead.\u201cAmong all the people you know, there is no one else.\u201dPei Tingsong was a bit distracted, and it took him a few seconds to understand what was being said. Fang Juexia had actually given him the answer to the first question that he had taken back, which Pei Tingsong had never imagined he would do.With a\u00a0ding, the elevator door opened. Fang Juexia walked in first and then turned to face Pei Tingsong and looked up at him. His eyes were still clear and smooth.Pei Tingsong\u2019s throat rolled up and down, and he asked somewhat doubtfully, \u201cWhat about Ling Yi? And Qiang Ge, do they know?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t believe Fang Juexia\u2019s words, but that he thought it wasn\u2019t quite possible. He was the only one? How?The second hand of his internal clock ticked forward, leaping forward into the abyss under the tightrope stretched out over it. Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes went across the lines of his shoulder and caught sight of Cheng Qiang, who was about to be upon them. His voice was calm and firm as he asserted\u2014\u201cThere\u2019s only you.\u201dA subtle feeling would appear once a person had been designated as \u201cone of a few.\u201dPei Tingsong was holding a secret in his hand.Or maybe, he was caught in the grip of a beautiful secret.A hand landed on the dazed Pei Tingsong\u2019s shoulder, and a voice spoke up, \u201cGo in\u00a0ah, why are you frozen here\u00a0ma?\u201d The huge stage elevator was very empty, while Cheng Qiang chattered on, \u201cGo up now, hurry up and change your clothes and take off your makeup. They should be nearly done.\u201dFang Juexia raised his eyes with his head half-lowered, catching sight of Pei Tingsong\u2019s face being reflected in the mirrored wall of the elevator. He was also staring back at him. In fact, Fang Juexia was also slightly regretting just going ahead and answering the question Pei Tingsong had already taken back, but he had just wanted to do so at that moment.Sure enough, under the catalysis of a tense atmosphere, people would take unexpected actions.He saw the red birthmark at the corner of his eye being reflected in the mirrored doors, and irresistibly recalled Pei Tingsong\u2019s \u201clast sentence.\u201dThe frequency of his heartbeat once again exceeded its normal range, and Fang Juexia had to take a deep breath to try and correct this physical error.Everyone had their own set of rules of conduct.Fang Juexia\u2019s rules were a two-way chain: On the basis of a specific paradigm unique to him, he would try to avoid mistakes that could possibly take place and would head towards his established goal step-by-step; every time there was any mistake encountered on this path, he would reverse-trace his steps, to track where the mistake happened. It was just like discovering that the result was wrong after solving a math problem, he would then start deriving the solution backwards, going step-by-step, until he figured out the key step in which the mistake had occurred. This was his method of self-reflection.The elevator stopped. Fang Juexia looked up and caught sight of the other person reflected in the mirror.Since the start of the fanservice, every time he tacked back and derived which key step the issue had occurred at, it always ended up being Pei Tingsong.This person did as he pleased, which made Fang Juexia feel completely uncertain about him, and so, every move of his thus became a trigger for error.\u201cGo\u00a0ba, go and clean up.\u201dThey would take part in activities in Shanghai the following day, and the charity party would also be held in Shanghai. After the concert, they flew over to Shanghai with their senior brothers and stayed in a hotel. In the past, whenever they stayed in a hotel, they would divide the rooms between themselves quite casually, with the only principle being that Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia had to be kept separated.But this time, Cheng Qiang just started handing out the key cards while in the hotel elevator.\u201cEveryone is on the same floor, and so are your senior brothers. Here, this is Ziyan and Ling Yi.\u201d He gave the room card to He Ziyan, and then turned to Jiang Miao and said, \u201cMiaomiao and Lu Yuan are also in one.\u201dThe last room card was naturally handed over to Fang Juexia.\u201cTake it, yours and Xiao Pei\u2019s.\u201dFang Juexia took the room card. Although the expression on his face remained unchanged, he felt a little flustered inside. After all, they had never stayed in the same room in the course of the past two years. In addition, he hadn\u2019t even uttered a word about the episode after leaving the performance to Pei Tingsong while they were on the plane.But now, they were going to spend the night together in the same room.Their other group members had already started to quip and joke around, with Lu Yuan knocking his shoulder into Pei Tingsong\u2019s, who was still listening to music and was completely unaware about what was happening. \u201cAiya, what a joyful day today is.\u201dPei Tingsong took off his earphones with a completely confused expression. \u201cWhat?\u201dLing Yi began to swing his arms around and complained teasingly, \u201cI\u2019m not okay with this, I want to sleep with Juexia!\u201dHe Ziyan fished Ling Yi over and rubbed his hair. \u201cFire Ge doesn\u2019t smell good? Huh?\u201dJiang Miao explained the entire situation to their youngest, who was still muddled. \u201cQiang Ge said you and Fang Juexia will sleep in the same room tonight.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Pei Tingsong had a completely shocked expression on his face now, and he stared at Cheng Qiang as if asking him if he made a mistake.Cheng Qiang glanced at him and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, you\u2019re even being reluctant\u00a0ah? Juexia is even the one who is the most well-behaved and quiet when sleeping out of all of you. It\u2019s a good deal for you, kid. Listen to me. I have the final say.\u201dWhen the elevator door opened, everyone pushed and shoved to get out, pushing Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia together. Pei Tingsong subconsciously held onto him, before the two of them quickly separated.\u201cI\u2019m so tired! I want to take a bath first!\u201d\u201cNo one\u2019s fighting you for it.\u201d\u201cStrong Ge, when the company makes money, can I stay in the presidential suite once?\u201d\u201cIf the company makes money, it\u2019s me, Strong Ge, who will be staying in the presidential suite first.\u201dEveryone entered their own rooms one by one, leaving only Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia behind, for their room was the furthest into the corridor.The atmosphere in the corridor suddenly quieted down, and it seemed as if the silent air was compressing and squeezing them together. Even their breaths would accidentally bump into each other, so both of them were taking the greatest amount of care in keeping a distance.Fang Juexia took the room card and opened the door. The room was no different from the many hotel rooms he had stayed in before, with floor to ceiling windows and two large beds.Logically speaking, there was nothing different, but Fang Juexia\u2019s palms still began to sweat. \u201cWhich side do you want to sleep on?\u201d\u201cEither is fine.\u201d Pei Tingsong looked at where the bathroom was located and pushed his suitcase over to the bed by the window as he stated, \u201cI\u2019ll sleep here\u00a0ba.\u201dThe bed he had left free was also on the side Fang Juexia preferred to sleep in. Fang Juexia let out a soft \u201cokay\u201d while putting his luggage in its place.\u201cDo you want to wash first or\u2026\u201d / \u201cWould you like to take a bath first?\u201dThe two people tacitly started talking at the same time, and also went quiet at the same time.Pei Tingsong had never experienced such an awkward moment before; he was clearly not such a courteous person, and ordinarily, he should be saying and doing whatever he felt like, but right now, it really felt like someone had some kind of hold over him.It was too strange when it was obvious that the opposite of this was true.He scratched his head. \u201cYou go first\u00a0ba. I\u2019ll look for my clothes.\u201d With that, Pei Tingsong sat cross legged on the carpet, his back facing Fang Juexia as he opened his suitcase. Fang Juexia accepted his proposal and went into the bathroom on his own. However, only after he began to wash did he realize that the bathroom was translucent, covered by frosted glass on all sides, through which the people inside could be seen faintly.He finally knew why Pei Tingsong had turned his back to the bathroom earlier, even before he had entered it.The temperature in the bathroom was too high, and the sweltering steam that billowed out made Fang Juexia feel dizzy. The water splashed over his head, and he lowered his head while supporting himself with his hands against the wall. His mind was currently filled with that scene that took place under the platform. He tried very hard not to think about it, but his brain seemed to be going firmly against him.He had said he needed to sort out his clothes, but Pei Tingsong actually hadn\u2019t brought much clothing. His back was to the bathroom, but the small glass bathroom was being reflected on the glass of the floor-to-ceiling windows. Such a scene, when reflected on top of Shanghai\u2019s bustling nightlife, was like Pandora\u2019s Box.A door suddenly opened in the corridor, and then came\u00a0 loud knocks on their room door. Pei Tingsong yelled, \u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cXiao Pei, quickly open the door!\u201dOnly upon hearing Ling Yi\u2019s voice did Pei Tingsong get up and rush to the door. Him catching sight of a tall and thin figure, made indistinct by the frosted glass and curling steam, was inevitable.\u201cWhy?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked through the door.He heard Lu Yuan\u2019s voice next. \u201cSomething\u2019s come up, quickly open up.\u201dExactly how many of them had come over? Pei Tingsong opened the door, and all of them tried to clatter their way inside, looking just like a bunch of puppies scrambling after dog food was laid out. He immediately leaned against the door, his arm blocking them from going further, and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on\u00a0ma?\u201d He then noticed Ling Yi\u2019s cellphone in his hand currently filming him. \u201cYi Ge, what\u2019s up with you this time?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m livestreaming\u00a0ah.\u201d Saying that, Ling Yi changed the camera view to selfie mode, turned around and after getting everyone into the camera lens, said, \u201cXiao Pei, quickly\u00a0say hi\u00a0to everyone!\u201d\u201cEh, it seems it\u2019s a little stuck.\u201d\u201cThe network here isn\u2019t good\u00a0ba, it froze.\u201dLivestreaming???Fang Juexia was still taking a bath inside; if he really let them in to film the bathroom, how terrible would that be?Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t even say anything before preparing to close the door, but He Ziyan and Lu Yuan seized his arm. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? Being all sneaky and furtive.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s being sneaky and furtive?!\u201d He deliberately replied in a very loud voice, hoping that Fang Juexia would hear a little bit from inside the bathroom, \u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the night; even if you guys aren\u2019t sleeping, I want to go sleep.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s definitely something fishy going on.\u201d Lu Yuan and He Ziyan geared up to break through the door and were already rushing up towards Pei Tingsong, who was still providing some last ditch defense, until suddenly, a cold voice appeared from behind him.\u201cYou guys\u2026.What are you doing?\u201dPei Tingsong abruptly turned his head around.He actually came out?!\u201cCough.\u201d Pei Tingsong guiltily cleared his throat, and loosened his arm that had been defending him. \u201cNothing, they want to livestream.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still stuck.\u201d Ling Yi couldn\u2019t stand the Internet speed and simply closed the livestream. \u201cYo, now you\u2019re actually letting us in. So weird, Pei Little Six.\u201dFang Juexia still had a towel on his head. He had changed into a pair of comfortable and spacious pajamas, and he was still steaming slightly, with his skin glowing red.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgHe Ziyan opened his mouth and asked, \u201cSansan said that we can go over to his room to have fun, are you coming or not?\u201dSansan\u00a0was their senior brother, Shang Sirui. He was also, previously, the most popular artist in Star Chart, and after he had appeared on the show \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019, he had become even more popular. When Fang Juexia was still a trainee, Shang Sirui had often helped him, and he was a very lively and optimistic person.\u201cEn.\u201d Fang Juexia nodded with a smile. After wiping his hair, he placed the towel back in the bathroom and followed everyone to Shang Sirui\u2019s room.Shang Sirui\u2019s door was half-closed, and he was just staying there alone. As soon as he heard the sound of footsteps, he immediately ran over and stuck his head out to take a look. Upon seeing his Didis, he opened the door immediately and greeted, \u201cYou guys came.\u201d He specially pulled on Fang Juexia\u2019s arm. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t coming, but it turns out you were taking a bath. You move so fast?\u201d\u201cEn, took a bath as soon as I got to the room.\u201d Fang Juexia naturally followed Shang Sirui into the room, with a smile on his face.Maybe it was because Fang Juexia was too good-looking when he smiled, but Pei Tingsong, who was following behind him, actually started to feel uncomfortable.He had done so much for him. He had concealed secrets for him, had come up with\u00a0ridiculous excuses\u00a0for him, and had held off these whelps for him, but Fang Juexia was doing just great, grinning happily at someone else.There was a heap of food laid out on the carpet behind Shang Sirui\u2019s bed. \u201cI\u2019m telling you guys, this was all secretly ordered by Gege here. Definitely don\u2019t tell Qiang Ge, or he\u2019ll say again that I\u2019ve led you all astray.\u201dLing Yi shrieked, \u201cAh, there\u2019s\u00a0maocai! I love maocai!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s even\u00a0double cooked pork!\u201d Lu Yuan also grew excited and exclaimed, \u201cLet\u2019s\u00a0start eating!\u201d\u201cI know Juexia can\u2019t eat spicy food.\u201d Shang Sirui took out several other lunch boxes and said, \u201cLook, I ordered a lot of dim sum, and there\u2019s the Japanese food Miaomiao likes to eat, and Ziyan\u2019s favorite barbecue, it\u2019s all here.\u201dFang Juexia smiled at him again. \u201cThank you.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s eyes were entirely pinned on Fang Juexia, not even seeing the chopsticks Jiang Miao held out towards him. His gaze remained focused until Shang Sirui handed him a lunch box. \u201cXiao Pei? I ordered pizza for you, you should love eating it!\u201d\u201cAh, thank you,\u00a0shixiong.\u201d With complicated emotions, he took the pizza, feeling a little ashamed for the direction his stray thoughts had wandered to.\u201cYou\u2019ve all been working hard, practicing so long for our concert.\u201d Shang Sirui divided up the food between everyone and then ran to lock the door. \u201cOriginally, the other members were also coming, but they started playing video games, and they\u2019ve gotten into it in full swing over there, so let us all eat first. They have been busy with concerts recently, so it\u2019s been a long time since they got time to play a few matches.\u201dFang Juexia took a shrimp dumpling and stuffed it into his mouth. When he looked up, he caught sight of Pei Tingsong, who now had some sauce on his mouth.Every time he stared at Pei Tingsong, the other party would immediately stare back at him. Fang Juexia pointed to the corner of his own mouth with his finger, but Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t know what was going on. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your mouth?\u201dHe helplessly lowered his head and pulled out a napkin. \u201cYou have sauce on your mouth.\u201d\u201cAiya, you wipe it for your Didi\u00a0ma.\u201d With the door locked, Shang Sirui had once again taken a seat next to Fang Juexia, and now he grabbed Fang Juexia\u2019s arm, and pulled his hand directly up to Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth, wiping away that bit of sauce.\u201cNow that\u2019s right. Band members have to be deeply attached to each other, understood?\u201d Shang Sirui put on the appearance of being an old Da Ge as he took out a bottle of alcohol from beneath the bed. \u201cThis came with the Japanese food, let\u2019s each take a sip.\u201dHe Ziyan said with a smile, \u201cYou really deserve to be called drunkard Sansan; I was just saying that something was missing.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t drink too much,\u201d Jiang Miao said, \u201cWe still have activities to do tomorrow morning.\u201dLu Yuan chimed in, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, everyone\u2019s drinking capacity is pretty good, so such a tiny amount won\u2019t be a problem. Also, even Xiao Pei is an adult now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been an adult for a long time,\u201d Pei Tingsong hurried to clear his name as he declared, \u201cI just had another birthday, so I\u2019m already 20 now.\u201d\u201c20\u00a0ah, that\u2019s great.\u201d Shang Sirui poured out the alcohol and began to clap. \u201cYou\u2019ll never be an age starting with 1 anymore.\u201dFang Juexia couldn\u2019t help laughing and accidentally grew distracted. He automatically took the alcohol that Shang Sirui offered to him and drank it all in one gulp.He hardly drank alcohol. In the past, whenever he went out to dinner with everyone, there would often be underage trainees who would also avoid drinking, so he didn\u2019t really know what his capacity for alcohol was. Upon taking a gulp like that, he started choking and coughing.Jiang Miao handed him a napkin and advised, \u201cSlow down, no need to choke, eat something and suppress it.\u201dLu Yuan took hold of his shoulder and said, \u201cJuexia is pretty capable\u00a0ah,\u00a0gulping it down like that, he\u2019s worthy of being half a Shandong man.\u201dFang Juexia stuffed a\u00a0custard bun\u00a0into his mouth, trying to suppress the pungent fumes of the alcohol. He had just stuffed his cheeks to the brim when he looked up and saw Pei Tingsong suppressing a smile. He finally understood why Pei Tingsong would ask him what he was laughing at every time; if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he couldn\u2019t open his mouth right now, he would ask that question too.Chewing the custard bun in his mouth, Fang Juexia quietly listened to everyone chatting away. Shang Sirui had a high drinking capacity, and he drank most of the bottle by himself without any trouble.Ling Yi thought of something. \u201cHey, Sansan, are you going to start filming the program soon? When will the second season of \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019 come out\u00a0ah?\u201dShang Sirui waved his hand and answered, \u201cDon\u2019t mention it. They said we were going to start filming, but last season, there was a girl, you guys remember\u00a0ba, she got married in a flash, and now she\u2019s on an international honeymoon, and so we can\u2019t film.\u201dJiang Miao nodded. \u201cAh, it\u2019s hard to do that when missing a person.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just one.\u201d Shang Sirui explained further, \u201cThe program group is changing, and they might add some more people. It\u2019s not easy to invite guests in the first place, and you guys know the difficulty level of this program.\u201d He coughed and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t tell other people\u00a0ah,\u00a0but there is a pretty popular celebrity, and their group contacted the program group. Of course, the program group didn\u2019t refuse them, but this celebrity group also made a request.\u201dPei Tingsong, who was listening to all this, guessed the rest, \u201cHe was asking them to reduce the difficulty\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Shang Sirui nodded repeatedly and continued, \u201cMoreover, he also asked for his script to be given to him beforehand, and put forth the condition that they give him the role of the killer. The screenwriter wouldn\u2019t agree no matter what, saying that if they did so, he just wouldn\u2019t write the script anymore. Naturally, the program team didn\u2019t want to lose the entire public reputation they have built up over one distinguished guest, so this matter just blew over.\u201dFang Juexia found it interesting. He had been forced to participate in an unsuitable reality show in the beginning, and had turned into a spray of wallflowers being menaced by the deputy director. However, this person took the initiative to go on programs unsuitable for him, and he even used his popularity as a bargaining chip.Everyone was doing things that weren\u2019t suitable for them.\u00a0 The world was like a staggered gear, with people always running into problems when it rotated to a certain point.\u201cWhich celebrity?\u201d Lu Yuan\u2019s face carried the standard expression of\u00a0eating melons. \u201cDo we know them?\u201dShang Sirui was a bit more free with his words after drinking, he didn\u2019t have many scruples in the first place, and they were all close to each other. \u201cYou do. Not only do you know them, but there\u2019s a bit of a grudge there.\u201d Having said that, he looked at Fang Juexia.Fang Juexia immediately realized what was going on, and it was not only him, but the others in his group also came to the same realization.Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia weren\u2019t so familiar with each other before, but looking at the way everyone\u2019s facial expressions changed, he could also hazard a general guess. Whoever had a grudge against Fang Juexia\u2014there was an 80% chance that it had to be someone from Astar. Most probably, it was a member of Seven Luminaries, the group that Fang Juexia hadn\u2019t debuted with.The most popular member of Seven Luminaries\u2026 Pei Tingsong thought for a bit, and remembered that it was that artist who was officially promoted by the company and often stood in the C position?By the time he returned to his senses, everyone else had already changed the topic. Fang Juexia looked unperturbed, not seeming to have any emotions about that so-called \u201cgrudge\u201d that had been mentioned just now. Everyone began to play drinking games, but they avoided the\u00a0multiples of seven game, the one game Fang Juexia was best at. As a result, Fang Juexia kept losing and kept drinking until there was no alcohol left, and his words grew rarer and rarer.Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes never really left him. After watching him drink cup after cup, he appeared to be fine; his face wasn\u2019t red, and he wasn\u2019t breathless, but Pei Tingsong kept feeling that something was off.Fang Juexia bit open a custard bun, then turned his head and suddenly started smiling at Pei Tingsong.It wasn\u2019t a normal smile, but a silly and sweet smile.There was definitely something wrong.Shang Sirui\u2019s cellphone suddenly vibrated. He picked it up and looked at it before exclaiming, \u201cHoly shit, holy shit, Yang Ge is about to come up and find me.\u201dYang Ge was his agent. As soon as the Kaleido members heard that, they immediately stood up and said, one after the other\u2014 \u201cThen-then let\u2019s go back first.\u201d\u201cHoly crap, I\u2019m most afraid of Yang Ge.\u201d\u201cQuickly grab your clothes!\u201d\u201cPut these away quickly.\u201d\u201cWtf, why is he coming all of a sudden?\u201d Shang Sirui quickly cleaned up the food on the ground and stopped all of them from trying to help him. \u201cYou guys go back now. If you\u2019re late, he\u2019ll give you guys a lecture. I can do it on my own.\u201dIn this way, the friendly and harmonious late night party of bros ended in such a mess. Pei Tingsong watched with his own eyes as Fang Juexia supported himself and stood upright using the bed, coming to a steady stance.But as soon as he walked, he\u2019d be exposed, for he was moving his hands and feet at the same time.Everyone fled in panic, with no one having the time to mind Fang Juexia, who was behaving strangely. Pei Tingsong, as his temporary roommate, had to shoulder the arduous task of taking his arm and running out with him.Finally, they fled back to their room, and once the alarm was temporarily off, Pei Tingsong let out a sigh of relief. He closed the door and inserted the room card, but before he could turn on the lights, he heard a thump.\u201cIt hurts\u2026\u201dWhen he turned on the lights, he found Fang Juexia crouched at his feet with his head buried in his arms, facing the wall, whining and crying out in pain.Pei Tingsong wanted to pull him up, but this guy was like a little ostrich; not only was his head in his arms, but his two arms were also wrapped around his knees and buried under his head. His whole person looked almost like a closed ball.\u201cYou\u2019re a ridiculously terrible drinker. Do you not know how much you can drink? Just drinking whatever is handed to you.\u201d Pei Tingsong complained as he tried to pull apart this small ball before pulling him upright by his arms. However, Fang Juexia was still strong even though he was drunk, and he wasn\u2019t able to break his grip no matter what.It was too comical; Pei Tingsong felt like he was that huffing and puffing dumb rabbit in that song.He had met a stubborn and delicate white\u00a0turnip\u00a0that he couldn\u2019t pull out no matter how hard he tried.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

An hour ago, he was still worrying about how awkward it would be to stay alone in a room with Fang Juexia, who had just laid all of his cards on the table. Yet, now that object had suddenly changed and become a Fang Juexia who had lost all his senses.\u201cRub my head!\u201dThe little ostrich began to give orders, and Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t dare not obey.\u201cOkay, understood, rubbing your head.\u201d He put his hand on Fang Juexia\u2019s head and rubbed it gently. He couldn\u2019t help but think of the\u00a0Maltese dog\u00a0he had raised when he was a child. It had been particularly beautiful and also liked to have its head rubbed.After only having rubbed two or three times, Fang Juexia muffled voice sounded out, \u201cDoesn\u2019t hurt now.\u201d\u201cThat works so well?\u201d Pei Tingsong was a little happy, and felt that he was now a man who could take very good care of people. \u201cThen get up\u00a0bei, wash your face and sober up a bit.\u201dBut who could have known that this little ostrich, who still had his head buried, would stretch out an arm next while saying, \u201cMy arm hurts.\u201dLooking at the thin, pale arm, Pei Tingsong was puzzled. \u201cUm\u2026rub your arm?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201dHow could he rub that\u00a0ah? Pei Tingsong felt that this was all off, for what man would rub another man\u2019s arm?\u201cI\u2019ll massage it for you\u00a0ba.\u201d After saying that, he began to knead Fang Juexia\u2019s arm with his eyes closed, looking quite like an abnormal blind masseur. He didn\u2019t dare to exert too much force, for fear that this guy would rebound again.He had really given too much up for this guy\u2014Pei Tingsong thought to himself.\u201cAlright, Gege.\u201d By now, Pei Tingsong was half-dead from fatigue, so he held Fang Juexia by his wrist and requested, \u201cCan we get up now?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so dark\u00a0ah.\u201d Fang Juexia still showed no intentions of getting up, instead shrinking into himself even further.Pei Tingsong helplessly said, \u201cIt\u2019s not dark though? If you lift your head up, it won\u2019t be dark; I turned the lights on.\u201d Saying that, he drew closer to Fang Juexia and pulled him in such a way that he would face him instead of the wall. He then stretched out his hand to help him lift his head, thinking that doing things this way definitely wouldn\u2019t pose a problem.But not only did Fang Juexia not cooperate, he even bit Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand that was stretched out towards his chin, biting down hard.\u201cAh, ow, ow, ow\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong was angry and anxious, and only managed to force Fang Juexia into letting his hand go after he grasped the back of this person\u2019s neck firmly.\u201cLook at how you bit me, you look up and see this bite mark, it\u2019s bleeding!\u201dFang Juexia still didn\u2019t look up, and not only did he not look up, but he also shifted his butt so that he would face the wall again, with all of these actions of his containing not a single shred of guilt.This move completely exhausted Pei Tingsong\u2019s patience. He shook his bitten hand twice, and without saying another word, picked up Fang Juexia and carried his whole person on his shoulder. Fang Juexia flopped around non-stop, just like a little fish ending up on the bank, and even his slippers flew away. Pei Tingsong then looped both of his arms around his legs and admonished, \u201cBe good.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to fly! I don\u2019t want to!\u201dPei Tingsong found this both infuriating and funny. \u201cWhat fly\u00a0ah? I still want to fly.\u201d He supported Fang Juexia\u2019s back as he placed him on the bed, and he was so tired out that he was currently panting for breath. He also lay down on the bed halfway, with his two hands supporting him. \u201cThankfully it\u2019s me, if you were with Ling Yi today\u2026.\u201dIn the middle of his speech, he suddenly froze.Fang Juexia was right under him, with his lips half open, and his chest moving up and down as he fought for breath. His always stubborn beautiful eyes were covered in a teary mist, and even the gaze with which he looked at him right now was soft.Pei Tingsong\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple rolled up and down, and his breathing started to become somewhat abnormal.Probably because he had consumed alcohol, the corners of Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes had turned red and had combined with his red birthmark to extend out and form one ruddy field. His skin was too pale, and when he was drunk, patches of his skin turned pink, making it seem as if his face had been rubbed against something.\u201cThirsty\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia twisted around on top of the quilt, his head tilted to one side, and his voice sounded mushy. \u201cI\u2019m thirsty.\u201dPei Tingsong pulled himself out of a not-so-good reverie, and once again shouldered the responsibility of taking care of his Gege. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll get you some water.\u201d It took him a long time to stuff Fang Juexia into the quilt, and then he started feeling hot, so he took off his coat and walked towards the table.After getting drunk, should he drink some hot water? Pei Tingsong looked for a kettle, but he wasn\u2019t very good at using it. Only after studying for a long time did he figure out how to use it to boil water.\u201cIt\u2019s so hot.\u201d Pei Tingsong glanced behind him to see that Fang Juexia was still obediently tucked into the quilt, although he was muttering something that he couldn\u2019t hear.\u201cMy situation is so hard.\u201d Pei Tingsong looked back and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, up until now, I\u2019ve never actually taken care of anyone, everyone has just taken care of me. Really, Fang Juexia, you have too much face, you may have been my ancestor in your last life.\u201dFinally, the water started boiling, and when he was pouring it out, which he did clumsily, he almost scalded himself. You couldn\u2019t immediately drink water that had just been boiled, so he mixed into it half a cup of bottled mineral water and made sure the temperature was okay before bringing it over to Fang Juexia.When he got closer, he found that Fang Juexia was reciting multiplication tables, and had already started over again after finishing one whole round.\u201cDrink some water, drink some water.\u201d He opened the quilt and was startled by the expanse of pale and smooth skin on display. \u201cHey, why did you take off your T-shirt?!\u201dFang Juexia was lying on his side, facing Pei Tingsong, and then scooted forward to end up on the side of the bed. \u201cI\u2019m hot.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll get a cold!\u201d Pei Tingsong wrapped the quilt around him and put the cup up to his mouth. \u201cDrink some water.\u201dFang Juexia gulped down all the water under his\u00a0ministrations, and after becoming fully content, giggled at him, sweet and soft, just like a different person.\u201cClose your eyes and go to sleep.\u201dAs soon as he said that, Fang Juexia really did close his eyes.He was actually pretty obedient. Pei Tingsong subconsciously reached out his hand and almost ended up covering his soft hair with his palm, but soon, he stopped mid-way.What was he doing?Pei Tingsong quickly stood up, wondering whether he was also drunk or not.Why did he involuntarily want to rub this person\u2019s head?\u201cIt\u2019s so hot.\u201d Pei Tingsong took off his shirt with one hand, then grabbed his pajamas to enter the bathroom.He needed to take a bath now in order to calm down.While bathing, Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help but think of what Shang Sirui had said when they were drinking. It couldn\u2019t be that the celebrity who couldn\u2019t reach an agreement with the program group was really the person who had taken the official debut spot from Fang Juexia?When they were together in Astar, they should have been trainees at the same time.Seven Luminaries was now one of the most popular boy-bands in China. The officially promoted Liang Ruo had possessed the best resources from the start of his debut. He was the main dancer and the secondary singer, and he almost always occupied the fixed opening and ending C position in the choreography of most of their songs. In the past, he had also been invited to be the regular guest on two different variety shows. Although he also had a countless number of anti-fans, considering that he had the blessing of a large company, everything had been smooth sailing for him.By aiming at a slice of the pie of \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019, he definitely wanted to set himself up as a person with a high IQ.Pei Tingsong just couldn\u2019t figure out the reason for making this kind of move. Fake was fake, and the more real you pretended to be, ultimately, when you were exposed, the more unbearable it would become.He couldn\u2019t help thinking about how Fang Juexia must have felt when he had heard the news about Liang Ruo. Did he feel that it was a pity? Did he feel uncomfortable?If\u2026if back then, he hadn\u2019t been forced to leave Astar, what would it be like now?In that case, they should have\u2026\u201cBang bang bang!\u201dThe continuous sound of knocking pulled Pei Tingsong away from his thoughts. When he turned around, he got so scared he nearly slipped and fell down, a string of F-words bursting out of him. Fang Juexia, who he had thought was asleep, had suddenly appeared at the door of the bathroom. His entire body was sprawled out against the frosted glass door, while he was slapping the bathroom glass wall with his hand. \u201cLet-let me in!\u201dThe frosted glass made his figure look even more furtive. Pei Tingsong leaned against the wall and pulled over a towel to hastily dry off his body.Little friend Fang Juexia\u2019s face was pressed tightly against the glass, crowding in so tightly that his face looked a bit deformed. \u201cMy eyes are broken, why can\u2019t I see clearly\u2026\u201d He slapped the glass door several more times. \u201cI\u2019ve already counted to a hundred, and I\u2019ve got you!\u201dIt was over, he couldn\u2019t even think about sleeping tonight.Pei Tingsong hastily put on his clothes and opened the bathroom door to come out. Yet, as a result, Fang Juexia, who had been ready the entire time, pounced on him, and his two hands firmly wrapped themselves around him.\u201cI-I\u2019ve got you!\u201dHe didn\u2019t have his shirt on, and he threw himself into Pei Tingsong\u2019s arms while his upper body was bare. He was pretty much behaving like a three-year-old kid at this point. Pei Tingsong could only go along with him, \u201cYes, you. caught me, you won. Can you go to sleep now?\u201dFang Juexia looked up at him, his watery eyes blinking. \u201cSleep?\u201d\u201cYes, sleep.\u201d Pei Tingsong dragged him forcefully back to the bed, where he once again stuffed his hands and feet back into the quilt. \u201cLook at you, ice-cold. If you do this again, I won\u2019t care for you anymore.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Fang Juexia hugged his arm and looked really aggrieved, as if he would start shedding tears the very next second.Just when Pei Tingsong was starting to feel much more sympathetic, Fang Juexia called out sweetly, \u201cLittle Abacus~\u201d and then he stubbornly held out his hand and scratched Pei Tingsong\u2019s chin. \u201cAre you hungry, Little Abacus? I\u2019ll go pour you some dog food~\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not your dog!\u201d Pei Tingsong grabbed his hand. \u201cFang Juexia, look closely. I\u2019m Pei Tingsong, your\u2026\u201dHe stopped, and Fang Juexia\u2019s watery eyes blinked.After a second-long pause, Pei Tingsong continued, \u201cI\u2019m your bandmate, understand?\u201d\u201cUnderstood, Little Abacus.\u201dWhat a waste of words, Pei Tingsong sighed. He tucked Fang Juexia in and considered it; if this person currently thought that he was Abacus, then he\u2019d just be Abacus\u00a0ba. The present Fang Juexia completely possessed a child\u2019s mind, so he could only coax him by employing the strategies used to coax children into doing things. \u201cHow about this, shall we have a sleeping competition? Whoever falls asleep first is the champion!\u201dFang Juexia blinked and asked, \u201cThen-then is there a reward?\u201d\u201cReward\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong asked, \u201cWhat kind of reward do you want?\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s mouth shrunk slightly. \u201cI\u2026 I want my dad to turn back into my old dad.\u201dUpon hearing this, Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help frowning.What did that mean? What was his \u201cold dad\u201d?But he had no way to investigate any further. These were Fang Juexia\u2019s private matters, and the only reason he was carelessly talking about them right now was because he was drunk. Once he sobered up, he definitely wouldn\u2019t want his privacy to be delved into by anyone.\u201cOkay, you can have whatever you want. Now we\u2019re going to start!\u201d Saying that, Pei Tingsong turned off the lights. He then thought of Fang Juexia\u2019s night blindness and left a bedside lamp on. He got into his own bed, for he was very exhausted after having been tossed around for such a long time in the hotel, not to mention that he had originally already been very tired from the flight. Pei Tingsong lay in bed with a long sigh of relief and closed his eyes.He kept chanting in his heart, praying that this guy would not start anymore drunken hijinks again. Gradually, just as he was about to sink into a dream, his consciousness flowed out of his stretched body and spread out around him.In a trance-like state, he felt his quilt being pulled at, and then something crept up, moving from his feet to his side. Pei Tingsong was confused, and he simply let out an \u201cen.\u201d However, that was when he heard Fang Juexia\u2019s voice in his ear\u2014\u201cCan I hug you to go to sleep, Little Abacus?\u201dPei Tingsong, who had nearly fallen asleep, was suddenly awakened, and opened his eyes to face the person next to him. Fang Juexia\u2019s innocent and pitiful eyes looked at him just like that.He was really going to go crazy.\u201cDon\u2019t you have a bed?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked in a completely helpless tone, \u201cYou\u2019re already such a big kid, you have to learn to sleep by yourself.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth shrunk as he began to speak, before hesitating.\u201cBut what?\u201d Pei Tingsong looked at him with the manner of an adult.Fang Juexia\u2019s tone was pitiful as he explained, \u201cBut Dad came home today. I\u2019m a little scared, he-he drank again, will he scold me\u2026\u201dRight now, when he spoke, the logic and organization that Fang Juexia had developed over the years seemed to have regressed to that of a frightened child\u2019s. Although all he said were a few short, confused words, Pei Tingsong more or less understood what he meant.\u201cNo,\u201d he rubbed Fang Juexia\u2019s head and consoled, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201dFang Juexia sniffled and looked at him. \u201cLittle Abacus, my eyes are sick, did you know?\u201dPei Tingsong nodded, his fingers touching Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes. \u201cI know.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cThen will you also find me annoying?\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes were filled with a watery haze, as if tears would start falling in the next second. He didn\u2019t know why, but Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart ached at this, and such a feeling was particularly strange.\u201cOf course not.\u201d Pei Tingsong pinched his cheek and said, \u201cAm I that kind of person,\u00a0pei,\u00a0am I that kind of dog?\u201dFang Juexia finally started smiling. \u201cWill you night-night with me?\u201dIn the end, Pei Tingsong finally compromised. He was obviously a bad-tempered, rebellious, and unrestrained prick, but every time he ran into Fang Juexia, he would compromise and do things he had never done before. It was as if this person had completely confiscated his power of refusal.\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d Pei Tingsong soothed him, even though he knew that some people would suddenly turn hostile and start acting nasty when they woke up the next morning. Fang Juexia would probably think he had taken advantage of him, so he pulled out his cellphone and turned on the recording app. \u201cThis is you absolutely wanting to sleep with me.\u201d\u201cEn!\u201d Fang Juexia immediately grew happy, with his voice turning sweet, and his eyes brightening, looking just like two beautiful glass beads, in which Pei Tingsong\u2019s face was being reflected. \u201cThen, can I hold you?\u201dBeing asked in this manner, Pei Tingsong suddenly ended up tongue-tied, and his ears felt hot as he replied, \u201cWhat-whatever you want.\u201d After that, he turned to the other side, with his back facing Fang Juexia. He had lived for 20 years, and he had never slept with anyone in the same bed before; doing this much was already his highest level of compromising.Yet, he hadn\u2019t even turned around for a second when Fang Juexia seized the clothes on his back and gently pulled at them, grumbling, \u201cHey, I can\u2019t see you anymore.\u201d\u201cFang Juexia, if you keep being so flirty, you will regret it when you wake up tomorrow.\u201d Pei Tingsong sighed and turned to face him. \u201cLike this is fine\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cEn!\u201d Fang Juexia arched up and then really hugged his head just as if he were hugging a small dog and also started patting Pei Tingsong on the back. \u201cLittle Abacus, night-night~\u201dPei Tingsong, a tall man of 1.9 meters, was pressed close and had to shrink to fit like that in Fang Jue Xia\u2019s arms as he was pressed into his clavicle. He didn\u2019t dare to breathe, let alone sleep.\u201cNight, night\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia began to sing randomly, as if he really wanted to coax a puppy to sleep. He first started with an out-of-tune lullaby, and then he somehow started singing the\u00a0Snail and the Oriole Bird song, of which he would only sing the first verse. He kept singing about \u201cPinot Tree Supremes\u201d until finally Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.In one swift action, he moved Fang Juexia\u2019s arms away from his head, and took him into his arms instead, then placed his arms under his neck, only to wrap his own arms all the way around him, thus coming to hold Fang Juexia firmly in his arms.\u201cIt\u2019s still a bit more comfortable for me to hold you.\u201d His chin was on the top of Fang Juexia\u2019s hair, and his hand gently patted Fang Juexia\u2019s back while saying, \u201cSleep\u00a0ba.\u201dFang Juexia, currently possessing a child\u2019s mind, also copied his actions, patting Pei Tingsong\u2019s waist and hugging him tightly. \u201cSleep\u00a0ba, Little Abacus.\u201dIt could now count as things having finally quietened. Pei Tingsong closed his eyes and took a deep breath. This hug was the first one between him and Fang Juexia\u2014a real and intimately close hug, even if it was born from neither of their free wills.He had once firmly believed that he and Fang Juexia must be two people walking different paths in life. Once such people met, the consequences would only be bad, not good.So, this moment was too sudden and too unexpected.If time travel really existed, and the Pei Tingsong from a month ago transmigrated over and saw this scene, he would probably be scared silly\u00a0ba. Recalling the events of these past few days, Pei Tingsong felt as if the two of them had been forced into the same dramatic whirlpool; the more they wanted to separate, the closer they instead became to each other.Sensing that Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t really moving around anymore, Pei Tingsong reached for his cellphone and stopped the still on-going recording. But it was at this time that the person in his arms suddenly raised his head and placed both of his hands on Pei Tingsong\u2019s face. In the dim light, he drew close and gave him a kiss. Maybe he wanted to kiss his chin or his cheek, but unfortunately, it was their lips that met.Pei Tingsong stopped breathing.\u201cThank you for keeping me company, Little Abacus.\u201d He giggled in a silly manner, then snuggled back into Pei Tingsong\u2019s arms, rubbing against his clavicle until he found the most comfortable spot where he could be at ease, and closed his eyes.Pei Tingsong\u2019s nerves seemed to have been anesthetized. His thoughts turned sluggish, and even up until now, the dull sensation of his lips being collided with could still be felt. This time though, there was no cellophane candy wrapper, and the lips that had touched his own had been completely soft. The short touch slowed down and stretched out in his memory: the coming into contact, sinking in, leaving, and his lips springing back. These\u00a0four gentle moves\u00a0of Fang Juexia\u2019s had completely toppled his heavy heartbeat, and after getting stirred up, he had no way to calm it down again, while it just continued to grow faster and faster. It was so fast that he was afraid that the crazy rabbit that was thumping away in his heart would wake up the little radish in Fang Juexia\u2019s heart while their two chests were this close against each other.Oh no.He had been surprise-attacked by a soft candy.Ten minutes passed, twenty minutes passed, and then even after who knows how long, his heartbeat still didn\u2019t manage to return to its normal pace. The tight embrace provided it with a steady stream of energy, allowing it to beat crazily, and in a lively fashion, regardless of any resistance from Pei Tingsong\u2019s brain.That had been his first kiss.Pei Tingsong tried to talk himself out of it. He was very cool, so cool, and a kiss on the mouth counted as nothing at all. What\u2019s more, he had already tried this out when they had been passing around the candy wrapper.However, his persuasion didn\u2019t seem to have much of an effect, and his adrenaline ratcheted up recklessly. The smell of Fang Juexia\u2019s shampoo confused his brain, and he felt dizzy and breathless.Clearly, he had already overdrawn his energy levels, but Pei Tingsong still couldn\u2019t fall asleep. He didn\u2019t even dare to move, for fear of waking up the person in his arms.An unexpected kiss managed to stuff 10,000 butterflies into his chest. They fluttered their wings as they tried to fly out of his throat. They plotted together to create a tsunami in a sea of alcohol.And he was the fool obediently holding onto a small bomb.Dizzy, and not knowing how long he had slept, a throbbing headache pulled Fang Juexia out of deep sleep, his consciousness just floating around for now. His thoughts were confused, and he couldn\u2019t open his eyes. He could feel that his body was slightly sore, so he moved a bit. Unexpectedly, he immediately felt a pair of arms around him tighten, after which he was patted on the back.He vaguely heard a familiar low voice, one which sounded a bit sleepy, say, \u201cBe good\u2026\u201dBe good?What kind of strange dream was this?This reflexively tightened embrace compressed the distance between the two people until there was nearly none left. What was embarrassing was that although Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t sure whether the voice he had just heard was real or not, what his thigh had accidentally touched was far too real.He violently came to his senses and in just one move, pushed Pei Tingsong, who still wasn\u2019t awake, away. He grabbed the quilt and retreated to the edge of the bed.\u201cPei Tingsong!\u201dIt was the first time he was so emotive.Pei Tingsong\u2019s brows twisted together, and he said, \u201cNow what\u2026\u201d He opened his eyes and only after seeing Fang Juexia in that standard posture\u2014 of a woman from a good family after having been taken advantage of\u2014 did his sluggish brain wake up.Sure enough, he just knew this would happen.At this time, Pei Tingsong sighed emotionally, feeling glad about his ingenuity in preparing beforehand for a rainy day.\u201cWait, you calm down.\u201d Pei Tingsong drew closer; he actually wanted to grab his cellphone and open the evidence for Fang Juexia to look at.However, Fang Juexia was completely unaware of what he was trying to do; all he knew was that as soon as he had woken up, he had discovered that he wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt and that Pei Tingsong had been holding him tightly in his arms. Moreover, the guy who seemed to be the initiator was still approaching him, and so Fang Juexia said, \u201cIt\u2019s you who should calm down.\u201d Having said that, he coughed and added, \u201cAnd you, down there\u2026\u201dDown there?Pei Tingsong, who still hadn\u2019t fully woken up, looked down at himself, and then let out a curse in a low voice.\u201cThis is a normal phenomena that happens in the morning, okay?\u201d He looked completely shameless and scratched his sleep-tousled hair. \u201cYou\u2019re also a man, so what are you making such a fuss about? This is showing that it\u2019s working normally. Don\u2019t you know?\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d Fang Juexia didn\u2019t want to listen to his middle school biology class lecture. \u201cThen why did you need to hug me while sleeping? Didn\u2019t you say you\u2019re not gay?\u201d His soul felt tortured right now.Pei Tingsong had nothing to say.Shouldn\u2019t you ask yourself that?Obviously, last night, he had been the one constantly calling him Little Abacus and stickily pasting himself onto him, but in the blink of his eye, he had now turned hostile and acted as if he didn\u2019t recognize him anymore.Pei Tingsong was angry, but he was also very clear on the situation. He had clearly known that Fang Juexia had the kind of stubborn personality\u2014one who wouldn\u2019t change his mind about anything without getting a\u00a0rude awakening\u00a0about it first. Thus, he decided to first get to his carefully compiled evidence. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll tell you why.\u201dFang Juexia was flustered. His brain was in a complete mess, and yet again, this person was drawing closer to him.Where was his shirt?Pei Tingsong wasn\u2019t really gay\u00a0ba? \u2014This question kept lingering in his mind.He stretched out his hand to resist, but Pei Tingsong grabbed his wrist in one move. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d Saying that, his other hand felt around the pillow and he said, \u201cWhere did it go?\u201d\u201cYou let me go.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s only other free hand also began to struggle.His current actions completely exhausted Pei Tingsong\u2019s patience, and so he just grabbed Fang Juexia\u2019s other hand and pressed it into his body, while wearing a condescending look on his face, as if Fang Juexia would do whatever he wanted. \u201cI told you not to move. Do you know how obedient you were last night?\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d\u201cTurning hostile as soon as you wake up\u2026\u201d He stared at Fang Juexia, and the anger in his eyes softened again. \u201cListen to me. Just wait until I find it\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish speaking though, repeated thumps on the door sounded out, coming from outside, and then Ling Yi\u2019s penetrating voice came through.\u201cDang dang dang dang! Kaleido ensemble show special! Morning raids and sudden inspections!\u201dShit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He then heard a\u00a0ding\u00a0sound, which was the sound of the door being unlocked.\u201cShit, how could they have the keycards?\u201d Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t have time to push Fang Juexia off his bed, and had to run quickly over to Fang Juexia\u2019s bed.Fang Juexia stiffly stared at the ceiling, still frozen in his original position, until Ling Yi entered the room with the camera.\u201cSurprise!\u201d Ling Yi bounced in and said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to announce who the lazy king of the group is\u2026\u201d\u2014This wasn\u2019t quite what he had imagined.He had thought that Pei Tingsong would definitely be the one still deep asleep, but what he didn\u2019t expect to find was this little tyrant actually neatly sitting upright on the bed, with a pillow placed on his stomach, his face wreathed in a professional smile, and his two hands folded properly on top of the pillow. The entire image seemed rather like a fake of the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d.\u201cMorning.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s pure American English gave Ling Yi the illusion of having walked into the wrong play. It was too strange; based on Pei Tingsong\u2019s normal behavior, he should have been kicked out of the room with two pillows being thrown at him at this time. How could he just casually reply with a \u201cgood morning\u201d to him, behaving just like a young lady from a great noble family? He was possessed\u00a0ba.On the contrary, after he had entered, Fang Juexia had wrapped himself up in his quilt and had rolled from one end of the bed to the other, now looking like a\u00a0tamagoyaki.Something wasn\u2019t right\u00a0ah, how was the atmosphere here so strange\u2026.Ling Yi was a smart guy and quickly realized that something was wrong with them. He guessed that they may have just engaged in a quarrel, but what could they have been arguing about this early in the morning?He cleared his throat, popped up the collar of his pajamas, and pretended to be talking into a walkie talkie. \u201cNo. 01, No. 01. The raid task is completed, and no lazy eggs were caught. Getting ready to go to the next room! Over.\u201d\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s chin lifted and he asked, \u201cWhere did you get our key card?\u201dLing Yi\u2019s current expression made it clear that he had just been waiting for this question as he placed his butt down on the side of the bed, fished out three key cards in the manner of a gambling king, and wiggled his eyebrows up and down. \u201cStrong Ge gave them all to me.\u201dWhat exactly was all of this?They had nearly been caught engaging in an adulterous scene while in bed.Pei Tingsong rolled his eyes. \u201cGet up, I want to sleep some more.\u201d\u201cNot eating breakfast?\u201d Ling Yi tried to pull his pillow away; his sudden niceness was way too fast. \u201cPei Little Six, let\u2019s go have breakfast\u00a0ba.\u201dThe only pillow covering up his shame was about to be pulled away by Ling Yi, so of course, Pei Tingsong would not agree to his suggestion. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry, you go by yourself, I\u2019m so sleepy.\u201d After saying that, he lifted up the quilt, put it over his body, and diligently pretended to sleep. \u201cRemember to close the door for me!\u201dReally weird.The camera was right behind them, so Ling Yi knew that he couldn\u2019t say anything, for fear that if he went deep into it, he\u2019d end up digging into some kind of big trouble. As a worldly-wise person, he definitely wouldn\u2019t allow something like that to happen on his watch.\u201cAlright\u00a0ba, anyway, I\u2019ve finished the surprise shot~ Mission accomplished!\u201d Ling Yi got up from the bed and accidentally discovered that when Pei Tingsong had moved the quilt to cover himself, the T-shirt Fang Juexia had been wearing when drinking last night had appeared.No\u00a0ah, why would Juexia\u2019s clothes appear on Pei Tingsong\u2019s bed?Right when Ling Yi had come up with a hundred different answers, none of which made any sense, his eyes, which were comparable to those of\u00a0Leeuwenhoek\u2019s, took aim and noticed an even stranger point.Next to Fang Juexia\u2019s pillow was Pei Tingsong\u2019s cellphone! That fancy purple cellphone case was absolutely Pei Tingsong\u2019s, make no mistake!Fuck, did he discover some kind of amazing secret?!Ling Yi\u2019s chest stirred with excitement, wild joy and fear, all of these emotions mixing together, and he quickly hurried the camera Da Ge, who didn\u2019t know what was going on, out of the room. He himself politely closed the door. \u201cThen you guys don\u2019t oversleep\u00a0oh.\u201dHis little heart was pounding, thinking that after the shooting of the segment was over, he would immediately convey this amazing secret he had observed to their four-person groupchat, take his bros along to happily eat melon, and all of them would gorge on it until they were full!Only after Ling Yi\u2019s loud voice and the sound of his footsteps got further away, and once he was certain that there wasn\u2019t any possibility of them coming back, did Pei Tingsong flip open the quilt and get off of Fang Juexia\u2019s bed. He also took the T-shirt that had appeared and threw it in front of Fang Juexia, who had turned his back on him by now.Fang Juexia was obviously stewing in anger and kept himself buried in the quilt, not even poking his head out. Pei Tingsong sat at his bedside, feeling as if he had returned to last night\u2019s awkward circumstances again\u2014where no matter how hard he pulled, he couldn\u2019t pull Fang Juexia\u2019s head out.\u201cHey, Fang Juexia, you really don\u2019t remember what happened last night?\u201d Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t really believe it; any person who didn\u2019t know better would think that they were following the script of some drama or something. \u201cYou really don\u2019t remember even a little bit?\u201dFang Juexia slapped down the quilt over his head and then stared at Pei Tingsong without saying a word. His voice had restored to its usual indifferent tone, and completely didn\u2019t contain any trace of his cutesy, brainless self from last night. \u201cDon\u2019t try to deceive me.\u201d\u201cMe deceive you?\u201d Pei Tingsong was so angry that he started laughing at him, his expression turning into that of an abandoned wife\u2019s. \u201cDo you know what you did to me last night? Who was the one groaning and whining without stopping, who couldn\u2019t be coaxed at all and even had to be hugged to sleep? I didn\u2019t have a second\u2019s leisure before you fell asleep, you know? Now you\u2019ve turned hostile and refuse to recognize me. Fang Juexia, you\u2019re really heartless.\u201dFang Juexia narrowed his eyes while still wrapped in the quilt, and expressed doubt at every word uttered by Pei Tingsong. \u201cImpossible.\u201d\u201cAlright, then I\u2019ll just have to bring out the big moves.\u201d Pei Tingsong was so angry by now that his lungs had started aching. \u201cDo you know what faceslapping is? I\u2019ll give you a taste of a faceslap today.\u201d Saying that, Pei Tingsong picked up the cellphone pressed against the corner of the pillow, found the recording from yesterday, and split his legs to ride astride on this tamagoyaki Fang Juexia.\u201cI\u2019m really a genius. I just knew you\u2019d turn your back on me and not acknowledge what you did, so\u2026\u201dDing.The door opened again.\u201cI\u2019ll go in first!\u201d\u201cShh, shh, shh!\u201d\u201cWhat are you squeezing in for, I lost my slipper!\u201dPei Tingsong, holding his cellphone, riding on top of Fang Juexia\u2019s body, turned to stare at the other four members\u2014all six members\u2019 faces had turned muddled.\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Ling Yi was holding a slipper in his hand, and carried a guilty smile on his face. \u201cEveryone was worried about you guys, scared that\u2014scared that you\u2019d start fighting\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong proffered a spiritless smile. \u201cFight, what, like fight on the bed?\u201dAfter saying that, he climbed off of Fang Juexia\u2019s body and faced the crowd of melon eaters who had broken in. \u201cAre all of you satisfied with what you saw?\u201d\u201cTch, it\u2019s not a good time.\u201d He Ziyan rubbed his chin and commented, \u201cWe should have come in later.\u201dLu Yuan snapped his fingers as he added, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it all have been over later?\u201dJiang Miao coughed twice as a warning.Ling Yi said, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be that fast\u00a0ba?\u201dThump, thump, thump\u2014two pillows hit four people.\u201cScram, scram, scram.\u201d Pei Tingsong rolled his eyes and said, \u201cHow can I have such a group of bandmates? My life is too hard.\u201d With that, he got out of bed and approached the bathroom with his cellphone in his hand.Ling Yi cleverly ran over to Fang Juexia and explained, \u201cAre you okay, Juexia? Actually it was\u2026 it was the captain who was coming to give you some hangover medicine, and then we all followed him in.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, my head just hurts a bit.\u201d Fang Juexia sat up, put on his T-shirt, and then went downstairs for breakfast with everyone else after washing up. The ensemble show\u2019s cameraman also followed them, filming their breakfast buffet trip.Throughout this duration, Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia got no chance to be alone together. They were even seated far away from each other, and everyone made a lot of noise. After breakfast, they were all whisked away by Cheng Qiang to get styled.Probably because they knew that the charity party taking place today would be popular, the magazine had released various clips of the interview videos of Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia in the morning, which featured several specific questions. Soon, \u201c#TingJue Idol Definition\u201d was trending on the Hot Search list. This kind of question was in itself topical, so it also led to the birth of a lot of trending discussions. These two idols, who had first appeared in the public eye in a boyband, were now being viewed by the public for the first time for something besides their performances and exquisite appearance.It wasn\u2019t a small number of passersby who were turned into fans from this, and it even led to many people\u2019s prejudice against idols being reversed. Of course, there were also a lot of marketing accounts stirring up shit, claiming that all of this was just part of an interview manuscript that had been written in advance, and was the usual trick employed by a magazine to promote people. All in all, because of the fight between the supportive people and the brainless antifans, their popularity rose up at an unusual speed.The two people in the center of the whirlpool were in the dressing room at the moment, listening to Cheng Qiang nag about the issues that needed to be paid attention to at the gala, his words spinning over and over again like a wheel. They were seedlings, ones who had just attained newly sprouted popularity in this circle, and nothing was stable. There were too many people staring at them, and if they weren\u2019t careful, their hard-earned recent popularity would be mercilessly crushed into pieces\u2014This was the entertainment circle.\u201cRemember, in the last big group photo, let your seniors go up first, and whatever else you do, do not rush forward. Even if your face gets blocked out, it doesn\u2019t matter, grabbing the C position is not a good thing, we really don\u2019t want this kind of topic coming up.\u201dLing Yi nodded heavily. \u201cUn\u2014der\u2014stood.\u201dJiang Miao said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be in charge of them later.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t speak, and didn\u2019t really listen to Cheng Qiang\u2019s words. His headache had been relieved under the effects of the medicine, but he still couldn\u2019t remember the events that took place last night. He just vaguely felt that something had happened, otherwise, they couldn\u2019t have woken up early in the morning while holding each other.It couldn\u2019t be that he had gone crazy while drunk yesterday and had done something he shouldn\u2019t have done to Pei Tingsong?But Pei Tingsong was tall, and he was stronger than him. Even if he really wanted to have drunken sex, his chance of succeeding at it wasn\u2019t high\u00a0ah.His mind was too confused and currently possessed no capacity to think about anything else. This itself was very strange\u2014he clearly had a job to do, so why was he still entangled with the events of the night he had spent with Pei Tingsong\u2014this wasn\u2019t like him at all.[Do you know how obedient you were last night?][Turning hostile as soon as you wake up.]Repeatedly thinking back on the words Pei Tingsong had spoken at the end, no matter how he interpreted them, they just sounded wrong. Fang Juexia pressed his\u00a0Jingming acupoints\u00a0and searched his memory again with his eyes closed.\u201cToday, Juexia\u2019s hair will be blown out.\u201d The stylist neatened out his hair and continued explaining, \u201cJuexia\u2019s hairline is beautiful, and if we comb his hair up, his facial features will appear more delicate.\u201d\u201cDo you want to cover up your birthmark?\u201dFang Juexia wanted to tell her to do whatever she wanted to, but unexpectedly, Pei Tingsong preemptively opened his mouth. \u201cWhy cover it up? It\u2019s not a blemish.\u201dHe looked at himself in the mirror, and then glanced at Pei Tingsong, who was finished with his styling and had lowered his head to listen to some music.\u201cThen let\u2019s not cover it up\u00a0ba.\u201d Fang Juexia smiled at the stylist Jiejie.All six of them were dressed in white suits that differed only slightly in terms of style and detail. Fang Juexia was in a white swallow-tail suit, while Pei Tingsong was in a three-piece suit, with a long waistcoat. Time was tight, and after finishing their make-up and hair styling, they immediately drove to the location of the charity gala.The car door opened, and their leader was the first to get out. They heard huge cheers coming from fans on both sides of the red carpet, all of them shouting their names.Fang Juexia tidied up his suit coat and got out of the car, with Pei Tingsong coming from behind him. They stepped onto the red carpet, and walked step-by-step to the organizer\u2019s signature board. The six people stood side by side with a smile on their faces.\u201cWelcome, welcome to the popular boy-band Kaleido!\u201dThe cheering of the fans almost drowned out the voice of the host. This red carpet seemed to be endless, and reminded Fang Juexia of a music award ceremony they had attended the year they had debuted. They had arrived early at the sponsor\u2019s red carpet, but they had been stopped and kept outside by the staff, and had to wait for other actors, singers, and even other groups who had made their debut in the same year, to go in first. By the time Kaleido\u2019s six people stepped up, the fans on both sides of the red carpet had grown sparse, and even the proxy photographers had all disappeared.They had just debuted, but they didn\u2019t even get a chance to introduce themselves. All they could do was to just quickly write down their names on the boards already filled with various signatures, thereby ending the parade of self-esteem with just a scribble.\u201cThis should be Kaleido\u2019s first time participating in the charity fashion event,\u201d the host introduced and laughed awkwardly, for the fans\u2019 voices were really too loud. \u201cEveryone is really quite enthusiastic, so let\u2019s greet them\u00a0ba.\u201dJiang Miao counted off \u201cone, two, three,\u201d and the six people raised their hands together to introduce themselves, \u201cHello everyone, we are Kaleido!\u201dThe male host laughed and asked, \u201cToday, Kaleido\u2019s style is of a prince on a white horse?\u201dJiang Miao skillfully replied to and dealt with the host. They were receiving unprecedented attention and were the first to enter the venue; they could sign their names on the blank signature board. Countless camera flashes went off at them, with numerous people calling out their names in hopes of getting a press photo.After entering the venue, they received instructions from the staff, who told them that there was still some time before they could enter the gala room. They were given a specific number for a round table; each round table could sit six to seven people, and Kaleido perfectly managed to\u00a0 fill up one whole table.The lighting in the venue was very dark, with all of the light being concentrated on the stage. Fang Juexia subconsciously focused his eyes on Jiang Miao, who was in front of him. The tables and chairs in the venue were arranged close to each other, and the corridor was narrow and curved.The visibility here was very low. He could be as careful as he liked, but diagonally in front of him was a chair that had been pushed out and away from the other chairs.He couldn\u2019t see it clearly.When he stepped forward in its direction, Fang Juexia found his waist suddenly being gripped by a hand, which then proceeded to drag him just slightly off track.Fortunately, he thus managed to avoid that obstacle.Mission accomplished, but the hand on his waist didn\u2019t remove itself. Long and slender fingers rested in a rather natural manner on the waist-line of his custom-made swallow-tail suit, as if they simply just belonged there.People would naturally experience emotional fluctuations from the unknown.But Fang Juexia knew exactly who was behind him.Yet, his heart was currently beating fast, all for this known person.His heart beat clearly in the dark field of his vision, like flickering fireflies, steadily pushing him forward.\u201cFound it.\u201d Jiang Miao checked the table number. \u201cEveryone sit down.\u201dAll of them sat down, sitting down based on their standing positions, and by Fang Juexia\u2019s side was Pei Tingsong. The venue wasn\u2019t quiet, there were staff people coming and going, and also other artists who were entering and sitting down one after another.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t look at him and just whispered, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to help me.\u201dEven he felt that his voice was a little cold as he said this, but this was the only way Fang Juexia could say it. He had told Pei Tingsong his secret because it had already been revealed and he had had no alternatives at that time. However, he had never expected to obtain Pei Tingsong now \u201ckeeping an eye on him\u201d because of this defect, and this was the thing he felt most annoyed about.He had no inferiority complex, and had never not felt confident because of this problem.He was very normal, just like everybody else.So, he didn\u2019t need to be treated differently.Pei Tingsong smiled, picked up the wine glass set on the table, poured some sparkling water into it, and placed it in front of Fang Juexia. Taking advantage of this brief moment when he was leaning close to him, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not helping you, I\u2019m helping myself.\u201d\u201cI know you\u2019re very strong and don\u2019t need me.\u201d His profile was illuminated by the gorgeous lights on the stage. \u201cBut I need a fanservice partner.\u201d\u201cSo I\u2019m asking you,\u201d he looked at Fang Juexia, the corners of his mouth carrying a hint of a smile. \u201cLeave me some room to perform.\u201dFang Juexia looked away.His heart was beating in an even more disorderly manner now, as if a hand had physically reached into his chest and forced the second hand of the hidden small clock to move, so it began to collapse and malfunction.Fang Juexia drank the water in front of him and maintained his apparent composure.When he looked up again, he caught sight of a group of artists passing by them, wearing complete sets of black suits, and they were all people familiar to him.\u201cSeven Luminaries is actually sitting next door.\u201d Ling Yi whispered.Pei Tingsong heard that and propped his chin in his hand as he looked over. He saw one of the guys there, the one with flaxen hair who seemed to face them, and this guy raised his hand and waved it vigorously at them with a social smile on his face.Liang Ruo\u2014Pei Tingsong chanted this very dull name in his heart.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgHe was waving at Fang Juexia\u00a0ba.Pei Tingsong turned his head towards Fang Juexia, only to see him remain as calm as usual, while smiling and nodding at that warm guy.This was a very courteous gesture, Pei Tingsong was clear on that. Not only was he clear, he also knew that Fang Juexia was far from being such a person. He could get excited, could get angry and speak ironically, could start sparkling when talking about his dreams, and could also want to rely on other people.This was the Fang Juexia who these people didn\u2019t know about at all.However, when he thought about it, he had known Fang Juexia for a mere two years, and they had really interacted for only about a month. What did he really know?He lowered his head, took out his cellphone, and compiled a message.Before long, Fang Juexia\u2019s cellphone vibrated. He thought it was a bit strange.[Kaleido Pei Tingsong: Don\u2019t you want to know what happened last night? Listen to it yourself.][Kaleido Pei Tingsong: shared a recording]This was the evidence that Pei Tingsong had said repeatedly that he would show him?He didn\u2019t have earphones right now.Fang Juexia thought for a moment, took off his coat, and stood up from his seat. He told the captain, \u201cMiao Ge, I\u2019m going to the bathroom.\u201d\u201cEn, go ahead\u00a0ba.\u201d Jiang Miao added, \u201cI think you just have to go out through that door.\u201dFang Juexia nodded and left without looking at Pei Tingsong.Naturally, Pei Tingsong wasn\u2019t happy; how was it that as soon as he sent him a message, Fang Juexia would get up to go to the bathroom? But he couldn\u2019t just directly follow after him, so he poured himself a glass of water and guzzled it down.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that we could sit with Seven Luminaries,\u201d Ling Yi laughed at himself.Jiang Miao motioned at him to stop talking. Only then did Ling Yi lower his head and pretend as if nothing had happened.This wasn\u2019t the first time that they had been involved with Seven Luminaries. At the end of the year when they had debuted, Kaleido had, very early on, won the opportunity to perform, but on the day before their performance, they had been informed that the program list had been changed and that their performance had to be cancelled.They didn\u2019t have a chance to perform, but they still had to go and attend. The six big boys sitting in the audience watched the whole show and saw that their three minute song and dance performance had been compressed into a 13 minute showcase for Seven Luminaries.They knew it couldn\u2019t be helped; whoever was popular was whoever had the right to speak.That was also that scene that had frustrated Pei Tingsong to the depths of his self-esteem for the first time. It was only then that he understood what his father had said to him\u2014\u201dYour world is too much of an ideal. You should take a look at what ordinary people\u2019s life is like and what it is like to not even be worth being mentioned.\u201dThere were more and more stars gathering in the venue, but Liang Ruo, who was seated at the Seven Luminaries table, stood up and went out of the door that Fang Juexia had walked out of just before.\u201cI just don\u2019t feel good about it, why can that Liang Ruo just smile cheekily at Fang Juexia as though nothing has ever happened?\u201d Ling Yi couldn\u2019t stay silent for long before he couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. Although he said it very quietly, Pei Tingsong still heard him.\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked.Lu Yuan turned his cup around. \u201cLiang Ruo\u2019s qualifications definitely didn\u2019t qualify him for being a part of AS\u2019 upper circle of trainees. Him being able to debut while Juexia was instead expelled, and even being able to make an official debut on top of that, there have always been some problems in this story.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s particularly interesting is,\u201d He Ziyan continued, while leaning on the back of his chair and observing the reactions of the other people in the Seven Luminaries group after Liang Ruo left, \u201cThe relationship between the group members doesn\u2019t seem to be very good.\u201dLing Yi seemed to have recalled something. \u201cRight, I remember, around the time we were about to debut, that Liang Ruo even came to find Juexia. He was in the company\u2019s parking lot at that time, and I saw him when I was getting some take-out.\u201dPei Tingsong frowned. \u201cWhat happened?\u201dLing Yi shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I also can\u2019t read Juexia\u2019s expressions, but he didn\u2019t return to the dormitory that night, and just slept in the practice room.\u201d\u201cStop guessing, they\u2019re probably friends.\u201d Jiang Miao poured water for them one by one. \u201cThere are also pictures of the two of them during their trainee period floating around online. Based on those photos\u2026 they had a good relationship; they were smiling quite happily in those pictures. None of us are in the know about this, so we shouldn\u2019t discuss these matters any more, especially when this isn\u2019t the place to talk about it.\u201dTheir leader had spoken, and so the others couldn\u2019t say anything more. They could just watch the stage silently and wait for the first program to commence.It wasn\u2019t easy to find the restroom in this venue. Fang Juexia searched for a long time before finding one, and it was both very luxurious and very hidden. He went to the sink, took out his cellphone, and minimized the volume on his phone.All of this was too absurd, absurd to the point that Fang Juexia laughed out loud while holding onto his cellphone.He would even go all the way out from the performance venue just to find a quiet place to listen to something, all because Pei Tingsong had sent him a recording.His finger was about to click open the recording when another person suddenly appeared at the doorway of the bathroom.\u201cJuexia?\u201dFang Juexia looked up when his name was called and saw Liang Ruo coming in.\u201cThat\u2019s great, you\u2019re really here. I was afraid that I wouldn\u2019t even be able to bump into you out here.\u201d Liang Ruo warmly smiled at him and spoke, \u201cIt\u2019s really not easy for us to meet. You\u2019ve been good recently\u00a0ba?\u201dFang Juexia held his cellphone and replied quietly, \u201cVery good.\u201d\u201cI saw your interview on the Hot Search List this morning, it\u2019s really amazing. You\u2019re the same as you were, you haven\u2019t changed at all.\u201d Liang Ruo walked closer as he continued speaking, \u201cHave you been really busy? Did you know, I sent you a lot of messages. I sent you a message on WeChat on your birthday and wanted to have dinner with you to celebrate, but you didn\u2019t reply to it.\u201dFang Juexia smiled. He remembered that Seven Luminaries had been holding a concert in Japan on the day of his birthday.But he didn\u2019t expose him, and replied, \u201cIs that so? Then, thank you. I haven\u2019t used social networking apps for a long time, so I wouldn\u2019t have received those messages.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201d Liang Ruo smiled very brightly and reached out for a hug, but Fang Juexia dodged him.This action seemed to hurt him a lot, and the expression on his face suddenly looked lost, but Fang Juexia still looked completely unperturbed. He began to step away to leave.\u201cDo we have to be like this?\u201dLiang Ruo\u2019s words stopped him in his tracks.\u201cWe were clearly very good friends. I was the one who used to accompany you while practicing day and night, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d Liang Ruo raised his head and looked at Fang Juexia, his eyes full of grievances. \u201cI am very grateful to you for what happened back then, but wasn\u2019t it because we were friends that you were even willing to step forward? Why do you refuse to acknowledge me now?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re actually lying, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re still totally blaming me.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t say anything. He wasn\u2019t good at dealing with such scenarios, and he also felt exhausted and a little out of breath.He didn\u2019t want to recall his past experiences. He had spent a very long time persuading himself that there was nothing wrong with what he had done, that there was nothing wrong with his action of coming forward, and that there was nothing wrong with persisting in what he believed in.\u201cJuexia, what happened in the past\u2026\u201dKnock knock\u2014\u2014The sudden knock on the door interrupted Liang Ruo\u2019s argument. Fang Juexia looked up to see Pei Tingsong leaning against the door frame while wearing a cynical smile on his face.\u201cAm I disturbing you guys?\u201dLiang Ruo turned to look at him and said, \u201cSorry, we have something right now\u2026\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201d Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t let him finish his words, and with one hand stuck in his pocket, he walked straight in. \u201cI just wanted to disturb you guys.\u201dLiang Ruo was suddenly blocked.\u201cFang Juexia.\u201d Pei Tingsong walked up to him, stood in front of him, and tilted his head while asking, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you reply to my WeChat message?\u201dFang Juexia was stunned.He had originally wanted to reply\u2026Pei Tingsong took hold of his shoulder in one move and said, \u201cDawdling while going to the bathroom, I even thought that you had gotten lost. Did you listen to what I sent you?\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t had the time yet,\u201d Fang Juexia replied honestly.\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring earphones\u00a0ba.\u201d Pei Tingsong put some wireless earbuds into his front pocket and said, \u201cGo back and sit down to listen to it, isn\u2019t it tiring to just keep standing there\u00a0ah?\u201dLiang Ruo seemed to be unable to bear the way these two people just kept ignoring him. He struggled forward for the last time and called out, \u201cJuexia, you\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong stopped, and his tone was not good. \u201cOriginally, Strong Ge and the captain exhorted me, telling me to not make trouble when we go out. I promised them and everything, but you just have to make me break my promise.\u201dHe turned around and looked down at Liang Ruo from his domineering height, his voice completely odious as he stated, \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re such a big deal. Didn\u2019t he just help you once? You feeling deeply grateful in your heart towards him is just enough.\u201dLiang Ruo took a deep breath and argued, \u201cYou\u2026what right do you have to comment on our past?\u201d\u201cBased on the fact that I\u2019m his bandmate,\u201d Pei Tingsong said, while still holding onto Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder with his hand. \u201cBased on the fact that I\u2019m with him day and night, based on the fact that one-sixth of his dream, when it finally comes true, will have my name written on it.\u201dPei Tingsong sneered\u2014\u201cAnd what are you?\u201dLiang Ruo gazed at Pei Tingsong with those innocent eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t want to say it?\u201d Pei Tingsong acted as if he was pondering over it before speaking, \u201cI\u2019ll think through it for you\u00a0ah\u2026 Former fellow company trainee? Old friends who parted ways? Or someone who displaced him from his debut position?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s fame and wealth, there\u2019s friendship, and then there\u2019s\u00a0emotional blackmailing.\u201dThe smile on his face disappeared, and he raised his eyebrows.\u201cDo you match all that?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 33Chapter 33 \u2013 Heart Like A Restless MonkeyTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksYou should take responsibility.One-sixth of a dream.Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t sure if Pei Tingsong was being sincere right now, but the moment he heard that sentence, his heart shook quite violently, and his fingertips went numb. Plainly speaking, not too long ago, they had still been at odds with each other, but now Fang Juexia got to indulge in this sense of belonging, which came from Pei Tingsong putting them squarely in the same camp.When did he become like this?\u2014Being so easily moved.After listening to Pei Tingsong\u2019s merciless sarcastic taunts, Liang Ruo, who was standing to the side, clenched his fist, and felt that a\u00a0fishbone\u00a0had gotten stuck in his throat. He had heard about Pei Tingsong\u2019s style a long time ago, and even their agent said that he shouldn\u2019t come into conflict with him, so Liang Ruo swallowed his anger back down for the time being. He didn\u2019t want to cause trouble, so he could only pretend that Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t exist.\u201cJuexia,\u201d he turned his head, and while displaying a hint of weakness in his eyes, started to speak, \u201cIf you have time, we can\u2026\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201d Fang Juexia expressionlessly interrupted his words, firmly leaving no room for negotiation. \u201cI don\u2019t have time, and you have even less.\u201dLiang Ruo couldn\u2019t believe it; he would never accept Fang Juexia\u00a0 becoming just a stranger passing him by on the street. Even if they had to traverse different paths because of the past, all those memories they shared were true.\u201cActually, you really don\u2019t have to keep worrying about it.\u201d The corners of Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth raised slightly, forming a smile full of grace but no emotion as he said, \u201cIf it had been anyone else back then, I would have still stood up for them back then.\u201dFor Liang Ruo, this sentence was the largest possible mockery he had ever received.\u201cI\u2019m going back, I\u2019m tired.\u201d Pei Tingsong held onto Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder as they left. \u201cHey, even if you didn\u2019t have headphones, you didn\u2019t have to run so far away to listen to it\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too noisy inside.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you just ask others first, about whether other people brought some earphones or not? Such an\u00a0axis.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve even learned to use the word \u2018axis\u2019. \u201cAs he watched the two people leave, Liang Ruo supported himself against the sink. He took in a deep breath, faced the mirror, and with great effort, managed to piece his usual expression back onto his face.The mirror in front of him seemed to turn into the mirror installed in the practice room, and there, reflected beside him, was that cold person, still standing next to him.But now, everything was different.The two people left the bathroom, and after they turned the corner and were walking down another hallway, Fang Juexia tried to remove Pei Tingsong\u2019s arm off his shoulder.\u201cHey, how come you\u2019re throwing me away as soon as you\u2019re done with me?\u201d Pei Tingsong was completely dissatisfied with being abandoned like this, and complained, \u201cSure enough, you\u2019re heartless.\u201d\u201cMy shoulder hurts\u2026\u201d said Fang Juexia in a low voice, after which he glanced at Pei Tingsong and asked, \u201cHow long have you been hiding and listening outside?\u201dThis particular look gave Pei Tingsong a different feel; this no longer felt anything like the Fang Juexia who was indifferent to everything. Pei Tingsong let out a long \u201cen\u201d sound. \u201cFrom the start of Liang Ruo\u2019s first sentence? I followed him in anyway.\u201d After saying that, he thought of Fang Juexia\u2019s behavior in the bathroom and inquired, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just directly refuse him a few moments ago? It can\u2019t be that you really were leaving room for me to perform in\u00a0ah?\u201dFang Juexia lowered his head and laughed. \u201cDid you feel like that because I didn\u2019t refuse and kept listening to him as he went on, it made me seem a bit indecisive?\u201dThat wasn\u2019t it. Pei Tingsong was clear on Fang Juexia\u2019s\u00a0 personality, and even though he looked calm most of the time, he was actually very powerful when standing up to someone.He shrugged. \u201cI just felt it was strange.\u201d\u201cI know Liang Ruo\u2019s personality better than you do. He\u2019s a person with an excess of ego.\u201d Fang Juexia said all this in an unremarkable way, \u201cIf I had decisively refused him and interrupted him, that would only serve to make him feel like I still care a lot about the past, and he would feel very satisfied.\u201dPei Tingsong asked, \u201cWhat kind of logic is that?\u201dIt couldn\u2019t be that Liang Ruo had the kind of personality where he would feel good only if he could get Fang Juexia to hate him?Fang Juexia continued, \u201cIn fact, I didn\u2019t say anything just now merely because I don\u2019t feel anything about him, just like he was a stranger.\u201d He looked at Pei Tingsong and said with a simple tone, \u201cWould you refuse a stranger sternly?\u201dPei Tingsong sometimes felt that the person in front of him was terrifyingly precise. He would classify everyone into categories that they should belong to. There were no gray areas in Fang Juexia\u2019s mind; he was always clear-cut. If there was someone who meant nothing to him emotionally, then they would be automatically classified into the 'stranger\u201d category.It seemed that even disgust was considered by him to be a waste of energy.\u201cBut,\u201d Pei Tingsong still found the whole thing surprising. \u201cYou could stand to hear him utter all of those nauseating words?\u201dFang Juexia shook his head. \u201cIf it\u2019s coming from a person I don\u2019t care about at all, why are we even talking about \u2018standing\u2019 anything?\u201dIf it\u2019s a person he didn\u2019t care about, then whatever they did, he wouldn\u2019t care at all. Fang Juexia was such a strange person, with a logic that was completely different from that of ordinary people. He could separate his emotions cleanly, and as long as he wanted to, he could walk out of the past at the fastest possible speed.The speaker didn\u2019t mean that, but the listener picked up on something from his words.Pei Tingsong actually captured something.He ran to catch up quickly with Fang Juexia, then walked ahead of him, and turned to block his way.Fang Juexia looked up at him, and with an expression that said he didn\u2019t know what was going on, asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cNothing,\u201d Pei Tingsong said, smiling with both hands stuck in his pockets.\u201cCrazy.\u201d Fang Juexia bypassed him and was about to walk away, but he was blocked by Pei Tingsong again, who shifted to the right side this time, and almost ended up running into his shoulder.\u201cPei Tingsong,\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s tone changed, and he looked him straight in the eye as he questioned, \u201cExactly what are you trying to do?\u201dSeeing the obvious impatience on Gege\u2019s face, Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t feel angry at all. Instead, he was actually a little pleased with himself, just like a small child. Before forcing the other party into growing anxious, he obediently gave way. \u201cNot doing anything.\u201dCompletely inexplicable. Fang Juexia shook his head and walked by himself in front of him. Pei Tingsong followed behind him step-by-step, his two hands stuck in his pockets as he smiled contentedly.It seemed that exercising patience had become a measure of emotional depth.Very interesting.When they got back to the table and sat down, Ling Yi couldn\u2019t help but complain, \u201cYou two even have to be hand-in-hand when coming back from going to the bathroom\u00a0ah.\u201dFang Juexia looked at his hand and commented, \u201cAre we hand-in-hand?\u201dLu Yuan directly ignored this fact and picked up from where Ling Yi left off, quipping, \u201cYou don\u2019t say, do you remember back in high school, if the girls couldn\u2019t all go to the bathroom together, then they\u2019d rather not go. That\u2019s a good relationship\u00a0ah.\u201dHe Ziyan laughed and added, \u201cYuan\u2019er, I\u2019ll accompany you to the bathroom later.\u201dEveryone talked and laughed, and Fang Juexia soon forgot what had happened before. The central axis of his memory was pulled back to where it was before he had left his seat, and the initial reason for which he had left popped up again.Right\u00a0ah, he had just wanted to listen to a recording.Fang Juexia took out the earphone Pei Tingsong had given him before and connected it wirelessly to his cellphone, which was when he realised that he only had one earbud in his hand. Touching Pei Tingsong\u2019s arm, Fang Juexia asked him for the other one in a low voice. However, more and more people had now come to occupy this main hall, and so his voice was completely covered up by the noise. Seven Luminaries had stood up from their table, looking as if they were preparing to go onstage.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201dFang Juexia moved to draw in closer to him, and it just so happened that Pei Tingsong also drew in closer towards him at the same time. The distance between these two people shortened by twofold just like that, and they nearly ended up touching. Fang Juexia retreated a little, blinked quickly a few times, and then turned his head.The other group members didn\u2019t notice this little episode, for their attention had been completely drawn to the opening act on the stage that was starting up.Pei Tingsong drew closer to Fang Juexia again, this time sticking close to his ear to whisper, \u201cWhat did you say just now?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia paused and restored his calm demeanour. \u201cI wanted to ask you for the other earbud.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d Pei Tingsong nodded. \u201cI\u2019m only lending you one.\u201d Upon seeing Fang Juexia turn his head to stare at him at this, Pei Tingsong started laughing. \u201cEven if you stare at me, I\u2019m still just lending you one.\u201dThis person was really\u2026 Fang Juexia had to work very hard to control his emotions.He really couldn\u2019t do anything when it came to Pei Tingsong.\u201cPress play\u00a0ah.\u201d Pei Tingsong propped his chin on his hand, \u201cWhat, are you afraid of me listening to it\u00a0ah? The original recording is on my cellphone, and I can listen to it as many times as I want to.\u201dFang Juexia really couldn\u2019t continue listening to him anymore. He took a deep breath and clicked on that recording. Placing his arm against the table and his forehead against his arm, he held a half-lying posture as he listened to the evidence preserved by Pei Tingsong.Right now, he wasn\u2019t thinking of anything, he just wanted to figure out what had happened last night.Pei Tingsong also imitated him, lying on the table together with him, and staring down at that recording\u2019s progress bar. This pair of earphones separated them from the noisy hall, and they were like two high school students who were secretly lying down on their desks to listen to music during a lunch break. They were sharing the same audio but hiding different thoughts.Fang Juexia covered his other ear with his hand, and the volume of the recording was pulled to the highest it would go. Suddenly, he heard Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice\u2014[This is you absolutely wanting to sleep with me.]His heart immediately jumped up.[En!][Then can I hold you?]Upon hearing his own voice utter these words in such a tone, even without waiting to hear Pei Tingsong\u2019s response, Fang Juexia really wanted to die. After just listening to the recording for a few seconds, Fang Juexia had already resigned to his fate and started to take out the earbud, but Pei Tingsong was faster, and stopped his movement mid-way.\u201cThere\u2019s still more.\u201d[What-whatever you want.]The Pei Tingsong in the recording sounded like he had lost a bit of his usual swaggering confidence, but it was still definitely him.How could this happen, how could this happen\u2026.When Fang Juexia heard his own voice next, his hand couldn\u2019t help but pinch his thigh.[Hey, I can\u2019t see you anymore.]It was too interesting\u2014Pei Tingsong had never run into a more interesting situation in his whole life. He found holding back his smile at this too hard, and so he raised his head and lifted his arms, while his own divine prophecy was now playing in the earbuds.[Fang Juexia, if you keep being so flirty, you will regret it when you wake up tomorrow.[Like this is fine\u00a0ba.]The rustling of the blanket as they turned around sounded very realistic. Clearly, the venue was so noisy that even talking to people was difficult, but their\u00a0hearing\u00a0seemed to be infinitely magnified at the moment. Them hugging, him patting his back, his sweet replies, him singing disorderly songs\u2014all these details were reproduced through the sound, and pulled Fang Juexia, who didn\u2019t want to believe it, back to that drunken night.He had even regarded Pei Tingsong as Little Abacus.At this moment, Fang Juexia seriously considered the maneuverability and success rate of him biting his own tongue right there and committing suicide.Accidentally noticing that Fang Juexia, who was lying on the table, was currently pinching his own thigh, Jiang Miao worridely asked, \u201cIs everything ok? Juexia, what\u2019s wrong, do you not feel good?\u201dPei Tingsong held back his smile and explained for him, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, he\u2019s good.\u201dSaying that, he then patted Fang Juexia\u2019s back. \u201cRight, Juexia Ge?\u201dAfter seeing Fang Juexia\u2019s red ears and neck, Pei Tingsong felt more satisfied than ever.The progress bar reached the end of the recording, and ended with Fang Juexia\u2019s last sentence of \u2014[Sleep\u00a0ba, Little Abacus.]Fang Juexia felt that his self-esteem had never been so thoroughly devastated to such a point before. He took off his earbud, slapped it onto Pei Tingsong\u2019s thigh, before sitting upright and taking in a deep breath.He needed to pull himself together. That wasn\u2019t him, that was him after drinking alcohol.Pei Tingsong restrained himself to take a cool breath, but still smiled as he put away the earbud Gege had returned to him. He seemed extremely pleased with himself as he drew closer to ask, \u201cI didn\u2019t deceive you\u00a0ba.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s face was so hot right now, he even felt hot all over.\u201cYou are too thin-skinned.\u201d Pei Tingsong stared at his red earlobe, a little distracted, and couldn\u2019t help but recall the cherry during the magazine photoshoot.\u2014Would break with just a pinch.On the stage, the host appeared, and everyone began to clap. The first program was Seven Luminaries opening up the scene, but Fang Juexia simply didn\u2019t have any attention to spare for them. He even forgot that there would be fans here, specifically taking reaction shots at this time, his mind was too full of the things from last night.\u201cYou\u2026 Did you record anything else?\u201dPei Tingsong spread his hands,.\u201dJust this one.\u201dThat was good news, at least. Fang Juexia blushed and asked, \u201cThen what happened later, I fell asleep?\u201dLater\u2014Pei Tingsong\u2019s memory instantly returned to the eve of that tsunami, back to that soft surprise attack.That later part was too dangerous for him, dangerous to the point that when he thought about it now, those butterflies started up their perilous death throes once again.\u201cYes.\u201d He replied stiffly, \u201cYou fell asleep, you slept really well, and you know what happened later.\u201dAfter hearing what he said, Fang Juexia felt relieved.Losing face was just losing face. If he had just hugged him to sleep, then that was really nothing. They were both men, and they couldn\u2019t do anything that would cross any lines anyway.Yet, the scalding heat on his face didn\u2019t dissipate with this reasoning, instead, it seemed to spread even further, just like prairie fire. Fang Juexia poured himself cup after cup of water and guzzled them down in an attempt to douse this heat. However, it didn\u2019t seem to be working, and he couldn\u2019t even focus on the show taking place right now.The other members were watching Seven Luminaries\u2019 opening performance. Lu Yuan, who was swaying to beat on the surface, whispered, \u201cIsn\u2019t the accompaniment too quiet?\u201dLing Yi let out an \u201cen\u201d and said, \u201cHis voice just cracked\u2026\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cThis kind of not very professional gala, none of the sound equipment will be very good,\u201d Jiang Miao said, saving against a rainy day. \u201cIt may be the same for us when we go up. Everyone should get ready in advance\u00a0ba.\u201dAll of them were discussing the stage, but Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t hear a single word. The half-dead butterflies in his heart seemed to be enjoying their final gleaming performance before the sun set, and didn\u2019t seem to know how to stop fluttering. He needed to get out of the memory of that unexpected kiss and divert his attention elsewhere. He subconsciously clenched his fist, with which Pei Tingsong felt something.\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing,\u201d Underneath the table, he stretched out his right hand towards Fang Juexia and asked, \u201cDo you know why I wore a glove today?\u201dFang Juexia certainly didn\u2019t know. When they were getting styled, he had wondered why the stylist Jiejie had only put leather gloves on Pei Tingsong, and that too only on one hand. He had simply written it off as a new trend.He looked down at the glove and shook his head at Pei Tingsong.Pei Tingsong wore an expression that loudly said\u2014 \u201cI just knew that\u201d, and then he winked at him, and his voice took on the hint of a command as he ordered, \u201cTake it off.\u201dAlthough Fang Juexia felt something was odd, his hand still grabbed Pei Tingsong\u2019s fingertip involuntarily and pulled off the white leather glove.In the dim light of the venue hall, he held Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand and drew it closer to himself to look at it clearly. In the area between the thumb and index finger on Pei Tingsong\u2019s right hand rested a clear bite mark, blue and purple, and the spots where his skin had been broken had already started to scab.\u201cYou did a good job.\u201d Pei Tingsong raised his eyebrows.\u201cMe?\u201d Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t believe it. Forget about biting people, he was already this old and he had never gotten into a physical fight with anyone before.But after listening to that recording just now, he could believe anything.Pei Tingsong wore an innocent expression.\u201dOr else who could it be? I regret not having recorded a video now. You should really see yourself when you\u2019re drunk.\u201dIt couldn\u2019t be that it really had been him\u2026 Fang Juexia stared at the bite mark and felt guilty inside. He really didn\u2019t think that his drunken behavior would be this bad.\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d Fang Juexia raised his eyes and looked at Pei Tingsong.He didn\u2019t know why, but as soon as he looked into Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes, Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help but recall that night\u2014 recall the warmth of Fang Juexia\u2019s skin and the aroma of his shampoo.\u201cNonsense.\u201d Pei Tingsong turned his head and pretended to look at the stage.\u201cSorry.\u201d Fang Juexia apologized to him, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here to wrap you up with either.\u201dPei Tingsong glanced at him stealthily. \u201cNo need, I\u2019m not so delicate.\u201d Then he awkwardly added, \u201cHelp me put on the glove.\u201dFang Juexia nodded, placed Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand on his knee, and softly pulled the leather glove onto his hand. After putting it on, he even pinched at the tips of his fingers to check if they were empty.\u201cDone.\u201d Fang Juexia was very satisfied with this achievement of his. He looked up with a smile in his eyes.Pei Tingsong pulled his hand back, uneasily clenched his fist, and coughed, \u201cThen-then, you can wrap it up for me later, after we return to the dorm.\u201dFang Juexia thought that he had heard wrong. His eyes widened a little. \u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat \u2018huh\u2019, you bit me in such a way, what if I get infected?\u201d Pei Tingsong felt extremely awkward as he ordered, \u201cWrap it up for me when we get back. You bit me, so you should take responsibility.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s eyes were still looking at him like that. They were so bright that Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart started to jump around like a restless monkey while his thoughts started to run wild, just like a galloping horse. He then gripped Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder and forced him to face the stage.\u201cWatch the show, what are you staring at me for?\u201dSeven Luminaries\u2019 performance ended to the sounds of the fans\u2019 strenuous support chants. The other performances took place in their requisite order, and it wasn\u2019t long before Kaleido\u2019s turn came. Under the guidance of the staff, the six boys rushed to the backstage in a hurry. As they turned a corner, a woman accidentally bumped into Fang Juexia.\u201cSorry.\u201dFang Juexia supported her and politely said, \u201cBe careful.\u201dThe woman looked like she was about 30 years old and was decked out very tastefully. She kept apologizing to them and made way for them herself.He just felt that she looked familiar, but time was tight right now, and Fang Juexia didn\u2019t have even a moment to care about her. They went on the stage according to the instructions given to them. Sure enough, the sound from the equipment was the same as before, and the accompaniment was very quiet. However, what kind of broken acoustics equipment hadn\u2019t they come across in all their previous commercial performances? So, this much really counted as nothing.The six people held handheld mics and sang both a fast song and a slow song, using their own strength to enthrall the whole audience. During the performance, Ling Yi and Fang Juexia exchanged their parts, with Fang Juexia\u2019s voice easily reaching up to those three high notes. He Ziyan and Pei Tingsong also exchanged their rap parts, while Lu Yuan and Jiang Miao exchanged dance movements.It was an idol\u2019s natural instinct to enjoy performing. During the time they were unknown, Kaleido had learnt to take every hard won performance seriously, and even if the people watching them from below that stage didn\u2019t recognize or care about them, they would still spare no effort in trying to unleash all their enthusiasm.They liked doing this\u2014 shouting out the names of their bandmates on the stage, and then smoothly switching parts with each other without carrying any worries.This kind of display of ease while performing couldn\u2019t be attributed to mere talent, but the tacit understanding and ability developed by six boys who had spent countless silent nights together in a small exercise room. Sweating, getting hurt, falling down, standing up, singing two or three lines of lyrics repeatedly\u2014 all the while imagining fans and a stage that didn\u2019t exist yet; they had all endured those boring and exhausting days together, and then they had grasped each other\u2019s hands to explore the unknown road ahead.So, at this moment, Fang Juexia looked at his bandmates on-stage and thought of Pei Tingsong\u2019s words.[Based on the fact that one-sixth of his dream when it finally comes true has to have my name written on it.]He liked this one-sixth.\u201cEveryone, thank you very much.\u201dHe liked the satisfaction of bowing to the audience alongside them, hand in hand.He wasn\u2019t actually fumbling around in that dark room all by himself. And it wasn\u2019t the corner of cold furniture that he touched when he reached out, but a hand.The other five people\u2019s warm hands.The audience below almost forgot that this was a charity dinner, and thought that they were at a concert instead. It wasn\u2019t until Kaleido finished their performance that everyone belatedly started clapping. The host came on the stage to chat with them, and only at this time did the group members find out that the company had donated\u00a0300,000 yuan\u00a0in Kaleido\u2019s name. Looking at the surprise that flashed across Jiang Miao\u2019s face, Fang Juexia knew that Qiang Ge didn\u2019t tell any of them.However, to their greater surprise, their Domino fans had held a fundraiser and had gathered together\u00a0200,000 yuan\u00a0in just three short days after learning that they would attend the charity dinner. This was the first time that they had participated in such activities since they had become popular, and their fans had constantly forwarded Weibo posts and called for donations, hoping to use their little strength to give these six boys confidence.\u201cThen let\u2019s invite Ms. Jiang Yin, one of the directors of the charity fund, to come onto the stage to present our Kaleido with a small gold commemorative ring and to thank Kaleido for their contribution to the many autistic children.\u201dA lady in an evening dress emerged from the backstage, picked up a small gold ring from the red velvet cushion held by one of the Mistress of Ceremonies on-stage, walked over, and handed it to group leader Jiang Miao with both hands.Fang Juexia looked at her, and only then did he realize that she was actually the woman who had accidentally bumped into him a while ago.Jiang Yin\u2026.After their segment finished, Kaleido stepped down from the stage according to the directions given by the staff. When Fang Juexia was just exiting the backstage corridor, he overheard the voice of the host on the stage. That person seemed to be talking to the woman named Jiang Yin, and he even mentioned \u2018Escape For Your Life.\u2019Cheng Qiang hugged them one by one backstage. \u201cYou guys were all so good. You performed especially well, so no wonder you\u2019re my cubs. Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go, we can eat down there now and finally watch the other performances in peace.\u201d\u201cQiang Ge.\u201d Fang Juexia asked, \u201cThe Miss Jiang who gave us the prize was?\u201d\u201cAh, she\u2019s really powerful.\u201d Cheng Qiang said, \u201cYou remember Zhou Ziheng, who became the Berlin Film Awards Emperor some time ago\u00a0ba? Mm, he goes to the same school as Xiao Pei. Jiang Yin is his agent.\u201d\u201cNot only that,\u201d They left the backstage area and prepared to enter the audience seating from the aisle outside the venue. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the producers of \u2018Escape For Your Life.\u2019 What, did she speak to you in private?\u201dFang Juexia shook his head. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\u201cHey, I thought she would come find you to get you on the show.\u201d Cheng Qiang laughed and continued, \u201cStill shouldn\u2019t dream of pies in the sky.\u201d He escorted the six people back to their seats like herding ducks. He was very pleased to see Pei Tingsong support Fang Juexia all the way to their seats.This fanservice hadn\u2019t just changed their popularity, but it seemed to have also brought the little wolf cub back into the fold.The programs continued one after the other, and the Kaleido\u2019s members watched with great interest. He Ziyan could see their fans from his seat, so they also interacted with the station Jies for a while. After all, they didn\u2019t have to go on-stage again, and one by one, these fans had started to grow flustered. Seven Luminaries was the most popular group on site, with their every move causing a scream, so the organizers had shifted their award ceremony to the very end.The Seven Luminaries group donated\u00a0500,000 yuan, and their fans also donated 500,000 yuan in their name. The host finished the interview and invited the editor-in-chief of the magazine to present them with a small golden commemorative ring after they had made their donation.\u201cThen, does Seven Luminaries want to say something?\u201d The host handed over the microphone, and Liang Ruo, who was standing in the very center of the group, took the microphone and looked down at the guests below.\u201cFirst of all, I would like to thank the organizers for giving us the opportunity to participate in this grand ceremony. This time, the charity\u2019s goal was to help autistic children in improving their living and growing environments. I think this is very meaningful. In fact, when I was a teenager, I also didn\u2019t like to talk very much, and socializing with others was a very big obstacle for me. But I was very lucky. At that time, I was helped by my good friends\u2026\u201d When he said this, Liang Ruo looked over at the spot where Fang Juexia was seated.He was here again.Pei Tingsong had to put in a lot of effort to manage his expression, despite never having done so before, and resisted letting the level 10 sarcastic expression from being displayed on his face. However, he did reach out and take hold of Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder, pulling on him to face himself.Fang Juexia had a confused expression on his face. He was pulled into facing Pei Tingsong, only to watch him pick up a marshmallow from the table and stuff it into his mouth.\u201cIf you don\u2019t eat any now, they\u2019ll all be eaten by Ling Yi.\u201dLing Yi, who was secretly chewing on some food while making small movements, was suddenly cued, and got so scared by this that his shoulders trembled a bit.Caught off guard by the mouthful of sugar stuffed into him, Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes were full of the words \u2018completely baffled.\u2019 Pei Tingsong also ate a marshmallow, and then he put his right hand in front of Fang Juexia.Fang Juexia just looked up at him without saying anything.\u201cHand hurts,\u201d Pei Tingsong mouthed at him.Fang Juexia\u2019s cheek was bulging, so he nodded at him to show that he understood.Then, he stretched out his index finger and expressionlessly poked at Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand. Pei Tingsong hadn\u2019t expected such an action, and his hand ended up bouncing up a bit like a little grasshopper. He stared at Fang Juexia in disbelief.After eating the marshmallow, Fang Juexia also mouthed back, \u201cOh, I thought you said it didn\u2019t hurt.\u201dThen he pointed to his ears\u2014\u201cBad\u00a0hearing.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The six boys kept bowing, and even though the host and editor-in-chief kept telling them to go to the center, they always declined. As instructed by Cheng Qiang, Fang Juexia, who was standing beside Pei Tingsong, shouldered the arduous task of reminding the little devil king to bow. His hand continuously remained on Pei Tingsong\u2019s back, and every time they bowed, he had to press him into bending down.The group photo was an occasion where artists could contend with each other in terms of beauty and level of fascination, and thus, everyone posed in various ways in front of the camera. However, the six big boys in white suits didn\u2019t try anything new, just tacitly putting up their group gesture and then stood straight, looking like six little princes whose white horses had fled far away.Coincidentally, the same was true for their senior brother group High Five, and after the event, all of them were mocked by netizens on Weibo that day\u2014StarChart groups didn\u2019t try to fight for attention and just edged to the corner by themselves.After the event, they flew directly back to Beijing. Besides Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia, the other four members had their own variety shows to participate in. The company\u2019s plan was to have everyone on a variety show right when the new album was being released, so as to ensure maximum exposure.That night, the terms #Kaleido white suit#, #Kaleido\u2019s scene#, and #TingJue CP# once again burst onto the Weibo Hot Search list, stirring up fevered debate. Some big verified music accounts even commented on Kaleido\u2019s performance, praising it tremendously for it\u2019s high quality, calling it a key example of live performances by boy-bands. Of course, many netizens also compared Seven Luminaries\u2019 performance with that of Kaleido\u2019s. The two groups of fans tore into each other a little bit, making this the first time they had actually fought each other. Seven Luminaries had a large fan following, and as soon as these fans appeared, they laid waste to Kaleido\u2019s sphere, but such an onslaught actually made many passersby feel bad for Kaleido, and ended up turning many of them into Kaleido fans.After spending a week away from the dorms, Fang Juexia had almost forgotten what it was like to sleep in his bed. After washing up quickly, he went to bed and curled up in his quilt. At 3:00 in the morning, the moonlight crept in through the balcony, and his vision turned hazy. He couldn\u2019t help thinking of the night when he had been alone with Pei Tingsong, and although he didn\u2019t remember anything after he had gotten drunk to the point where his consciousness was in pieces, there seemed to be some emotions leftover from that night in his heart.Somehow, he suddenly recalled how he had bitten Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand, and with that, all of his sleepiness flew away.Fang Juexia was a person who couldn\u2019t stand leaving things on hold for later at all. After tossing and turning around for a few minutes in his bed, he got out of it. There was no one else at home, so he turned on the light without any scruples, went to the living room to get the first-aid kit, and with light movements, walked over to Pei Tingsong\u2019s bedroom. He knocked on the door, but no one responded; instead, the door opened with a squeak.Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t sleep with the door closed?Fang Juexia hesitated for a moment. The bookshelf blocked the view of Pei Tingsong\u2019s bed, but he felt that there was no movement at that end. Embracing the idea that some people would be more obedient when sleeping, Fang Juexia entered the room. He turned on the light located on He Ziyan\u2019s side and crossed the bookshelf, all the while prepared to make a quick decision after understanding the situation on the other side.Sure enough, Pei Tingsong was asleep. He was lying on his side with a book by his face, probably having fallen asleep while he was reading. He hadn\u2019t even turned off the light at the head of the bed. Coincidentally, his bitten right hand was stretched out, half hanging out just over the edge of the bed. The bite on his hand had been covered by the glove all night, and so it was already inflamed and red.If it still wasn\u2019t dealt with, the injury may become even more serious. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t want to have his bite mark remain on someone\u2019s hand for a lifetime.Fang Juexia walked around the bed, sat down quietly, carefully opened the first-aid kid, took out a cotton swab, and dipped it in anti-inflammatory medicine. He made his movements as light as possible, gently and carefully touching the wound with the cotton swab.So deep?\u00a0Fang Juexia looked at the wound that he had created by biting, and subconsciously poked at his teeth with the tip of his tongue.The guilt in his heart suddenly increased exponentially.The medicinal liquid seemed to sting a bit, for Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand twitched a bit. Fang Juexia immediately withdrew the little cotton swab grasped in his hand, and then observed the hostile force\u2019s reaction.Fortunately, Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t make any big movements, just shifting his right hand over to the side of his cheek. Fang Juexia also shifted over in order to draw closer to the head of the bed, then dripped a few drops of medicinal liquid on Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand again, and gently wiped at it with a cotton swab.Pei Tingsong\u2019s fingers twitched again. Fang Juexia raised his eyes to look at him, only to see him frown and mutter something, which seemed to be in English.Before he could understand what was being said, that hand had already lifted itself up and was groping around for something. Then, it suddenly slapped on the top of Fang Juexia\u2019s head and ruffled his hair.\u201cStop, Lily.\u201d With his eyes still closed, Pei Tingsong spoke a few words in a confused way. His voice was soft, and Chinese and English were all mixed together as he continued, \u201cGood girl, good\u2026 How about we sleep together?\u201dUpon hearing this, Fang Juexia immediately dropped his small cotton swab.He waited for Pei Tingsong to finish ruffling his hair, then pulled his hand back and turned around. He quickly packed up his things and left the room hurriedly, like he was fleeing from a calamity.That night, Fang Juexia had a strange dream.In the dream, Pei Tingsong announced that he actually had a fianc\u00e9e named Lily, and that he was going to leave the group and return to the United States to get married. The speed of this was as fast as the manner in which he had become an airborne member of their group, and everyone was caught off guard. They were all invited to the wedding and soon found themselves sitting in the chapel. However, there seemed to be something wrong with the church door; when the priest announced it was time for the bride to enter, the door couldn\u2019t be opened no matter what. The bride smashed at the door desperately outside.Then, Fang Juexia woke up.\u201cBang, bang, bang.\u201dHe had opened his eyes, but the knocking sound still continued.This wasn\u2019t a dream?\u201cFang Juexia, are you up yet?\u201dIt really wasn\u2019t a dream. Fang Juexia rubbed his eyes vaguely, got out of bed, and rushed to open the bedroom door. It was actually Pei Tingsong who had been knocking.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his sentence, Pei Tingsong dragged him to the hallway entrance and dialed to call the property\u2019s security. \u201cThe person downstairs tried calling you for a long time, but when they said you didn\u2019t pick up your phone, they had to call the property\u2019s security site. They said that someone who claims to be your family member has come.\u201dFang Juexia suddenly woke up and thought of today\u2019s date. Someone from the property management picked up the phone and greeted, \u201cHello, Mr. Fang?\u201d\u201cHello, can I ask, has my Mama arrived?\u201dMama?Pei Tingsong was surprised and asked in a low voice, \u201cYour mom is about to come up?\u201dFang Juexia let out an \u201cen\u201d and continued to communicate with the property management until the other party confirmed that there was no mistake, and the person being discussed was allowed up. Fang Juexia quickly went back to his room to wash up, leaving a standing Pei Tingsong on the porch alone.Pei Tingsong was a person who couldn\u2019t deal with family relationships at all. During his childhood, he had almost no elders besides his grandfather. As for other elders, he would only meet them just a few times in a year, and they were just his father, who criticized him, his mother, who was addicted to living an extravagant life all over the world, and his older sister, who had lived like the perfect example of an excellent specimen since childhood. These were the people who formed his absurd and complicated family.When the doorbell rang, Pei Tingsong shouted towards the bathroom, but Fang Juexia was still washing up. He gritted his teeth, walked over, and opened the door.Outside the door stood a dignified lady, dressed in a neat and elegant camel-colored coat, with a lot of things held in her hands, and she started smiling as soon as she saw him. Pei Tingsong was stunned at that moment, however, he quickly reacted and bent down to take the things from Mama Fang\u2019s hands. \u201cA-Auntie, I\u2019ll take that for\u00a0you.\u201d\u201cThank you~\u201d Mama Fang said with an amiable smile. \u201cYou\u2019re Xiao Pei\u00a0ba,\u00a0so tall. Very nice, you really are a good child,\u201d Mama Fang exclaimed as soon as she came in. Pei Tingsong hadn\u2019t received much praise from other adults before, so he was a bit unused to it. \u201cThank you\u2026 Would you like to change your shoes? Um, so, Fang Juexia is washing up right now.\u201d\u201cSleeping in so late\u00a0ah,\u201d Mama Fang changed into the guest slippers and glanced at the clock. \u201cYou guys worked really late again\u00a0ba. What about the other little friends, is Yiyi not here today?\u201d\u201cNo, he went to his show.\u201dUsed to being a teacher, Mama Fang kept calling people \u201clittle friends\u201d and said, \u201cCome, come, Xiao Pei, give the things over to Auntie, and I\u2019ll put them in the refrigerator.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll help you.\u201dWhen Fang Juexia came out, he saw Pei Tingsong beside the island in the kitchen, standing and handing things to his own mother, and both of them were cooperating together very well.\u201cAuntie, what\u2019s this jar?\u201d\u201cAh, this is XO sauce. It\u2019s really good in fried rice, have you had it before?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s OK. Let Juexia stir-fry it for you next time. You\u2019ll definitely love it.\u201d\u201cEn!\u201dFang Juexia stood to the side and had the illusion that he was actually the outsider here.\u201cMom, you sit down and rest. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Fang Juexia rolled up his sleeves and went over to help. Mama Fang stopped him immediately and admonished, \u201cYou sit down\u00a0ba, it\u2019ll be fine with just me and Xiao Pei.\u201dAfter being refused by his own biological mother, Fang Juexia looked at Pei Tingsong. This guy actually turned around and stuck out his tongue at him, while looking very proud of himself.Alright\u00a0ba.Fang Juexia could only sit at the bar and watch the popular food science program and cooking program that was jointly being performed by these two people. From time to time, he would offer a word or two, which was ignored by his own mother.\u201cAuntie, I\u2019ve finished cutting up this green onion.\u201d\u201cGive it over to Auntie.\u201d Mama Fang took over Pei Tingsong\u2019s crookedly chopped green onion and smiled like a blooming flower. \u201cYou cut it really well, Xiao Pei has talent.\u201dPei Tingsong smiled just like a little pupil praised by his teacher, and Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help laughing at that.Thanks to Mama Fang, they partook in a rare family meal. Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong sat on one side, while Mama Fang sat opposite them. She kept using her chopsticks to put more food in their plates. \u201cEat more. You guys work too hard. Juexia, eat more carrots, your eyes\u2026\u201d Speaking until there, Mama Fang suddenly paused in her words.Fang Juexia calmly opened his mouth and stuffed the food his mama had given him into his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, he already knows.\u201dFang Mama wore an expression of complete surprise. \u201cXiao Pei knows?!\u201dPei Tingsong laughed in embarrassment. He was about to say that it had been an accident, but Fang Juexia took the lead.\u201cI told him,\u201d Fang Juexia said, then put some food on his mama\u2019s plate. \u201cEat more. How\u2019s\u00a0grandfather?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the same as before. After a while, when we\u2019re done eating, Mama will go see him at the hospital. He said he wanted to eat\u00a0walnut cookies\u00a0last night, and perfectly I just saw a Chinese snack shop right outside your neighborhood.\u201d\u201cWalnut cookies are too oily for him, he shouldn\u2019t eat too much.\u201dPei Tingsong felt unused to listening to the two people chatting about their family matters, but he was actually more envious than anything else. His gaze kept switching between Fang Juexia and Mama Fang, as he watched them get along and quietly listened to every word they said. Such a warm moment was too unfamiliar for him.This unfamiliar thing always seemed to be so good.\u201cXiao Pei, eat more\u00a0ah,\u201d Mama Fang saw that he was in a daze, so she gave him some beef. \u201cYou grew up abroad right, so you should love beef\u00a0ba.\u201dPei Tingsong was a little surprised and asked, \u201cAuntie, how do you know that?\u201dFang Juexia turned to him and explained in a low voice, \u201cAt home, she\u2019s always flipping around and watching our group\u2019s activities every day, and she would also go search online\u2026\u201dAs soon as he said that, his chopsticks were clacked into by Mama Fang\u2019s, and Fang Juexia immediately shut up.\u201cAuntie, you\u2019re too cute.\u201d Pei Tingsong chuckled and stuffed the beef into his mouth.Hearing this, Mama Fang felt a little surprised. The environment Pei Tingsong had grown up in had taught him to express his feelings straightforwardly, but Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t like that, therefore, this was the first time she had heard this kind of praise coming from the younger generation. Naturally, she was happy.\u201cXiao Pei, you are also cute, Auntie likes you very much.\u201d Her chopsticks moved nonstop while moving food around, and she nearly turned Pei Tingsong\u2019s bowl into a small hill. \u201cAuntie brought a lot of delicious food this time, so let Gege cook it for you.\u201dGege\u2026.As soon as this word came out, Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong looked up at the same time, their expressions and movements completely synchronized.\u201cWhat are you looking at me for?\u201d Mama Fang rebuked Fang Juexia. \u201cYou are three years older than Xiao Pei, so\u00a0 you should already have taken on the responsibility of being a Gege and should take good care of your Didi. It was so hard for Pei Tingsong to start following you guys around even before becoming an adult\u00a0ah. A lot of kids usually don\u2019t even develop fully by then.\u201dWhat else did he want to develop into\u00a0ah\u2026\u00a0Fang Juexia tugged the corners of his mouth back down.\u201cAuntie, I have developed very well.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s expression right now was almost like that of the\u00a0fluffy fat birb emoticon, as he puffed out his chest and looked practically ready to take off.Mama Fang smiled at him. \u201cYes, you are even taller than Juexia. He hasn\u2019t grown at all these last two years.\u201dThe attacks on his height had started up again. Fang Juexia silently listened to his own mother\u2019s malice.\u201cA Gege should act like a Gege and take the initiative to take care of his Didi.\u201dFang Juexia was like an emotionless nodding machine. \u201cUnderstood.\u201dSeeing him like this, Pei Tingsong was overjoyed. He had thought that only a big iceberg could produce a small iceberg, and thus hadn\u2019t expected Fang Juexia\u2019s mama to be so friendly and talkative, along with the most important thing\u2014she kept protecting him the whole time. Pei Tingsong liked this gentle auntie too much. Even after eating, after which Mama Fang had to rush to the hospital, he kept feeling a little reluctant to see her go.\u201cAuntie will come to see you guys next time. Quickly go back in, it\u2019s cold outside.\u201d\u201cGoodbye, Auntie~\u201d\u201cGoodbye, goodbye. If something\u2019s the matter, tell Gege and get him to help you.\u201dUpon seeing Pei Tingsong continue to stand there, reluctant to look away and sending off his own mother, Fang Juexia spoke with a trace of irony, \u201cSomeone who didn\u2019t know better would even think that you\u2019re her son.\u201dPei Tingsong closed the door. He really did wish for that.Fang Juexia walked over and took the slippers his mama had worn back to the shoe cabinet. He turned around and prepared to leave, but was suddenly stopped by Pei Tingsong. Two hands landed on both sides of the cabinet, encircling him inside.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Fang Juexia looked up at Pei Tingsong serenely. He seemed to have already gotten used to Pei Tingsong\u2019s mischievous behaviour, which could start anytime and anywhere.A smile hung on Pei Tingsong\u2019s face. \u201cNothing, just remembered that I forgot to praise you in front of Auntie just now.\u201dFang Juexia frowned, looking puzzled.As if he had already surmised a long time ago that Fang Juexia would be like this, Pei Tingsong raised his right hand, held the back of it towards him, and waved it.The trace of medicinal liquid left on it was almost invisible.\u00a0 Fang Juexia didn\u2019t want to admit that he had done it himself, even if the ridiculous act of applying medicine to someone who was asleep was something he had done last night.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with it?\u201dPei Tingsong had already guessed that Fang Juexia wouldn\u2019t admit to it, so he took out a used cotton swab from his pajama pocket and twirled it around. \u201cPretend a little less, I\u2019ve already figured it all out.\u201d\u201cGege also has times when he carefully takes care of me\u00a0ma.\u201d He shamelessly laughed.Sure enough, it was finally still revealed. He simply shouldn\u2019t have left anything to chance with Pei Tingsong, this sly guy.In his heart, Fang Juexia sighed. His head had been rubbed suddenly, which had caused him to leave the cotton swab on the ground without even realizing it. He could hardly think of anyone else who would do something as stupid as leaving behind a thing that could be used against him.Thinking along those lines, he actually did come up with a name.Cinderella.Compared to a crystal shoe, this small cotton swab seemed to become more and more of an eyesore. Fang Juexia reached out to grab it, but Pei Tingsong put it away. \u201cI found it, so it\u2019s mine. What are you trying to grab it for? Is it so hard for you to admit that you applied medicine on me last night\u00a0ah?\u201dEven the corners of Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes carried a smile as he said, \u201cIn fact, when you\u2019re not being stubborn, you\u2019re a lot like a good Gege.\u201d\u201cGet out of the way.\u201d Fang Juexia was ready to force his way out of his arms, but Pei Tingsong drew them in tighter. \u201cWhy, haven\u2019t we even hugged before?\u201d\u201cPei Tingsong\u2026\u201dUpon hearing the sound of teeth being gnashed, Pei Tingsong\u2019s sense of achievement grew even bigger. \u201cDo you want me to play the recording again? I\u2019ll play it on the home stereo\u00a0ba.\u201dFang Juexia tried very hard to calm his own emotions. \u201cYou\u2019d better not.\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019d better beg me.\u201dAgain.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgSure enough, he shouldn\u2019t underestimate this devil incarnate at all.\u201cIf you keep behaving like this, I will tell everyone else you actually have\u2026\u201dHalfway through this threatening sentence, Fang Juexia\u2019s cellphone rang. He took a deep breath and pulled it out to take a look. It was Cheng Qiang.\u201cHello?\u201dThe voice at the other end was obviously happy and even sounded a little excited. \u201cJuexia? Come quickly to the company. Is Xiao Pei there?\u201dFang Juexia glanced at Pei Tingsong and answered, \u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d With that, he switched to speakerphone mode.\u201cDoes he have classes in the afternoon? If he doesn\u2019t have classes, then he should also come over.\u201d\u201cOkay, we\u2019re coming over now.\u201dPei Tingsong interjected, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cSomething good.\u201d Cheng Qiang just finished saying that when he realized something was wrong. \u201cAre you two right next to each other? Why?\u201dThe two people looked at their current posture at the same time. Fang Juexia was about to push him away, when Pei Tingsong caught hold of his hands to stop his actions and replied, \u201cShar\u2014ing\u2014feel\u2014ings.\u201d\u201cAh, good, good, good. Then you guys come over here quickly. I still have some stuff to do, so I\u2019ll hang up first.\u201dAfter ending the call, Fang Juexia shook Pei Tingsong off and went to change his clothes, but this person still hadn\u2019t forgotten their previous topic of conversation, and so asked, \u201cWhat did you just say? What do you want to tell everyone else?\u201d\u201cYou just behave yourself.\u201dLooking at Fang Juexia walking back to his room after tossing out such a sentence, Pei Tingsong found the whole thing inexplicable.They drove to the company, with Pei Tingsong being entangled in these words of Fang Juexia\u2019s for the entire duration. He didn\u2019t understand how Fang Juexia could suddenly have something on him, he shouldn\u2019t\u00a0ah. However, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t pay any attention to him the whole time, and didn\u2019t even reply to him at all when they entered the company. This just made Pei Tingsong become even more curious.As soon as they arrived at the company, they were called to a small conference room by Cheng Qiang. Opening the door, Fang Juexia caught sight of a familiar woman\u2019s back. Upon hearing movement, the person inside turned around.It was Jiang Yin.\u201cHello, nice to see you guys again.\u201d Jiang Yin reached out with her hand and said, \u201cSit down and let\u2019s chat.\u201dThey both sat opposite Jiang Yin. Jiang Yin took out two documents from her briefcase and pushed them towards Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong. \u201cYou\u2019re all smart people, so you should have guessed the purpose behind me coming here today.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s eyes drifted over the documents. \u201cWe can guess, but we don\u2019t really dare to try.\u201d Saying that, he jerked his chin over at Cheng Qing, since after all, this was the person who had said not to dream of pies in the sky just yesterday.Jiang Yin smiled as she tapped her hand with red nail polish lightly on the table. \u201cThere\u2019s actually something you, Pei Tingsong, don\u2019t dare to guess?\u201dFang Juexia opened the documents and found that both of them were contracts, guest contracts for \u2018Escape For Your Life.\u2019Just like what Jiang Yin said, he had guessed and had a hunch about this, but he hadn\u2019t expected that the program group would come to them so soon, let alone the fact that Jiang Yin herself had come.\u201cThe purpose of my coming here was to reassure you,\u201d Jiang Yin went\u00a0straight to the point. \u201cMoreover, it is imperative for me to book you too.\u201d The assistant entered and brought her coffee. Jiang Yin thanked them in a low voice and took a sip before continuing, \u201cYou guys have shown a strong momentum recently, and I also paid special attention to the magazine sales this morning. Congratulations on setting a new record.\u201dFang Juexia himself didn\u2019t know about that; the two of them had still been asleep this morning.\u201cThe last record was set by my artists, and they were also a pair who came out of \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019.\u201d Jiang Yin\u2019s implication was obvious. \u201cI know that right now, there should be an uncountable number of large and small programs coming to you and inviting you to be permanent guests on their shows. There may be a lot of reality TV shows on big satellite TV among them, and the exposure you will gain from those shows is much higher than that from our program.\u201dShe folded her hands. \u201cHowever, there are also differences between programs. Some variety shows actually consume your popularity, while others tap into your potential.\u201dCheng Qiang asked, \u201cAre there any additional conditions for signing the contract?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201d Jiang Yin thought for a moment and added, \u201cIf we have to say it, it\u2019s that Juexia and Tingsong have to come onto the show together. If we want them, we want both of them.\u201dFang Juexia was very clear on the fact that this was a conscientious show, and he had always really liked it. Even if there were no additional benefits to their popularity to be gained through it, he would still be very willing to participate.But he also knew that Pei Tingsong had always wanted to participate in a hip-hop program. If he signed this, and some music programs came with invitations later on, he may find himself with no room in his schedule then.Cheng Qiang took over the conversation. \u201cIn fact, both of them are fans of \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019. They said it in the interview as well, and we\u2019re all very much looking forward to working together.\u201d\u201cVery flattered,\u201d Jiang Yin said with a smile. \u201cHowever, I want to collect all the smart kids in the circle into my program. If you guys go, you can film with Sirui, and it\u2019ll be really good.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t wait for them to talk any further and directly signed his name, not messing around at all. \u201cSigned it.\u201dJiang Yin thought that was interesting. \u201cYou\u2019re not even going to look over it carefully?\u201dPei Tingsong shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re even here in person, so can you pit me?\u201dFang Juexia was a bit surprised at this and turned to look at Pei Tingsong. He didn\u2019t understand why this guy was being so decisive at this time. Clearly speaking, he hadn\u2019t agreed to participating in any programs before and had slacked off all day on that decision.\u201cWhat are you looking at me for?\u201d Pei Tingsong said in a low voice before winking at him. \u201cSign\u00a0ah.\u201dReally strange. Fang Juexia inhaled a deep breath, and still couldn\u2019t make himself believe it. In the span of one night, his favorite program had taken the initiative to come to his door, and all good things seemed to have arrived all at once. He knew that the contract must have been confirmed in advance multiple times by Cheng Qiang, so he just quickly flipped through it and signed.Jiang Yin wasn\u2019t as aggressive as rumor had it. In fact, it seemed that she wasn\u2019t much older than them, yet still carried the feeling of being a big Jiejie.\u201cGood.\u201d After receiving the contract, Jiang Yin gave a long sigh of relief. \u201cA big stone in my heart has finally fallen away. You guys don\u2019t know how difficult it has been for me to find a guest.\u201d As if she had suddenly changed her personality, she began to complain to them, \u201cEveryone who came to us either asked us to change the script, saying that it was too difficult and that they couldn\u2019t escape at all, or else they agreed to be on the show, but wanted us to give them scripts, so as to let them act according to the script, and they also wanted brilliant roles on top of that. Our little script writer disagreed. The good thing about our program is mainly our script, so of course the script is the most important thing.\u201d\u201cThen how did\u00a0you\u00a0find us?\u201d Fang Juexia was curious. \u201cWe are not actually very famous artists.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be modest, you guys are very popular now.\u201d Jiang Yin laughed. \u201cOur little script writer saw the magazine interview, and he thought you guys spoke especially well. He told me about it, and I just investigated you two. By the way, I also saw your math competition clip. You\u2019re really good, you won a whole car of milk.\u201dWhen she said this, everyone else laughed, but Fang Juexia felt embarrassed.After confirming the recording time and other basic requirements, Jiang Yin was anxious to return to attend a meeting and so left in a hurry. As soon as she left, Cheng Qiang showed his true colors. His professional agent aura disappeared, and he looked overwhelmed with joy.\u00a0 He hugged Fang Juexia first and then went over to hug Pei Tingsong. \u201cThat\u2019s so great, that\u2019s so great. I didn\u2019t expect that this big cake would run over on its own for us to chomp into. You\u2019re definitely the little friends that I brought up!\u201d\u201cQiang Ge!\u201d Xiao Wen pushed open the door. \u201cThe boss is looking for you.\u201d\u201cGoing right now.\u201d Cheng Qiang rubbed his hands happily and took the contracts. \u201cThe boss must already know.\u201dAll of a sudden, they were the only ones left in the meeting room. Fang Juexia still didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhy did you agree to sign the contract so quickly?\u201dPei Tingsong glanced at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to go on?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Fang Juexia was stunned.So it was because of him?\u201cJust count it as having fun in an escape room at public expense\u00a0ba.\u201d Pei Tingsong sat on the table and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s also very interesting.\u201d After saying that, he remembered that the problem from before still hadn\u2019t been solved, and so continued, \u201cOh, by the way, you just said at home, that you wanted to tell everyone something about me. What is it\u00a0ah? It can\u2019t be that I was talking in my sleep last night and I told you some secret?\u201dFang Juexia let out an \u201coh\u201d and said, \u201cYou still remember.\u201d\u201cOf course. If you don\u2019t tell me, I won\u2019t be able to sleep tonight.\u201dThe corners of Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth faintly quirked up and he replied, \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026the matters between you and Lily. Don\u2019t worry, I was just saying things. I won\u2019t tell anyone else.\u201d\u201cLily?\u201dFang Juexia had finished talking and started moving to go to the practice room. He totally didn\u2019t take any notice of the strange expression on Pei Tingsong\u2019s face.\u201cYou wait.\u201d Pei Tingsong, who was leaning against the table, grabbed Fang Juexia\u2019s wrist and pulled him back towards him. \u201cTell me, what happened between Lily and me?\u201dThe smile on his face seemed to carry a lot of implications. His legs stretched out and surrounded Fang Juexia, who was now standing in front of him. This sudden shortening of the distance between them made the air feel compressed and so thick that even the ending of this sentence gained an ambiguous aura.\u201cHow did I say it in my dream? Hm?\u201dHis voice was deep and soft, and in that moment, Fang Juexia returned to the early hours of this morning, when Pei Tingsong had also used this voice to stop him, rub his head, and had mistaken him for Lily.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia broke away from his grasp and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t hear what you said, anyway\u2026\u201dYou let Lily sleep with you.\u201cAnyway what?\u201d The corners of Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes and his eyebrows were full of smiles, and he looked at the person in front of him from top to bottom while commenting, \u201cHow much inappropriate stuff did I say\u00a0ah?\u00a0Your neck is red.\u201dFang Juexia uneasily felt his neck with his hand. \u201cQuit that.\u201dPei Tingsong revealed the smile that he couldn\u2019t hold back anymore. \u201cWhat are you afraid of? You are the Gege, one who is nearly four years older than me, and I have followed you since I was a minor.\u201dThese words were clearly underlining the order left behind by his mother, but when Pei Tingsong said them, they became extremely ambiguous. Fang Juexia\u2019s heartbeat grew disorderly again. He didn\u2019t want to keep getting entangled with this person; anyway, all of this was a part of Pei Tingsong\u2019s private matters, which had nothing to do with him.\u201cWhatever you say.\u201dFang Juexia turned and was about to leave when he heard the person behind him suddenly burst out laughing.Was there something wrong with this person? Fang Juexia wore a completely confused expression on his face. He turned his head to see Pei Tingsong sitting on the table, and he was unable to sit straight because of how hard he was laughing. It was as if he had just heard the funniest joke in the world, and he was almost out of breath.\u201cWhat exactly is your problem?\u201d Fang Juexia finally couldn\u2019t endure it any longer, and his tone turned fierce.Pei Tingsong was laughing so hard that all his teeth were revealed and his eyes had disappeared, his face looking completely childish at this moment. He took a few deep breaths and tried to control his laughter. \u201cI\u2019m fine\u00a0ah. You\u2019re the one with a problem.\u201dFang Juexia, who now had a bellyful of anger, was about to refute him, but then he heard this abominable guy speak again\u2014\u201cLily is my dog\u00a0la.\u201d Pei Tingsong jumped down from the table, his face wreathed in smiles.\u201cDummy.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So in the attempt to avoid Pei Tingsong, he sequestered himself in the practice room, immersing himself in dance practice.Even when his cellphone vibrated, he never looked at it. It was only after returning to the dorm late at night did he discover that all the messages he had received were from Pei Tingsong.[Kaleido Pei Tingsong: Shared a picture]He had sent out nine photos in one shot, all of which featured a dog. It was a small snow-white dog with long fur; her fur had even been twisted into small braids, her eyes were very round, and she was especially pretty.So this was Lily.Fang Juexia was a bit surprised; he hadn\u2019t thought that Pei Tingsong could actually raise such a cute little dog. After all, with a devil incarnate like him, raising even a Tibetan mastiff was possible.[Just a pretty face: Cute.]Pei Tingsong had waited for an entire night, and after receiving only that word in lieu of a proper reply, he nearly died from anger.[Kaleido Pei Tingsong: You are too perfunctory\u00a0ba][Kaleido Pei Tingsong: Courtesy demands reciprocity, let me see Little Abacus]Then came another good long wait. Nearly 20 minutes later, Pei Tingsong\u2019s cellphone finally let out a half-dead vibration.[Just a pretty face: Shared a video]He clicked on the video, which looked to be about three minutes long. The scene in the video was of a beautifully arranged little garden. Fang Juexia was wearing a white baseball cap and half-kneeling on the grass. With one hand, he pulled a husky into his arms, and using the other hand, he then smeared some doggy shower gel over its body. He kept saying, \u201cLittle Abacus is so good. How about going out to play after the bath?\u201dHow was it that even a husky could become so obedient and sensible under his hands?At the end of the video, he heard Mama Fang\u2019s voice, \u201cJuexia, look here.\u201dThe next second, Fang Juexia turned to face the camera, and it seemed that he was a bit younger than now. It was at this time that Little Abacus, who was completely soaked, suddenly shook himself and splashed water all over Fang Juexia\u2019s whole body. At this, Fang Juexia began to laugh, smiling helplessly, but very beautifully.This was a Fang Juexi radiating life that was filled with firework-like sparks.For a reason Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t explain, he ended up watching the video repeatedly for a long time, wearing headphones throughout, so that Fang Juexia\u2019s voice, as he coaxed the dog to bathe, was right by his ear.His uncontrollable thoughts kept veering back to the memories of that particular night.The wider these folding windows opened, the more curious he became about the scenery on the other side of them.\u201cEscape\u201d had a large number of fans and was a common topic of conversation. On the second day after the contract was finalized, the marketing accounts online suddenly began to release information about the show one after another, mostly pointing at the lineup of program guests, with mixed accuracy. There was only one marketing account that implicitly mentioned that popular boy-band members had been invited to star in the new season.This piece of news soon set off a huge wave. Some people in the comments said that Seven Luminaries had contacted the program group very early on, but their fans refused to acknowledge that, and so these two groups tangled for awhile. Later, a long anonymous thread was built up in the forum, which stated that the newly signed guests were Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong, the pair who had recently become popular by selling a rotten CP.With this, the fans of Seven Luminaries and Kaleido collided again. Fang Juexia, for some reason, became the main target, being regarded by the Seven Luminaries fans as the one who had\u00a0stolen\u00a0their idol\u2019s spot, and so they did their utmost to discredit him. It got to the point that Star Chart had to send out a lawyer\u2019s notice that night, demanding that these fans stop slandering their artist. Normally, since such wars were a frequent occurrence in the fan circles, passers-by didn\u2019t pay much attention to it. In addition, nothing about the line-up was really known, so the program fans were just watching from the sidelines.But the next day, the posts on this topic suddenly doubled. All because Liang Ruo had released a selfie on a foreign social network platform.He seemed to have been photoshopped in this selfie. His face was covered with a painted-on grimace as he showed an aggrieved expression, and there were even photoshopped tears added to his face.Such a selfie would usually account to nothing much, and would be considered to be just a way to keep himself trending and give some cuteness to his fans. However, when such a selfie was published right in the middle of a heated debate revolving around the guest line-up for the show, this crying face took on a whole new meaning in the netizens\u2019 eyes.[@23CHIWE:\u00a07L C, he\u2019s implying something here\u00a0ba?][@Little angel is me: From the perspective of a passer-by, posting up such a selfie at this time is too coincidental, and I don\u2019t believe that it wasn\u2019t done on purpose. If the official guest really turns out to be FJX in the end, then 7L C is really\u2026 He\u2019s so popular, why does he need to\u00a0touch porcelain?][@3000 scoops\u00a0of the Yalong River: Laughing to death, a top artist from the most popular group accusing a\u00a038th parallel line\u00a0idol, I\u2019d really like to know what touching porcelain really means?][@kumakuma replying to @3000 scoops of the Yalong River: Don\u2019t put it so badly. The netizens still remember the scene of your family\u2019s group being abused by that obscure group two days ago. You can\u2019t do anything, so first place hatred you bring.][@Is the second season of Escape For Your Life out yet: Anyway, I believe in the program group\u2019s vision, and it\u2019s impossible for them to destroy their own brand. In the first season, the score of a certain team exceeded 9, and the guests were all super strong, so the program group will definitely take word-of-mouth as the top priority. P.S. new people can be added, no problem, but can you also let the original teams all return!][@Beautiful Fine Jeweled Xeriscape: Other people posting up selfies can even land on FJX\u2019s head, FJX is really miserable. I\u2019m carrying away my beautiful Gege, not\u00a0enjoying any success, and not accepting any stigma. On March 17, Kaleido ensemble show will premiere everywhere online. Welcoming everyone to come and watch!][@Fleet-footed little fool: Previously, the leaks always said it was a popular boy-band member\u00a0ah, some 18th rank small obscure group shouldn\u2019t try to get close to the word \u201cpopular\u201d\u00a0ba.][@Never\u00a0lllllb: Shit, Liang Ruo is really bitchy, hahaha][@Shipping fun things to save my dog life: Not a fan of either, but based just on their faces, I\u2019d pick Fang Juexia.]Online, fans kept increasingly sniping fiercely at each other, and \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019 ended up hanging on the Hot Search list for the whole day. This continued until the evening of the next day, when the program group\u2019s official Weibo finally released the list of the guests for the first episode, thereby confirming the fact that Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong were joining the new season of \u201cEscape\u201d, a topic that aroused a heated discussion again.Cheng Qiang specially comforted these two people by saying, \u201cYou guys have gotten more and more popular, so there will also be more and more disputes. This is very normal, don\u2019t take it to heart.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t really care about it. He knew very well that the fiercer the debate, the higher the popularity they would accumulate before the broadcast of\u00a0 \u2018Escape 2\u2019. Anyway, such a thing posed no problem when it came to their path to the ultimate goal, and he didn\u2019t really mind all the twists and turns they would have to face en route to it.Different from his cold-eyed bystander, Pei Tingsong was a thorn that would never suffer losses.On the night the most vicious curses were being rained upon them, he was still updating his Weibo by posting a photo. However, the picture he had taken was his palm with his five fingers outstretched. Interestingly, he had used a graffiti brush to paint all four fingers, except the middle finger, black. Only the finger in the middle stood out, vivid and eye-catching.Of course, this Weibo post was also gathered and recorded into a certain forum named \u201cPei Tingsong\u2019s\u00a0recklessness\u00a0incident log\u201d, which was full of his repeated victories.\u201cThese poor fans think they can seize the initiative by swearing a little bit more.\u201d Pei Tingsong laughed scornfully and commented, \u201cThey\u2019re being used as pawns for gaining popularity, and they don\u2019t even know it. Letting them rip into each other like this, when the whole world knows that the second season of Escape is about to start shooting.\u201dIt was also because of Pei Tingsong\u2019s picture, that thegroup of crazy fans were attracted over to his Weibo, and almost all the firepower was now concentrated solely on him.Pei Tingsong wasn\u2019t afraid of this at all and even posted a sentence in the comments\u2014[You guys don\u2019t really want to compete with a rapper in terms of cursing people out\u00a0ba?]He was an aberration in this circle. Possessing both background and personal strength, he used all the methods, which most PR teams would avoid, to smash people online relentlessly. Crushing this ant colony with his heavy fist was very much consistent with his aesthetics of perpetrating violence without sticking to any bottom line.Three days later, Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong went to the location where the reality TV\u2019s program group was going to be shooting. Fortunately, the second season of \u201cEscape For Your Life\u201d was set up to be shot in Beijing this time. After recording an episode, they could go home; it was really very convenient. They took Cheng Qiang\u2019s car to get to their destination early in the morning, and their Kaleido groupchat was in full swing by this time\u2014[@Your Fire Ge: @Kaleido\u2019s Only Big Boss, can you bring your cellphone in? If you really can\u2019t figure things out, come find your Fire Ge, me. I\u2019m really good at unlocking things.][@Sexy Teacher Yuan Doing Flower Hand Dance: Unlocking things hahahahaha. There won\u2019t be any horrifying places\u00a0ba? Damnit, I\u2019m so timid, my blood freezes just thinking about it.][@Water Water Water: There may be a little dark room or something. What if you two can\u2019t get out? By the way, can you guys bring water in? When they\u2019re halfway through with filming, will they give you anything to eat?][@The Original\u00a0M-Dash: My God, it\u2019s too hard if they don\u2019t give you any food. Fortunately, they didn\u2019t ask me to go (even if they did, I wouldn\u2019t be able to get out of the room) Juexia, you mustn\u2019t be in the same room as Xiao Pei. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll fall into a hurry, then pry open the door, and accidentally hurt you.]Pei Tingsong was left speechless when he read the chat record.[@Kaleido\u2019s Only Big Boss: I\u2019m going to film an escape room, not a picnic. Besides, I\u2019m sure I can get out of there. All of what you said has rebounded!]Just after he sent that out, Pei Tingsong looked up to see Fang Juexia fishing through the pockets of his jacket.[@Just a pretty face: I\u2019ve got milk candy and little cakes.][@The Original M-Dash: Great! Don\u2019t give them to Xiao Pei, starve that little cub.][@Kaledio\u2019s Only Big Boss: \u2026.]\u201cHere we are. Get out of the car\u00a0ba.\u201dAs soon as they arrived at the building where the filming\u00a0 was to take place, they were guided to the hairdressing room first by the staff. Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help but sigh; well-funded programs were just different.\u201cYour skin is really good\u00a0ah.\u201d The stylist was a young man, and he then asked, \u201cDo you want to cover up this birthmark?\u201dFang Juexia looked at his reflection in the mirror and shook his head. \u201cNo need.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgHis clothing style didn\u2019t seem to contain any distinctive features. He was wearing a white shirt paired with suit pants, and a knitted sweater vest on top of that. The stylist also specially placed a pair of non-prescription glasses on him, thereby giving him a very bookish air. Fang Juexia, as a loyal viewer of \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019, soon realized that this get-up might have something to do with his identity on the show.\u201cMy role couldn\u2019t be that of a teacher or a student\u00a0ba?\u201d Fang Juexia looked up at the stylist.\u201cYou are too clever.\u201d The stylist sprayed a little bit of styling gel onto his hair before declaring, \u201cDone. I really like styling good-looking children, no matter how I do it, I just can\u2019t fail.\u201dFang Juexia smiled in embarrassment. Before handing in his cellphone, he read the message he had just received.[Kaleido Pei Tingsong: In case we end up in a small dark room in a moment, remember to call me.]The corners of his mouth rose.[Just a pretty face: If you\u2019re the killer, wouldn\u2019t I become the sheep being sent straight into the mouth of a tiger?]It didn\u2019t take long for him to receive a reply.[Kaleido Pei Tingsong: My\u00a0tiger mouth\u00a0has already been bitten by you, where is there any other tiger mouth now?]Fang Juexia\u2019s fingers stopped moving and for the next few moments, he was at a loss on how to respond. This person was just too good at stirring up his emotions, especially when it came to guilt and compassion.But this feeling of guilt didn\u2019t persist for too long, because Pei Tingsong soon sent another message\u2014[Kaleido Pei Tingsong: Besides, if I really am the killer, I can kill you any time.]\u201cOkay\u00a0la, Juexia, we have to go over now.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d He could only give up and hand the cellphone over to the crew member, and then he followed them into the elevator to head to the designated floor. Before getting out of the elevator, the crew member covered his eyes to mask his vision.Masking his vision this time wasn\u2019t as simple as covering his eyes with an eye mask. Instead, a square hood was placed over his head, and in the blink of an eye, everything went dark, and there was someone supporting him and guiding him forward.This kind of operation easily increased the tension felt by the guests, but Fang Juexia was rather familiar with this feeling, so he didn\u2019t feel anything. He just felt that it was a bit of a pity; according to the schedule, he should be entering the escape room directly, that was to say\u2026.He wasn\u2019t the killer.This made Fang Juexia feel rather disappointed. Although he looked like he had a mild personality, he also very much\u00a0 wanted to try playing a villain-like role, like that of the killer who needed to possess nerves of steel and a strategic mind. It seems that he had missed this opportunity by just a little bit for this first episode.Fang Juexia heard the sound of a door opening. He was then helped into the room by the crew and was seated into a chair. He could feel that it was a very comfortable leather sofa. Subsequently, they tied him up with ropes and also fixed his legs in place, but they didn\u2019t remove his hood.\u201cThis is your cellphone, specifically designed to let you receive text messages from the program group.\u201d The crew member put the cellphone into the pocket of his trousers.\u201cYes, thank you.\u201dOnce in the dark, Fang Juexia, who had lost his sight, would usually become extremely sensitive. He could easily judge the trajectory of the rope based on the crew member\u2019s movements, and quickly outlined out a mental sketch of the way he had been tied up.The clock in his heart rotated for only ten minutes before Fang Juexia heard the door open again.It seemed that he wasn\u2019t the only one present in this escape room. However, he wasn\u2019t sure whether this was a good thing or not. Although more people possibly meant more help, no one could tell whether the other party had a good identity.Listening to the sound of the movements, Fang Juexia was sure that the newcomer was sitting right opposite him, and that the distance between them shouldn\u2019t be more than 50 cm, because he could clearly hear the sound of clothes rustling. There were also some sounds of metal clanging, which probably came from handcuffs.Once all sound disappeared, and the door of the room was closed for the last time, was when this escape room was finally initialized.The next moment, a rather familiar and slightly metallic sound filled the room, which was the intro theme to \u2018Escape For Your Life.\u2019\u201cWelcome to the second season of \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019. Now, please forget all about your original identities. In this game, your only identity is that of players who are currently trapped in the escape rooms. Please note that this game consists of not just a single escape room, but rather of many such rooms connected to each other, which means that when you open the door of your own escape room, you will enter a new escape room. There may be other people, who are just like you, trapped in there.\u201dFang Juexia possessed a good memory. Just after listening to the beginning bit, he noticed that this monologue was a complete copy of the first season\u2019s.\u201cPlease allow us to introduce the rules of our game. The person who escapes all the escape rooms and leaves the house in the shortest amount of time will be the winner of this game, and will thus gain the highest number of points. The rest of the players will be allotted points calculated in accordance with their escape durations, and one point will be deducted from the player\u2019s score for every extra ten minutes taken after the winning duration.\u201dThe voice paused for a moment, and then continued, \u201cI think we all know that the difference between \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019 and other escape room games is that there is a killer present among the players. Unlike ordinary players, this hidden killer holds the right to \u201ckill\u201d other players, and the killed players will be able to attain no points for that round. However, in each episode, the killer can only kill off one player.\u201d\u201cOrdinary players can also deduce the identity of the \u201ckiller\u201d through reasoning. Once all the players have gathered together, they can vote to \u201ckill\u201d this specific player. The players who manage to successfully vote the real killer out of the game will gain 1.5 times the points they would originally accrue. However, if the \u201ckiller\u201d becomes the final winner in the game, then every other ordinary player gains the status of being killed. Their points for that round are completely cleared, and the killer will get double the amount of points then.\u201dListening to this, the only difference from the first season seemed to be the change in the calculation of points. In the previous season, players who had correctly voted to oust the killer wouldn\u2019t be rewarded; this was the new mechanism that was added in the second season of the show.But if this was the case, wouldn\u2019t players go all out to find the killer\u2019s identity in order to get the reward, so wouldn\u2019t the game become more difficult for the killer?\u201cNone of you have any supporting decryption equipment on your bodies, and we hope that you won\u2019t use any physical means to break open the escape rooms. Each player has been equipped with a modified cellphone designed so that they receive their group information, get information on countdown timings, and for voting. Please note,\u201d Here, the narrator paused for a moment, \u201cthe only thing you can rely on in this game is your own intelligence and teamwork.\u201d\u201cThen good luck to everyone. Commencing the countdown\u2014\u201dWas that it?\u201cThree\u2026\u201d\u201cTwo\u2026\u201dFang Juexia still felt that it was a little strange.\u201cWait a minute.\u201d The narrator suddenly stopped the countdown and laughed. \u201cJust joking around with you guys. There is still another key rule, one that wasn\u2019t stated just now. Attention, please.\u201d\u201cThere is a new character being introduced for all players in this season\u2014 the double-faced knight.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 36Chapter 36 \u2013 Double-Faced KnightTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksNon-professionals should not imitateDouble-faced knight?\u201cAs the name suggests, double-faced knights can belong to the dark camp or the light camp.\u201d\u201cPlayers who get the role of the double-faced knight will choose the camp they wish to belong to based on the rules, after the game starts. If the double-faced knight chooses to side with the ordinary players, they will need to do their best to help the good guys find the killer. Once the double-faced knight is ousted from the game, be it from them being voted as the killer or being killed, the killer will gain an extra escape clue. If the good guys emerge victorious in the end, the double-faced knight will be awarded 1.5 times their original points.\u201dIt was like a gamble; dangerous as it was, the payoff was also quite considerable.The good guys needed to protect the knight, and the knight should also do their best to help the good guys. Once the light camp was chosen, the knight would become the killer\u2019s first target for murder.\u201cOn the flip side, if the double-faced knight chooses to side with the killer, they will join the dark camp. Once they escape, the good guys will get information on the killer\u2019s identity, in order to speed up the process of uncovering the killer. Of course, if the dark camp wins the game, the double-faced knight will also be awarded 1.5 times their original points.\u201dFang Juexia subconsciously calculated the probability of this character\u2019s victory. If the double-faced knight could privately get in touch with the killer, and the killer had some key parts of the plot in their hand, this wasn\u2019t really fair. The chances of attaining victory were higher if the killer\u2019s camp was chosen.\u201cYou all must be thinking that if you get the double-faced knight\u2019s role, you will choose the killer. But,\u201d the narrator\u2019s voice carried a hint of a smile as it warned, \u201cit\u2019s not going to be that easy this season.\u201d\u201cIn season two, the killer will no longer have the right to know the original story. Every player will receive a message about which role cards have been assigned to them only once the game starts. In other words, both the killer and the double-faced knight will be unaware of their own identity until they enter the escape room. Besides their own identity, they will not know anything else.\u201dIt was at this moment that Fang Juexia\u2019s slow senses finally started to grow excited.He finally got the fun of this change. Under such a rule, the double-faced knight, the killer, and the players belonging to the light camp\u2014 all had equal odds of winning, along with the fact that every player was trapped in an isolated black box and couldn\u2019t see any other player.It was inevitable that everyone would be worried and suspicious of their fellow players, even if they were partners belonging to the same camp. Any word was likely to break this unstable cooperative relationship and push the other party into the abyss.Too interesting.\u201cAll the rules have been relayed. Good luck to everyone.\u201d\u201cThe game has officially started.\u201dThe narration ended just as abruptly as it had started, with a murmur of static. This sudden silence worked to heighten the tension.Fang Juexia took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and created a mental sketch of the manner in which the staff members had previously tied him up.First, they put the rope around the back of his neck, then the two ends of the rope passed through his armpits to spiral around his arms. They had then bent and bound his two arms to his back, in an imitation of a yoga pose. After that, they had tied his two wrists. Finally\u2026.Fang Juexia was thinking about the last move when suddenly, he felt his foot being kicked.It was from the person sitting opposite him.Why did this person move in such a manner? It couldn\u2019t be that he also couldn\u2019t see anything?Fang Juexia waited for the next movement, and when it didn\u2019t come, he became even more sure of his judgment.Yes, this person had entered the room later than himself, and so probably didn\u2019t know there was a second person in the escape room.\u201cI\u2019m opposite you.\u201d Fang Juexia opened his mouth, and spoke softly, having no intentions of scaring the other person. \u201cBe careful, I can\u2019t see either. If you accidentally fall over or run into something, it will be difficult for me to help you for the time being.\u201dAfter this brief statement, Fang Juexia did not intend to continue to entangle with him. He continued to recall how he was bound up\u2014after winding the rope around his wrists, the crew member seemed to have pulled upward. Yes, the two ends of the rope had gone through the one that was first wound around the back of his neck, before being pulled down and tied into a knot.That was to say, as long as he could untie the knot hanging right above his wrist, he had a chance to get out of his bindings.After a brief silence, a slight laugh sounded out from the other side.It was very short, with weak sound waves rolling up before floating across the darkness towards him.For others, a laugh would carry very little information, but this particular laugh managed to break the calmness Fang Juexia had maintained since entering the escape room.\u201cPei Tingsong.\u201dFang Juexia called out his name directly. He was very sure to the point that he didn\u2019t even think about how the audience would react, especially the CP fans, after this episode was broadcast, as they watched him figure out the identity of the person opposite him so firmly and easily.Another length of silence followed after this proclamation.The continued silence made him more sure of his judgment.\u201cReally boring.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice sounded out as expected, and even carried a trace of complaint as he commented, \u201cI thought I would be locked up with new friends.\u201dAlready used to Pei Tingsong\u2019s banter by now, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t take this comment seriously. He said frankly, \u201cWhen you escape, you can find new friends.\u201d\u201cMy hands are handcuffed,\u201d Pei Tingsong said.\u201cI know.\u201dPei Tingsong laughed again. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d\u201cHeard it.\u201dWhile dealing with him, Fang Juexia reached for that knot. Years of dance practice had given him a flexibility that ordinary people couldn\u2019t attain. Although his wrists were bound, the program team had probably been worried that binding them too tightly would affect the guests\u2019 blood circulation, so they had left a little room. He moved his wrist and tried to reach up as high as he could.His fingertip really touched something similar to a knot.But if he wanted to untie it completely, he would have to work harder.Fang Juexia suddenly heard a sound that seemed to come out when a bunch of building blocks collapsed. He asked the opposite side, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice sounded very\u00a0effortless, as if just like he had announced before, he was just here to play. \u201cAlthough my hands are handcuffed, it\u2019s just that I can\u2019t separate them. As soon as I touched the table in front of me, it seems that I pushed down the pile of metal blocks there.\u201dHe said it as though that was a matter of course.Fang Juexia heard some other sounds and guessed that Pei Tingsong was probably putting something together. Suddenly, he heard the sound of a click, as if something just happened to snap together.After hearing this sound several times in a row, he heard a\u00a0didi\u00a0sound. Strangely, it wasn\u2019t coming from the speakers in the room, nor was it coming from Pei Tingsong\u2019s side, but rather, it was from his own hood\u2014\u201cDing Dong.\u201dWhen the last tone ended, to Fang Juexia\u2019s surprise, the square hood that was caging his face scattered, like a gift box bursting apart, each side falling in different directions.Fang Juexia could see everything in an instant.Pei Tingsong, whose head was also caged in by a hood, was sitting opposite him across a table, and his hands handcuffed. If Fang Juexia hadn\u2019t been familiar with his voice, he feared that he wouldn\u2019t have been able to guess his identity through the hood.\u201cHm?\u201d Pei Tingsong made a questioning sound.\u201cMy hood split open.\u201d Fang Juexia looked around; the metal blocks that Pei Tingsong had been fumbling with were pressed into the table. \u201cIt should be the mechanism in front of you that controlled my hood.\u201dLooking around, this room looked like a counseling room with many books on psychology on the shelf to the side. He looked at Pei Tingsong\u2019s clothes again\u2014 he was wearing a white shirt, with a name plate pinned to the front.Maybe his character was that of a psychologist.Looking down, Fang Juexia found a display screen embedded in the armrest of his sofa chair. He tried to bend to one side and touch its screen with his elbow.The screen lit up and displayed a digital clock, with the hours, minutes, and seconds all formed of seven LED lines.At this point, a sound was emitted from the hood on Pei Tingsong\u2019s head, a female AI voice.\u201cExcuse me, what time is it?\u201dSure enough, it was a time? But this seemed to be oversimplifying it.\u201cWhat did you find?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked.\u201cHm.\u201d Fang Juexia identified the LED numbers on the display\u201409:15:50He tried out this answer, even though it was really too simple. \u201c9:15:50 a.m?\u201dThe hood made a harsh\u00a0di\u00a0sound.\u201cSorry, wrong answer.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgFang Juexia had already expected this outcome. \u201cSure enough, it\u2019s wrong\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s wrong, and yet you still said it,\u201d Pei Tingsong murmured, \u201cMy ears are going to explode.\u201d\u201cShhh\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia examined the six numbers in front of him again. It really was a very common digital clock, and there was nothing wrong with it, so then why had his\u00a0 answer been wrong?There must be something he was misunderstanding.He focused his attention on these numbers, and kept feeling as though something was wrong, but he couldn\u2019t pinpoint it. These small LED lines clearly formed these six numbers.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to get stuck at the smallest hurdle at the very beginning\u00a0ba, that\u2019s going too far.\u201d Pei Tingsong began to say again and again, \u201cI even wanted to take first place, but now it looks like I\u2019m going to be the number one player after the winning order is counted in reverse.\u201dFang Juexia couldn\u2019t help frowning. \u201cDon\u2019t keep saying \u2018first place\u2019, \u2018first place\u2019, what number one\u00a0ah\u2026.\u201dAll of a sudden, something flashed through his head, and he leaned over again to look at the six numbers, especially at the number 1 after the first colon.1\u2026\u2026He finally discovered what was wrong.The vertical and horizontal lines in the LED display weren\u2019t forming square rectangles, but were actually polygons with varying edges and corners, some of which were hexagonal. In previous digital clocks, the 1 was made up of \u201cvertical lines\u201d, but the left side would be slightly lower than the right side, thus forming a\u00a0small slope, and looking more like a printed 1.But now, the 1 in this display was reversed, and its left side was higher than the right side.So that\u2019s what it was.\u201cI see, you have to flip it around.\u201d Fang Juexia tried to turn around and identify the numbers, \u201c05, 51, 60\u2026\u201dFang Juexia touched the screen again, and the voice from Pei Tingsong\u2019s hood once again asked, \u201cExcuse me, what time is it?\u201d\u201c5:52 in the morning.\u201dTwo seconds later, a \u201cding dong\u201d sounded out. Pei Tingsong\u2019s hood also scattered in the same way his hood had, which was a little funny to Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes, for it made Pei Tingsong seem like a surprise gift that had been wrapped up, and which was now appearing in front of him.As soon as light hit his eyes, he saw that Fang Juexia was smiling. Pei Tingsong frowned and asked, \u201cWhat are you smiling for? You\u2019re even all tied up.\u201dFang Juexia disapproved but still kept a smile on his face. \u201cI can untie this rope, do you believe me?\u201dPei Tingsong looked at the rope on his body from all angles. His hands were completely tied behind his back, with his arm having been bent into his back as much as possible\u2014 there was almost no possibility of this person being able to move at all.However, he did not dare to say that he did not believe him. Based on Fang Juexia\u2019s character, if he wasn\u2019t completely sure of himself, he wouldn\u2019t say anything.So Pei Tingsong sat back in his chair, and even with his hands handcuffed, he possessed the bearing of a master. He faced Fang Juexia and said with a smile, \u201cPlease.\u201dFang Juexia straightened up his upper body, and noticed that the ties at his wrist had loosened a lot due to the activity just now.With great effort, he reached up and grabbed that huge knot. His fingers groped around, following the twists and turns of the winding on the rope to reach the end. This kind of binding, carried out using only one rope, even if it was more complicated, both of its ends must eventually overlap somewhere.Pei Tingsong quietly watched the whole thing. Under his gaze, Fang Juexia\u2019s body was tightly bound by the snake-like rope, and the intertwined rope rubbed against the fabric of his clothes, outlining a clear inverted triangle figure.As he made movements to escape, the contours of his muscles also started moving. When he turned his head to look behind him, the curve of his neck elongated, looking beautiful and slender, containing a fragile sense of beauty. The thick rope slipped down the collar of his shirt and rubbed against the back of his neck, turning his sensitive skin red.The delight of watching wasn\u2019t immediate, but it was very novel.\u201cGot it.\u201dHe heard Fang Juexia murmuring to himself. The tight grip of the binding made his breathing tighten, and he gasped a little, with the pale skin on his forehead now covered with sweat, which shone with a delicate luster under the light.This performance didn\u2019t last too long. Although every move seemed to linger in Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart, Fang Juexia, true to his word, managed to untie the knot hanging on his back using his amazing flexibility and memory recall.He turned his neck, and he could now put his arms down, for they weren\u2019t bent anymore, but there was still a knot around his wrists.Being able to go to this extent, Pei Tingsong already couldn\u2019t help but applaud him. \u201cToo strong. But what about the rest, can your fingers twist around and untie the knot on your wrists?\u201dFang Juexia glanced at him, then looked at the camera on the table pointed at him before taking a deep breath.\u201cI hope that for the next segment, the program team will help me put up a warning notice when it\u2019s broadcast.\u201d After saying this, Fang Juexia moved forward on the chair as far as possible, as if to make room for his back. He then moved his shoulders and slightly pulled at his wrists, which were tied up behind him. \u201cThe following movements are very dangerous. Non-professionals should not imitate them, especially children.\u201dPei Tingsong wore a completely puzzled expression, for who would have known that in the next moment, Fang Juexia would raise his bound arms backward and suddenly jerk them forward. He managed to turn his arms, which were tied behind his back, all the way to the front!\u201cYou\u2026. How did you do that?!\u201d Pei Tingsong was so flabbergasted that he couldn\u2019t say anything more, and instead just started laughing. He felt as if he was watching an acrobatic performance, that seemed to violate the way human bodies were designed to work.80% of the directors in the program group were also startled right now, at the fact that this kind of position, where his hands had been tied behind his back, had been solved by the person himself. This was just too exaggerated.Fang Juexia rolled his joints, lifted his bound wrists, and tried to bite at the last knot with his teeth. He explained, \u201cI\u2019m very flexible; I started learning how to dance all the way back in kindergarten.\u201dAt this moment, vibrations sounded out from the cellphone in his pocket. At the same time, the same sound of vibration also resounded from Pei Tingsong\u2019s side.Putting aside the knot for the time being, Fang Juexia took out his cellphone with his bound hands and lowered his head to unlock it.The screen lit up, and a sentence popped out\u2014[Escape For Your Life: Hello player, welcome to the card drawing segment.\u00a0Your\u00a0role in this round of games is\u2026.]The text disappeared, and two cards appeared on the screen. One was a picture of a knight in black armor, while the other was that of a shining white knight.[Double-faced knight.][Please select your camp.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He actually got a special role in the very first episode.Fang Juexia glanced at the camera in front of him.It couldn\u2019t be that the directors had issued their role cards based on their performance just now? But giving this kind of role to a completely new player in the very first episode, were they really not afraid of screwing up the whole show?He glanced in front of him, only to see that Pei Tingsong seemed to have finished checking his role as well. He stuffed his cellphone back into his pocket and looked up at him.\u201cWhy do you have a face filled with woe?\u201d The corners of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth drew up as he guessed, \u201cDid you draw the killer?\u201dFang Juexia raised his eyebrows. This way of bluffing him into revealing his identity totally wouldn\u2019t work on him. \u201cYes\u00a0ah, you\u2019re with the killer in the very first game. How do you feel about that?\u201dPei Tingsong, who was handcuffed, leaned forward across the table. With both of his eyes pinned on Fang Juexia, he put on a pitiful and innocent expression. \u201cI\u2019m especially scared.\u201dHowever, as soon as he finished saying that, he began to laugh.This appearance of his really makes him look like a crazy killer\u2014thought Fang Juexia.It couldn\u2019t be that Pei Tingsong was the killer?That thought flashed through his mind. If it was really two newbies taking the special role cards together, then the program group may really be crazy.On second thought though, he remembered that his senior brother had also been a\u00a0newcomer\u00a0when appearing on the first episode of the first season\u2014a completely blank slate. However, the first role he drew was that of the killer, which showed that the program team didn\u2019t seem to consider too much when distributing role cards. The only possible consideration they had should be on how well the killer matched with the script.Even so, he still couldn\u2019t rule out the possibility that Pei Tingsong had gotten the killer role card.The table was positioned just right for him to block the movements of his hands. Fang Juexia clicked on the role card on the screen, chose his camp, and pretended to stick his head down as he stuffed his cellphone into his pocket. Then he expressionlessly raised his hands and continued to bite at the knot with his teeth.He was sure that there was a tool to cut the rope present in some corner of the room, but he didn\u2019t feel like spending the effort to find it. Anyway, as long as the goal was achieved, there was no difference between good and bad when going through the process to reach it.\u201cIf you continue like this, you count as doing a brute force attack\u00a0ba.\u201d Pei Tingsong scoffed, \u201cThe program group should have given the rope to me and the handcuffs to you, just to be on the safe side.\u201d As he said this, he suddenly noticed that his handcuffs had the letter B printed on them; its color was very light, making it not easily detectable.If something was marked, then there must be a puzzle accompanying it.The space Pei Tingsong had available to move around was very limited; he could only check if there were any other clues on or around the table. Now that his hood had been removed, he could see that the block he had just pressed into the table had a capital letter \u2018A\u2019 written on it.Intuition told him that this \u2018A\u2019 was related to some kind of puzzle.Looking up at Fang Juexia, Pei Tingsong wanted to tell him about the letters he had found, but unexpectedly discovered a very small card hanging on the rope that bound Fang Juexia\u2019s arm. This card was currently shaking due to his movements.\u201cStop moving for now.\u201dUpon hearing Pei Tingsong\u2019s words, Fang Juexia stopped and looked at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a card hanging from your left arm.\u201dAfter listening to his words, Fang Juexia looked to his side and saw that it was a small wooden card with the letter \u03b1 written on it. Pei Tingsong also managed to finally see it clearly.A and \u03b1.\u201cSo it\u2019s not English letters.\u201d Pei Tingsong smiled, not expecting to find the corresponding letter so quickly.\u201cWhat English letters?\u201d Fang Juexia asked.\u201cThe letter on the card on your arm corresponds to the one on the block of metal I just pressed into the table.\u201d Pei Tingsong took out the block and showed the side printed with the letter to Fang Juexia, explaining, \u201cThey are all Greek letters, one in the uppercase and its corresponding one in lowercase.\u201dNow Fang Juexia understood; this was probably the tool designated by the program group to untie the rope, but how would a block cut the rope?Pei Tingsong held the block in both of his hands, trying to knock on it and twist it, but no change took place from any of those actions.It couldn\u2019t be that it was broken?Only after he looked at it closer did he discover that near the edge of the cube was an almost indiscernible strip, just like a small drawer hidden in the cube. Pei Tingsong tried to push at it with his fingers, but that strip was too narrow for his fingers to push open.Fang Juexia felt that doing all this was hopeless. Even if Pei Tingsong found a way, it was very unlikely that he would just give it to him. He might as well solve the problem by himself; maybe he could just bite the knot open.\u201cI see now.\u201d Pei Tingsong soon thought of a new way. With his handcuffed hands, he took off the nameplate on his shirt. It was a thin rectangular piece of metal with the words \u201cDoctor Tian\u201d written on it.Sure enough, his character was that of a doctor?Pei Tingsong connected a corner of the metal nameplate to that metal cube marked with an A, and pushed it into that small strip. Sure enough, a square piece of the cube popped out with that push, just like pulling out a flat block from a drawer!The end of the square facing him was the strip attached to the cube just now, and its front end, that emerged from the middle of the cube, was as thin as a blade.\u201cHere, found it.\u201d Pei Tingsong held the square \u201cblade\u201d in his hand and waved it at Fang Juexia.Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t very happy inside, because based on his past experiences, he knew what was going to happen next. He could only hope that because they were filming, Pei Tingsong wouldn\u2019t say\u2026.\u201cBeg me, and I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d Pei Tingsong clearly didn\u2019t bother to pretend even a little.Sure enough, he still said it\u2026 Fang Juexia sighed in his heart.\u201cNo need.\u201d He still chose to try and bite open the knot on his own.Upon looking at him lowering his head and biting at the rope, Pei Tingsong glanced at the handcuffs on his own hands.He really couldn\u2019t be teased.\u201cIt\u2019s a joke\u00a0ma.\u201d After watching Fang Juexia use his teeth like that, even Pei Tingsong had to wince. \u201cI know your teeth are good, but the program group arranged everything carefully to make us cooperate in order to escape. You should also let me perform.\u201d\u201cHere,\u201d he said, pressing the blade on the table and pushing it over to the opposite side where Fang Juexia was seated. \u201cThe greatness of mankind lies in the use of tools.\u201dFang Juexia glanced at the blade that had been pushed over.Pei Tingsong being so cooperative today made him suspicious. Fang Juexia speculated internally\u2014it couldn\u2019t be that he wanted to play nice and get him to vote for him.Forget it. Anyway, since the blade had already been found, if it wasn\u2019t used, it\u2019d be a waste.Just as he reached out with his hands, he saw Pei Tingsong put his elbows on the table as he propped his cheek against his two handcuffed hands, with one hand covered in a glove and the other bare. His face literally had the words \u2018lonely and pitiful\u2019 written on it, and he even let out a long sigh as he reminisced, \u201cOh, I\u2019m missing my Lily.\u201dFang Juexia had to force himself internally into keeping calm.He had known that Pei Tingsong would never let him down.\u201cYou can bring her to China.\u201dPei Tingsong shook his head. \u201cShould just forget it, can\u2019t afford two doggies.\u201dBeing faced with such insinuations from Pei Tingsong, Fang Juexia tried very hard to keep his emotions calm. He could almost imagine the scene after the program was broadcast; the fans would definitely spam the barrage and ask if they had a little dog in the dorms.He shouldn\u2019t have replied to this little devil at all from the beginning.In order to move freely, Fang Juexia still picked up the \u201cblade\u201d. Although it didn\u2019t have the sharpness of a real blade, it was sharp enough to cut the rope. He tried moving it back and forth several times, and sure enough, the rope was being cut.Suddenly, the narrator\u2019s voice sounded again as he announced, \u201cPlayers, please note that the double-faced knight has made their choice. For a period of time, the black or white face of the knight will be kept hidden, but it is only temporary. As the players continue to solve plot clues, we will select an appropriate time and announce the knight\u2019s chosen camp in the form of a formal announcement.\u201dPei Tingsong sprawled comfortably across the couch, lazily slacking off, and commented, \u201cThey really can play.\u201dThis period, where they didn\u2019t state whether the knight was good or bad, was the most suitable time for fishing in troubled waters. Every player only possessed a small amount of information, and although no one trusted each other, they still had to communicate and cooperate with each other in order to piece together the whole plot. Depending on what was said during this entirely dark period, the direction of the whole game could be affected.After hearing this announcement, Fang Juexia started to secretly rejoice. He had initially been worried that his camp would be exposed soon after he had picked it, but it seemed that the program group wanted to keep the players and audience in suspense for a longer period of time. In spite of the tempestuous storm brewing in his heart, Fang Juexia\u2019s expression didn\u2019t allow even the slightest tremor to be shown, as if all of his attention was still focused on the knot around his wrists.As a knight, this particular period of time was his prime opportunity, and he had to escape this room as soon as possible to collect more information and thus control the rhythm of the game.After seeing Fang Juexia work so hard in order to break free, Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t stay idle either. Although it was his first time playing this game, the logic was clear: in the case where two people were tied up in designated places at the very beginning, the tools for them to break themselves free must be hidden nearby.And what was closest to him was this table.His gaze hastily swept across the table, but there wasn\u2019t much there. In front of him was a blank notebook with a pen beside it. Next to that was a desk lamp with a round lampshade, and there was another desk lamp in front of Fang Juexia on the other side.\u201cWhy is it that only the light at your end has been turned on\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong muttered to himself. There had to be something meaningful about having only one of the two lights on. He stretched out both of his handcuffed hands and tried hard to get close to the lamp placed at the upper left corner of the table. Just then, he unexpectedly noticed a letter that was engraved on the base of the lamp.It was \u03b2.Found it.Pei Tingsong used all his strength to get to the switch, and when he finally touched it, the light suddenly turned on.Only after spending a long time cutting the rope did it finally break. Fang Juexia rubbed his chafed red wrists, then gathered up the rope and put it on the table. That was when he saw Pei Tingsong examining something closely in the light of the lamp, so he stood up and walked to him.A faint shape had appeared on the lampshade.It was the shape of a key.Just as Pei Tingsong was about to pull off the lampshade, Fang Juexia, who was more agile at the moment, grabbed this opportunity. After stripping off the lampshade, it could be seen that the lamp had only one isolated bulb, and that a small key was hidden within that transparent bulb.\u201cYou really throw things away when you\u2019re done with them\u00a0ah.\u201d Pei Tingsong, who had lost the initiative, still laughed. \u201cAm I your handyman?\u201dFang Juexia smashed the light bulb and picked up the small key from the debris. The metal key was very small, and he was afraid it couldn\u2019t be used to open anything besides the handcuffs. He held it in his hand and played with it for a while. Then he leaned against the table and faced Pei Tingsong with a calm expression. \u201cIsn\u2019t this the way this kind of game progresses? Everyone is suspicious of each other, but we all have to make use of each other.\u201dThe eyes beneath these glasses were tranquil. Under the dark rules of the game, Fang Juexia uttered these kind of words to someone for the first time in his life\u2014\u201cIs it your turn to beg me now?\u201dPei Tingsong leaned back on the sofa with a cynical smile on his face.In his eyes, the Fang Juexia of this very moment still carried red rope marks left on his wrists and neck, while the collar of his shirt was spread open, and he had a pair of refined glasses on his face. This was a more fragile and scholarly look than that of the usual Fang Juexia, and this look also brought with it an inviolable sense of taboo. Even when he said such threatening words, with that face and just that amount of coldness seeping from his bones, he didn\u2019t really sound like much of a deterrent.Instead, it seemed as if he was teasing him.It was like Fang Juexia was inviting him to break the rules.Therefore, the more threatening Fang Juexia tried to be as he stood against him in confrontation, the more excited Pei Tingsong felt.This was a really abnormal feeling, but the adrenaline rushing through his body right now wasn\u2019t a lie. Maybe he was just born with some slightly mutated genes in his bones.Pei Tingsong curled up on the sofa and smiled at him. As soon as the fierceness in the corner of his eyes and eyebrows disappeared, his face actually gave off a completely youthful feel.\u201cJuexia Ge,\u201d his voice was obedient, and right now, in front of the camera, he really seemed like the youngest in a family. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to not help me\u00a0ba?\u201d\u201cIf I help you, what can I get?\u201d Fang Juexia held the key in his hand and expressionlessly scratched out a mark out with it on the table, upon which the table let out a plaintive whine.\u201cIf you\u2019re the killer, or the black knight, what will I do then?\u201dHe looked really cute when he asked \u2018what will I do then.\u2019 Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t stop the corners of his mouth from rising. \u201cHow\u2019s this\u00a0ba, as long as you help me unlock the handcuffs and the foot cuffs, I promise you that I\u2019ll agree to an alliance with you.\u201dFang Juexia glanced at him, but his eyes didn\u2019t meet Pei Tingsong\u2019s. Pei Tingsong looked completely at ease, as if he completely wasn\u2019t the one at a disadvantage currently.In his heart, he calculated the sincerity of Pei Tingsong\u2019s alliance offer.If Pei Tingsong was an ordinary player, an alliance with him would be harmless and result in all gains. If he was the killer, that option still seemed to be alright. In any case, for the double-faced knight, it was beneficial to gain the trust of any player.But this guy he was facing was someone with no bottom line; what he would do or say next was completely unpredictable, and these premises and assumptions would be totally meaningless. Even if they formed an alliance right now, if in the next moment Pei Tingsong voted to have him executed, Fang Juexia wouldn\u2019t be surprised. Getting into an alliance with a bomb, one would always be able to predict the tragic ending in advance.However\u2026.In this kind of game of fishing in troubled waters, people without bottom lines were more likely to win.Fang Juexia pulled at Pei Tingsong\u2019s hands and looked down at the keyhole in his handcuffs. \u201cWhat counts as an alliance?\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgPei Tingsong sat up, drew closer to him, and said in a sincere voice, \u201cIn the first round, I will unconditionally vote with you and try my very best to take you out of this room with me.\u201d His tone was suggestive as he continued, \u201cYou will always have a time when you need me.\u201dFang Juexia had no words and so quietly opened the handcuffs for him.\u201cToo uncomfortable.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s hands could finally move nimbly, and he stretched to his fullest extent, rolling his wrists around. He then lowered his head to look at the foot cuffs below. These two foot cuffs didn\u2019t have any keyholes, instead, they had a four digit passcode lock, and there was also a character on the code lock \u2013 \u03b4.The next step\u2014he should find the corresponding capital Greek letter.At this time, Fang Juexia was scrutinizing the entire room. Their table was in the center of the room, and on the right was a five-story bookshelf, propped up against the wall. It was stuffed full with books, most of which were related to psychology, but occasionally, some humanities and social science books could be seen mixed in there, and there were even some popular science books on subjects such as astronomy and mathematics as well. There were a few ornaments hanging on the wall, and there was only one painting in the room, positioned right next to the door. Its width was about the width of the door frame, but it was much shorter in height.The only door in the whole room faced their table. Fang Juexia approached it, and was surprised to find that the door had neither a keyhole nor a passcode lock; there was only a display screen embedded into the door panel. He tried touching it, and sure enough, the display lit up, and an electronically synthesized tone was then emitted\u2014[Please do not leave until the end of your appointment.]\u201cAppointment?\u201d Fang Juexia was puzzled.It couldn\u2019t be that this building was actually a psychologist\u2019s clinic, and he was a patient who had come to see a doctor?After the alert concluded, the screen went dark, and a white \u03b3 appeared in the middle.The third Greek letter had appeared, but what did it correspond to?Just when he wasn\u2019t sure, a man\u2019s voice suddenly sounded out from the stereo in the room\u2014[Now, next\u00a0please, I will hypnotize you:]\u201cHypnotize?\u201d Pei Tingsong felt that this was strange. \u201cWhat did you move just now?\u201dFang Juexia pulled back and pointed to the screen on the door panel. \u201cThis.\u201dPei Tingsong saw the letter on the display screen; it didn\u2019t match the \u03b4 printed on his foot cuffs, and it was in lowercase, but his intuition told him that it would have some special meaning as the game progressed.\u201cJuexia Ge, help me find out if there is anything printed or marked with a triangle symbol or the letter \u0394 in the room. It may be a clue to the code to unlock the cuffs on my feet.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201dThe man\u2019s voice, coming from the stereo, continued non-stop, his voice was slow and peaceful, as if he were really hypnotizing someone.[Your muscles on your body, relax them all. Then empty the thoughts in your mind and enter into the void. Let the top of your mind stretch out into its deepest reaches. The outside shelf of the world that created these emotions is where they return to\u2026]Fang Juexia went with what Pei Tingsong had told him to do and looked for things marked with the letter \u0394.If he considered things from the game designer\u2019s point of view, he must consider the worst possibility\u2014 that of the two people locked in the same escape room deciding not to cooperate with each other. If that happened, Pei Tingsong, whose hands and feet were both tied up, would be isolated and helpless. The clue that could let him restore his own freedom therefore must definitely be in a place he could reach through his own efforts.Hypnotic words reverberated throughout the room, carrying the faint power capable of soothing emotions and calming down any anxiety.[Now think of a world where depression and resentment never interfere with you. Then feel the splendid palace built by your consciousness. Climb the bookcase-like steps and go to the deepest place. There is the home of the soul in all its tranquility\u2026.]Something within reach.Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes locked onto the table. Pei Tingsong was bent over it, writing something down, and there were only a few things on the table. The lamp? No, it had already been used. Pen and paper, Pei Tingsong was using them right now, and he should have already checked them. There was nothing else there.According to conventional thinking, if there was nothing on the table\u2026\u2026Underneath the table.Fang Juexia immediately crouched down and shifted to look under that big table. However, even this movement of his didn\u2019t manage to distract Pei Tingsong from his task.The space under the table was very small. Fang Juexia simply knelt down and tilted his head back, as far as possible, to look at the bottom of the table. Sure enough, there was a convex triangle there. It couldn\u2019t be pressed, so it didn\u2019t seem to be a button.He changed his plans and tried to grasp the triangular block and pull it out.Sure enough, the wooden block moved as he pulled at it, and a wooden triangular prism, with a piece of paper stuffed in it, was finally pulled out. Fang Juexia took it out and spread it on the floor.This paper was very similar to the game of Sudoku that he usually played, but there were no numbers in the grid. It was more like an ordinary scratch paper, and in the middle of the paper was a line of numbers: 258, 321456987, 12369, 12369874.What is the meaning of this?\u00a0Fang Juexia knelt on the ground, lost in thought.The \u201chypnotic monologue\u201d resounding in the room continued on\u2014[Look, the blue sea in the middle of this pure land. Now a book this is not, don\u2019t be afraid, the rustling chilly wind will never blow here. Stretch yourself open and spread out in the warm sunshine to your heart\u2019s content\u2026]The voice was so loud that he almost couldn\u2019t think.[Now then, it is time to slowly open the door of your subconscious mind. To open up your memory and your true self.]Fang Juexia held the piece of paper tightly and scanned every number with his eyes, trying to find any patterns. It couldn\u2019t be that the number that was next in this sequence was a four-digit number that could be entered into Pei Tingsong\u2019s cuffs?But, however he looked, he couldn\u2019t see any pattern to these numbers.Just then, Pei Tingsong suddenly slapped the table, startling Fang Juexia into twitching a bit as he lay underneath the table.\u201cJuexia, quickly go to the bookcase over there. The blue book on the top shelf! Bring it over here.\u201dWhat?Fang Juexia\u2019s face was covered with a completely confused expression. Holding the numbered paper in his hand, he crawled forward and came to the edge of the table. He even supported himself up using the knee in front of him and looked up at Pei Tingsong as he asked, \u201cThe bookcase?\u201dIt was only at this time that the two players, who had been engrossed in deciphering their respective puzzles, finally discovered how ambiguous and embarrassing the pose the two of them had ended up in was. Fang Juexia had pretty much tunneled his body in between Pei Tingsong\u2019s knees, and was even looking up at him with a very pure expression at this moment.Fortunately, his knitted vest was tightly wrapped around his shirt, otherwise, from this angle, Pei Tingsong would have been able to take in everything with just a glance. All of a sudden, he found himself a little tongue tied. \u201cYou-you get out first, go to the bookshelf to see if there are any blue books on the top shelf.\u201dFang Juexia let out an \u201coh\u201d, and quickly escaped the confines of the table like an angry little gray mouse. He placed the paper with the numbers on the table for the time being, and rubbed his burning ears. Unbeknownst to him, his knees had grown numb from kneeling, and suddenly, he found himself unable to support his body while standing upright, so he had to lean against the table, and only after he recovered a bit did he quickly walk over to the bookcase.Although he really didn\u2019t know how Pei Tingsong had gotten this clue, based on his tone just now, it didn\u2019t seem like he was trying to trick him.Fortunately, the bookshelf wasn\u2019t too tall, and Fang Juexia\u2019s height of 1.8m easily helped him in reaching the books on the top shelf. It was only at this time that he discovered a small ukulele on the top shelf.So many books, with all five shelves stuffed to the brim\u2014 if there was no clue given, they may have had to spend the whole day here. Fang Juexia looked carefully from left to right, his eyes sweeping across each book, before finally finding the one required.\u201cThe program group is too insidious. The spine of the book is white, but the front and back covers are blue.\u201dPei Tingsong, who had successfully cracked the clue, was very excited. \u201cShow me.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Fang Juexia pulled the book out and opened it. Inside it was a piece of paper with a few big words on its top\u2014 Appointment Registration Form.There were some names at the bottom of this form.\u201cTeacher Yan, Zaozao\u2026\u201dJust as he was reading the names aloud and walking in Pei Tingsong\u2019s direction, a loud sound came from behind him.He also heard Pei Tingsong\u2019s incredulous voice\u2014\u201cWhat the heck\u2026\u201dFang Juexia turned around and witnessed the bookcase behind him slowly move along the left wall with his own eyes, and the white wall that was revealed unexpectedly had a door in it![Congratulations, successfully unlocked.]This sound wasn\u2019t coming from their room, but was a cue from the room next door.The next second, the door that had suddenly appeared opened, and a long and narrow shadow appeared one step before its owner. When Fang Juexia saw this familiar face, he had to admit that goosebumps broke out all over his body at this moment.\u201cYi? There are two little friends in this room\u00a0ah.\u201d The person who entered was wearing a high school uniform, which consisted of a white shirt and black trousers, and he had a school badge and a name tag pinned to his chest. He laughed and joked, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, being patronized with a handsome little guy, I even forgot to introduce myself.\u201dHe took a step forward, smoothly entering their escape room territory.\u201cHello\u00a0ya, I\u2019m Xia Xiqing.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, he just hadn\u2019t expected that the first unknown player they would actually meet would be Xia Xiqing, the master of the last season of \u2018Escape For Your Life.\u2019It wasn\u2019t that Xia Xiqing\u2019s intelligence would definitely rank first among all the players, but rather, his playing style was special and confusing, and he was definitely the best when it came to psychological warfare. No matter what kind of role card he drew, he always played rather villainously.\u201cHello.\u201d Fang Juexia bowed respectfully and introduced himself, \u201cI am Fang Juexia.\u201d He then remembered the Didi who couldn\u2019t stand up to say hello, so he introduced him as well, \u201cHe\u2019s Pei Tingsong, and his feet are cuffed right now, so he can\u2019t get up. Both of us are members of Kaleido, and are the new players in this season.\u201d\u201cVery good\u00a0ah.\u201d Xia Xiqing nodded with satisfaction. \u201cThis season, everyone\u2019s a handsome little Ge.\u201dSince Fang Juexia had already taken the initiative to speak for him, Pei Tingsong, the one who always took on the rebellious role, just raised his hand as a greeting towards Xia Xiqing, who was still standing near the door.\u201cHow are you this serious-looking? I like little serious people the most.\u201d Xia Xiqing laughed and immediately pulled Fang Juexia into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m not actually a senior, I\u2019m just an artist, don\u2019t be so formal.\u201d After saying that, he also patted Fang Juexia\u2019s chest.Fang Juexia seldom had such intimate contact with strangers. Even though he had seen Xia Xiqing on TV more than once, he still wasn\u2019t really used to him.He glanced at Xia Xiqing\u2019s name tag, on which was written \u201cZaozao\u201d. He couldn\u2019t help but grip the appointment form in his hand tighter.\u201cAnd I\u2019ve known about you for a long time,\u201d said Xia Xiqing as he looked into his eyes.Fang Juexia became a bit suspicious at this, and his way of expressing his suspicions was also to very directly question, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWhy else?\u201d Xia Xiqing was amused by him and explained, \u201cBecause you\u2019re attractive\u00a0ah,\u00a0I noticed it the first time you entered the Hot Search list. Ah, and the behind the scene posts made by the magazine, along with those videos of the two of you\u2014peak aesthetic. Has no one ever told you before? The birthmark at the corner of your eye is just like the\u00a0finishing touch to a painting. I\u2019ve also always wanted to draw you. Do you prefer watercolor or oil paintings? How about I paint a big one for you to hang up?\u201d\u201cEn\u2026\u201d Just as Fang Juexia was about to respond, he heard the very deliberate sound of someone clearing his throat nearby, which diverted his attention from this big boss.\u201cGeges, don\u2019t just focus on chatting away,\u201d said Pei Tingsong with a friendly smile on his face, staring at Fang Juexia and then pointing to his leg as he reminded, \u201cGe, I\u2019m still stuck here.\u201d\u201cOh, right.\u201d It was only then that remembered that he still had to finish solving the math problem. \u201cI still have a clue that hasn\u2019t been figured out yet.\u201d He quickly walked over to the table in front of him, with Xia Xiqing following him slowly. \u201cDon\u2019t fuss, anyway, even if you could walk, you would still be stuck here.\u201d Xia Xiqing\u2019s gaze rapidly swept across the room, probably looking at the furnishings, as well as at Fang Juexia\u2019s and Pei Tingsong\u2019s costumes.\u201cIt seems that Xiao Pei\u2019s designated role is that of a psychologist?\u201d Xia Xiqing laughed. \u201cA 19-year-old psychologist\u2026\u201d\u201c20 years old.\u201d Pei Tingsong retorted immediately, \u201cYour internet speed must be slow, I have already celebrated a birthday.\u201d\u201cReally? When did that happen?\u201d Xia Xiqing was curious.Pei Tingsong raised his eyebrows. \u201cAround the same time\u00a0you\u00a0went public with who you were dating\u00a0ba.\u201dJust as he finished saying that, he noticed Fang Juexia staring at him, and so, all Pei Tingsong could do was shift his gaze around. But, as soon as Fang Juexia drew close to him, he complained to his Gege in a voice carrying a bit of a grievance, adding a bit of coquettishness as well, \u201cMy legs are going numb.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t even look at him. He just silently lowered his head, unfolded the paper again, and gazed at the numbers on the piece of paper.[258\uff0c321456987\uff0c12369\uff0c12369874]Xia Xiqing also came over at this time, stopping right next to Fang Juexia. The two people\u2019s arms were close together, and he also bowed his head and asked, \u201cNeed help?\u201d\u201cThis sequence should be the clue to unlock the passcode lock of Xiao Pei\u2019s foot cuffs,\u201d Fang Juexia explained the situation simply.\u201cA sequence.\u201d Xia Xiqing looked at the paper and laughed. \u201cDo you study mathematics? So subconsciously\u2026. A bunch of numbers set together doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate a sequence.\u201dUpon hearing this, Fang Juexia felt stunned.\u201cThe scriptwriter of this program always does all his homework on the players. He goes to the extent of understanding your specialties or your hobbies, even your experiences, and then, using your point of view, he sets the questions, tailoring them to your usual thought patterns.\u201d Xia Xiqing deliberately scared them. \u201cIt\u2019s very frightening.\u201dThat\u2019s right, he really did fall into his own usual thought patterns as soon as he saw the puzzle.Fang Juexia looked at the string of numbers, this time simply looking at them one by one. As a result, he actually discovered certain rules that were there\u2014 many of these numbers had 123, 456, or 321 in them.So it wasn\u2019t not a sequence of numbers, instead, it was a sequence of hints.No wonder they used the Sudoku grid of 9 squares. After realising this, Fang Juexia suddenly marveled at the care the screenwriter had taken; he had probably looked through fan materials carefully and had discovered that one of Fang Juexia\u2019s hobbies was playing Sudoku. Using this kind of grid wasn\u2019t just a hint, it was probably also a way to confuse him.\u201cGive me the pen.\u201d Fang Juexia didn\u2019t even lift up his head, directly stretching out his hand towards Pei Tingsong, who was on the opposite side. As soon as he said that, a pen was rolled over to him. Fang Juexia picked up the pen and started filling in the numbers in the nine squares printed on the paper.123456789Seeing that he was about to start the process of solving the problem, Xia Xiqing, a veteran player, suggested, \u201cLittle Serious, you\u2019d better describe your thought process about reaching the solution of this problem out loud, otherwise the audience may not be able to follow your reasoning when this episode is broadcast. It will be troublesome for the program group in the editing stage, and they\u2019ll have to insert subtitles for you then.\u201dUpon hearing his words, Fang Juexia raised his head to look at him, wearing a cute expression of sudden realization on his face.He didn\u2019t like talking, so he had completely forgotten about that point.Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes kept moving back and forth between the faces of the two people opposite him, and he was very unhappy inside. He had spent so much effort coaxing Fang Juexia into forming an alliance with him, but right after they had confirmed their cooperation, a\u00a0Cheng Yaojin\u00a0had burst into the scene, and with just a few words, had hooked Fang Juexia over to his side. What exactly was all of this?Unfortunately, the party at the center of this issue was completely absorbed in solving the problem and had no time to take into account a certain someone\u2019s mood.Fang Juexia held the pen and explained while solving the problem, \u201cThe first clue on the paper is 258. In this nine-square grid that I have already drawn out, starting from 2, you can connect 258, thus drawing a vertical line from top to bottom, which actually represents the number 1.\u201dHe then filled out the second of the nine-square grid on the paper. \u201cThe second clue is 321456987. If we draw a line like before, based on this order of numbers, we get a 5.\u201dIn the same way, he quickly resolved the remaining two numbers, and ended his explanation with, \u201cSame as above, we get\u00a07 and 0.\u201dWhen he heard 'same as above\u201d, Pei Tingsong laughed. Fang Juexia raised his head and glanced at him.Xia Xiqing, who stood next to them and was getting a third-party\u2019s point of view, first glanced at Pei Tingsong, and then looked at Fang Juexia, after which, the corners of his mouth quirked up in a smile filled with an unclear meaning.\u201cThat\u2019s the answer.\u201d Xia Xiqing took a look at the paper. \u201c1570, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cProbably,\u201d Fang Juexia was someone who was strict and precise with his words. Until the passcode lock was unlocked, he wouldn\u2019t make a firm assertion. \u201cI\u2019ll go try it.\u201d\u201cYou let him bend down himself and try it out\u00a0bei, with your height, isn\u2019t it uncomfortable for you to tunnel down there?\u201d But before Xia Xiqing could finish his sentence, Fang Juexia had already wormed his way down.He really was quite straightforward.Xia Xiqing scanned the table and found the appointment form that Fang Juexia had randomly placed on it before. It seemed to be a new clue that they should have just discovered. Xia Xiqing thought to himself that this was indeed a new player; only new players would be unaware of how unscrupulously everyone played in a game like this, and it was rare to see someone throw away a clue as soon as he found it, not treating it as taboo at all.Xia Xiqing looked at the form and casually asked, \u201cThis appointment form\u2026 Where did you guys find it?\u201d He was just probing, not expecting that anyone would actually randomly answer him.So he was surprised when Fang Juexia, who was all the way under the table, still took the time to answer his senior\u2019s question. He honestly explained, \u201cIt was in a book on the bookcase.\u201d\u201cThe bookcase?\u201d Xia Xiqing raised his head and glanced at the rather spectacular collection of books crammed into the bookcase. \u201cTch, tch, this twisted program group\u2026. You guys didn\u2019t really flip through every single book\u00a0ba?\u201dPei Tingsong knocked on the table with his knuckle, causing Xia Xiqing to turn to look at him.He then saw Pei Tingsong point at the ceiling, where some sound was coming from.The hypnosis monologue was still sounding, and it had played twice by now; they were afraid it was on an infinite loop.When he had entered the room, Xia Xiqing had wanted to ask about it, but had forgotten about this annoying thing as they discussed other things. Now, he stood and listened to it quietly, sensing that something wasn\u2019t quite right. \u201cThis is a word puzzle?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Pei Tingsong pushed the notebook in front of him to Xia Xiqing. The complete monologue was written in the notebook, and it was arranged neatly. It looked like Pei Tingsong had deliberately written it out so neatly.\u201cThe words are pretty good-looking.\u201d[Now next please, I will hypnotize\u00a0youYour muscles on your body, relax them allThen empty the thoughts in your mind and enter into the void.Let the top of your mind stretch out into its deepest reaches.The outside shelf of the world that created these emotions is where they return toNow think of a world where depression and resentment never interfere with youThen feel the splendid palace built by your consciousness.Climb the bookcase-like steps and go to the deepest place.There is the home of the soul in all its tranquilityLook, the blue sea in the middle of this pure landNow a book this is not, don\u2019t be afraid, the rustling chilly wind will never blow here.Stretch yourself open and spread out in the warm sunshine to your heart\u2019s contentNow then, it is time to slowly open the door of your subconscious mind.To open up your memory and your true self]\u201cFortunately you thought of writing this narration down, you\u2019re pretty fast at writing. The answer to these kinds of neatly arranged word puzzles is usually hidden in the first or last word of each line\u2026\u201d Xia Xiqing tried to solve it based on that rule, but found that it didn\u2019t work. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first or last letter? It can\u2019t be that it wants you to reverse the whole thing?\u201dAt this moment, Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t really pay attention to Xia Xiqing\u2019s question, because he had just discovered that Fang Juexia hadn\u2019t made any movement for a long time after getting under the table.What was the matter with this guy?He bent over and looked down, just to see Fang Juexia sitting on the floor with his legs crossed. He was bent over with his head bowed as he gazed at the paper lying on his leg, seemingly lost in thought.Feeling that it was strange, Pei Tingsong stretched out one of his hands and rubbed his hair. \u201cHey, what are you doing? You\u2019ve already found the answer but you\u2019re not hurrying to enter it in, is it that you can\u2019t bear to let me out\u00a0ah?\u201dFang Juexia raised his head when he heard his voice, and his eyebrows twisted as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not right.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s not right?\u201d Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t understand and asked, \u201cThe answer isn\u2019t right?\u201dUpon hearing their conversation, Xia Xiqing also crouched down and added, \u201cShouldn\u2019t be\u00a0ah, it\u2019s obvious that this is how number shape questions are solved. Your answer should have no problems. Did you input the code wrong? Do you want to try it again?\u201dThe logic was sound, but the answer really wasn\u2019t right.Right in front of them, Fang Juexia input the 1570 number that they had arrived on as the solution, but the lock didn\u2019t loosen at all. No matter how hard he shook it, it remained as motionless as it was before.\u201cIt\u2019s really not right.\u201d Xia Xiqing thought that this was a little inconceivable.Fang Juexia thought about why; the method of solving this riddle was already very obvious, but the answer they had gotten was actually wrong.\u201cYour guys\u2019 room is much more difficult than mine. When the game started, I, at least, had freedom of movement. It seems that I can finally count as not having gotten the hell script this time round.\u201d Xia Xiqing stood up and waved the notebook with the hypnotic sentences in his hand. \u201cXiao Pei, you haven\u2019t finished explaining. I just looked over it again, and it\u2019s the\u00a0third word, but why?\u201dHe was really good. Pei Tingsong simply analyzed the previous situations, \u201cMany of the clues in this room are marked with Greek letters. The first clue that hinted at the tool to undo Juexia Ge\u2019s ropes was a wooden card with an \u03b1 on it. The second clue that hinted at the location of the key to my handcuffs had \u03b2 on it. \u201c\u201cEn.\u201d Xia Xiqing nodded.\u201cBefore this hypnosis recording started playing, the Greek letter \u03b3 was displayed on the screen on the door. You should know that \u03b3 comes third in the Greek alphabet. In fact, it implies that this so-called acrostic puzzle isn\u2019t using the first word, but the third word.\u201dFang Juexia, who was still under the table, heard Pei Tingsong\u2019s explanation and suddenly realized something. He picked up the triangular block that had been lying on the ground and when he turned it around, it looked quite like the Greek letter \u0394.\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is, so the third word from top to bottom is\u2026. Please on the top shelf of the bookcase the blue book open it up.\u201d Xia Xiqing couldn\u2019t help but admire these two little idols who had just joined the show. They were worthy of being the new guests that Jing Yin had searched for so long and so hard.Sure enough, they weren\u2019t here to just be\u00a0vegetarians.He looked at the various objects with letters on them spread across the room. \u201cI don\u2019t have any of these marks in my room, Greek letters\u2026 It must be because they know that one of you is a philosophy student and the other studied math, so both of you would naturally be sensitive to the Greek alphabet, and therefore they used these. Otherwise, wouldn\u2019t English and Arabic numerals work just fine?\u201dEverything he said was correct. Since the writers used the Greek alphabet when creating the puzzles, they must have checked their identities quite thoroughly, and knowing that naturally implied some other information as well.Information on \u0394\u2026.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgA white light flashed through Fang Juexia\u2019s brain.That\u2019s it!It really isn\u2019t 1570, that is just the raw initial result.After doing a quick calculation in his head, Fang Juexia once again approached Pei Tingsong\u2019s left leg, and ducked down to enter the new answer.5\uff0c9\uff0c1\uff0c4\u201cClick.\u201dThe lock opened.There was still the cuff on the right, and he soon turned the numbers on its passcode lock.3\uff0c1\uff0c3\uff0c4Right!Finally decoded it. Fang Juexia happily pulled on Pei Tingsong\u2019s pant leg and poked half of his head out from under the table, looking just like a child waiting for praise as he declared, \u201cIt\u2019s open now.\u201dPei Tingsong, who had originally still been talking to Xia Xiqing, looked down after his pant leg was pulled on. Fang Juexia, who was crouched on the ground, pointed to the open foot cuffs, and said again, \u201cI unlocked it.\u201dPei Tingsong looked completely surprised. Obviously, he had just told them moments ago that his answer was wrong, but then he managed to unlock them so quickly. He sat back in his chair and held out his hand to Fang Juexia. \u201cYou come out first.\u201d\u201cHow fast\u00a0ah.\u201d Xia Xiqing also felt curious. \u201cWhat was the answer?\u201dFang Juexia, using Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand as support, came out from under the table and sighed. \u201cWhat you guys said just now reminded me of something.\u201d\u201cWhat we said?\u201d Xia Xiqing looked at Pei Tingsong. \u201cWhat did we just say?\u201d\u201cThe meaning of the letters. In fact, the problem description for this puzzle wasn\u2019t complete. In addition to the hints given on this paper, there was a hidden condition as well, that is, the Greek letter \u0394.\u201d After saying that, he looked at Xia Xiqing and asked, \u201cXiqing Ge, what do you think \u0394 stands for to a person who studies mathematics?\u201dXia Xiqing was a little confused at first. His eyes flickered for a bit, but then suddenly he laughed and said two words, \u201cAn increment.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Fang Juexia had known that he could respond immediately. \u201c\u0394 means an increment. So the four numbers we got are not the real answer, it is just an initial result that hasn\u2019t been incremented yet.\u201dXia Xiqing asked again, \u201cBut all we know is that we have to increment, they didn\u2019t give us how much to do so by\u00a0ah?\u201d\u201cThey actually did.\u201d Fang Juexia looked at Pei Tingsong. \u201cXiao Pei just said that these Greek letters have an order. \u0394 is the fourth, so the amount we have to increment by is 4.\u201dPei Tingsong stood up and moved around a bit. \u201cSo 1570 is the initial number, and using this as the base, we add 4 to each digit. Ah, wait a minute, you could also subtract 4\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes shone while talking about the way to solve the problem. \u201cI did keep feeling that it was strange before. There are clearly two foot cuffs here, but only one clue was given. This was illogical. If the code to unlock both of the cuffs was the same, it would be too wasteful. The program group for \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019 wouldn\u2019t do such superfluous things.\u201d\u201cThen I realized that increments can be added or subtracted. So, one side is 1570, where you add 4 to each digit, and after not carrying any ones over, you take the final digits to get 5914. On the right is the initial four digits minus four, and of course we take the absolute value of each digit, thereby getting 3134. These are the two codes to unlock the cuffs.\u201dPei Tingsong liked to look at the expression that would appear on Fang Juexia\u2019s face after he managed to successfully solve a problem; it was the same one that would appear after someone had praised him for his outstanding performance on the stage. He would smile happily, his smile completely bright and sincere; it was totally different from his usual cold appearance. His outer shell melted, revealing his clean and confident personality hidden inside.Whenever this happened, all Pei Tingsong wanted to do was praise him and let him know that he was sparkling right now.Unfortunately, this time, someone else stole his opportunity to do so first.\u201cReally so good, you\u2019re stronger than I thought.\u201d Xia Xiqing came to a stand beside Fang Juexia from his original position across the table, and after deliberately lowering his voice, he asked, \u201cDo you want to team up with me? Gege will carry you, and the two of us can definitely win.\u201dTeam up?Before Fang Juexia could open his mouth, Pei Tingsong, who had been stretching and moving at the side, immediately dragged Fang Juexia over to him, grabbing his shoulder, and smirking a little at Xia Xiqing as he announced, \u201cSorry, this guy has already formed an alliance with me.\u201d\u201cAn alliance?\u201d Xia Xiqing laughed and threw the notebook in his hand on the table. \u201cLittle Didi, alliances on \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019 are more fragile than paper.\u201d Having said that, he looked at Fang Juexia, and while wearing an expression of wanting to see the world plunged into chaos, he instigated, \u201cYou kick him out and follow me\u00a0ba.\u201dKick??What kind of word was that to use here?Although Pei Tingsong was angry, he still had a bit of confidence in the friendship he had just established with Fang Juexia. He held onto his shoulder more tightly and said, \u201cYou give up\u00a0ba, Juexia\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat conditions do you have?\u201d Fang Juexia suddenly opened his mouth and directly interrupted Pei Tingsong\u2019s words.Conditions???Pei Tingsong reached out and pulled at Fang Juexia\u2019s cheek, in an attempt to force him to turn around to face him. However, who would have known that not only Fang Juexia would not give him any reasonable explanation, but that he would also frown and push his hand away. He even adjusted the glasses on the bridge of his nose before facing Xia Xiqing again.\u201cYou\u2019re right. If we want to talk about cooperating together, there must be some conditions.\u201d Xia Xiqing leaned against the table and made it seem like he was in a very tangled situation. \u201cHm\u2026\u201d\u201cNo\u00a0ba, Fang Juexia. You\u2019re not really going to believe his words\u00a0ba?\u201d Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t believe that he was actually seriously considering this proposal. \u201cIt can\u2019t be you don\u2019t know how crafty he\u2019s been when playing in the games before?\u201dSuddenly, Xia Xiqing slapped the table and said, \u201cAlright, the condition is me showing all my cards.\u201d He looked at Fang Juexia with a sincere expression as he confessed, \u201cI am the double-faced knight.\u201dFang Juexia looked directly into his eyes. Or, in other words, they looked at each other.Stress stimulates adrenaline, and, coincidentally, excitement did too.He was very clear that Xia Xiqing was lying about his identity.In order to not be cheated by him, from the moment Xia Xiqing had walked through that door, Fang Juexia had consciously shown weakness in front of him. For example, he had waited for him to tell him the rules of the number puzzle first, as well as that moment when he had just randomly thrown the appointment form on the table. All of these factors worked to build up the image of him being a naive novice player in Xia Xiqing\u2019s eyes.Having watched a lot of episodes from the previous season, Fang Juexia understood the gaming style and intelligence level of the person in front of him. If he showed complete trust in Xia Xiqing and allied with him now, he would look suspicious to him. But because of how he had resolved the unexpected number problem just now, Xia Xiqing had already learned about his strength. At this time, it would be too fake if he pretended to be a newcomer who could only follow suit.If he questioned him now and made his doubts about his statement too clear, it was very likely that Xia Xiqing would start to suspect whether he was a player with a special role or not, since otherwise he shouldn\u2019t have so much confidence while asking. It was quite difficult to reach a middle ground, which was a dilemma.\u201cHow about it?\u201d Seeing that he didn\u2019t reply immediately, Xia Xiqing offered another condition. He was wreathed in smiles as he guided him towards his side gently. \u201cOr how about, if you and I team up, I will tell you my camp.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change as he replied, \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t really dare to believe anything you say.\u201d\u201cThe player who always blows himself up has blown himself up, and you still don\u2019t believe him?\u201d Xia Xiqing raised his eyebrows.Fang Juexia nodded. \u201cI only believe in logic. You can try to convince me.\u201dXia Xiqing shook his head, and with a smile, said, \u201cYou are too cute, really. Of course, I can convince you since I am indeed the knight. Whatever thought process you want to hear in order to be convinced, I can tell you.\u201dFang Juexia secretly breathed in relief on the inside, confirming to himself that at least he was playing Tai Chi in the right direction, but it wasn\u2019t long before he heard another voice.\u201cWhat a coincidence,\u201d Pei Tingsong stretched. \u201cI\u2019m a knight too. So awkward\u00a0ah.\u201dFang Juexia turned his head to look at him, trying to maintain the doubtful consideration that an ordinary player should have.The most awkward person in this situation was him as the real knight.But now, he felt too embarrassed to even show his embarrassment.\u201cReally?\u201d Xia Xiqing stood up with a smile, looked at Pei Tingsong, pursed the corners of his mouth, and the expression on his face was obviously full of questioning as he argued, \u201cOnly donning this knight\u2019s role after I said something, your credibility is a bit weak.\u201dFang Juexia couldn\u2019t figure out Pei Tingsong\u2019s intentions in standing out at this moment. He completely hadn\u2019t expected this guy to self-detonate his own role as a knight. Although Pei Tingsong\u2019s way of doing things was always very tiger-like and he always managed to catch people unprepared, he was smart enough and very logical, and his ability to wreak confusion on other people\u2019s sense of judgement was no less than that of Xia Xiqing\u2019s.That meant that this was also a tactic\u00a0ba.It couldn\u2019t be that he was trying to bluff his way into getting access to information about his and Xia Xiqing\u2019s identity?In any case, Fang Juexia had already made his choice; he would lie in wait at the moment. Right now, as an ordinary player, he should feel confused or curious.\u201cThen which camp did you choose?\u201d Fang Juexia looked at Pei Tingsong.Who would have known that Pei Tingsong would tilt his head and smile before stating, \u201cIt\u2019s not important which camp I chose. As long as our alliance has not been dissolved, I am your knight.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The corners of his mouth rose, and he said, \u201cYou say this as if I am the killer who needs the protection of the black knight.\u201dAt the end of his sentence, he raised his head and covered up the short-term panic with his facial expression management skill, which was a basic skill that all idols were required to be very good at. His eyes were both doubtful and calculating as he stared at Pei Tingsong and said, \u201cJust like Xiqing Ge, I don\u2019t quite believe in your identity as a knight. And despite his reasoning, I also can\u2019t just casually believe him either.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s quite obvious that even if I let you guys continue through with your logical persuasions, you still won\u2019t tell me any of the whys or wherefores, and there\u2019s no action you can take or words you can use that will help me verify your reasoning. So, unless you report your own camp to me, no other argument else will hold water.\u201dObviously, Xia Xiqing did not choose to directly report his camp.After listening to Fang Juexia\u2019s words, Pei Tingsong did not continue with any of his boyish retorts, nor did he start fighting him; instead, he took Fang Juexia\u2019s sudden interrogation quite calmly and replied, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t believe me. Anyway, at this time, no one can tell if anyone\u2019s words are true or false, but everything has its own order.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s face still maintained a faint smile, and his tone was calm as he said, \u201cIt was you who took the initiative first.\u201dWhether it was Xia Xiqing or Pei Tingsong, even though it seemed that the two fake knights were fighting with each other, in fact, they were more attacking Fang Juexia through subtle insinuations.After saying his piece, Fang Juexia looked down at the appointment form, and found \u2018Zaozao\u2019 written on the second line of it. \u201cThere have been only two escape rooms, and two knights have already appeared. No one can be sure whether there really is a killer in our midst, who is stirring up the waters. It seems that both of you want to win my support, but all this does is make me more convinced that I shouldn\u2019t act rashly.\u201dFang Juexia had made his position clear. Contrary to his expectations, Xia Xiqing laughed after hearing this, making it seem as if the destruction of the alliance between the two boy-band members was already a great harvest for him. \u201cWhat you said is reasonable.\u201d He put his hands in his pockets, and his face was relaxed as he continued, \u201cEither way, we first need to understand the plot, or we need to make our escape a priority, so it\u2019s unnecessary for the three of us to fight like this right now. There should still be some time before the first round of voting, and we can all slowly chat about it when it comes to that.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cThen Xiqing Ge, when you were in that escape room just now, you should have found some clues about the plot\u00a0ba.\u201dAt this point, everyone basically knew that no one was a\u00a0slouch\u00a0here, and hiding things now would just serve to make everyone else suspicious. Xia Xiqing generously pulled out a pamphlet that he had stuffed into the pocket of his school uniform pants. \u201cActually, I wanted to show you guys this before,\u201d he gave Pei Tingsong a look before continuing, \u201cbut after seeing him put all his attention on solving those puzzles in order to save you, I forgot.\u201dHe handed out the pamphlet in his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a medical record. The name on it is the same as the nametag on my chest, with only Zaozao written on it. It sounds like it\u2019s a nickname or a pseudonym.\u201dFang Juexia took a hold of the medical record and opened it. Recorded inside were the symptoms of mental illness\u2014[Name: Zaozao, Gender: Female, Age: 17]Pei Tingsong was the first to find a bright spot, and exclaimed, \u201cHey, the gender written here is of a girl.\u201dXia Xiqing took a look and commented, \u201cIs it? I didn\u2019t notice. Probably because they felt I\u2019m not bad-looking, so they gave me a flipped role? Maybe it\u2019s a lousy idea that came from the scriptwriter.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s attention was focused on the medical record, and he said in a soft voice, \u201cThe patient was diagnosed with depression on February 10 after displaying symptoms such as a down-cast mood, long-term insomnia and anxiety, mental weakness, fear of social contact and physical contact, and is currently taking\u2026\u201dJust after hearing the beginning, Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth curled and he remarked, \u201cThe character and the person playing her are not alike at all.\u201dXia Xiqing said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m actually especially suitable for this kind of miserable character.\u201d\u201cThe time on this appointment form is March 2, so that is to say, Zaozao probably came to find\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia looked at Pei Tingsong, who tacitly supplied the name of his identity, \u201cDr. Tian.\u201d\u201cYes, she came to see Dr. Tian for a follow-up visit, or for some other psychotherapy.\u201d Fang Juexia looked at Xia Xiqing again and asked, \u201cXiqing Ge, can we go to your room and take a look?\u201d\u201cOf course. This room may provide some plot clues about Zaozao.\u201d Xia Xiqing turned to lead them over. \u201cI thought it was very strange at the beginning. There are very few decorations in this room, which is quite different from the games in the first season. It looks a little bit shoddy.\u201dIndeed, as Xia Xiqing had said, the room was unexpectedly simple; the only things that could be called furnishings were a sofa and a small coffee table. On the coffee table was a landline phone, a handbook on mental health, and then there was an oil painting that had been taken down and set on the sofa.Seeing Fang Juexia look down at the painting, Xia Xiqing said, \u201cThis is Van Gogh\u2019s \u2018Flowering Garden\u2019. I took it down to understand the mystery.\u201d\u201cVan Gogh\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong sat on the sofa and glanced at the room\u2019s wallpaper. It was different from the blue wallpaper in their escape room; it was all pink in here.Fang Juexia carefully examined the room and kept feeling that something was off. \u201cIn the beginning, I thought that, like the first season, each room would be designed according to the player\u2019s character persona, to show that it was the room where they stayed and lived in. However, now it doesn\u2019t look like that applies here.\u201dHearing what he said, Xia Xiqing lifted a schoolbag from the sofa and shook out its contents onto the coffee table. \u201cIf you want to find out the player\u2019s persona, there should be the props prepared by the program group for that purpose.\u201dSpread on the coffee table were two or three brushes, a box of newly bought paint that hadn\u2019t been opened yet, high school textbooks, and a leaflet from an art school. Fang Juexia squatted beside the coffee table, subconsciously sorting out these props into a proper order, and then checking them one by one.Pei Tingong leafed through everything for a bit and guessed, \u201cSo this character is a 17-year-old female high school student who is currently studying fine arts. She suffers from depression and came to the Dr. Tian\u2019s clinic for medical treatment.\u201d\u201cNot only that, look at this.\u201d Xia Xiqing opened the textbook, and there was a torn-up note that had been pasted back together inside it.Fang Juexia took a look at it. It really had been written in a girl\u2019s handwriting, elegant and clean, but it had then been torn to pieces.Xia Xiqing picked up the posthumous note and read, \u201cBy the time you all see this note, I may have already passed away forever. I tried to love the world in the past, but this world didn\u2019t even give me a trace of warmth. I know that those who have hurt me will not change because of my absence; they will still continue hurting more children. They will violently tear up our bodies and crush our childhood with the authority they wield. But, at the very least, in this last moment, I have to stand up and expose\u2026\u201dHis voice suddenly stopped. Pei Tingsong, who had still been reading the art school pamphlet, looked up and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no more.\u201d Xia Xiqing put the suicide note down and replied, \u201cShe didn\u2019t continue writing after that. When I saw it, it had already become a big pile of fragments, and after I pieced it together, it came out as a complete piece of paper, but the suicide note itself is incomplete.\u201dPei Tingsong confirmed this in a glance; it really hadn\u2019t been written completely. \u201cCould it be like this? The girl wanted to commit suicide before, so she wrote a suicide note in advance, but later on, she had other ideas and regretted her decision, so she tore up the suicide note.\u201d\u201cThis logic works.\u201d Xia Xiqing put down her suicide note. \u201cI was thinking that in her suicide note, she mentioned \u2018people who hurt her\u2019, as well as \u2018tearing up bodies\u2019 and \u2018crushing childhood\u2019. These words probably imply that she has been hurt in her childhood. Will there be anyone playing the role of the person who hurt her?\u201dXia Xiqing\u2019s idea also prompted Fang Juexia to think of something. In the previous season of \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019, the identity of the killers often corresponded with that of the murderers or perpetrators in the episode plotline. By following this train of thought, they may be able to find the real killer.They had found the prop that indicated the identity of the character, but what about this escape room? Was there any metaphor hidden here?Fang Juexia looked around and found that the room didn\u2019t even have a bed.\u201cXiqing Ge\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong, who was sitting to the side, heard Fang Juexia subconsciously call out Xia Xiqing\u2019s name. He even went to the extent of affectionately calling this person Gege, which was completely unlike the cold appearance Fang Juexia donned when dealing with himself. Pei Tingsong felt a bit of a bad taste rise up in his heart. Obviously, these matters could also be discussed with him, but Fang Juexia just kept skipping over him.He also couldn\u2019t describe what this feeling was, all he knew was that he felt a little agitated.Fang Juexia still continued asking Xia Xiqing, \u201cMany rooms in the first season of Escape were bedrooms or studies. What do you think this room looks like?\u201dXia Xiqing listened to his tone and soon noticed something. He looked around carefully before glancing over at the door connecting the room to the clinic. Suddenly, he thought of something. \u201cDo you want to say that this might be a waiting room?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Fang Juexia repeatedly nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s just a guess.\u201d He held the appointment form in his hand and pointed to Pei Tingsong. \u201cXiao Pei is the psychologist, Dr. Tian. You are the patient, Zaozao, who came to the clinic after deciding to give up on the idea of suicide. As for why you are in the waiting room\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong took over this explanation, \u201cBecause the person who is consulting with the doctor right now is you.\u201d He then read out the name of the first person on the reservation form, \u201cTeacher Yan.\u201dFang Juexia nodded. That was the reason why, when they had just clicked on the screen of the\u00a0gate\u00a0door, it had prompted a notification saying that their treatment time wasn\u2019t over yet, so they couldn\u2019t leave.\u201cI see.\u201d Xia Xiqing laughed. \u201cSo, in that case, the rest of the players should also be listed here.\u201d He read out everyone\u2019s names in turn, \u201cTeacher Yan, Zaozao, Xiao Xi, Zoe. That is to say, there are five players in total this time. One psychologist, and four patients. The teacher and the psychologist were trapped in the clinic together, and the remaining three players have been separated into different waiting rooms.\u201d\u201cIt should be that way, that\u2019s right.\u201d Fang Juexia stood up.Pei Tingsong, however, leaned back on the sofa as he said, \u201cBut right now, we are trapped here, and even if we manage to fumble our way into gaining some clarity on these matters, it\u2019ll be of no use. We should first think about how to get out\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cHow about this? Xiao Pei will have a rest on the sofa first,\u201d Xia Xiqing winked at Fang Juexia. \u201cWhile me and Little Serious here will go look around for the way to unlock the door?\u201dPei Tingsong immediately sat up straight, just like a little dog bristling up. \u201cThat\u2019s no good. What if you guys go out and lock me in, then what will I do?\u201dXia Xiqing smiled. \u201cHow could we do such a thing?\u201d\u201cCome on\u00a0ba, Xiqing Ge.\u201d Pei Tingsong pulled up the corners of his mouth. \u201cYou guys have done such a thing before, in the first season, and it was even to our senior brother.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t have any attention to spare on these two people who were fighting each other, because his mind was completely occupied with what Xia Xiqing had just said. He kept muttering to himself in a low voice; every time he was thinking seriously, he would be like this. \u201cThere is no lock on that door, and just now, the door prompt announced that my consultation time wasn\u2019t over yet, so I can\u2019t leave\u2026\u201dWait a minute.Only after the previous patient\u2019s consultation time was over would the next patient be allowed into the clinic, and they would have to wait in this waiting room till then.He suddenly thought of something. He then raised himself to stand up, but his legs were numb, and all of a sudden, his legs felt a little soft. He uncontrollably started tilting towards the sofa, almost ending up falling on Pei Tingsong\u2019s body. Pei Tingsong hurried to help him, and pulled him to his side before making him sit him down. He said mercilessly, \u201cYour legs get soft too easily.\u201dXia Xiqing suddenly laughed, and unexpectedly followed up on Pei Tingsong\u2019s words with, \u201cYes\u00a0ah, you haven\u2019t even\u00a0done\u00a0anything yet, and your legs have gone soft.\u201dPei Tingsong abruptly changed the topic, \u201cBy the way, what did you want to say just now that you went and suddenly stood up?\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t notice any problem with the direction of the conversation; his whole person was concentrated on the numbing torture he could feel coming from his legs, and he couldn\u2019t think at all. On the contrary, Pei Tingsong immediately released Fang Juexia\u2019s hand and moved to the other side of the sofa.Fang Juexia rubbed his legs, leaned over, and asked, \u201cXiqing Ge, you said your escape room was relatively simple, so could it be that it has been intentionally set this way by the screenwriter?\u201dXia Xiqing squinted, thought for a few seconds, and suddenly got Fang Juexia\u2019s meaning. \u201cYou mean to say, they gave me a simple escape room, in the hopes that I will enter your guys\u2019 room early.\u201dPei Tingsong also saw the light. \u201cThe general logic should be to allocate the players, according to their ability, into rooms with corresponding difficulty. Giving you, such a high-level player, a simple escape room, while completely tying up us newbies, was to ensure that you would definitely enter our room before we left it. Specifically, that you would enter the clinic.\u201dAfter arriving at this conclusion, the three people stood up at the same time, with Pei Tingsong instinctively helping Fang Juexia a bit. Fang Juexia raised his head and whispered, \u201cMy legs aren\u2019t soft anymore.\u201d And then, he walked faster than anyone else.Already feeling not soft so quickly, he was so freaking strong.I see that you, Fang Juexia, are the hardest person in the world; your legs are hard, and your heart is also hard.Pei Tingsong rolled his eyes behind him, but he still followed Fang Juexia. Going through the door connecting the two chambers, they returned to the psychiatrist\u2019s office and stood in front of the black door in that room.\u201cI hope we thought right.\u201d Fang Juexia clicked on the dark screen. This time, there was no Greek letter flashing on it, and neither did any sound come out of it, indicating that the treatment time wasn\u2019t over yet.But at the same time, no new Greek letter or puzzle appeared on it, which was contrary to what the three of them had imagined would be.Just when Fang Juexia was feeling confused, a new tone sounded out\u2014This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cHello,\u00a0your\u00a0consultation time is over. Please follow the instructions to find the right exit and leave the clinic.\u201dSure enough, it wasn\u2019t that simple.Only Pei Tingsong grabbed at the word, \u201cThe right exit\u2026\u201dAll of a sudden, the speaker in the room let out some noise. It was the signal that cued the narrator\u2019s announcement\u2014\u201cPlease note that two players have already left their initialization rooms and entered the public area.\u201dThis kind of announcement would undoubtedly increase the other players\u2019 psychological burden. However, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t feel any such thing; in general, the most difficult tasks in the whole game were either to break out of the public area or to restore the plot.Xia Xiqing joked, \u201cThis room is really difficult, there are a lot of checkpoints, and they\u2019re all scattered around. You guys are very unlucky, you\u2019re fast catching up on my hell dungeon from the second episode of the first season.\u201dFang Juexia knew the score in his heart. This room was the psychiatrist\u2019s office, so naturally, its difficulty level would be high. As idols, they were used to being used as fringe decoration in many variety shows. Now it seemed that Escape For Your Life\u2019s program group liked to do just the opposite of that. By giving the two of them the hardest room at the beginning itself, if they solved it, it would make the audience feel like this was a twist; and if they couldn\u2019t solve it, there was still Xia Xiqing who would eventually enter the room to help them.While he was thinking that, he saw Xia Xiqing\u2019s eyes being drawn to the painting by the door.\u201cBased on past experience, all paintings have puzzles in them.\u201d Xia Xiqing tried to take down the painting on the wall, but found it was very much fixed in its place. \u201cThe people in the props group have really worked hard.\u201dFang Juexia wouldn\u2019t usually pay much attention to the contents of a painting, while on the contrary, Pei Tingsong opened his mouth. \u201cI just wanted to say that the painting technique used in this painting is a little special. There are no outlines of anything, it\u2019s all made up of squares.\u201d He consulted Xia Xiqing, \u201cXiqing Ge, I have to trouble you for a layman\u2019s explanation.\u201dXia Xiqing laughed and commented, \u201cYou are actually the first person who has taken the initiative to ask me to give a layman\u2019s explanation of a painting on this program.\u201dPei Tingsong shrugged. \u201cPhilosophy and the Arts can also count as having come from the same place.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re very good at talking.\u201d Xia Xiqing looked at the painting and explained, \u201cThis is actually a world-famous painting, Peter Mondrian\u2019s \u2018Composition with Red Blue and Yellow\u2019, and you\u2019re not wrong in saying that the painting is made out of squares. What you just mentioned, the missing outline of things, is a characteristic of the classical style, that is, a style inspired by nature. Artists know that nature is beautiful, so they paint nature and people to show beauty. Mondrian\u2019s use of squares in painting is another innovation, that of abstractionism. He tried to explore whether beauty would still exist after all external forms are abandoned.\u201dFang Juexia looked at the painting in front of him. Countless horizontal and vertical black lines formed large and small squares, which were filled with colors. He didn\u2019t know if it was because he had been born liking precision and clarity, but such a strict lattice-style painting filled with artistic color was indeed beautiful to his eyes.Pei Tingsong nodded. \u201cThat is to say, his lattice-style actually deconstructed the world, making horizontal and vertical lines stand in as the essence of the world.\u201d\u201cIt could be understood in that way.\u201d Xia Xiqing was a little surprised, not having thought that a boy who had just recently turned 20 would have such a high understanding of art. \u201cThis is a kind of artistic pursuit into the essence of the world.\u201dStrangely, these words happened to touch both Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong. In common perceptions, philosophy and mathematics were both disciplines that explored the essence of the world. Although they often couldn\u2019t intersect, at this moment, the purpose of their search could actually be represented in a form of artistic expression; it was really too interesting.\u201cThey\u2019re quite good at choosing paintings. This painting is what Mondrian created while seeking inner peace, which fits with the setting of it being a decoration in a psychiatrist\u2019s office.\u201dFang Juexia couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cAlthough I have never studied paintings, seeing this reminds me of Pythagoras.\u201dXia Xiqing laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s true, maybe they\u2019re all geometric monsters\u00a0ba, but Pythagoras may prefer triangles. If you put a diagonal line down across it, it\u2019s more like\u2026\u201d He kept talking as he stretched out a finger and drew a line down the painting, but then, he suddenly looked like he had found something. \u201cHuh?\u201dHe put both his palms on the painting and felt the entire picture.Pei Tingsong asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? What\u2019s wrong?\u201dXia Xiqing didn\u2019t look back, and instead asked them, \u201cIs E the fifth letter in the Greek alphabet?\u201dFang Juexia nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThe last clue is hidden in this lattice painting.\u201d Xia Xiqing grabbed Fang Juexia\u2019s hand and put it on the painting. \u201cTouch it. Some of the horizontal and vertical lines on the painting stick out, and the protruding part forms the shape of an E.\u201dSure enough, the lines did.\u201cReally, this is pretty hard to find.\u201d Fang Juexia showed a surprised look and looked back at Pei Tingsong, but the expression on the other party\u2019s face didn\u2019t look so good.What was going on with him?Xia Xiqing tried to push the protruding line with his fingers, and unexpectedly, the lines creating the shape of the Greek letter ended up being twisted by him.All of a sudden, the screen next to the door on their right lit up again, and a small \u03b5 appeared on it. At the same time, the picture in front of them suddenly moved!Xia Xiqing and Fang Juexia let go and stepped back. He watched the painting split in the middle, just as if it had been cut in two, with one half moving up, while the other half moved down, both halves shifting in different directions. Their movement continued until the upper half of the painting exceeded the height of the right door and the lower half touched the ground, and it was only then that both these halves came to a stop.\u201cThere\u2019s a rail in this wall.\u201d Pei Tingsong felt that such a thing was quite unbelievable, even though he had seen how skilled this show\u2019s props group was in the previous season.Under the wallpaper was a sliding rail, and its width was exactly the same as the width of the painting. It seemed that the program group had been waiting for them to discover the riddle in the painting, after which they started the corresponding mechanism.The sliding picture frame and guide rail had cut into the blue wallpaper, and as the torn wallpaper swayed, half of it scattered down, revealing a white part hidden under it. They originally thought that this was a wall, but when Xia Xiqing tore off the rest of the wallpaper covering the sliding rail, a brand-new white door was on display in front of them.And in that spot, where the picture had just been hanging, was now the same display screen that was on the door to their right.Who could believe that there were actually two doors in this escape room?!Pei Tingsong understood. \u201cIt turns out that this is what that \u2018right door\u2019 meant.\u201dThe two screens lit up at the same time, and a new prompt was issued out simultaneously, \u201cHello patient,\u00a0your\u00a0consultation time is over, and you can leave now.\u201dThe AI lock on the white gate sounded out in an electronic voice, \u201cWe are the AI locks of these two gates. Under our specially designed program settings, what one of us says will always be true, and what the other one says will never be true.\u201dThe AI lock on the black door added, \u201cIf all of you are asked to directly choose a door, your success rate is only 50%, so you all have the right to ask a question, only one question, for which our answer will only be a yes or no. Please think carefully. Once the wrong choice is made, we will lock both the doors, and you can only try again after an hour passes.\u201dTwo doors, they could only ask one question, with one lock speaking only the truth and one speaking falsehood, and both of them could only answer with a yes or no.This was a logic problem.Fang Juexia tried to simplify and formalize the question, and quickly tried to deduce it in his mind, but he was a little late.\u201cI\u2019ll go?\u201d\u201cSo fast?\u201d Xia Xiqing glanced at him. \u201cIf you\u2019re wrong, we\u2019ll have to wait for an hour.\u201dUpon hearing Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice, Fang Juexia gave him a sideways glance. Seeing his expression radiating confidence, he surmised that this person must already have the answer. That made sense, Pei Tingsong was someone who had really studied systematic logic.Fang Juexia nodded and chose to believe him.Since he wanted to listen to Pei Tingsong\u2019s questions carefully, he observed Pei Tingsong cross his arms across his chest and get ready to open his mouth, but unexpectedly, this guy asked him, \u201cGe, which door do you like? White or black?\u201dUpon suddenly being faced with a question, Fang Juexia froze. He didn\u2019t know whether he had short-circuited because of this \u201cGe\u201d or because of his inexplicable question.\u201cEn\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia pointed with his finger. \u201cWhite\u00a0ba, the new door.\u201dXia Xiqing\u2019s eyes jumped back and forth between these two people, with an expression that showed how particularly interesting he found this duo\u2019s interactions. Sure enough, he preferred to observe people\u2019s hearts rather than grapple with such a tortuous problem belonging to the realm of cold logic.\u201cAlright.\u201d Pei Tingsong stood in front of the white door and raised this valuable question\u2014\u201cExcuse me, you guys, will the other AI say that this door is the real exit?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 40Chapter 40 \u2013 Hidden DoorTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksMy little pet accidentally scratched meThe next second, after Pei Tingsong posed his question, the AI locks on both the white gate and the black gate answered simultaneously, \u201cNo.\u201dPei Tingsong stepped back, looked at Fang Juexia, and pointed at the white door. \u201cThen this one is the real exit.\u201dSo that\u2019s how it was. Fang Juexia now understood; he let them answer with each other\u2019s answers, and the AI who only told the truth would answer with the lie that the other AI would say, while the AI who only uttered falsehood must lie about the truthful door\u2019s answer. Both their answers would then be consistent and always contrary to the facts. A positive answer would mean that this door was the false exit, and a negative answer would indicate that this is the real exit. Using this way, you could find the real door by asking only one question.\u201cCongratulations, correct answer.\u201d With a click, the white door opened out automatically. \u201cPlease leave the clinic.\u201dXia Xiqing stretched. \u201cLet me see who escaped their rooms?\u201dFang Juexia walked out after him. Outside of their room was a small reception hall with elegant furnishings. There was an open door on the left side, and a showcase embedded into the wall on the right, with paintings and medals hanging from it. Directly opposite them was the reception hall\u2019s door, which was marked with the sign of the final exit.It seemed that as long as you could get out of this room, the game would be over.As soon as he exited, he saw a tall figure\u2014it was Zhou Ziheng, the person he had met on the campus of P University. Right next to him stood their senior brother Shang Sirui, and the two of them seemed to be examining something.Hearing Xia Xiqing\u2019s voice, Zhou Ziheng turned his head and smiled at him. \u201cYou came out.\u201dShang Sirui first saw Xia Xiqing walk out in front. \u201cXiqing!\u201d Soon, he also noticed Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia, who were following behind Xia Xiqing, and said, \u201cIt turns out that you guys were all locked in together\u00a0ah.\u201dFang Juexia nodded, but accidentally glanced and caught sight of Zhou Ziheng tidying up Xia Xiqing\u2019s mic, and then saw Zhou Ziheng take advantage of Shang Sirui\u2019s current posture, which was blocking the camera lens, to embrace Xia Xiqing\u2019s waist for a second. Fang Juexia blinked several times after seeing this, then hastily turned his face, walked quickly towards the sofa, and sat down like a little robot with rusty limbs.Noticing his strange behavior, Pei Tingsong, who was behind him, opened his mouth and asked, \u201cHey, what are you doing?\u201dFang Juexia shook his head. \u201cNothing.\u201dPei Tingsong had noticed long ago the direction he had just been looking in, so he also glanced over there, and after understanding the situation immediately, laughed rudely as he sat down with him.\u201cWho are you laughing at?\u201d Fang Juexia asked him.\u201cWho else can I be laughing at but you\u00a0ah?\u201d Pei Tingsong could clearly see that he really didn\u2019t understand the situation and felt even more amused. \u201cYou\u2019re not about to tell me that you don\u2019t know the relationship between them\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cI know\u00a0ah.\u201d Fang Juexia showed an \u2018I understand very clearly\u2019 expression while saying this. \u201cLast season, weren\u2019t they just\u2026just a CP?\u201d\u201cCP? How long have you been disconnected from the Internet?\u201d Pei Tingsong laughed so hard his stomach hurt, and then he suddenly fell on Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder. Fang Juexia felt puzzled and tried to push him away, but Pei Tingsong grabbed his wrist and pulled him towards his shoulder instead. His palm was forced to cover the scene of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth and his own reddening ears as they met.\u201cThey are really in love.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s low voice twisted up a warm air current, and giant waves started shifting under the iceberg.In-in love?With that, Pei Tingsong tossed Fang Juexia\u2019s hand aside, leaned against the sofa, and looked at him sideways, while wearing a smile on his face the whole time. Fang Juexia\u2019s face was filled with shock, and he also looked like he couldn\u2019t quite dare to believe it. He turned his head and stared at Pei Tingsong with wide eyes, which only served to make Pei Tingsong feel that this was even more interesting.\u201cIs what you\u2019re saying true?\u201dPei Tingsong stuck up three fingers in an\u00a0okay gesture.Fang Juexia breathed out a deep breath and subconsciously rubbed his neck. He felt that this was unimaginable and asked, \u201cThen\u2026 does everyone know?\u201d\u201cNot necessarily before.\u201d Pei Tingsong added with a smile, \u201cNow the entire world should know.\u201dHe complained that Fang Juexia was the very last person to know.Fang Juexia frowned slightly. \u201cThat\u2019s because I haven\u2019t been online for a very long time.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Pei Tingsong shrugged. \u201cI mentioned it at the beginning, about Xiqing Ge\u2019s public announcement of his relationship before, but you didn\u2019t notice.\u201d\u201cI noticed, but I thought you were referring to someone else. I didn\u2019t expect it to be your university senior\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help but turn his head, wanting to look at them. He didn\u2019t expect that as soon as he turned his head, he would see Xia Xiqing hugging his shoulders from behind the sofa. \u201cLittle Serious, how are your ears so red?\u201dAfter being rubbed up against just once, Fang Juexia immediately shot up from the sofa. Without saying a word, he looked up to see Zhou Ziheng\u2019s expression.Unexpectedly, Zhou Ziheng was also amused and was actually laughing at this. Even so, he preserved his upright image, and walked over to pull Xia Xiqing away. \u201cAlright, don\u2019t tease him anymore.\u201dNo matter how Shang Sirui looked at this scene, he felt it was strange; over on the sofa were two people, and over by his side were another two people, with only him being left all alone. \u201cDuring the promotions for this season, didn\u2019t they say there were going to be six people? Where is my little companion?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have a little companion,\u201d Pei Tingsong mocked, \u201cSingle Domination\u00a0SSR\u00a0card.\u201dThe two people then started creating an uproar, and Fang Juexia, who felt a bit flustered, wandered around the hall, in an attempt to ease his emotions after finding out this\u00a0juicy piece of gossip.Turning around, he stood in front of the last door alone. This door also didn\u2019t have a lock, instead, having a display screen embedded into it. Just as he was about to touch it, to light up the display, another hand reached out to it first. Looking back, it was Xia Xiqing\u2019s.\u201cThis kind of door can usually only be opened after all the clues and the plot has been cleared.\u201dFang Juexia nodded. The display screen showed what looked like a 6\u00d76 chessboard, with 36 small squares all painted in different colors; it was\u00a0similar\u00a0to the painting they had seen in the consultation room before, but each grid here was of the same general size.Xia Xiqing saw the question hanging above the grid and read it out loud, \u201cPlease select a button from the grid below. Note that if you make a wrong choice, you will need to wait for an hour before making the second choice.\u201d\u201cAgain the same.\u201d He raised his eyebrows impatiently. \u201cThe answer must be hidden here somewhere. It\u2019s impossible for them to want us to just guess at it randomly.\u201dFang Juexia noticed a gray X in the lower right hand corner of the screen, and realised that it wasn\u2019t that noticeable under the white light being emitted by the screen.Zhou Ziheng also seemed to have joined the camp of \u2018Poking fun at Shang Sirui\u2019. He was even suggesting that Shang Sirui should pull in the members of his own group to play together with them next time. Just like Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia, however things turned out, at least his own bandmates would also be there on the ticket.Shang Sirui faced off against Zhou Ziheng and Pei Tingsong all on his own, and looked like he was actually having fun. \u201cI\u2019m just not going to, I want to keep my solo character. I won\u2019t have a partner; I\u2019ll be the number one golden bachelor of the entertainment industry.\u201dPei Tingsong clapped before putting his palms on Shang Sirui\u2019s head. \u201cVow to be single x2.\u201dJust as their argument was heating up, the room was filled with the sound of the program\u2019s announcement voice declaring, \u201cPlease note, the last player has escaped from their initialization room.\u201d\u201cYi?\u201d Shang Sirui looked completely confused.Pei Tingsong released Shang Sirui\u2019s head from in-between his hands.Zhou Ziheng also frowned and asked, \u201cThere are still other doors here?\u201dJust when everyone was confused, a sound suddenly came from the showcase wall, and a door-shape from the wall was pushed open.\u201cSo it turns out that this is an invisible door!\u201d Shang Sirui clicked his tongue several times and commented, \u201cThe props group is really powerful, too rich.\u201dFrom the invisible door\u2019s room came a tall girl, wearing a stiff black coat, with a shirt and riding pants inside, a pair of high leather boots on her feet and long hair that trailed over her shoulders, while her eyebrows and eyes carried a heroic air.\u201cHello, I\u2019m Zhai Ying.\u201d She lowered her head a little, then raised her head again. \u201cIt looks like I\u2019m the last player.\u201dShang Sirui felt she looked familiar. \u201cAh, I know. You\u2019re the leader of Astar\u2019s new girl group, aren\u2019t you?\u201dZhai Ying nodded.Pei Tingsong instinctively looked at Fang Juexia, and noticed that the other party didn\u2019t seem to have any response to this. Fang Juexia also realized that Pei Tingsong was looking at him and understood what he wanted to ask, so he directly shook his head at him, expressing that he didn\u2019t know this person.Fang Juexia seldom had contact with the girl group trainees before leaving Astar, but he did pretty much recognize some of them. However, he didn\u2019t really know this Zhai Ying; maybe she only entered Astar after he left, or maybe she was an airborne, like Pei Tingsong.He just found it interesting that the resources that Liang Ruo had strenuously worked so hard to grab had, in the end, ended up with his own company\u2019s junior sister. In light of this, Zhai Ying wasn\u2019t someone who would be afraid of the difficulty of the script at all.\u201cNow that everyone is here, let\u2019s sit down and check the plot\u00a0ba.\u201d Xia Xiqing took the lead in sitting down in front of the sofa, then he took out the sheet detailing his medical record, and put it on the coffee table. \u201cThe three of us have already discussed it briefly before. To save time, I\u2019ll tell everyone about it again, and whatever I miss, Juexia can add in.\u201d\u201cMy room was probably a waiting room. Just now, I asked Sirui and Ziheng, and the structure of the three rooms we were in was the same, but the details weren\u2019t, and these two people\u2019s rooms were interlinked. Anyway, I think they were all waiting rooms. Juexia and Xiao Pei\u2019s initialization room was the consultation room. Xiao Pei is playing the role of a psychologist, and Juexia was the first patient to see the doctor.\u201dJuexia nodded, and based on his words, took out the appointment form to show everyone. \u201cThis is the clue we found in the consultation room. If there\u2019s not something we\u2019re missing, then everyone\u2019s character\u2019s names should be found on it.\u201d[Reservation form:Teacher YanZaozaoZoeXiao Xi]Shang Sirui glanced at it and said, \u201cIt really has me\u00a0yi. My character is the lead singer of a band, and his name is Zoe. There was a guitar bag in the room where I started, and there was also a flyer for our band\u2019s performance.\u201d Saying that, he took out the leaflet and put it on the coffee table. Pei Tingsong picked it up and looked at it; it had a very obvious underground-band style going on. \u201cFactorX bar, 8:00 p.m., special invitation for the first spring performance of the band \u2018Together\u2019.\u201dShang Sirui flipped to another pamphlet and said, \u201cOh, yes, this is my medical record.\u201dHis medical record was similar to Xia Xiqing\u2019s, with his symptoms noted on it, but his symptoms were different\u2014 mainly being manic anxiety, decline in memory, and a certain degree of anorexia.Seeing that he had taken out his medical records, Xia Xiqing also took out his own medical records and Zaozao\u2019s suicide note, and gave a general account about them. After that, he looked at Zhou Ziheng and said, \u201cWhat about yours?\u201dZhou Ziheng picked up a schoolbag from the armrest of the sofa. \u201cThis is the schoolbag that was in my room. There are some college-level physics and astronomy textbooks, and a note written to me by someone else, about an appointment to go study together tonight with me.\u201dAs soon as he said that, Pei Tingsong immediately chuckled, and then Shang Sirui, while suppressing his smile, went ahead and high-fived Pei Tingsong. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t get it at first, but soon remembered that Zhou Ziheng and Xia Xiqing\u2019s CP name was\u00a0ZiXi.Zhou Ziheng cleared his throat and took out the note. There was indeed such a sentence in the note\u2014[Xiao Xi, let\u2019s go study together in classroom 2 tonight\u00a0ba, same place.]\u201cThis is my medical record. It seems that my problems aren\u2019t small, I suffer from weak nerves and paranoia.\u201dShang Sirui would make use of every opportunity. \u201cIt\u2019s what you get for studying quantum mechanics.\u201dZhou Ziheng contended, \u201cThere is no such thing.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgShang Sirui also pointed to the paper on top of the textbook. \u201cOh, yes, this is it. You can see what parallel universes and multi-universes he looks at all day long, and it must be because of reading all this that he grew paranoid.\u201dFang Juexia thought out loud, \u201cSo one of you is Xiao Xi, the other one is Zoe, but we still have one\u2026\u201d Then he looked at Zhai Ying, who was the last to escape from the initialization room.Zhai Ying said quietly, \u201cI wanted to say something at the start of Xiqing Ge\u2019s speech, but I ended up waiting for you guys to finish talking first.\u201d She pointed to the door to her room. \u201cMy room isn\u2019t a waiting room. If you guys want to see it, you can go in and have a look. As for my role\u2026\u201d She glanced at the appointment form. \u201cIt\u2019s not that of a patient with an appointment.\u201dFang Juexia looked at the now open invisible door, and the room behind it seemed dim and dark. He had originally thought that the script had clearly designated roles, that was, the psychologist and his patients, but now it seems that it wasn\u2019t so simple. The reason why the program group had created the door to her room as invisible must be to indicate the peculiarity of Zhai Ying\u2019s role.Zhai Ying took out a letter and put it on the coffee table. \u201cThis is the clue I got after unlocking the password for my room. It\u2019s an anonymous letter.\u201dXia Xiqing opened the letter and read it out loud, \u201cHello\u00a0detective, what I want to ask\u00a0you\u00a0to do this time is to find a fugitive. He is steeped in crime and is very good at hiding his identity. All I know is that his last appearance was at the most famous private psychological clinic in the city. Please be sure to find him. Yours truly.\u201dAfter this letter was read out loud, all of their previous suppositions were pretty much overturned.Shang Sirui sighed and commented, \u201cWow, a female detective. So cool\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cSo, there is still a criminal here,\u201d Pei Tingsong said.Hearing this point, Shang Sirui clapped his hands. \u201cI said it before\u00a0ma, the program group always conforms the killers\u2019 identity with murderers and criminals\u00a0ah, but here, everyone is either a doctor or a patient, and I kept wondering how we could find the killer. Now, this makes some sense.\u201dZhou Ziheng said, \u201cThis letter points out that the fugitive should be in this clinic, so doesn\u2019t that mean that one of us here is the fugitive?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why Zhai Ying\u2019s room was behind the wall.\u201d Pei Tingsong glanced at it. \u201cI think that if we want to get a clear view on the situation now, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll have to go to her room to look around again.\u201dZhai Ying lifted her hand and concurred, \u201cI agree. Anyway, right now, only my room is different.\u201dSo they decided to first go to the detective\u2019s room to check for clues. Fang Juexia deliberately slowed down his pace; if the room was really short on light, he would need someone to stand in front of him to ensure that no accidents happened.As he walked to the door step by step, Fang Juexia confirmed his conjecture from before. The room was indeed very dark, and although there seemed to be a faint light source in the interior, in Fang Juexia\u2019s case, he pretty much couldn\u2019t see anything.He heard Shang Sirui\u2019s voice say, \u201cIt\u2019s so dark in here, it\u2019s a little scary. How could they let a girl start in this kind of room\u00a0ah?\u201dZhai Ying said lightly, \u201cI am not afraid.\u201dHe also heard Zhou Ziheng\u2019s voice, as he spoke very quietly, \u201cAre you ok? Turn around and go out, when I come out, I\u2019ll tell you what was there.\u201d\u201cNo need, the door is open.\u201d Xia Xiqing replied.Fang Juexia stood at the door and held the door frame, then took a deep breath. Just as he was about to step in, his shoulder was caught.\u201cDon\u2019t stand in the entranceway\u00a0ah.\u201dIt was Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice.He could feel Pei Tingsong\u2019s slow steps approach him, and his foresight enabled him to feel the fluctuating air currents that were disturbed when Pei Tingsong reached out his hand towards him, and his sensitive senses allowed him to clearly feel the strength being put into Pei Tingsong\u2019s grasp on his shoulder\u2014all of this made it seem as if he had grasped his breath instead.His heart suddenly calmed down, with every heartbeat moving with the second hand of his internal little clock, and he could hear it loud and clear in the dark.\u201cI started right in front of this table.\u201d Zhai Ying took the others inside and headed towards the light that looked very weak.Shang Sirui was curious. \u201cWhat mechanism did your room have?\u201d\u201cA code lock cracked with Morse code,\u201d explained Zhai Ying as she opened the drawer, and there was a safe in the drawer. \u201cThis safe has a mechanical lock and two passwords. You have to collect the pieces of the puzzle scattered in this room to open it. Once you open it, you\u2019ll find a book inside.\u201d She opened the door of the safe, took out a book from it, and put it on the table. \u201cThe key to the room was hidden in the book.\u201dShang Sirui couldn\u2019t help but sigh emotionally. \u201cThis mechanism looks so difficult\u00a0ah.\u201dXia Xiqing\u2019s attention was attracted by the wall the desk rested against. Some notes were pasted on that wall, on which were written the names of all the characters being played by the other players. In the middle of it all were some arrows and lines interconnecting them all.With Pei Tingsong\u2019s guidance, Fang Juexia also came to the table. He held the edge of the table and looked at the character relationship diagram displayed on the wall under that faint light.Shang Sirui teased them, \u201cYou two are practically stuck together, Xiao Pei has changed\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cHave I?\u201d Pei Tingsong smiled.\u201cWhen your whole group appears together, you two aren\u2019t actually so sticky. Once you two come out alone though, you keep following after each other like shadows. And you\u2019re even denying it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong thought for a while and said, \u201cWe each form one-sixth of our group, but when it\u2019s only the two of us that come out, we become one-half of a group, so of course, we have to take care of each other.\u201d Pei Tingsong gripped Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder and asked, \u201cRight, other half?\u201dIn the dark, Fang Juexia nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dAfter joking around, they once again focused their attention on the relationship diagram left by the detective.\u201cTeacher Yan, high school math teacher,\u201d Xia Xiqing went down the line, \u201cis Zaozao\u2019s teacher.\u201dZaozao had more than one arrow connected to her, and the other one pointed to Zoe, with the word \u201cfan\u201d written on the arrow, thereby describing her relationship with the band\u2019s lead singer.\u201cSo Zaozao is Zoe\u2019s fan?\u201d Shang Sirui, who played Zoe, poked at Xia Xiqing with a big smile. \u201cLittle fan.\u201dXia Xiqing grinned and looked at the picture again. \u201cThe college student studying astronomy is Zaozao\u2019s neighbor, and he was the one who introduced Dr. Tian to Zaozao.\u201dFang Juexia stared at all these lines, and realized that the ones who had the most lines surrounding them were Zaozao and Dr. Tian. This high school girl had become one of the key characters in connecting all the other characters, and they were all also patients of Dr. Tian.\u201cThis picture was left behind by the detective.\u201d Zhou Ziheng analyzed, \u201cWhen we regard this character relationship diagram as one of the clues, we are imperceptibly also accepting the impression of the detective having a positive image. It\u2019s relevant, but we\u2019re still not sure whether the detective character is reliable or not.\u201dHis words acted as a reminder to everyone. Shang Sirui immediately nodded and added, \u201cThat\u2019s right, previously, the program group often liked to add this kind of a twist, with the character who looked like a good person finally turning out to be the big boss.\u201dPei Tingsong smiled, put his hand on his shoulder, and joked, \u201cWasn\u2019t that you? Senior brother.\u201dShang Sirui was about to hit him, but then he discovered this person was wearing a glove on that hand. Upon seeing that, he remembered that Pei Tingsong had also been wearing gloves during the charity party in Shanghai, so he asked curiously, \u201cWhy do you always wear gloves these days? Doesn\u2019t it feel uncomfortable? \u201cHearing this, Fang Juexia\u2019s attention shifted away from the relationship map on the wall. He couldn\u2019t help but listen in on their conversation, fearing that the truth of his drunken behavior would be exposed. Although he knew that that wouldn\u2019t happen; at the very least, Pei Tingsong wouldn\u2019t expose him while they were in front of the camera.\u201cAh, that.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice was understated as he explained, \u201cMy little pet accidentally scratched me and broke the skin on the back of my hand. It looks a bit bad on camera, so the stylist gave me gloves.\u201dAs Fang Juexia listened with one ear, his head lowered unconsciously, and his hand was grasping the edge of the table.\u201cReally? Then you have to go to the hospital for an injection.\u201d Shang Sirui wanted to pull the glove off. \u201cShall I see if it\u2019s serious?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not serious. It\u2019s a pretty small wound, and medicine has been applied to it.\u201dShang Sirui patted him on the shoulder. \u201cAh, that\u2019s what pets are like. My friend\u2019s hands always end up scratched whenever he gives his master cat a bath. So fierce, and not obedient at all.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Pei Tingsong chuckled. \u201cMy little master is pretty obedient.\u201d\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 41Chapter 41 \u2013 Each With Their Own IdeaTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksTrue knights never retreat.There was a sudden clattering sound. The conversation between the two of them was interrupted, and when Shang Sirui glanced over, he saw that Fang Juexia had accidentally dropped the book, that they had just taken out of the safe, onto the ground.Fang Juexia quickly squatted down and felt around for the book on the ground with his hands. His entire field of vision was plunged into complete darkness, when suddenly, he felt something; however, it wasn\u2019t a book, but rather the texture of a cool leather glove.The deprivation of his sense of vision had resulted in his sense of touch growing that much more profound.\u201cThis book is quite thick.\u201d Pei Tingsong composedly picked up the book before he could and glanced at the cover. \u201cNorth\u2026\u201d After saying just that word, he used his ungloved warm hand and pulled Fang Juexia up, helping him into standing upright, while complaining out loud at the same time, \u201cGet up\u00a0bei,\u00a0or else, in a while, your legs will go soft again.\u201dAlthough Fang Juexia looked calm on the surface, these words of Pei Tingsong\u2019s echoed in his heart repeatedly.Pei Tingsong placed the book on the table casually and continued to chat with Shang Sirui.Zhou Ziheng, Xia Xiqing, and Zhai Ying, who had finished looking at the relationship map on the wall, were still discussing it.Due to his habit of thinking rigorously, Zhou Ziheng kept feeling as though this relationship map might not be completely depended upon. Xia Xiqing on the other hand, felt that his resistance to this map was a little too much, and commented, \u201cYou are being very strange, if you had gotten the good camp card as usual, you wouldn\u2019t play like this.\u201d\u201cOf course, this is only my opinion,\u201d Zhou Ziheng didn\u2019t concede in the slightest, and argued, \u201cBut you can\u2019t always rely on the players\u2019 gaming habits to judge what\u2019s going on; that counts as outside information\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cSo,\u201d Zhai Ying interrupted them in the middle of their debate, \u201cIn your opinion, my role is that of a detective who suddenly burst into the scene. If we proceed to deduce on the basis of a conventional plot line, then this person is a clue provider. However, as Zhou Ziheng said, if these clues do not hold up, then the role of detective could be to create a twist in the plot.\u201dWhile speaking, she unbuttoned her overcoat and put one hand into the pockets of her riding pants before continuing, \u201cThen, if we follow this route, is it possible that the most vulnerable looking female high school student could create this kind of dramatic twist? And then there\u2019s the psychiatrist, the most positive looking character. Of course, if the lead singer of a band is involved in a homicide, it may also create a sensation.\u201dHer logic was clear, and her speech was very organized. After hearing this, Fang Juexia went towards their group and added, \u201cI agree with Zhai Ying. In fact, in addition to all this, the two characters, that of the teacher and the college student, are very easily forgettable because they are not that distinctive, and inconspicuous characters like these are also often linked to twists in the plot. So I think that everyone is, roughly and equally, as suspicious.\u201dXia Xiqing nodded, then gave his opinion, \u201cWell founded, and irrefutable. But I would like to ask, if the program group really needed to create such a twist, why did they connect the seemingly vulnerable female high school student with almost everyone else? Doesn\u2019t this make everyone very suspicious of that particular character?\u201dZhou Ziheng laughed and used Xia Xiqing\u2019s logic to counterattack, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because the program group knows that you are the one who is going to perform that character\u2019s role. If they hadn\u2019t made the role a bit dazzling, it wouldn\u2019t match your playing style.\u201dThe others all laughed.Pei Tingsong, who was bored, was half lying on the table and flipping the pages of the book on the desk. \u201cI want to see your room.\u201dShang Sirui nodded. \u201cGo\u00a0bei.\u201d Then he added, \u201cDo you want me to accompany you?\u201dPei Tingsong glanced at Fang Juexia, who, coincidentally, was also looking back at him. However, he wasn\u2019t sure whether Fang Juexia could actually see him or not.\u201cWhatever you want,\u201d said Pei Tingsong.Fang Juexia turned his face away.Oh, so it turned out that he could see.\u201cI won\u2019t go,\u201d said Shang Sirui as he hugged Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve seen enough, I had to stay there so long that I\u2019ve become traumatized by it now. Go look around yourself, and I\u2019ll stay here. Maybe there are more clues in this room. Right, Juexia?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Fang Juexia didn\u2019t look at Pei Tingsong again.\u201cAlright.\u201d Pei Tingsong stopped flipping through the book with his hand, and threw it upside down on the table. \u201cIs there anyone else who wants to go with me?\u201dZhou Ziheng turned around and said, \u201cI want to see the clinic.\u201d While he said that, his hand rubbed the back of Xia Xiqing\u2019s neck. Xia Xiqing turned around and said, \u201cYou go\u00a0ba, I\u2019ll stay here.\u201dPei Tingsong tilted his head at Zhou Ziheng in a gesture that indicated they should go, and the two people left together.Xia Xiqing, who had been left behind, carefully sorted through the whole relationship diagram, and then turned over any part of the room that might still contain plot clues, including the mattress in the detective room.Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t see clearly, and thus lost the advantage of investigating this room.However, he had a keen sense of hearing. In the midst of the noisy discussion and sounds of rummaging that echoed through the room, he heard a very small sound. It was the sound of music playing, but it was very, very light\u2014almost playing at the minimum possible volume\u2014and was completely submerged by the loud sounds of the room. If it wasn\u2019t because he couldn\u2019t see at all and could only rely on his hearing right now, he would have definitely missed it as well.It was like an auditory hallucination, and he had pretty much no way to ensure whether the music was real or not, but the darkness allowed him the initiative to grope around somewhat. Guided by his hearing, he followed the sound bit by bit.The edge of the table, the cold wall, the wooden shelf, the single sofa, the soft cushion. The changing feel guided his steps.Once he sat on the sofa, Fang Juexia took a deep breath.He kept getting closer and closer to the sound of the music, drawing closer and closer to the real source. He reached into the gap in the sofa cushion behind him.All of a sudden\u2014\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you, Juexia?\u201dUpon hearing Xia Xiqing\u2019s voice, Fang Juexia composedly withdrew his hand from the cushion and shook his head with a smile. \u201cMy waist hasn\u2019t been very good recently. I\u2019ve been practicing dancing to the point where I can\u2019t quite\u2026 I can\u2019t quite stand for very long. I wanted to sit down.\u201dHe struggled within his heart for a long time before finally giving a tentative invitation, \u201cYou\u2026 Would you like to come and have a seat?\u201dAfter waiting for a few seconds, he heard Xia Xiqing\u2019s reply, \u201cForget it, I\u2019m getting uncomfortable being shut up in here, so I\u2019m going out.\u201dXia Xiqing left the dark room, and when he was supporting himself against the hidden door, he suddenly noticed that this wall also had a bunch of paintings hanging on it. These paintings seemed to belong to a collection of a series of paintings, all of which are acclaimed masterpieces of the school of abstract art. One of them caught his attention, and it was \u2018The Death of Marat\u2019.He gazed at this world-famous painting, only to discover that something was not quite right with it. He reached out and took it down.Shang Sirui and Zhai Ying were still looking for clues within the room. Zhai Ying seemed to be a person of few words and didn\u2019t respond much to Shang Sirui. Or maybe it was to avoid arousing any sort of suspicion about a relationship between idols of the opposite sex, but in any case, the two of them didn\u2019t communicate very much. As he sat in the darkness, Fang Juexia pondered for a while, then took out his hand from under the sofa cushion, and gripped the item he had extracted from it tightly. His whole person then leaned on the sofa with his hands on his forehead.This small recording pen had a button on it, and when Fang Juexia pressed it, the subtle music stopped suddenly. After three seconds of silence, the small, broken and static crackling sound grew clear.It was a girl\u2019s voice\u2014\u201cI\u2019m calling in the hope that we can work together. You guys also don\u2019t want to be like this, do you\u2026\u201d\u201cOnly by getting rid of him, only by getting rid of him\u2026\u201dZhou Ziheng first took Pei Tingsong to see Shang Sirui\u2019s room, and it really was very simple. Pei Tingsong sat on the sofa, picked up the guitar, and played it. \u201cThe sound isn\u2019t bad.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know much about music.\u201d Zhou Ziheng asked, \u201cWhat kind of guitar is this?\u201d\u201cHollow body guitar.\u201d Pei Tingsong put the guitar back. As he chatted with Zhou Ziheng about music, they arrived at the psychologist\u2019s room. Zhou Ziheng\u2019s attention was attracted by the big table placed in the middle. \u201cThis should have been where all your clues were concentrated\u00a0ba.\u201dPei Tingsong had just come out of the waiting room and now stood in front of the big bookcase, staring at the various books placed in it. He let out an \u201cen\u201d and added, \u201cIt was pretty difficult. At that time, both of us were wearing hoods, so we couldn\u2019t see, and our hands and feet were all tied up.\u201d\u201cWe were also wearing hoods. The square ones were especially funny,\u201d said Zhou Ziheng as he sat down on the chair that Pei Tingsong had started in. While checking whether there was any mechanism on his chair, Zhou Ziheng chatted enthusiastically, \u201cThe audience will probably be very amused when they watch it, we\u2019ve all got square heads.\u201dHe heard the sound of a guitar, and looked up to see Pei Tingsong holding a pocket-sized ukulele, strumming its strings and playing a tune.Zhou Ziheng raised his eyebrows and expressed his admiration, \u201cThe theme song of our film.\u201d\u201cThe program group is really meticulous, they\u2019re all good instruments.\u201d Pei Tingsong turned around and returned it back to its original place.Just then, they heard the program\u2019s announcement sound out\u2014\u201cPlayers, please note that there is still half an hour before the first public vote for who to execute takes place. Please brainstorm together and discuss the person you suspect most likely to be the killer in the remaining amount of time.\u201dSo fast? Fang Juexia calculated the time. Quite a long period of time had passed, but the program group hadn\u2019t yet made the information about the knight\u2019s camp public. It seemed that they wanted everyone to execute a player first, after which they would announce it.The six people came out of the rooms and sat down in the reception hall after this announcement.\u201cHow do we discuss it?\u201d Pei Tingsong bent over and flipped through some of the clues lying on the coffee table, \u201cIt seems that we haven\u2019t sorted through too many leads yet, so we can\u2019t just blindly throw someone out now.\u201dUnexpectedly, his words immediately drew Xia Xiqing\u2019s attack. \u201cXiao Pei, don\u2019t you want to tell everyone that you jumped out and announced your role of being the knight along with me in the clinic?\u201dIn fact, Fang Juexia had wanted to tell everyone about this matter early on itself, so as to allow them to lock the role of the knight onto these two people. However, he never managed to find a suitable time to disclose it, and found it risky because he had even less of a position to stand on; if he wasn\u2019t careful, he could end up drawing fire upon himself.He hadn\u2019t expected Xia Xiqing to be the one who mentioned it first.Pei Tingsong kept calm in the face of this emergency. \u201cYes\u00a0ah, I almost forgot.\u201d He then gave everyone a brief account of what had happened, which was, of course, based on his own standpoint and logic. \u201cXiqing Ge wanted to pull Juexia Ge into being a part of his team, and so explosively revealed that he was the knight. Coincidentally, he\u00a0kicked my iron plate, so I jumped out on the spot to expose him and said that I was the real knight instead.\u201dXia Xiqing laughed. \u201cTo be honest with you\u00a0ba, I can\u2019t directly be sure that you aren\u2019t the killer wearing knightly clothes, but if you honestly admit that you are not the knight right now, I will continue to believe that you are taking the bullet for the real knight. You choose yourself.\u201dPei Tingsong didn\u2019t fear his words at all, instead raising his eyebrows. \u201cAre you implying something about me? Sorry, I don\u2019t understand. True knights never retreat.\u201dSuch a big and wonderful play was being acted out right from the start in front of everyone. Shang Sirui was dazzled by all this and said, \u201cDid the program group get something wrong? This isn\u2019t a double-faced knight, but rather a true and false knight\u00a0ba.\u201dZhou Ziheng observed the two people\u2019s condition and inquired, \u201cWhat? Is everyone getting ready to get rid of the knight in this round? But right now, the knight\u2019s camp hasn\u2019t been made public yet.\u201dZhai Ying had her arms wrapped around her chest as she watched this fun play. \u201cSince the two of them dare to openly take up the gauntlet, their camp is very obvious; they both will state that they are white knights\u00a0ba.\u201dFang Juexia knew that he couldn\u2019t not say anything right now, but he also couldn\u2019t speak casually. The conflict in this round was centered around and between Xia Xiqing and Pei Tingsong, but if he wasn\u2019t careful with his words, things would become more complicated.The best route for him to take right now was to just pretend to be a regular player.He tried to think from a different angle. If he actually was an ordinary player right now, what would be his highest priority?It would still be finding the killer\u2019s identity, that\u2019s right.\u201cI don\u2019t think this round should be concerned with the knight\u2019s identity yet. Our opportunity to vote is very precious and is the only method we have by which we can get ahead of the killer, because the killer also has the right to kill a player. Everyone, don\u2019t forget that.\u201dXia Xiqing looked at him, and the corners of his mouth carried a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s right. But in my opinion, someone who would fight about being the knight with me definitely can\u2019t be holding a good person card.\u201dYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s directly leaping out to fight about being the knight ba, Gege\u2014complained Fang Juexia in his heart.Pei Tingsong counterattacked, \u201cIn my opinion, you\u2019re the same. If it wasn\u2019t for you taking the initiative to reveal your role, I might still be hiding and supporting my camp, not daring to reveal my face yet, but I can\u2019t just stand and watch the killer wear the white knight\u2019s clothes. So I have to stand up and show myself.\u201dFang Juexia blinked.Pei Tingsong could really talk\u00a0ah. If he wasn\u2019t the real knight, he would have ended up believing his words.The situation was at an impasse for a moment, and everyone remained silent for the next few moments.Zhou Ziheng turned it over in his mind and thought that things were not so simple. \u201cI guess the program group won\u2019t expose the knight\u2019s camp at this time. To tell you the truth, I agree with what Juexia said just now, that this round does not concern the knight, but is for voting to oust the killer. However,\u201d he shifted to another subject, \u201cI also don\u2019t really believe you two when you say that one is real while the other is fake. Maybe both are fake, and the real knight is still hidden in the darkness.\u201dFang Juexia secretly gripped his fingers as he heard Shang Sirui open his mouth and analyze further, \u201cJust now, Xiqing told us that he was the white knight, and then he also told Xiao Pei that \u2018if you are the fake trying to take a bullet for me, you should back down immediately, and I will believe you are a good person. If you don\u2019t, then you are the killer.\u2019 At first glance, this logic makes a lot of sense and seems a lot like how the white knight should think.\u201cBut do you guys remember what Xiao Pei also mentioned just now? Xiqing revealed his identity specifically to cozy up to Juexia, and that\u2019s a bit strange. The white knight revealing himself at the start itself, wouldn\u2019t that lead to a fatal disaster soon enough? In order for the good people to win, you shouldn\u2019t be using your own role of being the knight in exchange for an alliance\u00a0ba.\u201dShang Sirui\u2019s logic was quite clear, and this was also the point Fang Juexia had thought Xia Xiqing hadn\u2019t gotten right. However, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for him to say that, so he felt that Shang Sirui\u2019s statement was very appropriate.Zhai Ying continued to add, \u201cThere\u2019s another point. Xiqing Ge revealed his identity such a long time ago, and the killer still hasn\u2019t killed him. Isn\u2019t that also very strange? But there\u2019s another even stranger point; if Xiqing Ge belongs to the dark camp, when he pretended to take a shot at Pei Tingsong\u2019s identity, shouldn\u2019t he also have taken action then? No, because up until now, nothing has happened.\u201dAfter listening to her, Fang Juexia thought for a moment before inserting his opinion, \u201cThe killer might be one of these two people, but I fear we can\u2019t judge whether a player is the killer or not from their performance in the game. Let\u2019s not forget that the killer in \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019 is always linked to the plotline.\u201d Saying that, he paused again and then, according to the manner of thinking of ordinary players, continued, \u201cOf course, the purpose of our vote is to do our utmost to get rid of the killer, so even if I can\u2019t see the entire situation right now, I can choose to vote someone out to ensure that the votes of the people belonging to the good camp will not be wasted.\u201dHis words seemed to gain the approval of all the players there, for everyone nodded.At this point in time, if they chose not to vote, then the biggest beneficiary would be the killer, because that person\u2019s chance of getting executed would thus be greatly reduced. So even if you killed a good person by mistake, you had to fight and vote, just for the possibility of actually managing to oust the killer.Soon, a voting prompt sounded from the room\u2019s speakers.\u201cPlayers have a total of 30 seconds to vote. Please fill in the name of the player you suspect to be the killer. The countdown starts now.\u201dEveryone scattered a little farther away from each other and took out the cellphone that the program group had given them to vote with. Fang Juexia walked to the showcase wall with the hidden door and lowered his head as he took out his cellphone. A premonition lingered in his mind, one that had been in the forefront ever since he had come out of that dark room behind the hidden door.\u201cFive\u2014\u201d\u201cFour\u2014\u201d\u201cThree\u2014\u201dFang Juexia typed in a name.\u201cTwo\u2014\u201d\u201cOne.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgAnd sent it.As he locked the screen, Fang Juexia\u2019s heart was beating really fast. He stuffed his cellphone into his pocket and waited nervously for the program group\u2019s evaluation. The words exchanged between Xia Xiqing and Pei Tingsong when they were fighting to reach the finish were still ringing in their ears, and he couldn\u2019t accurately judge whether his decision was critical or correct.\u201cPlayers, please note that the result of this vote is\u2026\u201dJust as the program group\u2019s announcement rang out again, Fang Juexia\u2019s heart lifted.\u201cA tie. We will not execute any of the players, and the game will continue. There is half an hour until the next round of voting, so everyone should seize this time to uncover the identity of the members of the dark camp hidden amongst you, part through the clouds, and successfully escape for your life.\u201dHe let out a breath of relief.Raising his head, he internally analyzed the likelihood of who voted for who. As he was thinking about it, Fang Juexia accidentally realized that there seemed to be a picture missing from this wall. The piece of wall revealed by this lacking painting was completely empty, with only an imprint left, which made for a really unfriendly gesture towards obsessive-compulsive patients like him.Looking around, he saw that the missing painting was actually placed next to a cabinet near the gate, inside which was a tea set. Fang Juexia went over and picked up the painting. The man painted on it had died in a bathtub, whilst holding a letter and a pen in his hand.His obsessive-compulsive disorder forced him to hang the painting back onto its blank position on the wall, while making sure it was straight. Fang Juexia looked at his achievement with satisfaction, but found that the painting deviated a little from its inner frame, showing a little white edge there.Too uncomfortable. No matter how he looked at it, he found it uncomfortable.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Xia Xiqing appeared from behind him and placed his hand on his shoulder. \u201cAre you interested in this painting?\u201dFang Juexia looked back and smiled at him. He wanted to say that he had just wanted to hang up the painting, but upon seeing Xia Xiqing, he suddenly thought of something.The hand that was holding onto the frame began to sweat, and Fang Juexia adjusted his breathing before speaking, \u201cEn, although I don\u2019t understand it in particular, I feel that there should be some story behind this painting.\u201dXia Xiqing nodded. \u201cYou guessed right, you really do possess an artistic sensitivity. This painting shows Marat, an assassinated leader during the French Revolution.\u201d He shrugged and complained, \u201cBut this is not a very good imitation.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Fang Juexia laughed. \u201cI can\u2019t tell.\u201dMarat\u2026A leader.He gazed at the picture on the wall and kept feeling that something was off.Zhou Ziheng came up and asked, \u201cWhat are you guys talking about?\u201d\u201cArt.\u201d Xia Xiqing smiled at him.Looking at how the two people were drawing closer, Fang Juexia automatically turned away and moved out of that space a little bit, trying not to disturb them. However, as soon as he turned his head, he realized Zhai Ying was standing at his side.\u201cJuexia Ge, I heard you studied mathematics.\u201dFang Juexia nodded. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cI found this in the psychologist\u2019s room; it seems to be scratch paper.\u201d Zhai Ying handed him the paper in her hand. \u201cAre these formulas meaningful?\u201dFang Juexia looked at it carefully. \u201cThese formulas are part of a calculus problem. If we have to say that there\u2019s a meaning, then there is probably no other meaning, it\u2019s just an ordinary double integral.\u201d Some other sets were also written on one side of the equation.\u201cThen is the answer to this question right?\u201d Zhai Ying asked.Fang Juexia\u2019s attention was drawn back to the calculus problem. \u201cI\u2019ll calculate it.\u201d So he took the paper and the pen Zhai Ying handed him as he bent over and used the cabinet where he had just found the painting as a writing desk.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll come back later.\u201d Zhai Ying left directly, leaving Fang Juexia alone. He was absorbed in the calculations, and quickly arrived at the same result as on the original scratch paper. Fang Juexia turned to look for Zhai Ying, but almost bumped into another person who had drawn close to him now.\u201cAre you stumbling around outside too now?\u201dHis arm was grasped by someone, and Fang Juexia, holding the calculus paper in his hand, looked up, only to see Pei Tingsong\u2019s face.His speech had always been filled with multiple hints, one after another, in riddles only the two of them understood.Pet, one-sixth, little master\u2026He was too good at playing word games.\u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as it doesn\u2019t happen when I dance.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s tone was calm as he pulled his arm out of his grasp and came to a steady stand. He folded both the\u00a0 scratch paper and the paper he had calculated on and stuffed them into his pants pocket. However, Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t seem to give up. \u201cYou didn\u2019t run into something in there\u00a0ba?\u201d he asked, before putting his hands on his shoulder, turning him over and over again, almost touching him all over his body. \u201cI\u2019ll check.\u201dFang Juexia felt that it wasn\u2019t good to be like this in front of the camera, it was a bit too intimate, so he tried to push Pei Tingsong away. As they went back and forth like this, the two of them started to look like two cats entangled together and fighting each other. However, Fang Juexia finally failed to twist around as much as Pei Tingsong, so he stopped struggling and was forced to accept this \u201cinspection\u201d.\u201cYou seem to still have a lot of energy. I heard from Senior Brother that your waist was hurting.\u201d Pei Tingsong patted Fang Juexia\u2019s chest. \u201cYou\u2019re very lively, I\u2019m relieved.\u201dWith this move, Fang Juexia froze.The instigator of this whole thing left the scene and walked towards Shang Sirui. When the two of them got together, it was all jokes and banter again, while Fang Juexia stood still at that spot, not moving at all, as he kept looking at Pei Tingsong\u2019s back.He adjusted his breathing, turned around to face this cabinet, which came up to the height of half a person, and then stood there in silence for a very long time.Sensing the camera in front of the cabinet twisting and turning to his side, Fang Juexia regained his senses and focused his gaze on the contents of the cabinet. There was an exquisite tea set in it, with a beautiful European style white glazed teapot, and several tea cups, which were arranged in a straight line along the edge of the cabinet.But this line\u2026 it wasn\u2019t straight enough.Obsessive-compulsive disorder made him reach out and adjust the position of the cups until they were all in a straight horizontal line.\u201cAlright,\u201d Fang Juexia whispered to himself.However, the very next moment, he suddenly heard a click, and the drawer that had been locked until now automatically unlocked and opened a bit.So this was the way to actually open it?Fang Juexia felt a little surprised and drew closer to the tea set to see what was going on with the mechanism here. He found that an X had been drawn on the teapot with a silver pen.So that\u2019s how it was. Fang Juexia put the teapot away and opened the drawer.Zhou Ziheng and Xia Xiqing, who weren\u2019t far away, also noticed this sound, and turned their heads to look over. They watched Fang Juexia take out a white plaid handkerchief from the inside of the cabinet.\u201cIs that a new clue?\u201d Zhou Ziheng asked.Fang Juexia nodded. \u201cIt should be related to the answer required for the display screen on the main escape gate. It\u2019s all a grid.\u201d He looked down at the handkerchief in his hands, which was embroidered with a few lines of numbers.15.41.23.14.3314.24.1234.23.14.32.1551.24.43.22.55.54\u201cIs this the password\u2026\u201dZhou Ziheng went over and touched the inside of the handkerchief. He felt something, so he picked up the teapot and shook it. There was water in it, which he then poured onto the handkerchief before flattening it out.The white plaid handkerchief turned translucent after getting wet, thus revealing a hidden laminated piece of paper inside, and the words on it gradually grew clear.___1__2__3__4__51__q__w__e__r__t2__y__u_i/j_o__p3__a__s__d__f__g4__h__k__l__z__x5__c__v__b__n__m\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia thought it felt familiar, thought about it a bit more, and soon, he had the answer.\u201cI understand.\u201d Zhou Ziheng subconsciously took out his cellphone and wanted to confirm whether he had gotten it right or not. However, it was only after unlocking the phone that he remembered something, and he laughed as he said, \u201cI forgot. This is the program group\u2019s cellphone.\u201dFang Juexia also laughed.All of a sudden, the program group made an announcement\u2014\u201cAttention, everyone,\u201d\u201cPlayer Pei Tingsong has died.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 42Chapter 42 \u2013 No SpoilersTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksThe winning camp is\u2026\u201cWhat?\u201d Shang Sirui, with a completely panic-stricken look on his face, looked at Pei Tingsong who wasn\u2019t far away. \u201cXiao Pei is dead? Why kill Xiao Pei\u00a0ah?\u201dFang Juexia looked over just to see Pei Tingsong laughing as he joked, \u201cThis program is really unfriendly towards new people.\u201dThe narration from the program group rang out again\u2014\u201dThe dead player has lost all rights to speak. Please head to the execution area and wait to leave the room.\u201dSo he stood up and followed the instructions, heading towards the red circle on the floor of the reception hall, which was the only way by which a dead player could leave the escape room.Fang Juexia stared at Pei Tingsong, and as if due to some tacit understanding between them, he also looked over at the same time.He gave a rare smile, one that seemed to signal that he was admitting defeat as he fell down from the execution area.With the floor closing up again, the first player had officially exited the escape room. The remaining people were all immersed in different moods; some were surprised, while others adjusted their thinking after taking this new reality into account.Pei Tingsong\u2019s death had come so suddenly that everyone was caught off guard.Zhou Ziheng frowned and took a look at the time. \u201cThere are only 15 minutes left before the next round of voting to oust the killer.\u201dFang Juexia looked at the handkerchief on the cupboard again. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we figure this out first?\u201d\u201cWe can leave it here and figure it out at any time.\u201d After saying that, Zhou Ziheng looked at Fang Juexia and said, \u201cYou can rest assured, this main gate definitely contains more than just this one simple lock.\u201dZhou Ziheng then headed towards the sofa and called everyone to gather around for a discussion before the second round of voting.Fang Juexia took one last look, then followed him to the coffee table.\u201cLet\u2019s sort out the clues and elements we have in our hands first.\u201d Zhou Ziheng seemed to have taken the position of the leader. \u201cIn the last round, I believe everyone\u2019s focus was on Xiqing and Xiao Pei, but it\u2019s not realistic to verify everyone\u2019s vote from the last round right now, since after all, the program group has deliberately adopted the anonymous voting method. Both of them survived the voting round, but the killer then killed Xiao Pei. This is very strange, and is worth analyzing.\u201dShang Sirui was still shocked by Pei Tingsong\u2019s death. \u201cWait, let me straighten things out in my head, I\u2019m really confused right now.\u201dAfter holding his head for a long time, he suddenly said, \u201cJust before Xiao Pei died, he stood up and said that he wanted to go back to Zhai Ying\u2019s room to take a look, but he died just as he took two steps in that direction. It couldn\u2019t be that there is something in Zhai Ying\u2019s room?\u201dZhai Ying said, \u201cWhat he\u2019s saying, I also heard it, it\u2019s true. At that time, I also wanted to go look again at my room, but I didn\u2019t expect the program to suddenly announce that he was dead. In addition, when Xiqing Ge and Pei Tingsong confronted each other before, they both said that they were white knights. Now that Xiao Pei is dead, is it possible that the killer killed off the one he thought was the real white knight?\u201dShang Sirui suddenly looked at Xia Xiqing.\u201cWhy are you looking at me\u00a0ma?\u201d Xia Xiqing\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change at all, and he even laughed. \u201cDo you think I killed him? If you just think about it a little bit, you\u2019ll know that that\u2019s impossible. How could there be a killer who put on a knight\u2019s clothing and then immediately after that, kill off the person who is jumping out and declaring that they\u2019re the real knight? Now that Xiao Pei has died, everyone will doubt me. Do you think I would use such a trick, one that would inevitably draw fire upon myself?\u201dZhou Ziheng laughed as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible.\u201dFang Juexia looked at him.\u201cBecause we all know that you are good at playing this game and wouldn\u2019t use such a trick. However, once you did use it, you could actually clear yourself of all suspicion by making everyone think that it is a cheap trick deliberately orchestrated by someone to frame you.\u201dXia Xiqing almost started menacing Zhou Ziheng right then and there, but an announcement from the program group suddenly rang out\u2014\u201cPlayers, please note that we are now announcing the double-faced knight\u2019s chosen camp.\u201dHearing this, Fang Juexia quietly unscrewed the water bottle kept near the sofa and drank some water.\u201cThey\u00a0chose the dark camp.\u201dAll the players had different expressions after hearing that. Fang Juexia tightened the cap on the water bottle cap, set it on the coffee table, and sighed, \u201cA black knight\u2026\u201dZhou Ziheng took the lead in analyzing. \u201cIn fact, I said before at the start that when Xiqing and Xiao Pei were both jumping out at each other, that I felt that the real knight was off to the sides. Because I believe that regardless of whether they belong to the dark or light camp, the knight wouldn\u2019t reveal their card this easily. Of course, this rule becomes invalid when it comes to Xiqing, because he is a player who likes to explosively reveal himself. That\u2019s the only reason why everyone\u2019s view of the situation was so unclear.\u201d\u201cNow that the knight\u2019s camp has been revealed, it just adds more evidence towards my idea; the real knight chose a black card, and he knows that his camp will be revealed sooner or later, so he wouldn\u2019t jump out and reveal himself easily. So, in that case, what roles are the two people who did jump out playing? Either they\u2019re an ordinary player who mistakenly thought that the knight was a white knight and jumped out to block a stab for the knight, or they\u2019re the killer.\u201dAfter saying that, he looked at Xia Xiqing. \u201cThis just verified my previous logic. The first time, you used your identity as a player who explosively reveals himself to let everyone think that you may be the real knight. The second time, you used the assumption that a player belonging to the good camp wouldn\u2019t kill off the only person who had jumped out with the knight identity to clear all suspicion off your head. As for why you killed Xiao Pei? Maybe it was because you really thought that he was a white knight, but I\u2019m more inclined to think that you discovered that Xiao Pei had found evidence that pointed towards your identity.\u201dHis words were forceful and lofty, and the logic he stated was perfectly coherent. After he abruptly stopped speaking, the rest of the players could only consider things according to the pace he had spoken with, and they pretty much didn\u2019t discover any flaws in his reasoning.There was a moment of silence, and even Xia Xiqing just smiled.Fang Juexia folded his hands in front of him and asked, \u201cAccording to this reasoning, we really can analyze the situation where both of them had jumped out, and Xiao Pei\u2019s death just now. However, the killer\u2019s identity is linked to the plot. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good to judge on such things so quickly when the plotline isn\u2019t so clear to us yet.\u201d\u201cAt last, there\u2019s someone who understands.\u201d Xia Xiqing laughed grimly. \u201cBeing a logical computer is your strong point after all, Zhou Ziheng. Let\u2019s put that aside first, and sort out the plot this time.\u201dHe leaned back against the sofa and pointed to the picture on the display wall. \u201cSee the middle painting there? A man who died in a bathtub. This painting is \u2018The Death of Marat\u2019\u2014it shows Marat, a cruel leader of the French Revolution, who was assassinated in a bathtub.\u201d Saying this, he smiled and added, \u201cBut there is something wrong with this painting.\u201d\u201cIn the original painting\u2019s composition, Marat and the bathtub are on the left side of the picture, but this painting has these things reversed, and they\u2019re on the opposite side. When I saw this painting, I knew that this was a clue the program group had set up. So I took the painting down and found this hidden between the canvas and the frame.\u201d He took out a piece of paper, and Fang Juexia recognized it at a glance. It was the same kind of graph paper that was used for the female high school student\u2019s suicide note from before.As Fang Juexia had expected, Xia Xiqing had really opened the painting, so there would be a gap there.Shang Sirui leaned over and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s written on it?\u201dXia Xiqing replied, \u201cThis is a diary entry written by Zaozao.\u201dHe then read it out, \u201cHelp me, I don\u2019t want to be controlled. I feel broken and split, and I\u2019m in great pain. Why didn\u2019t the treatment make any progress, but made me instead sink into the mire and can\u2019t extricate myself. I have a premonition that I\u2019m about to die. The doctor said that all of this is just my fantasy, he said that my neighbor is an old lady, and that there is no college student at all, and he said that that band also doesn\u2019t exist, why does he want to deceive me, no, these are all fake.\u201d\u201cXiao Wen Gege from next door said he would help me. He will help tutor me, chat with me, and let me feel that there is still hope in the world. The pain I feel right now is just short-lived, and I just need to relax. I have already bought tickets to go see Together\u2019s concert, and I miss Zoe very much. Teacher Yan, right, Teacher Yan will help me. Dr. Tian said that I\u2019ll get better, and I will. It\u2019s very sunny today, isn\u2019t it?\u201dHe finished reading the diary entry on this piece of paper and put it on the table. \u201cAre you guys still not clear on what is going on now? This whole clinic is filled with hints, like Van Gogh\u2019s paintings; as you all know, Van Gogh suffered from schizophrenia in the end, and there\u2019s also that multiverse stuff in Zhou Ziheng\u2019s school bag, and all the grid problems. All the clues are pointing to Zaozao; all of them are implying that no matter who it is, whether it is Zoe, Teacher Yan, or the big Gege from next door, they\u2019re all actually the secondary personalities that Zaozao created for self-protection after being violated. She was an abused child, who has even attempted suicide once.\u201d Xia Xiqing looked at everyone and asked, \u201cDo you really think that she had been set up as the killer by the program team?\u201dShang Sirui\u2019s current expression revealed that he had suddenly seen the light. \u201cThen what about the detective? Is the detective another one of her secondary personalities?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Xia Xiqing said, \u201cI am leaning towards thinking that the detective is real, but Zaozao can\u2019t be the criminal she\u2019s chasing after.\u201d\u201cI agree with the plotline of there being a split personality disorder. When I saw the multiverse thing, I had a vague feeling. However,\u201d Zhai Ying shook her head before pointing out, \u201caccording to this logic, all of you are Zaozao, with the doctor and I being independent people, and if Zaozao isn\u2019t the criminal, then the only option left is the doctor? But the doctor is already dead, and besides, how could a famous doctor like that be a fugitive? That letter also said that the last time they saw the fugitive was when they were in the clinic. It doesn\u2019t make sense no matter how you say it that the doctor is a fugitive. Then if it\u2019s like this, then isn\u2019t no one here a fugitive?\u201dFang Juexia, after listening to these words in silence, inevitably had some admiration for her sprout in his heart. All the flaws that he had found before in Xia Xiqing\u2019s reasoning were accurately pointed out by her.\u201cNo, there is another possibility.\u201d Xia Xiqing continued, \u201cThe main personality is Zaozao, which doesn\u2019t mean that the fugitive is Zaozao, but that it\u2019s very likely that the crime was committed when a secondary personality was dominating her body, so the fugitive is likely to be a secondary personality.\u201d\u201cIf so, the knight is someone who can both protect Zaozao and persecute Zaozao\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia laughed before saying, \u201cThen aren\u2019t me and Ziheng the most suspicious characters? After all, Zoe is an idol, and there should be some distance between them\u00a0ba.\u201dShang Sirui quickly brought up the question, \u201cCan\u2019t the detective be an evil detective? It\u2019s possible for the detective to play such an ambiguous role.\u201dFang Juexia secretly admired the screenwriter in his heart. He could bury two sides into so many different roles.Zhai Ying put forward a point, \u201cI used to like to read European history, and previously, I didn\u2019t know that the painting featured Marat, but after Xiqing Ge pointed it out, I thought of something. Marat was a doctor before the revolution, and he was assassinated by a vengeful girl. So does that mean something?\u201dXia Xiqing seemed to have thought of this point a long time ago and quickly countered, \u201cThis painting is reversed, so can I also say that it was actually the girl who was killed here?\u201dFang Juexia looked them in the eyes, gently scuffed his fingers against the sofa, and then said casually, \u201cWhatever the story is behind this painting, maybe its connection to the plot isn\u2019t that big. What\u2019s important is the letter that was hidden behind it, that\u2019s what I personally think.\u201dZhou Ziheng, who had been silent and listening this the entire time, picked up the piece of paper, looked at it, and then opened his mouth to suggest, \u201cAll our inferences just now were based on Xiqing\u2019s assumption\u2014his assumption that Zaozao really is the victim.\u201dHe leaned back on the sofa and continued to analyze, \u201cI accept that the plot centers on multiple personalities or schizophrenia, because there are too many things that don\u2019t make sense. Me, Zaozao, Zoe, and Teacher Yan all know each other, and all of these characters just happen to be patients of Dr. Tian. The probability of that actually happening is too small. The most likely explanation is that all of us are actually just one person, and that\u2019s the only patient.\u201d\u201cBut there is a problem with this hypothesis.\u201d Zhou Ziheng looked at Xia Xiqing. \u201cWhy is it that Zaozao asking for help definitely clears her of any suspicion of being the killer? A storyline where the one who seems to be the weakest turns out to, in fact, be the big boss at the end\u2014we\u2019ve all heard this kind of story too many times before. Do you guys know what I felt after listening to that diary entry?\u201dHaving said that, he looked at everyone and pointed to the diary. \u201cYou see, clearly, Zaozao had already been told by the doctor that she is schizophrenic, but she still had to go find Zoe, go find Xiao Xi and Teacher Yan. Why? If she wanted to help herself, shouldn\u2019t she accept the result of her diagnosis and be active in getting it treated? Why look for her other personalities? What is her purpose there?\u201d\u201cIf you look at the second sentence of the diary, she feels split and wants to be saved. This shows that she is no longer satisfied with sharing the same body with the other personalities. Only by removing the other personalities can she truly feel saved.\u201dZhou Ziheng raised his eyebrows. \u201cThere may be more than one victim, but there is only one killer.\u201dHe was implying that the girl Zaozao went to find her other personalities in order to eliminate them all.The two men were at loggerheads, diametrically opposed to one another. However, Fang Juexia just stared at the diary that was facing Xia Xiqing; he was sitting on the side of the sofa and could only look at it from the side. Fang Juexia tilted his head, carefully reading out each sentence in his heart. He looked back and reexamined the reversed \u2018The Death of Marat.\u201dReversed\u2026.Shang Sirui was confused. \u201cI think what both of you said is all reasonable. It\u2019s clearly two different sets of logic, but now I feel that both of them work.\u201dZhai Ying suddenly thought of the scratch paper she had given Fang Juexia before. \u201cBy the way, Juexia Ge, have you solved the double integral problem on the paper from just now?\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Fang Juexia also thought of it, so he took out the scratch paper and the paper where he had also calculated out the problem. \u201cI\u2019ve calculated it, and it\u2019s right.\u201dJust as he took it out, he suddenly realized something and looked at a string of numbers on the scratch paper.His heart pounded in his chest.Xia Xiqing glanced at it and roughly checked over the calculations. There are also some sets written on the paper, like {1,2,3,4,2,5,2,2,2,2} {3,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1}\u2026 There were a lot of these, but he didn\u2019t really pay attention to them. \u201cI thought the killer was Xiao Pei before, but now that I think about it, from the beginning to the end, it wasn\u2019t him who directly and constantly kept shoving me into the dark camp, but rather, that was Zhou Ziheng. Then, when I look at all the cards in my hand, naturally, I will suspect you.\u201dZhou Ziheng replied with a smile, \u201cMy reasoning has been consistent and coherent from the beginning to the end, without any problems. What\u2019s more, you don\u2019t have ample reasons to deny that you are a killer.\u201dFang Juexia thought for a moment, and then said, \u201cI\u2019m still inclined towards thinking that Xiqing Ge isn\u2019t the killer. If he is the killer, then killing Xiao Pei in exchange for trust is very risky. And I\u2019ve always been curious about why, whenever the situation is completely uncertain, Ziheng points to Xiqing Ge. This doesn\u2019t seem like how an ordinary player would play this game, because ordinary players are afraid that if their perspective isn\u2019t made clear, they may misunderstand someone\u2019s identity or draw the killer\u2019s attention towards themselves. \u201c\u201cSo now you\u2019re standing on Xiqing\u2019s side?\u201d Zhou Ziheng laughed. \u201cYou don\u2019t speak much while on the field, but almost all of your words are neutral or are secretly protecting him. Can I reasonably suspect that there is some kind of relationship between you two?\u201dXia Xiqing suddenly laughed, raised his eyebrows at Zhou Ziheng, and teased in a frivolous tone, \u201cEven if there was a relationship, what do you want to do about it?\u201dFang Juexia felt that he was being forced into getting drawn into a bloody battlefield again, which made him feel awkward.\u201cI accept all doubts.\u201d Saying that, Fang Juexia looked at Zhou Ziheng directly. \u201cI just think that your diametric opposition came on too suddenly, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m certain you\u2019re the killer. And there\u2019s still another point, I\u2019m not sure how the killer kills people, whether it\u2019s through using the cellphone or not. I\u2019m just wondering, but when Xiao Pei died, you had just taken out your cellphone, right?\u201dZhou Ziheng defended himself, \u201cI just unlocked the screen, and in such a short while, I can\u2019t type out \u2018Pei Tingsong\u2019 and then click send.\u201dZhai Ying asked at this time, \u201cBut what if you had already opened up the killer\u2019s input screen in advance, and had gone ahead and entered Pei Tingsong\u2019s name? In that case, seeing you holding your cellphone becomes a prepared alibi.\u201dAs time passed, the program group\u2019s narration reappeared.\u201cPlayers, the last round of voting for the killer\u2019s identity will start in 30 seconds, and the executed players will be kicked out. The countdown has begun.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll all regret it if you throw me out,\u201d Zhou Ziheng warned.Xia Xiqing shrugged, his fingers stroking his chin for a second, and then got up from the sofa.The remaining five people also scattered, and Fang Juexia walked a few steps towards the two doors of the clinic. The other people also went towards other doors or walls, everyone keeping their backs to each other as they took out their cellphones.Fang Juexia took a deep breath, quickly entered a name, and then, while still pretending to hold the cellphone, stretched his other hand out to the front of his shirt.Even at this moment, he could still feel the aftershock he had experienced when Pei Tingsong had patted his chest, and remembered the rustling sound he had heard in his front pocket vividly.He took out this piece of paper the same way he had taken out the poem Pei Tingsong had given him when they were at the magazine shoot.An English word was written on this piece of paper.[Ukulele]The ukulele.He turned the paper over and saw another line of words on it, the handwriting careless and open.He didn\u2019t know why, but just seeing this line made his heart beat violently.\u201cVoting time is over. The results will be made public soon.\u201dFang Juexia turned back around calmly and stuffed both the piece of paper and cellphone into his pocket as he waited for the moment of sentencing to arrive.\u201cIn this round of voting, the executed player is\u2026\u201d\u201cZhou Ziheng. Please go to the execution area by yourself.\u201dEveryone looked at Zhou Ziheng just to see him as he twisted his eyebrows, after which he shook his head. Without saying a word, he entered the bright red circle.After watching him fall down, Fang Juexia glanced at the final gate.Xia Xiqing seemed to be very satisfied with the result. \u201cNow that the killer is dead, the program group must give us some information on the black knight.\u201dShang Sirui felt a little scared. \u201cLast season, we\u2019d managed to escape before having to execute this many people.\u201dZhai Ying glanced at him and asked, \u201cWhat are you afraid of? It\u2019s not like it\u2019s real.\u201dFang Juexia leaned against the door and used it to support his waist as he opened his mouth, \u201cBy the way, we\u2019ve been talking about the killer this whole time, so much so that I almost forgot.\u201d He pointed to the cabinet by the door and looked at Xia Xiqing as he continued, \u201cDidn\u2019t we see a 36-grid square array on the display screen on that door just now? I just unraveled the drawer mechanism in the cabinet to the side, and there was a plaid handkerchief inside it. Ziheng just put some water on it, and we saw a cipher there.\u201dHe walked over, and the others followed. Xia Xiqing looked down at the square array printed on the handkerchief, and Fang Juexia explained, \u201cThere are also numbers on the handkerchief.\u201d\u201cThis is a\u00a0chessboard cipher.\u201d Xia Xiqing said, \u201cThere was a period of time when I read a lot of books on decryption, and this is the most classical of classical ciphers.\u201d___1__ 2__ 3__ 4__ 51__ q__ w__ e__ r__ t2__ y__ u_ i/j_ o__ p3__ a__ s__ d__ f__ g4__ h__ k__l__z__ x5__ c__ v__ b__ n__ m\u201cYou really found the key clue.\u201d Xia Xiqing pointed to the number on the handkerchief and explained, \u201cThe first line with 15.41.23.14.33, actually denotes a coordinate. The first number is the row, and the second number is the column, corresponding to the chessboard just now. 15 is t, 41 is h, 23 is i or j, 14 is r, and 33 is d.\u201dShang Sirui immediately realized what was going on. \u201cThird! Number three!\u201dXia Xiqing nodded, and then went on to explain further. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t speak up, and everyone\u2019s attention was focused on that cipher.He walked away in silence. Zhai Ying discovered him, and she turned her head and asked him, \u201cWhere are you going, Juexia Ge?\u201dFang Juexia looked back with some doubts on his face. \u201cI think it\u2019s very strange that only I don\u2019t have a medical record. Could it be that I haven\u2019t found it yet? I\u2019d like to go back to the clinic, and maybe there\u2019s still a key clue hiding there.\u201dXia Xiqing also looked back and thought for a moment. \u201cWe really do not have yours.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cAnyway, the most important thing is to unlock the main gate. I\u2019ll look for it first, and you guys can come over later.\u201dShang Sirui said, \u201cThe third line is it? I\u2019ll try.\u201d Xia Xiqing immediately stopped him and said, \u201cFirst let\u2019s finish solving it, if we type in the wrong answer, we\u2019ll have to wait an hour!\u201dFang Juexia silently entered the clinic by himself. Only after checking to see that no one was following did he walk quickly to the bookshelf and take down the ukulele.As he took it down, he noticed that a book had also been pulled out and placed next to the ukulele; it was a book on astronomy. There was a magnifying glass on the book. He had noticed this astronomy book before, but had this magnifying glass also been in the psychiatrist\u2019s room from the start?If it was really like this, the ideas in his head would only grow firmer.Fang Juexia turned the ukulele over and shook it; there was something inside. He reached into it carefully with his fingers, for fear of making a noise.Sweat had even gathered on his forehead.Finally, Fang Juexia took out the thing that was inside it, which was a stack of thickly folded paper. He eased the ukulele down and unfolded the paper as he walked into Zaozao\u2019s room.The first piece of paper was his medical record, which clearly showed his illness\u2014manic depression.Seeing these words, Fang Juexia\u2019s breath nearly stagnated.Manic depression, also known as bipolar disorder.Flipping to the second piece of paper, he found that it was a music score for a guitar; however, this score was scribbled on an old newspaper. When he flipped it over, he saw an item in the newspaper that was circled with a pen.[At 5:52 this morning, a young man surnamed Tan, wearing a white coat and holding a knife, killed a middle-aged man on Yanghua road. The motive for the murder has not been discovered yet, and the police have stepped in to investigate the whereabouts of the fugitive. At present, according to people familiar with the matter, Mr. Tan was not a doctor. When he was 13 years old, he was sexually assaulted by his neighbor, and it caused quite a sensation at that time. Since then, he has suffered from delusions and multiple personality disorder, and has been receiving treatment in a private clinic in the city\u2026]5:52Wasn\u2019t this the first number puzzle he had solved?In the news article, the character \u2018Tan\u2019 had also been marked, and beside it were a few scribbled words\u2014[Yan, Xi, Zao, north, Tian, together]Fang Juexia suddenly thought of the number set on the previous piece of scratch paper, and abruptly woke up.He hurried and flipped to the last piece of paper, which seemed to have been rolled up, with obvious signs of it curling. A few words were written on this piece of paper.[A counterattack doesn\u2019t really let you stand up againLife is worth admitting your own smallnessThe sand obeys the sea, just like the subordinates obey a lordOnly by knowing yourself can you obtain true restIf you give up early\u00a0ba, you will always be secondary]\u201cJuexia, have you found it? Your medical record.\u201dAs soon as Fang Juexia heard Shang Sirui\u2019s voice, he put the other papers away, held the medical record in his hand, and crouched at the side of the sofa. \u201cSeem to have found it\u2026\u201dShang Sirui came into the room just in time to see Fang Juexia\u2019s red face as he pulled out a piece of paper from the bottom of the sofa. Fang Juexia stood up and patted the dust off the paper. \u201cIt should be this one, no mistake.\u201d\u201cWhat does Teacher Yan have?\u201dFang Juexia directly handed the medical record over to him.\u201cWhat is manic depression\u2026\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t pay any more attention to him and went out by himself. \u201cHave you guys found the answer?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Zhai Ying turned her head and explained, \u201cIt\u2019s the third row and the first column, which solved the square array, but then another problem popped up on the screen. Xiqing Ge just entered the answer, but it wasn\u2019t right. But the good thing here is that if you enter in this answer wrong, you don\u2019t have to wait for another hour before trying again.\u201dXia Xiqing had now sat back on the sofa, and was frowning and lowering his head as if deep in thought.\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d Fang Juexia walked over and clicked on the screen on the door.While thinking, Xia Xiqing subconsciously noticed that piece of scratch paper. Just now, when Fang Juexia had taken it out, he had just taken a cursory glance and had matched up the problem-solving process and the answers instead of paying attention to the random handwritten sets on the paper.{1\uff0c2\uff0c3\uff0c4\uff0c2\uff0c5\uff0c2\uff0c2\uff0c2\uff0c2} {3\uff0c2\uff0c1\uff0c1\uff0c1\uff0c1\uff0c0\uff0c1\uff0c1}Generally speaking, a set could not have duplicate elements, and must be unique.He counted.Fang Juexia stared at the question on the screen and heard Zhai Ying say, \u201cThat\u2019s just the problem. Xiqing typed in Xiao Xi and Zaozao just down, but it wasn\u2019t right.\u201dTwo lines in English were displayed on the screen\u2014[Who is the main one\uff1fWho are you\uff1f]\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201dXia Xiqing, who had counted out the repeated elements in each set, suddenly realized and murmured, \u201cIt\u2019s 6\u2026\u201dYes, six. Six players with five rooms, with only one room connected to two doors, six square hoods, and the square array on the display screen on the door was also a 6\u00d76 grid.All the details came together at once: Shang Sirui\u2019s guitar in the waiting room, the ukulele in the consultation room, Zhou Ziheng\u2019s physics textbook in the waiting room, the astronomy book in the consultation room, the art tools in his room, and the paintings in the consultation room.Only two people had started in the clinic, corresponding to one black and one white door, and then the double integral on the scratch paper.Xia Xiqing lowered his head, and the reversed painting appeared in his mind. He suddenly remembered something, and then immediately picked up that diary entry again.No, it wasn\u2019t.The painting was reversed.The characters were also reversed.So, the diary entry should also be reversed. Diary entries always started with a statement about the weather\u2026.[It\u2019s very sunny today, isn\u2019t it?Dr. Tian said that I\u2019ll get better, and I will.Teacher Yan, right, Teacher Yan will help me. I have already bought tickets to see Together\u2019s concert, and I miss Zoe very much. My pain right now is just short-lived, and I just need to relax. Xiao Wen Gege from next door said he would help me; he will help tutor me, chat with me, and let me feel that the world still has hope.The doctor said that all of this is just my fantasy, he said that my neighbor is an old lady, and that there is no college student at all, and he said that that band also doesn\u2019t exist, why does he want to deceive me, no, these are all fake.I have a premonition that I\u2019m about to die.Why didn\u2019t the treatment make any progress, but made me instead sink into the mire and can\u2019t extricate myself.I feel broken and split, and I\u2019m in great pain.Help me, I don\u2019t want to be controlled.]Wrong, all wrong.He had just been feeling suspicious about why it had been \u2018the main one\u2019 instead of the \u2018killer\u2019 being asked in the display panel.Because the main one was the killer.After having inputted his answers, Fang Juexia looked at the questions and answers on the screen.Who is the main one\uff1f [Dr. Tian]Who are you\uff1f [Tan\u00a0Ji]\u201cEveryone, please note that the first player of this season has successfully escaped with his life.\u201dWith a bang, the gate opened.The first person Fang Juexia saw was Pei Tingsong, who had been standing outside the gate and waiting for a long time. His smile was filled with victory and wild ambition, and underneath the colorful paper streamers and gold sparkles being sprayed by the staff, he opened both his arms and pulled Fang Juexia, who was keyed up to the fullest extent right now, into his arms.\u201cYou worked hard.\u201dThe narration announced the final result, \u201cThe winning camp is\u2026\u201dClosing his eyes, that note hidden inside the ukulele appeared before Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes. On the back of the note were written the last words Pei Tingsong had to say to Fang Juexia after he had quickly peeled off his golden cicada skin to escape a tricky situation.[You need to let me win\u00a0ah, Gege.]\u201cThe dark camp! Congratulations to Black Knight Fang Juexia, and Killer Pei Tingsong!\u201dFang Juexia raised his head and did away with his empty-looking disguise. \u201cOther half.\u201d The eyebrows on that naturally cold face were raised right now, and even the red birthmark at the corner of his eye grew fresh and alive as he uttered\u2014\u201cWe won.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 43Chapter 43 \u2013 Dinner Party RecapTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksYou really were his knight.After the program recording ended, the production team specially arranged to also film the dinner meeting, in order to create a highlight reel from that footage. After filming for several continuous hours, everyone was hungry, and had been since a long time ago. Originally, the players had planned to have dinner together at a private restaurant after work, but it just so happened that the program group had already arranged it for everyone, so they all partook in a happy meal together.\u201cLet\u2019s eat hot pot!\u201d As soon as Shang Sirui sat down, he started vibrating happily and asked, \u201cHow miserable is the camera Da Ge\u00a0ah, have you guys eaten yet? Oh, you\u2019ve eaten\u00a0ah, then I won\u2019t feel sorry for you anymore.\u201dXia Xiqing sat down to his right. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to feel sorry for someone, feel sorry for yourself\u00a0ba, silly Sansan.\u201dZhou Ziheng sat down next to Xia Xiqing, and seeming very much like a dog running to its master, kneaded his shoulders for a long time. Pei Tingsong sat down on Shang Sirui\u2019s left side, and Fang Juexia also sat down beside him. Zhai Ying, who came in last, went to Zhou Ziheng\u2019s side and sat. Once everyone was seated, they started ordering dishes.\u201cXiao Pei grew up abroad, so can you not really eat spicy food?\u201d Xia Xiqing asked.Pei Tingsong was pouring water. \u201cI\u2019m alright, I can eat it.\u201d After saying that, he suddenly thought of something, and continued, \u201cBut Fang Juexia really can\u2019t, so if it\u2019s possible, order half spicy red oil and half tomato soup\u00a0ba.\u201dFang Juexia had originally been setting the tableware in front of him, but upon being cued suddenly, he raised his head and looked at Pei Tingsong.Pei Tingsong felt that he was being particularly funny, and as he held back the corner of his mouth from curving into a smile, he teased, \u201cDo you want to eat spicy? Pretty boy.\u201dFang Juexia immediately shook his head and told everyone, \u201cI can\u2019t eat any peppers at all. I used to think that I could eat spicy food, but then Ling Yi took me to eat Sichuan food, and it was only then that I discovered that Guangdong spicy food and Sichuan spicy food are not at the same level at all.\u201dThe rest of the people started laughing unceremoniously.\u201cAlright, then half tomato and half spicy red oil.\u201d\u201cOrder some alcohol\u00a0bei. Everyone was so nervous up until now, so let\u2019s all have a drink to relax.\u201dPei Tingsong immediately interrupted, \u201cFang Juexia can\u2019t drink alcohol.\u201dXia Xiqing laughed. \u201cHow do you know everything?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I can drink it.\u201d Fang Juexia looked over and said, \u201cXiqing Ge, order it\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cWhether or not you can drink, don\u2019t you still know yourself\u00a0ah?\u201d Pei Tingsong sighed, \u201cAnyway, in a bit, you\u2019re not allowed to drink, otherwise you can\u2019t even head back.\u201d\u201cThen order some juice for Juexia.\u201dThe six people gabbled away as they finished ordering dishes and while waiting for the dishes to be served, chatted with each other. Xia Xiqing knocked on the edge of the table with his chopsticks. \u201cReally, the crew for \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019 is the most intelligent and meticulous crew I\u2019ve ever seen, it\u2019s too hard for me!\u201dZhou Ziheng nodded heavily twice.Zhai Ying, in a rare occurrence, followed that up with, \u201cI had known that it would be very difficult when I got on this program. I felt that I had psychologically prepared myself enough for it, but I still didn\u2019t imagine it to be so difficult.\u201d\u201cIt was mainly the plot.\u201d Pei Tingsong said, \u201cWhen I was uncovering the plot while collecting clues, I constantly kept sighing internally.\u201dFang Juexia also agreed. He had deviated from the right track several times, nearly turning the entire plot into another story. Fortunately, he was pulled back by the clues they kept finding.\u201cSpeaking of the plot,\u201d Shang Sirui sighed heavily and continued, \u201cChenchen, Chen Ge, Writer Xu, let us go\u00a0ba. If it goes on like this, my brain will end up only being used to make hot pot.\u201dEveryone started laughing.\u201cI will vent my anger while he is away.\u201d Shang Sirui raised his drink. \u201cI really want to lock our cute Writer Xu in an escape room. Oh, no, even his family member who provided him with all kinds of puzzles has to be locked up. The two of them can be\u00a0 locked up separately in two different escape rooms, and then I will watch them on the monitor. I\u2019ll watch\u2026\u201d\u201cHello, here are the\u00a0fried tofu skin sticks\u00a0you ordered.\u201d A waiter came up and set the plate right in front of Shang Sirui.\u201cThank you, thank you.\u201d Shang Sirui didn\u2019t even raise his head before continuing to speak, \u201cWhat did I just say, oh right, lock them up\u2026\u201dWho knew that instead of leaving, the waiter would actually ask, \u201cWho are you going to lock up?\u201d\u201cOur screenwriter,\u201d Shang Sirui blurted this out, and then realized that something wasn\u2019t right. As soon as he looked up, he saw the waiter take off his hat and smile at him.\u201cChenchen?\u201dZhou Ziheng laughed. \u201cAs soon as he pushed open the door, I realized who it was. You were the only one naively talking to yourself over there.\u201d\u201cEh, just you by yourself?\u201d Xia Xiqing looked at the door and inquired, \u201cWhere\u2019s my crooked and underhanded nephew?\u201dXu Qichen replied, \u201cAh, he is working overtime. A new version of the game will be launched tomorrow, and he thinks it might take all night to finish.\u201dThis was the first time Fang Juexia had met Writer Xu in-person, and he looked more elegant and smaller than when he had seen him on TV before. He gave off a bookish air and looked like a college student who had not yet left the ivory tower.Just as he was thinking that, a pair of chopsticks, waving about in the air, suddenly appeared in front of him. Fang Juexia turned his head and saw Pei Tingsong, who was a real college student. Pei Tingsong pulled back his chopsticks and asked, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dFang Juexia shook his head.\u201cLet\u2019s welcome Xu Qichen, the screenwriter for Escape 2, to the highlights dinner party,\u201d the director standing behind them all said. \u201cEveryone can eat while recapping things, we\u2019ll edit this footage for a special program and put it on the VIP channel.\u201d\u201cThe director is so good.\u201d Xu Qichen said hello to everyone, took off the waiter\u2019s jacket, and sat next to Zhai Ying. \u201cLet me tell you something, I was the narrator for this season.\u201d After saying that, he smiled. \u201cThe voice changer is too fun.\u201dShang Sirui\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAh! Like I said, at the start, the narration had a really jokey tone, and its style was completely different from the previous season\u2019s narration!\u201d\u201cSo it was like this\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia belatedly realized. \u201cI even kept thinking, we had previously agreed to the show being revised, so how could the rules be the same as the last season? Later, after that joke, I didn\u2019t feel so nervous.\u201dPei Tingsong had just tossed in a piece of tripe into the hot pot, and before he got the time to swirl it around, he had caught sight of how Fang Juexia kept staring at Writer Xu. Unconsciously, he started staring at Fang Juexia.\u201cXiao Pei, your tripe is getting cooked too tough.\u201d Shang Sirui helped him by taking out the tripe and putting it into his own mouth.Xu Qichen said with a smile, \u201cI asked Yin Jie to let me participate in the filming of the program. I wanted to watch it\u00a0ma.\u201d\u201cLet me first make it clear to the audience that the amount of information that each player started out with in this episode was the same. In other words, everyone only knew whether they were ordinary players, the knight, or the killer. No one had the script or any kind of summary regarding the plot. They had to restore the entire plot gradually through the process of solving the puzzles.\u201d\u201cNext, I\u2019d like to generally talk about the plot line of this episode. In fact, the core clue was the only one that reflected reality, which was that article in the old newspaper. There was only one protagonist of the whole storyline, named Tan Ji. When he was a child, he was sexually assaulted by his neighbor, which caused him great trauma and made him suffer from delusions. At the same time, he also developed a multiple-personality disorder. He imagined himself to be the best psychologist in the city, Dr. Tian, rather than the patient who was being treated, Tan Ji. At the same time, he split his most painful childhood memories to create the character Zaozao.\u201d\u201cIn the same way, all the players were secondary personalities of his. But this particular personality, Zaozao, suffered too much, and was always on the verge of collapsing. She was completely oppressed and controlled by the master personality, that is, the doctor, so she gradually turned to the other personalities for help. There was a telephone recording that recorded her entire plea for help, which was in the recording pen that Juexia found. However, the master personality figured out that she was resisting, so he hypnotized Zaozao into choosing to commit suicide. The hypnosis script was actually an acrostic, suggesting that the doctor had killed Zao. But before Zaozao could finish writing her suicide note, she was already killed by the doctor personality.\u201d\u201cSo it turns out that this is the real story,\u201d Shang Sirui sighed. \u201cReally, by just missing a link, the plot becomes completely different. But why was it Tan Ji?\u201dXiao Pei said, \u201cActually, when the appointment form was first found, and I saw the names Teacher Yan, Zaozao, and Xiao Xi, I thought of putting the words together. The character Tan is obviously a surname, and since there is a surname, there definitely has to be a given name. I then checked every room with the purpose of finding this name, which was basically like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.\u201d\u201cObviously, Zoe and the detective don\u2019t have Chinese names, so the puzzle pieces must not refer to their names, but instead to something related to them. Zoe\u2019s band is called \u201cTogether\u201d, and the book inside the safe in the detective\u2019s room only had one word on its cover, North, so that\u2019s \u2018\u5317\u2019. Take that north, add on the Tian from Dr. Tian, then add in the character for \u2018together\u2019, and you get Ji.\u201d\u201cThis sensitivity of yours, towards words, is really powerful.\u201d Xia Xiqing wasn\u2019t stingy with his praise.\u201cJust as Xiqing is naturally sensitive to paintings, so is Xiao Pei to writing,\u201d Xu Qichen reminded them, \u201cDidn\u2019t you guys notice that all the clues Xiao Pei collected came from word games.\u201dFang Juexia had noticed that; Pei Tingsong had found almost all the word puzzles in this episode, whether it was the hypnotic acrostic at the beginning, or the later puzzle involving the given name, or the most important news article puzzle.Even his seemingly gag-like nonsense during the program, was a word game he used to hint and pun at things.Shang Sirui suddenly slapped the table. \u201cI just remembered, when I was chatting with Xiao Pei in that dark room, he kept reading that book the whole time. Later, he placed the book upside down on the table, making sure the cover was especially on display. You did that on purpose\u00a0ba.\u201dPei Tingsong nodded. \u201cYes, I wanted to show it to Juexia Ge, but later, I thought that since I had almost collected all of the puzzle pieces, it would be better to give him the answer directly, after collecting them all.\u201dAfter saying that, Pei Tingsong saw Fang Juexia accidentally eat some spicy beef, and being anxious to drink some water, he grabbed onto his wine cup. Pei Tingsong hurriedly grasped Fang Juexia\u2019s hand and whispered, \u201cThis is my cup.\u201d\u201cI saw wrong.\u201d Fang Juexia pulled his hand away and poured himself a cup of Sprite.Xu Qichen continued, \u201cThere are still many details in the middle, so let\u2019s chat about it all slowly. Everyone\u2019s performance today was so wonderful; actually, the script is just a skeleton, and what really enriches the entire program is each guest\u2019s individual performance. Different players will play with different styles.\u201dXia Xiqing had ordered some alcohol and poured it for himself as he spoke, \u201cReally, this episode was one of the best ones I\u2019ve ever played. Although I didn\u2019t win in the end, winning or losing is really not important at this level.\u201d\u201cHahahaha, is it that you didn\u2019t expect that one day, that act of fancily revealing your role would throw you into a pit?!\u201d Shang Sirui swished a large piece of tripe through the hot pot as he said, \u201cBut seriously, low-end players just see the results, while high-end players look at the process. This time, even me, a low-end player, felt pretty cool.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give myself this penalty cup for my empiricism.\u201d Zhou Ziheng also specially touched Xia Xiqing\u2019s cup to his own before drinking, and then drank all the cup\u2019s contents in one gulp. \u201cBut I\u2019m very curious, Xiao Pei, when did you find out that Juexia was the knight?\u201dPei Tingsong recalled, \u201cIt\u2019s a long story, but when we started off together in the clinic at that time, weren\u2019t we all wearing hoods? As soon as I reached out and touched some metal blocks, I actually found a piece of paper under one of them. I subconsciously felt that there was some problem with that, so I secretly pulled out that piece of paper and hid it on my body. Only then did I go and solve the puzzle of the metal blocks to break open Juexia Ge\u2019s hood.\u201dFang Juexia, who had originally been eating vermicelli, heard these words, and his eyes grew bright. He slurped up the vermicelli into his mouth and murmured, \u201cSo it was at that time that you got my medical record!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re pretty good at guessing,\u201d Pei Tingsong said with a smile. \u201cAfter the hood was undone, I immediately looked at that piece of paper. It was indeed the teacher\u2019s medical record, and manic depressive disorder, also known as bipolar disorder, was written there. I realized at that moment that Fang Juexia should be the double-faced knight arranged by the program group for this game. I knew that he might choose to be the black knight, so I hid his medical records at that time, because if it were to be seen by Xiqing Ge, Juexia\u2019s knighthood wouldn\u2019t be able to stay concealed any longer.\u201dXia Xiqing clicked his tongue and said, \u201cExpended much thought\u00a0ah, Xiao Pei.\u201dUnexpectedly, Shang Sirui suddenly exclaimed, \u201cSo manic depression is bipolar disorder\u00a0ah!\u201dFang Juexia took a bite of the frozen tofu in the tomato hot pot, and it was so hot it burned his tongue. \u201cI guessed that Senior Brother didn\u2019t know this, so I finally directly handed Teacher Yan\u2019s medical records to him.\u201d\u201cAh! Juexia, you!\u201d\u201cEven if you knew, it\u2019d be too late.\u201d Xia Xiqing interposed into their conversation and asked Fang Juexia, \u201cIn fact, at that time, you had already sorted through all the evidence and had understood the whole plot, hadn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Fang Juexia looked at Pei Tingsong as he said, \u201cXiao Pei found the core clue, but he hid it.\u201dZhou Ziheng was a little puzzled. \u201cI was there when he went\u00a0ah. How could I\u2026\u201d Halfway through saying those words, he suddenly remembered, exclaiming, \u201cI know, when you played the guitar!\u201dXu Qichen started laughing first. \u201cI was laughing to death back when I was watching it happen on the monitor. In fact, Ziheng put forth several key questions.\u201dZhou Ziheng found it inexplicable. \u201cReally?\u201d But as soon as this question came out, he thought about it again and slapped himself on the forehead with great chagrin. \u201cAh, I\u2019m so stupid. I even asked you what that guitar was.\u201dPei Tingsong laughed and carried a slightly childlike air as he explained, \u201cYes\u00a0ah, when you asked me, I specifically told you that it was a hollow-body guitar. If you had reached in, you could have felt the newspaper pasted to its inner walls.\u201d\u201cThe article was about the real protagonist Tan, and said that he was suffering from delusions and had multiple-personality disorder. He had been wearing a white coat when he had committed the murder, so it was very obvious that he had deluded himself into thinking that he was a psychologist, that his surname was Tian, and that he was the best psychologist in the city. The other players formed all of his secondary personalities.\u201d\u201cWas the detective also his secondary personality?\u201d Shang Sirui was a little confused.\u201cYes.\u201d Zhou Ziheng said, \u201cI sorted it out later, after I was sent backstage. The detective personality was likely a newly split personality. In fact, that letter Zaozao sent her implied that she was already on the verge of collapse, and there was no way to rescue her. Her desperation to be saved made the new personality of a detective appear. That letter that spoke about searching for a fugitive actually reflected Tan Ji\u2019s reality. He himself was the fugitive who had killed people. Is that right, Qichen?\u201dXu Qichen gave him a thumbs up. \u201cVery good. In fact, among the various multiple personalities, there are those who know each other, but also some who do not. In this plot, Tan Ji fantasizes that he is Dr. Tian. Thus, as the master personality, his means to control other personalities was through psychological counseling, therefore, all of the other personalities were his patients, and they received treatment from him, even hypnotic treatment. But the detective personality was a new birth, who could be regarded to be the Zaozao personality\u2019s protector, a scenario which also reflected reality to the greatest extent.\u201d\u201cNow, considering the news article, in almost each and every personality, a trace of reality can be found. The lead singer of the band may represent some of Tan Ji\u2019s childhood dreams, because Zaozao represented his childhood, and she liked Zoe very much\u2026\u201d Zhai Ying was a little surprised. \u201cToo strong, there was even something hidden in the guitar\u2026 No wonder the program group specifically found a hollow body guitar, they\u2019re too meticulous.\u201dXu Qichen asked, \u201cDid Xiao Pei find the newspaper when he was playing the guitar? When I was watching the monitor, I heard you specifically say that the sound wasn\u2019t bad.\u201dPei Tingsong nodded. \u201cAs soon as I played it, I discovered that the guitar\u2019s sound wasn\u2019t right. After all, after having played the guitar for so many years, I do understand it. I guessed then that there was something inside, and when Ziheng Ge went past me, I reached in and took out the clue. \u201cShang Sirui sighed. \u201cNot knowing how to play an instrument then is really\u2026 Who would stick their hand into a guitar? The props group is too strong.\u201dFang Juexia couldn\u2019t help opening his mouth to say, \u201cThere were also many other unreasonable details present, and it seems that the program group included them all intentionally. The appointment time for Teacher Yan to visit the doctor is 5:52, but how can anyone go see a doctor this early in the morning? This implies that all of these things are fake\u2014that the doctor is fake, and that the patients are also fake. There was also a small hint given by the stylist group, I don\u2019t know if anyone noticed it. Although we all played different roles, we are all wearing the same shirt.\u201dShang Sirui looked down at his\u00a0flowered shirt, then looked up at the others and admired, \u201cAmazing. So in fact, we are all the same person.\u201d\u201cThe program group is really strong.\u201d Xia Xiqing recapped the hints they had gathered through the props, \u201cIf you think about it, every room, except the doctor\u2019s clinic, actually represents something. For example, the guitar in Shang Sirui\u2019s room corresponds to the ukulele in the consultation room, the textbook in Ziheng\u2019s school bag corresponds to the astronomy books in the consultation room\u2019s bookshelf, the art tools and paintings in Zaozao\u2019s room corresponds with the paintings in the consultation room.\u201d\u201cAnd there\u2019s also the magnifying glass, representing the detective,\u201d Pei Tingsong added.\u201cYes,\u201d Xia Xiqing nodded. \u201cIn fact, all this hints that these rooms are just a representation of one of the protagonist\u2019s personalities, and only the consultation room is representative of the master personality, which contains items from all the personalities. It was just that I didn\u2019t notice in the beginning, because I held the preconception that Zaozao was the master personality.\u201d\u201cIncluding this was \u2018The Death of Marat\u2019, which, in fact, was also a core clue. Chenchen had even opened up a back door for me, but I was eager to prove my point of view at that time, and thus ignored the secondary deep meaning hidden in the painting, which was\u2014 reversal. The painting was reversed, and so the characters who were assassinated within the painting should also be reversed. Similarly, the diary in the painting also has to be read in a reversed order.\u201dXu Qichen said, \u201cYou finally realized that something wasn\u2019t right, and I was surprised by the extent to which you reacted to that piece. In just half a minute, you overturned all your views for the plot that you had set up before and pulled back to the correct plotline. You\u2019re very strong.\u201dHe set aside his chopsticks. \u201cThis time, I can also count as having incorporated Xiqing\u2019s usual play style. I knew that even if Xiqing had a normal role, he would definitely reveal himself as the knight, so I purposefully designated the identity of an ordinary player to him and let him muddle the waters. If Xiqing was the real knight, its effect on the program might not have been so good.\u201dAfter that, he looked at Pei Tingsong and said, \u201cReality proves that that was true. If it had really been Xiqing who was the knight, while Xiao Pei was the killer, then\u2014one person just reveals himself explosively, while the other just stabs himself\u2026\u201dEveryone laughed at this, but Pei Tingsong leaned back on his chair and said with a smile, \u201cNo, I only chose to commit suicide after I confirmed that the black knight\u2019s role must be Fang Juexia\u2019s.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s chopsticks paused.What did this sentence imply?The other people had begun to coax him, led by Xia Xiqing. \u201cAiya, so you made all your preparations and handed over all the relics, and only then went unflinchingly to your death?\u201dWhat relics?\u201cThen how did you know that Juexia was definitely a black knight? Even if you had his medical record, he could have been a white knight?\u201d Shang Sirui asked.Pei Tingsong said with a laugh, \u201cThat was impossible. Xiqing Ge jumped out to state that he was a knight and pretended to take on Juexia\u2019s identity. My jumping out at him at the same time contained two purposes: on one hand, it was to make Senior suspect Xiqing Ge, thereby not allowing him to rest easy in the position of the knight. On the other hand, I was also trying to bluff out Juexia Ge\u2019s camp.\u201cIf you guys think about it, with two fake knights jumping out at each other and also fighting each other before the vote, if the real knight belonged to the light side, it would be absolutely impossible for him to let others claim his knighthood so easily. For the victory of the good camp, he would have to stand up and reveal himself.\u201d His expression was completely confident as he stated, \u201cEspecially if that knight was Fang Juexia.\u201d\u201cYes\u00a0oh, or the white knight would have to carry the\u00a0blame\u00a0for this round.\u201dFang Juexia lowered his head a little and listened to Pei Tingsong\u2019s words, but what he thought about was the scene from not long ago, where the other party had stuffed the note into the front of his shirt.\u201cI\u2019m very curious, Juexia.\u201d Xu Qichen asked, \u201cI didn\u2019t see when you finished the handover in the monitors. How did you know he had hidden a clue in the ukulele?\u201dFang Juexia raised his head. \u201cWhen Pei Tingsong was teasing me by the display wall and kept play-fighting with me, I didn\u2019t take it seriously, since he usually likes to play tricks on me and play-fight like this with me. However, he then left abruptly, but before that, he patted my pocket. At that time, I heard a sound from the pocket at the front of my coat, and it was the sound of paper. So I figured out what was going on, but I kept pretending that I didn\u2019t know and searched for a more appropriate time to look at it.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is\u2026\u201d Xu Qichen nodded. \u201cYou know, Juexia was actually a bit beyond my imagination. At the beginning, I just thought that he was a person suited to playing as the false prophet and hiding his true identity, so I gave him the role. But in fact, his strongest points were not just math and his skill to remain calm at all times, but also his ability to find opportunities.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgXia Xiqing also grasped this point. \u201cYes, yes, I just wanted to say that this Little Serious is too good at distracting people. When I think back, I understand that I really underestimated my opponent. In the beginning, he deliberately accommodated me, and in the end, didn\u2019t Ziheng get ousted through voting? At that time, I thought I had nearly won, and then, Juexia deliberately directed my attention towards the code on the handkerchief in the cabinet and asked me to solve it.\u201dJuexia was a bit embarrassed and nodded. \u201cAt that stage, I really needed time to go find the ukulele, but Xiqing Ge is too smart, and if I directly left the hall, he would definitely find a flaw. So I could only use the chessboard code on the door\u2019s display lock to divert his attention.\u201d\u201cAnd the reason you provided was also very strong.\u201d Xu Qichen said with a smile, \u201cYou said you were going to find your medical record. In fact, if you hadn\u2019t said it, it would have only made Xiqing suspicious.\u201dXia Xiqing nodded. \u201cYes, because you were the only patient without a medical record until then. This was a problem I had been struggling with the entire time. Although you spoke in a sunny way and had made no small moves, that missing medical record kind of remained stuck in my heart the whole time.\u201cAs long as you were a character belonging to the dark camp, you would naturally want to hide your medical records. Yet, in the end, you just stood up and said it, and even added that you were going to go find it yourself. My suspicions on this matter disappeared just like that, so I then concentrated on solving the chessboard code.\u201dZhai Ying shook her head. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because Juexia Ge looks too kind-hearted, and really doesn\u2019t make people feel suspicious about him. When I got that scratch paper, my first reaction was to go find Juexia Ge.\u201d She looked at Fang Juexia and asked, \u201cIn fact, at that time, you had already discovered the problem, hadn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Fang Juexia said with a smile and shaking his head. \u201cI was also controlled by my habitual thinking at that time, so I just solved the double integral straightforwardly. In fact, in addition to being a mathematical problem, that set also implied something else.\u201dXia Xiqing nodded heavily and regretted his mistakes. \u201cAh, I was so completely focused on battling it out with Zhou Ziheng at that time. When everyone gathered up the clues, I also just checked the answer for the double integral problem and didn\u2019t notice the set beside it. Then, I went back to the sofa after I had typed the final answer wrong and saw that scratch paper. It was only then that I finally discovered the root of the problem, using this set.\u201dZhai Ying curiously asked, \u201cWhat was wrong with the set?\u201dFang Juexia explained, \u201cSet theory states that there can be no repeating elements in a set. But each set on that piece of paper had a repeating element in it. In the extension of set theory, there is a concept called multisets, in which the number of repetitions of an element in a multiset is called multiplicity or repetition, and for all the multisets on the scratch paper, the multiplicity was 6.\u201dShang Sirui was surprised. \u201cGod, even the set of numbers on a piece of scratch paper implied that there were six personalities.\u201d\u201cXiqing was really only a little bit late.\u201d Xu Qichen spoke with a smile, \u201cBecause Xiqing is a person who can defend his own views very well, and can also find various clues to act as proof for his views, so he does end up falling into the strange circles of the plot.\u201dXia Xiqing recognized this. \u201cSo that\u2019s why I say I didn\u2019t lose out anything by losing this time; everyone played really well this round. When I finally sat on the sofa, and my mind filled with all the details I couldn\u2019t reconcile together before, that was a really cool feeling, and I\u2019ll remember it for the rest of my life.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say anymore.\u201d Zhou Ziheng was laughing so hard he was nearly dying of breathlessness. \u201cYou guys don\u2019t know, but I died, right? After I died, I ran to look at the monitor and met Xiao Pei there. I complained to him at that time, saying that it was over, it was over, Xiqing\u2019s moves were successful again. He played the killer\u2019s role like this, and even then, there were still people voting with him.\u201dPei Tingsong leaned back with a smile, and Fang Juexia felt a little worried while watching him. He was afraid that this person would fall back, and his hands subconsciously wanted to protect the back of his chair.\u201cCan you guys imagine how hilarious that was?\u201d Zhou Ziheng was still laughing to death. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m so angry, Xiqing even plays the killer in a manner as dirty as this, I was just about to carry this round\u2019. Then Xiao Pei patted me on the shoulder,\u201d He imitated Xiao Pei\u2019s movements as he narrated what had happened, \u201c\u2018Senior, I\u2019m actually the killer.\u2019 You know, I almost dropped dead right there.\u201d\u201cHahahahahaha!\u201dNow Zhou Ziheng was sighing as he continued, \u201cI play Werewolf\u00a0ah, and this strategy of killing yourself is pretty common in that game. But Escape isn\u2019t the same as Werewolf, because once a werewolf dies, there are still other werewolves left behind to kill people. However, here, once the killer is dead, he\u2019s dead, and his only chance to kill someone was used up on himself. That\u2019s really something few people would dare to do. What\u2019s more, he\u2019s even a newcomer. He\u2019s too tiger-like.\u201dPei Tingsong had laughed enough and let out a long breath. \u201cI also count as being a loyal audience member of the previous season, and I\u2019m also very clear on the playing methods of both Senior and Xiqing Ge. As soon as I saw that I had gotten the killer card, and that the program group wouldn\u2019t be providing extra clues this time, I knew that would have to plan ahead of time.\u201d\u201cWhen I bluffed out the fact that Juexia was a black knight, it became very clear that the only way I could win was to make Senior and Xiqing Ge oppose each other.\u201dThen he looked at Zhou Ziheng. \u201cSo I had to jump out as the knight, and also had to commit suicide, all so that Senior would grow more suspicious of Xiqing Ge. Only when they were standing on diametrically opposite sides, could Juexia get some room to survive.\u201dXia Xiqing couldn\u2019t help clapping for him. \u201cTrue love. I now count as understanding what it means to say, \u2018As long as our alliance has not been dissolved, I am your knight.\u2019 Program group, director, remember this sentence, and you have to cut it into the trailer, okay? This is the biggest spoiler.\u201dIt was only at his reminder that Fang Juexia belatedly came to realize the meaning of this sentence. For a period of time following this, he was a little distracted. It turned out that every sentence he thought of as either being for fanservice or being a joke was actually a hint from Pei Tingsong.\u201cI also want to say that Xiao Pei kept muddying the waters with me the entire way,\u201d said Shang Sirui as he grabbed some fat beef with his chopsticks and put it in his own oil dish. \u201cMoreover, he was the first one to die, so he is definitely going to get laughed at by the fans. You guys don\u2019t know, but Xiao Pei is famous for being a game black hole from way before.\u201dThe director couldn\u2019t help interrupting, \u201cOther people were muddying the water for clues, but you were just muddying the waters for real.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be like that\u00a0ah, director. I may just be paddling along, but I\u2019m very high-leveled at paddling along, okay?\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d Zhai Ying analyzed, \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t put Ziheng Ge and Xiqing Ge in opposition with each other, it would have become very difficult to win this game. These two immortals represent two completely different ways of playing; it\u2019s hard to trust each other, but it\u2019s easy to kill each other.\u201d\u201cOnce the two logic big bosses were at loggerheads, the rest of us could only passively choose to follow the reasoning laid out by one of them. We never even imagined that there was a third set of logic hidden underneath all of it. At that time, I really thought I had already locked the role of the killer onto one of these two people.\u201dXu Qichen said with a smile, \u201cJuexia is actually really kind-hearted. When he saw Ziheng and Xiqing tearing into each other, he also reminded all of you that the reasoning you guys had put forth was all quite right, but that you also shouldn\u2019t forget that the identity of the killer was linked with the plot, and wanted you guys to stop fighting to uncover the whole plot first.\u201dAfter that, he couldn\u2019t help praising, \u201cZiheng\u2019s speech was really the best there. All of his logical reasoning was closely linked, and there really was no flaw at all. If it wasn\u2019t for Xiqing being there, Ziheng would definitely have been able to uncover Juexia\u2019s identity.\u201dZhou Ziheng sighed. \u201cWho would have thought that the youngest player on the field would take advantage of both Xiqing\u2019s uncertainty and my logical thinking to create a feint and sow dissension among the ranks.\u201dThe corners of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth quirked up. \u201cIt was precisely because Senior and Xiqing Ge were strong enough that I was sure that my move of committing suicide would work. They were indispensable to this plan, and if my opponent hadn\u2019t been strong enough, I wouldn\u2019t have used this kind of a wild path of burning all my bridges.\u201dSaying that, he looked at Fang Juexia and said, \u201cOf course, there was also my knight. If anyone else were my knight in this episode, I probably wouldn\u2019t have killed myself. Because my knight would have to avoid all attention, collect clues secretly, connect with me smoothly, manipulate the voting pattern perfectly each time we voted, and finally seize the opportunity to decrypt all the clues and escape. Only Fang Juexia could do all this.\u201dFang Juexia couldn\u2019t deceive himself. They had been trapped in the escape room for several hours, and although they hadn\u2019t stayed together all the time, it seemed that there was an invisible thread that had been binding them together. Hidden under all this deception and intrigue was Pei Tingsong\u2019s unconditional trust in him.He looked up and gave Pei Tingsong a smile.Fang Juexia then opened his mouth, \u201cIn fact, winning this round had a lot to do with luck. At first, I was hesitating between Xiao Pei and Xiqing Ge. Even though Xiao Pei kept hinting at me, I was still wondering whether Xiqing Ge was my companion or not. So when I found the recording, I invited Xiqing Ge over. But he turned me down, which allowed me to give up on the idea that he was the killer.\u201dZhai Ying asked again, \u201cBut you can\u2019t control the voting\u00a0ah? If in the first round, Xiqing Ge or Xiao Pei had left, it would have been a mess after that.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t control the voting, but I can calculate it.\u201d Fang Juexia said while smiling at her, \u201cDuring the first round of voting, I still wasn\u2019t sure who the killer was, so neither of the two could leave. At that time, you and Senior Brother doubted Xiqing Ge\u2019s motives, but Senior Brother was more experienced. He knew that he could not use conventional logic when facing Xiqing Ge, and so was always cautious when voting. Therefore, there was an 80% chance he\u2019d abandon his vote.\u201d\u201cZhai Ying, when you talked, it seemed as if you wanted to vote for Xiqing Ge, so when I was encouraging everyone to vote, I believed that you would vote for Xiqing Ge. Ziheng\u2019s logic was very stable; he only believed in himself, and didn\u2019t believe that the knight was definitely from among one of them, so it was likely that he would vote for others. Xiqing Ge and Xiao Pei would vote for each other. Then, at that time, calculating all this, there were two votes to oust Xiqing Ge and one vote to oust Xiao Pei, so I voted for Xiao Pei.\u201dShang Sirui marveled at this set of assumptions. \u201cI did give up voting at that time. You\u2019re too strong, who would have thought that the black knight would vote for the killer in the first round?\u201dFang Juexia looked at Zhou Ziheng and asked, \u201cThe person you voted for during the first round was me, right?\u201dZhou Ziheng admitted it readily, \u201cYou guessed right. The first round, I locked onto you, but you just hid too well. If Xiao Pei hadn\u2019t died later, my attention wouldn\u2019t have entirely been diverted towards Xiqing.\u201d\u201cYes, Xiao Pei protected me and caused havoc between you two.\u201d Fang Juexia nodded with a smile. \u201cIn the second round of voting, I just wanted to get Ziheng kicked out, so I stood with Xiqing. On the one hand, Xiqing now had a little trust in me, and on the other hand, Ziheng was the person who had discovered the chessboard password with me. It\u2019s hard to distract someone\u2019s attention from something they know is there.\u201dXu Qichen couldn\u2019t help praising, \u201cIn the beginning, when I watched your guys\u2019 interview, I especially liked both of your attitudes and speaking styles, so I asked Yin Jie to invite you onto the program. However, you guys have really exceeded my expectations, that silent tacit understanding you have going with each other is really powerful.\u201dEveryone ate and chatted, and began to discuss their predictions for the next episode, continuing all the way until the director said from behind the camera, \u201cEveryone\u2019s almost done eating, so I\u2019ll say a few words.\u201d\u201cWe will be donating all the proceeds from this episode to the child protection association, and we are very grateful to the companies and the brand names who have supported us. We very much hope that through this episode, we can stimulate everyone into protecting and caring for the youth, and into paying attention to the issue of preventing children\u2019s sexual abuse, because protecting our children is what protects our future.\u201d\u201cGreat!\u201d\u201cWell then, everyone has worked hard today. \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019 season 2, episode 1, has officially completed its filming today!\u201dEveryone ate and drank well, then added each other on WeChat. Xia Xiqing created a group chat and changed the group chat\u2019s name to\u2014 [Today I am again fighting a battle of wits and courage against the program group], and then everyone gathered up their things and prepared to go home.When Zhai Ying\u2019s agent came to pick her up in person, he ended up coming face to face with Fang Juexia at the back door of the restaurant, and recognized him.\u201c\u2026\u2026Juexia?\u201d The middle-aged man showed a trace of embarrassment as he asked, \u201cYou\u2019ve been good recently\u00a0ba?\u201dFang Juexia nodded somewhat emotionlessly and replied, \u201cVery good.\u201dZhai Ying looked at the two people, then pulled her family\u2019s agent away, rolled down the window after getting into the car, and said goodbye to Fang Juexia with a smile.Fang Juexia waved at her and watched Zhai Ying\u2019s car drive away. His mood right now was somewhat complicated, but he didn\u2019t even have the time to put his hand down before someone hugged him from the back, with two long arms hooking around his neck. \u201cI\u2019m so dizzy\u00a0ah, Juexia Ge.\u201dEven after everything, Fang Juexia had still not gotten used to Pei Tingsong calling him Gege, but he did seem to enjoy it a little bit right now.\u201cYou stopped me from drinking, but you drank so much yourself.\u201d Fang Juexia pulled his hands away, and right then, Xiao Wen drove his car over and flashed his headlights at them.Supporting Pei Tingsong over to the car, Xiao Wen was also very excited, exclaiming, \u201cI watched this entire episode on the monitors, too strong, it will definitely explode, and our spot on the Hot Search list is reserved!\u201dFang Juexia was as calm as ever and didn\u2019t say too much. Up until now, his mind was still constantly recalling all the things that had happened in the escape room.Pei Tingsong seemed to have really drunk a lot; his neck had turned red, and his speech had become slower, but he still looked to be quite sober. His drinking tolerance and drunk behavior were much better than his own.\u201cRight,\u201d Xiao Wen suddenly thought of something and said, \u201cI forgot to tell you guys that today you may have to stay outside. Strong Ge asked me to take you to a hotel.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Fang Juexia didn\u2019t understand and inquired, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the dormitory?\u201d\u201cWell, the dormitory\u2019s electronic lock was suddenly attacked today. Fortunately, none of you were there. The company suspects that because you guys are popular now, there may have been some stalker fans or something who did it. It\u2019s still getting fixed right now, and we\u2019re going to replace the lock for you guys. For the sake of this matter, Strong Ge even quarreled with the property management, saying that someone bribed the people on the property. Anyway, it\u2019s urgently getting dealt with right now, so we won\u2019t go back tonight. We\u2019ll find a hotel close to the company, and just use that for tonight.\u201dThere was also no other way to deal with this.Fang Juexia was about to answer, but Pei Tingsong snatched the initiative and stated, \u201cI\u2019m not going to stay in a hotel.\u201d\u201cThen what do you want to do\u00a0ah, young master?\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s really a stalker around, then the hotel is even less safe.\u201d Pei Tingsong looked at the night view outside the window. \u201cGo to the apartment I used to live in\u00a0ba.\u201dFang Juexia turned his head and looked at him.Pei Tingsong, who was half-drunk, grinned and bumped his forehead against Fang Juexia\u2019s. \u201cWhat, are you afraid\u00a0ah?\u201dFang Juexia covered his forehead, which had been suddenly bumped into, and stared at Pei Tingsong with wide eyes. The colorful neon lights outside the glass window projected onto that handsome face. He was still smiling, leaning against the window on the other side, with Fang Juexia\u2019s face being reflected in his deep pupils.\u201cI even killed myself for you,\u00a0black knight.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Fang Juexia looked out the window, and calculated that they had already known each other for more than two years, but he had never gone to the place where Pei Tingsong lived. Their interactions had only taken place at either the company or during activities, and even when at work, he had displayed an extremely indifferent attitude towards Pei Tingsong, pretending that he simply didn\u2019t exist, that no such person existed in his eyes.They had actually managed to maintain such a mutually strained tolerance for a whole two years.\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201dFang Juexia made a sound of acknowledgement, opened the car door, and got out first. However, for some reason, Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t follow him out. Seeing him behave like this, Fang Juexia bent down and looked inside the car. \u201cPei Tingsong, we\u2019re here.\u201dPei Tingsong raised his head, shook his head once more, and then slowly climbed out of the car. As he got out of the car, his center of gravity became unstable, and he fell against Fang Juexia just like an uprooted tree.It was probably the alcohol was kicking in again, and Fang Juexia felt that right now, Pei Tingsong was even more seriously drunk than before.\u201cHey, slow down a bit. Weren\u2019t you talking smoothly just now?\u201d Fang Juexia reached out to steady him and called to Xiao Wen for help. The two people helped him to the ground floor of the apartment complex. The lock at the entrance here used facial recognition, but Pei Tingsong seemed to be sleepy, and it seemed that he couldn\u2019t open his eyes. Xiao Wen threw him bodily against Fang Juexia, then pried open Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyelids with both of his hands, and tried to force him to face the camera so that it would recognize him.\u201cIt hurts.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s \u2018Young Master\u2019 temper was aroused, and with a slap, he pushed Xiao Wen away. Fang Juexia had no way left other than to coax him, \u201cYou look here for a second, we can only go up after it recognizes you.\u201dAfter listening to this, Pei Tingsong turned to face Fang Juexia and even blinked.\u201cNot at me.\u201d Fang Juexia turned his face to the right with his hand and aimed it at the camera, instructing, \u201cLook here.\u201dAfter spending a lot of effort over a long period of time, they finally managed to get upstairs. To Fang Juexia\u2019s surprise, Pei Tingsong\u2019s apartment was much simpler than he had imagined. He had thought that a child like him, one who came from such a well-off family and lived by himself, would live in that kind of high-rise mansion with hundreds of square meters. Reality proved that he was not as extravagant as that. The apartment was indeed beautiful, with floor-to-ceiling windows in the two bedrooms and two living rooms, but the furniture was very sparse, and the living room was almost empty except for a sofa.It totally didn\u2019t look like a home.\u201cJuexia, you just stay here together with him today\u00a0ba. This is the change of clothing and toiletries I brought from the dormitory for you. Originally, they were for you to use while at the hotel, but now, it\u2019s perfect, you can still use them here too,\u201d said Xiao Wen as he anxiously helped Pei Tingsong to the sofa and sat him down. He checked the time and then added, \u201cI still need to send Lu Yuan to the airport in a bit.\u201d\u201cIs he going to record a show?\u201d\u201cYes\u00a0ah. I\u2019m going to be late, so I\u2019ll leave now.\u201dFang Juexia sent him to the door and said, \u201cDrive carefully.\u201dUpon closing the door, only the two of them were now present in the apartment. Fang Juexia changed his shoes for slippers, took out another pair of slippers, went to the sofa, and put them on the ground. \u201cYou change your shoes, too.\u201dPei Tingsong let out an \u201cen\u201d. He kicked off his shoes and also took off his coat at the same time. \u201cIt\u2019s so hot.\u201d With one hand, he dragged his innermost black sweater off his body, threw it on the sofa, and now, with his upper body completely bare, leaned back against the sofa.His skin was usually pale, but after drinking, it was suffused with red.\u201cYou\u2019ll catch a cold.\u201d Fang Juexia sighed and brought his coat over to cover him. As soon as he covered him, Pei Tingsong pulled it aside. \u201cIt\u2019s really hot.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hot while wearing the sweater, but wearing the coat won\u2019t make you feel that hot.\u201d Fang Juexia pulled him up, helped him put on the coat, and zipped it up. However, Pei Tingsong made a last stubborn move of his own by moving his hand and pulling the zipper all the way down to reveal his abdominal muscles.Fang Juexia looked at his figure and thought it was strange. When exactly had Pei Tingsong managed to get fit? He had muscular abs, muscular pecs, and even a mermaid line right under his abs. Fang Juexia danced every day, and yet all he had were only the abs.\u201cYou\u2019re looking at me.\u201d Pei Tingsong tilted his head and blinked at Fang Juexia.\u201cNo,\u201d Fang Juexia stood up and said, \u201cYou rest for a bit here, I\u2019ll go to wash up first.\u201dThe bathroom, on the other hand, was very big. Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t really rest easy with a drunk outside, so he could only take a quick shower, wash himself quickly, and then exit the bathroom in the shortest amount of time. He considered washing the clothes he had worn today, even though he had been wearing the clothes provided by the show\u2019s stylist group the entire time they had been filming.Tidy things up first\u00a0ba. Fang Juexia picked up his coat and shook it out. A piece of paper fell out of it and drifted onto Fang Juexia\u2019s slippers.He stooped to pick it up, glanced at it, and then stuffed it into the pocket of his pajamas.\u201cI\u2019m done with the bathroom.\u201d He wiped at his hair and came out, only to find that Pei Tingsong, who had just been on the sofa, was now standing upright, and had pasted both of his hands against the floor-to-ceiling window, seeming as if he was looking out at something.Fang Juexia walked over and asked, \u201cHave you sobered up? Go wash up and go to bed early\u00a0ba.\u201dPei Tingsong leaned against the window and nodded, then turned and walked towards the bathroom. Fang Juexia was a little worried and reached out a hand to help steady him, but Pei Tingsong refused it. The tall man, who was nearly 1.9 m, staggered around while walking forward. Fang Juexia, who was watching this, was nearly living in terror, afraid that this person would fall to the ground with his next step.However, it seemed that he was worrying too much for no reason. Only after he heard the sound of the bathroom door closing did Fang Juexia feel relieved. He walked around the empty living room and suddenly thought of the problem of how they would sleep that night.Fortunately, there were two rooms.However, this idea soon proved to just be his naive hypothesis. There were indeed two rooms in the apartment, but there was only one bed. The other bedroom had been turned into a study, with two large bookcases, a desk that doubled as a working station, as well as a guitar, keyboard, and other musical instruments.\u201cWhat to do\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia had a headache about where he was supposed to sleep tonight, but he also couldn\u2019t help walking into that room. This study contained the most vitality in this apartment.No, not vitality. Fang Juexia dismissed this judgment of his in his heart and then revised it.It was full of Pei Tingsong.He walked in, and realized that the room was filled with the smell of paper books. It was very intriguing; it was plainly a cold city night, but here, he could feel the warm breath of the sun as it dried the pages. There was a mess on the desk, with open books, a thick stack of papers, and various notes spread across it, along with a very brightly colored note propped in front of the lamp with a few big words on it\u2014Please don\u2019t clean up here.Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help it as the corners of his mouth drew up. He guessed that this apartment should have a cleaning auntie who cleaned it up regularly, otherwise, this young master, who couldn\u2019t even make a bed, probably wouldn\u2019t be able to even keep himself neat and tidy. Just looking at this little note, he could imagine the various scenes\u2014 of Pei Tingsong defending his messy desk to death, of him writing out his requirements in a way that clearly showed he had translated them first from English, of him saying \u2018please\u2019 out loud.His desk was padded with a piece of paper on which he wrote and drew. There were many repeated words on it, as if he had been practicing calligraphy. Fang Juexia felt a little affectionate towards it; it was just like some scratch paper for literature lovers.He sat down to identify what had been written on the paper; it consisted mostly of signatures of Pei Tingsong\u2019s name, along with some scrawled English.Some of the words were very interesting and attracted Fang Juexia\u2019s attention.[the taste of coffee is coffee-colored, and the taste of cream is soft white.add ice, the taste of ice is transparent and colorless.after drinking, cold air cuts the throat.ice is a diamond lying in the throat.]His mind always seemed to be full of fantastic ideas, like a\u00a0heavenly steed\u00a0soaring through the skies, while simultaneously being completely unpredictable. Fang Juexia opened up a book and wanted to continue reading, but unexpectedly, that book accidentally fell on the floor. He hurried to pick it up and found a photo that had fallen onto the floor as well, and it seemed to have fallen out of the book.In the center of the photo was an old man in a wheelchair, who was wearing a pair of bifocals and had a kind smile. Crouching by the side of the wheelchair was a 13 or 14-year-old, who was hugging a newly born puppy in his arms. He was smiling so widely that his eyes had become curved crescents, and he was full of youthful spirit.Pei Tingsong was like a cactus seedling when he was a child; even his thorns were soft. Actually, you couldn\u2019t even call them thorns, they were like the rays of light that peeked through the clouds.Fang Juexia placed the photo back into the book, stood up, and suddenly realized that a lot of time had passed since Pei Tingsong had entered the bathroom, but there had been no signs of any sound from that direction at all.He couldn\u2019t help but worry; even though it looked like Pei Tingsong seemed to possess all his mental facilities, he had really drank a lot of alcohol. Besides, last time, when he had gotten drunk to the extent of becoming a completely-falling-over drunk, it had been Pei Tingsong who had taken care of him from the beginning to the end, so he needed to return his kindness.There was no movement from the bathroom, and not even the sound of a shower emerged from it. Some bad possibilities appeared in Fang Juexia\u2019s mind.It couldn\u2019t be that he had fainted\u00a0ba?Right, you couldn\u2019t just casually take a bath after drinking!Thinking of this, Fang Juexia rammed himself against the bathroom door. Unexpectedly, the bathroom door wasn\u2019t locked at all, and had just been closed superficially. Ramming into it the way he did, he ended up falling to the floor and almost couldn\u2019t get up.\u201c\u2026\u2026really hurts.\u201dFang Juexia frowned and raised his arms. Looking inside, he found that Pei Tingsong was actually taking a bath.Bathing was even more dangerous in such a state! Fang Juexia didn\u2019t even have time to care about the pain coursing through his body, and he ran barefoot towards the innermost bathtub. Pei Tingsong\u2019s head was resting against the bathtub, his eyes were closed, and he was completely motionless.\u201cHey, Pei Tingsong, wake up.\u201d He patted Pei Tingsong\u2019s face, and only after seeing the other party slowly open his eyes did his heart, that was nearly beating out of his chest, stabilize a bit.News headlines about the sudden death of a member of a boy-band trending on the social network sites had just leaped to the forefront of his mind.Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyelashes were covered in moist water vapor, and he blinked twice, slowly, before finally focusing on Fang Juexia\u2019s face. The corners of his mouth quirked up, and he smiled as he raised his hand to cover Fang Juexia\u2019s whole face with his palm.\u201cWhat are you doing\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia held his hand and pulled at his arm, wanting him to sit up. \u201cQuickly come out, you can\u2019t take a bath when you are drunk.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not drunk.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s enunciation was much slower than usual. In order to prove that he was not drunk, he actually held onto the edge of the bathtub and stood up.Fang Juexia had been crouched beside the bathtub, and Pei Tingsong caught him off guard by standing up so suddenly, so he hurriedly turned his head away. He didn\u2019t know what was wrong with him; everything the other party had, he did as well, so if he did see something, it wouldn\u2019t count as anything.But his heart told him, clearly, that there was something.\u201cYou really\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia was tongue-tied for a moment, so he could only get up, pull down a bath towel, and wrap Pei Tingsong up with his head turned to the side. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so\u2026fierce\u00a0ah.\u201d Pei Tingsong talked slowly. He didn\u2019t sound as grumpy and sharp as usual, and even sounded as if he had been a little wronged.\u201cYou\u2019re the one who didn\u2019t listen first.\u201d Fang Juexia finished wrapping him up in a bath towel and took his arm as he led him to the bedroom. \u201cBe careful, don\u2019t run into things.\u201dPei Tingsong said slowly, \u201c\u2026.I\u2014I\u2019m not stupid.\u201dAfter expending great effort, Fang Juexia finally got Pei Tingsong next to the bed. He then took a breath, helped him lie down, and said just to deal with him, \u201cYes, you are the smartest.\u201dWho would have known that in the next moment, he would be dragged down by Pei Tingsong and completely pulled right against this person\u2019s body?The distance between them shrank suddenly, and even the oxygen around them solidified. Fang Juexia held his breath and stared at the person directly under him.His brain was completely blank, unable to give any effective emergency instructions.Pei Tingsong suddenly laughed, with his white teeth flashing, while his eyes were full of Fang Juexia.\u201cYou finally praised me.\u201dHe said this slowly, as his arm slung across the back of Fang Juexia\u2019s waist.Fang Juexia was stunned; he had never expected Pei Tingsong to say something like this. He was clearly the most arrogant child in the world, born with both innate talent and confidence.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia wanted to struggle, but ended up being gripped even tighter by Pei Tingsong, so he could only ask in a frank tone, \u201cDo you know who I am? You\u2019ve drunk too much.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know what was wrong with this sentence, but Pei Tingsong actually exerted force to turn around his body in order to press Fang Juexia under his body.\u201cYou get up, I\u2019m almost out of breath\u2026\u201d\u201cI know who you are.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s bangs hung down, covering his deep eyebrows and eyes halfway. \u201cYou are Fang Juexia\u2026\u201dHe was actually clear about that. Fang Juexia frowned and pushed at him with his hand. \u201cThen you get up, don\u2019t keep pressing on me.\u201d\u201cYou are that damned Fang Juexia\u2026\u201dDamned\u2014this prefix was really in line with Pei Tingsong\u2019s personality. Fang Juexia knew that he had drunk too much and so didn\u2019t bother arguing over it. He just wanted to wrap this person up with a quilt, close the door, and then he could go and squeeze himself onto the sofa for a night.Pei Tingsong was not letting this go at all. He looked as if he was the same as usual, but he still wasn\u2019t quite the same. He mumbled a few vague words in English, then lowered his head and leaned it against Fang Juexia\u2019s clavicle.With hot breath being sprayed against his skin, Fang Juexia felt that his chest was being compressed to the point where his heart couldn\u2019t even muster up the strength to beat properly. \u201cYes, I\u2019m Fang Juexia, that damned Fang Juexia. When you\u2019re done cursing me out, let me go.\u201dPei Tingsong was still stuffed against his chest. \u201cYou\u2026 Do you really admire others?\u201dFang Juexia felt this was a rather inexplicable question. \u201cWho?\u201d\u201cThose people, the screenwriter, Xiqing Ge, and many others\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice was originally low, but it became even deeper when he was drunk.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t understand why he was suddenly saying things like this, and even less on how it had anything to do with Pei Tingsong. \u201cYes, they are all very outstanding and very powerful\u2026\u201d\u201cAm I not outstanding?\u201d Pei Tingsong suddenly raised his head, and his neck was red. \u201cWasn\u2019t I powerful today?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s heart leaped abruptly. \u201cOf course you are also very outstanding, very powerful.\u201dThe most powerful was you, both brave and resourceful, managing to entangle all the best players on the scene into the plan you weaved all by yourself.\u201cBut you didn\u2019t praise me at all.\u201d Pei Tingsong dropped his head again.Fang Juexia was quite surprised; he hadn\u2019t expected Pei Tingsong to be entangled about, or even unhappy with his comments.During the course of the game, he had marveled over Pei Tingsong\u2019s ability more than once, but he didn\u2019t know how to say it to him. He could express his praise to others easily, but when faced with Pei Tingsong, it seemed that he would have to muster up a lot of courage just to smile at him.Fang Juexia himself could not find the reason for why Pei Tingsong received such differential treatment from him.\u201cDo you still think\u2026 think I\u2019m biased against you?\u201d Pei Tingsong lay against his chest. \u201cI said it before, that I misunderstood you previously. I haven\u2019t thought that way ever since then\u2026\u201dHe had never thought that Pei Tingsong would be so frank after getting drunk, which made him feel guilty.Fang Juexia took a deep breath before saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I know you have changed, you said that before.\u201d\u201cBut you don\u2019t trust me, you-you always hide from me\u2026\u201dHe really did do that, that was right. After two years of maintaining constant mutual exclusion, he couldn\u2019t completely get rid of this habit of his within a short time and allow Pei Tingsong to break into his safety zone. Even if he had already dismissed his antipathy towards him, keeping a distance from him had become an ingrained defense mechanism when it came to dealing with Pei Tingsong.This was so even if he was clear that Pei Tingsong was no longer the Pei Tingsong who had targeted him everywhere in the past. He was no longer overbearing, and even his young and frivolous desire for victory had been used by him as a stepping stone to place at Fang Juexia\u2019s feet.Why was it so hard to give up your heart?Fang Juexia also wanted to know the answer to that.\u201cI used to bully you, and I know you disliked me too,\u201d Pei Tingsong paused for a bit before defending himself, \u201cBut now, I\u2026 now I really want to be-to be friends with you. Can\u2019t you see that? I\u2019m already-already so obvious about it. You\u2019re so good, Fang Juexia. You\u2019re so good\u2026\u201dHe kept starting and stopping, talking in a very painstaking manner, but the weight of each of his words was very heavy. One by one, they smashed into Fang Juexia\u2019s heart, creating both deep and shallow pits while releasing a sour and astringent juice.\u201cAbout being a friend, we can be friends.\u201d Fang Juexia held his hand out hesitantly and covered Pei Tingsong\u2019s head, which could count as providing some kind of comfort to him. \u201cBut I\u2019m not as good as you think I am.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Pei Tingsong raised his head abruptly, and as if thinking hard, started praising, \u201cYou\u2019re very good, you\u2019re really good-looking\u2026.you\u2019re smart\u2026very good-looking\u2026\u201dSo he was just good-looking? Fang Juexia didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.\u201cAlso, you\u2019re kind, you\u2019re very cool, right, your attitude towards life is cool, and the way you pursue your dreams is also very cool.\u201dFang Juexia couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cNot as cool as you.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgWhether Pei Tingsong was copying him or just repeating things, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t know, but in short, he kept repeating the words, \u201cNot as cool as you\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to entangle over the question of who was cooler anymore; his hands had already gone numb, and now he just wanted to coax Pei Tingsong up. \u201cI know, you have no prejudices against me now, and you are sorry for what you have done in the past. I forgive you, and I also apologize to you. I used to ignore you and pretend that you didn\u2019t exist, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dPei Tingsong kept lying on his stomach and nodded. \u201cThen-then I forgive you too.\u201d\u201cAlright, then we\u2019ve forgiven each other. Can you get up now?\u201dPei Tingsong could still be counted as being obedient, for he raised up half of his body to make room. Yet, before Fang Juexia could get out from under him, he fell down again. \u201cI have no strength.\u201dGod\u2026 Fang Juexia was fast running out of ideas.Drunk Pei Tingsong was really the same as his family\u2019s dog. He was sticky, you couldn\u2019t get rid of him, and he even had a very hot body temperature.\u201cI really wanted to have a Gege before\u2026\u201d This time, Pei Tingsong lay his head against Fang Juexia\u2019s cheek, and hot air floated over whenever he spoke. Fang Juexia\u2019s pores even resonated with the sound waves made when he opened his mouth.The word \u201cGege\u201d was originally very simple, but it had been embedded with too many elusive meanings in Pei Tingsong\u2019s word games. So now, every time Fang Juexia heard that word, his emotions grew complicated.Did Pei Tingsong want him to be his Gege?But he couldn\u2019t say this out loud\u2014 \u201cYou can view me as your Gege.\u201dThe person who was pressing on top of him suddenly seemed to realize something, struggled to get up, and then reached out to touch Fang Juexia\u2019s waist. Fang Juexia was a little ticklish, so he dodged it and grabbed his hand. \u201cWhat are you doing? It tickles.\u201dPei Tingsong, whose hand was caught, blinked in confusion, then looked at Fang Juexia and asked, \u201cDoesn\u2019t your waist hurt?\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t even do anything, so how can my waist hurt?\u201dAs soon as he blurted this out, Fang Juexia regretted it a little. This sentence was just too ambiguous. Fortunately, Pei Tingsong was really drunk right now, otherwise he would definitely make fun of him by using the worst possible tone to mock his unintentional words.But he didn\u2019t expect that Pei Tingsong would instead look completely relieved. \u201cYou-you told Senior Brother that your waist hurt, and it was because of dancing\u2026 I heard that. I thought it was true, you usually don\u2019t deceive people.\u201dFang Juexia suddenly saw the light; no wonder Pei Tingsong had run over to him at that time and had been so handsy, forcing him into a fight, into almost wrestling together.It turned out that what he had said at that time was true, and that it was not some kind of implied secret signal. He had really come to confirm whether or not he had a waist injury.\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m not hurt.\u201dPei Tingsong nodded heavily, his hair tumbling down. However, he then thought of something else and methodically said, \u201cBut I got hurt.\u201d Saying that, he pointed at the corner of his eye.Fang Juexia wanted to laugh and held onto Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s this side, you\u2019re pointing the other way.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d He rubbed it and then said loudly, \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d just like a fool.Fang Juexia felt that this was too funny, to the extent that he even wanted to record Pei Tingsong\u2019s silly and dazed appearance. Anyway, this guy had done the exact same thing to him before.But forget it, a video wasn\u2019t safe, even though they weren\u2019t doing anything.Doing? It seemed that this word \u201cdo\u201d was also very ambiguous. It had already, obviously, caused even his own thoughts to be carried off too far.\u201cThere\u2019s also this one.\u201d At once, Pei Tingsong reached out and brought his hand right in front of Fang Juexia\u2019s face. \u201cThis also got hurt.\u201dA small scab had already formed on the bite mark on his hand, but it had turned a little red after soaking in the bath, and even the hard scab had now become soft.Speaking of all this, the injuries at the corner of his eye and the one on his hand were all related to him.A little guilt welled up in Fang Juexia\u2019s heart. \u201cYes, I was the one who bit you, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d In order to show his sincerity, he also reached out and rubbed Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand.\u201cYes, you were the one who bit me.\u201d Pei Tingsong nodded. Fang Juexia had thought this topic was over, but unexpectedly, Pei Tingsong suddenly grasped Fang Juexia\u2019s chin in his hand, forced him to raise his head, and then bent down. Fang Juexia was caught completely unprepared by this series of actions.\u201cHey!\u201dClearly, he had just been so docile, but had suddenly transformed back into a wolf cub.What was going on?\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dHis sensory system was being attacked.Everything failed, he could not see or hear anything. He could only feel the soft lips against his throat.The lips separated.\u201cI\u2019m going to bite it back.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a playful bite, and it wasn\u2019t on his hand. It was like a hungry predator biting into his prey\u2019s throat, biting so hard that the prey released fresh and warm blood as he waited for his life to drip out little by little, after which it would completely belong to himself.As Fang Juexia regained his senses, he violently pushed at him and struggled hard, but his actions only seemed to irritate Pei Tingsong even more. In response, Pei Tingsong gripped his forearms, with his two wrists then converging at the top of his head, and he held Fang Juexia down tightly with his broad, bitten hand.He looked down at Fang Juexia, his gaze travelling from his eyes to the red corners of his eyes, all the way to his unique birthmark. It seemed as if he was scrutinizing his prey currently.\u201cPei Tingsong, don\u2019t go crazy while you\u2019re drunk.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes shifted back to showing stubbornness and fearlessness, which made the delirious Pei Tingsong feel more familiar with him.\u201cI\u2019m not drunk.\u201d Pei Tingsong was also very stubborn. \u201cYou know, have you ever seen yourself drunk? I\u2019m completely not\u2026I completely don\u2019t count as being drunk.\u201dYes, but he wasn\u2019t that much better.Anyway, he was going to regret it when he woke up.There was a dull pain at his neck, and Fang Juexia frowned. He was worried about how he would appear on camera in the next few days and how he would explain this to the others. He was still struggling, twisting his arms and his entire body around at the same time.Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t let go. He was terrifyingly strong, and he frowned. \u201cFang Juexia, you\u2019ve made a mess of my bed.\u201d\u201cYou let me go. This is uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201dPei Tingsong was a little unhappy, and he didn\u2019t want to see Fang Juexia\u2019s face, so he lowered his head and gasped for breath. Suddenly, he seemed to find something, and his free hand stretched out to scratch at the sheets. His eyesight was blurry, and his head felt faint, so he had to reach out several times just to pick up a small piece of paper.He squinted and tried to make out the words written on the paper.But Fang Juexia was faster in seeing the handwritten \u2018ukulele\u2019 facing his side. He suddenly regained his senses; shame haunted him for no good reason, and he wanted to grab this note back, but he couldn\u2019t struggle out of Pei Tingsong\u2019s grasp.\u201cDon\u2019t move, I can\u2019t read clearly\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong wasn\u2019t happy. He repeatedly read the word for a long time. \u201cWho-who copied my handwriting?\u201dThat is your handwriting, fool.\u201cNo, no\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyebrows suddenly smoothed out as he said, \u201cThis is what I wrote, this is what I wrote to Fang Juexia before I committed suicide\u2026\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Fang Juexia already had no strength to resist. \u201cThese were your posthumous words, alright\u00a0ba.\u201dPei Tingsong suddenly laughed, as if particularly happy. \u201cI thought you had thrown it away.\u201dHe should have thrown it away; it was just a game prop, and he didn\u2019t know why he had kept it.Fang Juexia wanted to change the topic. He didn\u2019t want to talk about this piece of paper any more, and he didn\u2019t want to recall the shock he had experienced when he had seen that word.\u201cHow are you like this when you get drunk?\u201dOne second, such a straight-shooter that he made people see stars, and the very next second, he was like a madman who wouldn\u2019t let go of anything.He couldn\u2019t even coax him into doing anything.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d Pei Tingsong pinched the piece of paper and frowned slightly. \u201cI\u2019m much better than you, do you know how-how terrible you are when you are drunk? You made me\u2014made me sleep with you\u2026\u201dThese complaints, which he had heard over and over again, still had the ability to make Fang Juexia feel ashamed. \u201cDon\u2019t say it, I know, I\u2019ve apologized to you.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know.\u201d Pei Tingsong interrupted his words and covered his mouth with the small note in his hand, as if he was sticking a seal on it.Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you did.\u201dHe bent down, and like a beautiful collapsed palace, suddenly fell in front of Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes, and in a flash, everything was shaking.\u201cYou kissed me that night, Fang Juexia.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice was very slow and very deep.Then he kissed him from across the paper.Fang Juexia\u2019s breath stopped suddenly. He was drowning in the ruins; his body couldn\u2019t move, and his mind was completely blank.The next moment, these scattered ruins gathered together again, and drew up little by little while rising into the sky. There was a piece of paper separating him from these skimming kisses, and he thus gained some breathing space.However, Pei Tingsong, who had been left further away, was dissatisfied with this degree of restoration, so he reached out and ripped off that seal that had only lasted for a moment.\u201cThat\u2019s not right, it was like this.\u201dThen, he kissed him for real.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 45Chapter 45 \u2013 Break The Ice To Warm UpTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksWhat else did I do?How did it turn out like this?\u201cWu!\u201d Fang Juexia tried his best to break free of the grip Pei Tingsong had on his hands, while simultaneously using all of his strength to push at him, but it didn\u2019t work at all. On the contrary, he ended up driving Pei Tingsong even crazier, to the extent that this person pressed up against him fully, leaving him no breathing space at all.He didn\u2019t know if he had really forced Pei Tingsong to kiss him when he had been drunk, and even more, he didn\u2019t know how he had kissed him at that time. But in any case, Pei Tingsong\u2019s kiss was definitely nothing like a dragonfly skimming over water, and the more he resisted, the harder Pei Tingsong went at it. The fires of alcohol and the desire for victory had burned his reason to ashes, and he didn\u2019t even care if Fang Juexia was still pushing at him. He directly grabbed Fang Juexia\u2019s jaw with his hand, and as if he were prying open an iceberg, forced him to open up his firmly closed mouth.As an inexperienced beginner, what kind of excellent skills could he have?He kissed Fang Juexia with his lips and teeth, kissed him with his bones.This fire had ignited an unprecedented desire in the depths of his heart, rendering this mimicry that had sprung up, no longer so simple.The sealed glaciers were smashed into helpless ice floes, which were then forced to melt into spring water. The gradually dwindling air supply turned Fang Juexia\u2019s resistance into death throes. His elevated neck seemed to have lost the ability to swallow, and he really became a prey that gradually lost himself.No, he couldn\u2019t turn into prey.This burst of will restored a moment of clarity to him, and he used the last of his strength to mercilessly bite down.The crazy wolf cub was pained, let go, and looked up, only to then severely be slapped by Fang Juexia.Late in the night, this slap resounded particularly clearly in the bedroom, so clear that it reverberated repeatedly within Fang Juexia\u2019s confused mind. He had never hit anyone like this with such great strength.But he really didn\u2019t want to be a tool that a drunken Pei Tingsong could use to blow off steam.Pei Tingsong\u2019s head turned away after he slapped him, with his arms now supporting his body. This blow seemed to have slapped him silly, and with his half dry hair scattered across his face, Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t make out his current expression clearly.Fang Juexia wiped at the corners of his mouth with the back of his hand while gasping rapidly for breath. After seeing that Pei Tingsong\u2019s bath towel had also been kicked all over the place by him, he could only lift up the whole quilt to cover up Pei Tingsong\u2019s body.He could still taste the blood that had suffused within his mouth, all the way from the back of his teeth to the tip of his tongue, but it wasn\u2019t his blood.Originally, a bellyful of fire ready to explode had been festering within him, but now that Pei Tingsong was completely immobile, he couldn\u2019t even direct a single curse word at him. After that slap, the room had become horribly quiet.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t know what was wrong with him as well. At such a moment, he should just throw up his hands and leave. It was Pei Tingsong who had gone crazy first, so he could just treat this entire incident as having been bitten by a dog.If you got bit by a dog, you couldn\u2019t just bite the dog back.No mistake.He originally wasn\u2019t a person who liked to get entangled in things. Blocking out any person or thing that would affect his mood by just pretending that they didn\u2019t exist or that thing didn\u2019t happen came to him easily. He could maintain his inner peace by employing this method.This had always been Fang Juexia\u2019s consistent maxim when it came to dealing with such matters.After getting out of the bed, he clamped onto a pillow and carried it away, then opened the wardrobe, found another quilt inside it, and got ready to leave the room. Even if he had to sleep on the sofa, he just didn\u2019t want to be in the same room as this lunatic.While holding onto the quilt, as he was leaving the bedroom, having walked no more than two steps, the now hard-hearted Fang Juexia heard a sound, and his steps slowed.Pei Tingsong sneezed three times in a row.Just a few seconds passed, and Fang Juexia now stood in the corridor as he ransacked his mind to list out all the shortcomings Pei Tingsong possessed that he could find. Pei Tingsong had made fun of him in all kinds of ways these past two years, and then he tried very hard to recall just how indignant he had been, how angry he currently was, and how much he had wanted to beat this madman up.Dozens of seconds passed.Fang Juexia, who had experienced lots of people and things, still went back to the bedroom, cursing himself out as he headed back.He was simply the most contradictory person in the world.Pei Tingsong was clearly the most arrogant and immature person he had ever met, and this person possessed countless shortcomings that could pave the way for him to ignore him now. But in the past few seconds, all he had thought of was how Pei Tingsong had helped him get out of trouble; at that crucial, hanging-by-a-thread moment on that stage, Pei Tingsong had followed his lead without any hesitation, he had held his shoulder steady in the dark, and even though he obviously didn\u2019t know how to take care of people, he had even kept his demented drunk self company for a whole night, and then during the escape room game, he had protected him and given his all\u2026.And just a while ago, he had said over and over again\u2014Fang Juexia, you\u2019re so good.His so-called hard-heartedness was akin to a paper tiger that could be punctured through with a finger.\u201cPei Tingsong, for the sake of all the times you have taken care of me before, I\u2019ll return the favor. I will do everything possible to help you.\u201d He threw the quilt in his hands on the bed, put it on top of Pei Tingsong without any gentleness at all, then bent his head, and struggled to wrap him up with another blanket. At present, he was the world\u2019s most attentive sushi master as he coarsely rolled up a\u00a0wolf heart and dog lung\u00a0kimbap.Only Pei Tingsong\u2019s head was left sticking out, and the expression on his face looked like he had been completely wronged. His right cheek had been slapped bright red, and the edges of his eyes were red, making it seem that he was about to cry. Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t tell whether he was really sad or had caught a cold, but anyway, he had been sniffling the whole time.Fang Juexia was still really angry, so he pressed Pei Tingsong down with both hands. His voice was unusually vicious. \u201cDon\u2019t move. If you end up catching a cold, I really won\u2019t care for you anymore.\u201dPei Tingsong was even more aggrieved after hearing this. \u201cMy mouth hurts!\u201d\u201cYou deserved it,\u201d Fang Juexia glared at him. \u201cYou should be thanking God and the heavens right now that I didn\u2019t bite your tongue completely off.\u201dOn hearing him say that, Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth shriveled. \u201cHow can you be so fierce\u00a0ah?\u201d\u201cIs this the first time you\u2019ve met me?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201d He answered the question honestly, and began to mutter again, this time with a bit of a stutter added in, \u201cYou can be-be gentle and soft with others, but you\u2019re the fiercest towards me. You don\u2019t\u2014you don\u2019t even smile at me.\u201dFang Juexia glanced at him and was about to speak, but Pei Tingsong seemed particularly afraid of him interrupting his words, and so, didn\u2019t pause for breath before complaining again, \u201cI\u2014you-you kissed me that day, and I didn\u2019t even lose my temper. I didn\u2019t say a word against you, and I even hugged you to sleep. But you, I just kissed you once, and then you hit me. Even my dad doesn\u2019t dare to hit me, if he ever hit me, I would jump out the window, and I would just drive his car away! I\u2019ll drive to\u2026\u201dFang Juexia had a terrible headache now, and he covered Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth with one hand as he sat his whole person on Pei Tingsong who was currently wrapped in a quilt. \u201cShut up, I don\u2019t want to know where you\u2019re going to drive your father\u2019s car to. You can even go to Las Vegas, and it\u2019ll have nothing to do with me.\u201d\u201cWu!\u201d Pei Tingsong was obviously not happy. Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t even letting him talk, and the anger from that grew the more he was suppressed, so he opened his mouth to bite him. Yet, as soon as his teeth touched his hand, he closed his mouth again and shook his head in anger.\u201cYou are really crazy. Don\u2019t drink any more in the future. Actually, neither of us should drink anymore.\u201d Fang Juexia took his hand away from his mouth and instead, pressed it on his head. Pei Tingsong sniffled a bit, and pitifully said, \u201cYou bit my hand, but I won\u2019t bite back.\u201dFang Juexia pulled opened the collar of his shirt and said, \u201cI\u2019ve already let\u00a0you\u00a0bite my neck until the skin broke, Young Master, and you still say you won\u2019t bite back.\u201dPei Tingsong really didn\u2019t let it go. \u201cThen, since you kissed me, is it not okay for me to kiss you back? I didn\u2019t even hit you, but you still hit me.\u201d\u201cI just can\u2019t outtalk you.\u201d\u201cYou were originally\u2026\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s anger reached its limit, and he pointed at his face as he said, \u201cShut up. I\u2019ll just ask you, did I kiss you that way? No matter how drunk I was, I wouldn\u2019t be like the way you just were, that\u2019s impossible.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just how you were.\u201d Pei Tingsong vigorously raised his head, smacked his lips and gave Fang Juexia\u2019s index finger a kiss. \u201cJust like that.\u201dFang Juexia hurriedly pulled his fingers away, and couldn\u2019t help but loudly demand at him, \u201cWho asked you to kiss me again?\u201d\u201cYou asked me, you were the one who asked me!\u201d Pei Tingsong seemed to feel that he was the most wronged person in the world, and he was so frantic that he appeared to be an earthworm that couldn\u2019t flip over.Fang Juexia had never dealt with this kind of situation in his entire life. His 23 years of interpersonal experience were rendered completely useless when it came to Pei Tingsong, and he was mentally and physically exhausted.Taking a deep breath, Fang Juexia decided that he didn\u2019t want to tangle with this person anymore, especially on the matter of who kissed whom and how. He got up from Pei Tingsong\u2019s body and let out a long breath.He really was becoming increasingly less and less like himself.\u201cLet\u2019s call a truce, alright? Sleep.\u201d Fang Juexia picked up the bath towel that had come undone during the struggle, rolled it up diagonally, and tied him up with it. \u201cDon\u2019t you still need to go to class tomorrow? Just behave yourself and fall asleep for me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to class.\u201d After saying that, he sneezed again.Whether or not you want to go to class, what does that have to do with me?Fang Juexia ignored him, grabbed his quilt, and got ready to leave. If they kept tossing around like this, half of his lifetime would be spent on Pei Tingsong.But just as he was about to leave, Pei Tingsong called out to him, and started twisting himself up to follow him out.It was a terrible scene once again, for he really fell down.\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d Fang Juexia had no other choice but to lie down beside Pei Tingsong, deciding to wait for him to fall asleep before leaving.Seeing Fang Juexia turn off the light and lie down next to him, Pei Tingsong finally became quiet, neither quarrelling nor causing anymore trouble. Fang Juexia wrapped a quilt around himself and flipped around to face the wardrobe. He then felt Pei Tingsong scoot forward and lean against his back.Fang Juexia said nothing. He couldn\u2019t see anything clearly in the dark, and he also didn\u2019t want to see it clearly. Filming for the whole day had drained him of his energy, and he should have gone to sleep a long time ago. He felt like he was a balloon full of air, and upon meeting Pei Tingsong, that cactus, he had been pricked by his thorns all over the place. Whether he wanted to or not, all the air had leaked out of him, along with his brains, leaving behind only a soft and shriveled body.After a while, Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice sounded out behind him again, but it wasn\u2019t as aggrieved and willful as his voice had previously been. Instead, it was deep, carrying a tone of some unexpected and indescribable request.\u201cDon\u2019t turn off the lights.\u201dFang Juexia felt such a request was inexplicable, and kept his back to Pei Tingsong as he coldly said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t turn off the lights, how are we going to sleep?\u201dAfter that, he felt Pei Tingsong\u2019s head prop up against the back of his head.\u201cIf the lights are off, Fang Juexia can\u2019t see.\u201dIt was only at this moment that he found that the kiss had left some aftershocks.Once he closed his eyes, he would fall back into that deep and drowning kiss. His heart was drenched, and he couldn\u2019t find a way to escape.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t turn around, but he did reach out with his hand, circle it back, and pat Pei Tingsong\u2019s head.\u201cI can see, sleep\u00a0ba.\u201dPei Tingsong was woken up by his own alarm clock. The class was at 10 a.m., so he had set the alarm for 8:30, but it was vibrating so much that his head hurt. He was still dazed from sleep, and he couldn\u2019t even open his eyes. He wanted to reach out and turn off the alarm clock, but unexpectedly, he couldn\u2019t stretch his arms out at all.That was weird. Pei Tingsong frowned, and in the next moment, sensed an arm hang over his side, which then went over him, felt around his pillow for a long time, feeling around and around until it finally grasped his cellphone and directly turned it off.He was startled awake in that instant. When he opened his eyes and turned his head, he saw the person lying beside him. Half of his face had shrunken into the quilt, but with the birthmark that was clearly revealed at the corner of his eye, this person could be no one else but Fang Juexia.His mental abilities slowly recovered, and he tried to search his memory. He remembered that they had come out of the program group\u2019s dinner party, and then Xiao Wen had sent them back to the dormitory.No, the dormitory\u2019s door lock had been attacked, so they should be in his apartment now.That was right, that could be the only reason why he and Fang Juexia were sleeping in the same bed.All of this was very logical, and Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart settled slightly. Since he was suffering from a hangover, he had a bad headache. Pei Tingsong thought about drinking water, but found that he couldn\u2019t get up at all.Only after forcefully raising his head did he discover that he had been completely wrapped up, and had even been tied up tightly with two bath towels that had been knotted together. Forget about getting up, he couldn\u2019t even move an inch.No, what had Fang Juexia been thinking? Pei Tingsong cursed in his heart while trying to think up ways to get out of the quilt. As soon as he got one arm out, he noticed that something was wrong.Why was he naked?Pei Tingsong struggled to pull both of his hands out, scooted his body out of this binding a bit, then untied the bath towel and glanced into the quilt. Only then did he find that he really wasn\u2019t wearing anything.How did this end up happening?He had a deathly headache, and after Pei Tingsong looked down and around, he realised that his clothes weren\u2019t there anymore. He could only get out of bed while still wrapped in the quilt, open the wardrobe, and find a pair of pajamas to throw on. Suddenly, through the mirror in the wardrobe, he noticed that his right cheek was a little swollen and a little red.His tongue hurt a little too. He opened his mouth and saw that his tongue had been bitten.Not only that, he also had a wound caused by nails scraping against his skin on his shoulder.What was going on?Every bone in his body hurt as well.He looked back at Fang Juexia, only to see him still sleeping. Pei Tingsong, with a heart full of suspicion, went to the bathroom himself. He took a bath and checked to see whether he had any other wounds. At the same time, he tried to recall what had happened last night, but his mind was in such a mess that no matter how he tried to remember it, he just couldn\u2019t.Originally, he had thought that after a hot bath, he would feel more comfortable, but the more he washed his hair, the more he was having difficulty breathing, so he just turned off the water and came out from the shower. Only after exiting the bathroom and going back to the bedroom did he find that there was actually no longer anyone in the bed.It couldn\u2019t be that he was still dreaming\u00a0ba?\u201cWhat are you doing, blocking the way here?\u201dA familiar cold voice sounded out from behind him, and Pei Tingsong returned to his senses, turning around and moving away.Fang Juexia\u2019s hair was messy in the front, and there were still some water droplets on his hands. He placed a cup of hot water at the head of the bed and glanced meaningfully at Pei Tingsong. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the fridge, so I can\u2019t make any hangover soup. Make do and drink this.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d As soon as Pei Tingsong opened his mouth, he realized that his throat was hoarse, dry, and painful. He coughed a few times and tried to clear his throat, but the more he coughed like this, the harder he kept coughing. He bowed his body and coughed so hard that he found himself unable to even lift his head, so he walked towards the bed, sat down, and reached for the cup of water so as to suppress it.Fang Juexia just looked at him, and afraid that Pei Tingsong would end up choking, he picked up the water first. \u201cDrink only when you\u2019re done coughing.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s face turned red from all the coughing. He looked so pitiful that Fang Juexia could only reach out and pat him on the back. When he got better, he handed him the cup of water. \u201cDrink it slow.\u201dWatching him gulp down the water, Fang Juexia, who stood at the side, asked, \u201cDo you feel bad anywhere?\u201dPei Tingsong put his cup of water down and said in a hoarse voice, \u201cMy bones hurt.\u201d\u201cWhat else?\u201d\u201cMy tongue hurts too, don\u2019t know what happened\u2026\u201dIt seemed like he didn\u2019t remember what had happened last night.Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t describe the emotions he was feeling right now.It was best if Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t remember the events of last night, that way, neither of them had to feel awkward around each other. If it was really like how Pei Tingsong had said, when he had been drunk before, he really had kissed him. However, after he had woken up, Pei Tingsong hadn\u2019t mentioned a word about any such thing, which showed that he also felt embarrassed and didn\u2019t want to reveal anything.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgForgetting was easier than anything else.But somehow, he felt a bit unreconciled to this.The scary thing was that the Fang Juexia of the past had almost nothing to do with the word \u2018unreconciled\u2019. He was not a very emotional person.\u201cMy eyes are a little sore too\u2026\u201dAs soon as he heard Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice, he thought it didn\u2019t sound quite right. Remembering that this person had been naked for a long time yesterday while causing an uproar, and had also been sneezing and having a runny nose, Fang Juexia felt that things weren\u2019t good.\u201cHow are your eyes hurting?\u201d He felt it was strange and patted on a pillow behind Pei Tingsong. \u201cYou lie on it. Do you have a thermometer here?\u201dPei Tingsong shook his head. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t ever been sick.\u201d\u201cThen congratulations, you\u2019re sick now.\u201d Fang Juexia covered him with a quilt and reached out to touch his forehead, but his hand was too cold. Whichever way he touched him, Pei Tingsong felt hot, and it wasn\u2019t an accurate way to measure his temperature.Pei Tingsong stubbornly insisted that he wasn\u2019t sick, and he felt that he would especially have no face if he got sick in front of Fang Juexia. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish speaking, Fang Juexia lifted up his bangs and drew his own forehead closer to Pei Tingsong\u2019s.The distance between them was suddenly shortened, and with his unfinished words being blocked while still in his throat, Pei Tingsong was left stunned.Although it was just a way to measure his temperature, and it was only for a few seconds, this whole action was just like a turning point, his memory igniting with a snap. He remembered what he couldn\u2019t remember no matter how hard he had tried before this moment. The images of those scenes reappeared in front of his eyes in a flash.He had kissed Fang Juexia last night.The source for the pain on the tip of his tongue had suddenly been uncovered, and it thus became more difficult to ignore. Under the stimulation of this pain, all of his absurd actions reappeared.Raising his eyes and looking over, he saw that the skin on Fang Juexia\u2019s Adams\u2019 apple was broken, and the wound was red and clearly visible.\u201cYou have a fever.\u201d Fang Juexia seemed to have known this would happen for a long time and didn\u2019t sound surprised. He raised his hand and tucked him into his quilt. \u201cDo you have any medicine here?\u201dPei Tingsong saw the light blue bruise on his wrist, as if it had been gripped tight. He shook his head and croaked out, \u201cNo.\u201dFang Juexia sat by the bed and stayed silent for a while, before suddenly remembering that he seemed to have prepared some ibuprofen beforehand. Because their events had kept them too busy these days, and the amount of sleep they got daily was only three or four hours, they often had headaches, so he always kept some with him.It could count as coming in handy now.Pei Tingsong watched Fang Juexia leave the room, reached out his hand to touch his lips, frowned, and thought about last night.He seemed to have been like a madman, and had kept entangling with Fang Juexia and talking at him\u2026But Fang Juexia got up in the morning like nothing had happened.Not long after, Fang Juexia came back with a cup of water and a pill in his hand. \u201cTake this, it\u2019ll bring your fever down.\u201d\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Pei Tingsong swallowed the pill and asked.\u201cHalf-past nine.\u201dPei Tingsong coughed. \u201cI still have to go to class.\u201d\u201cYou told me last night that you didn\u2019t want to go to class.\u201d Fang Juexia took his cellphone and said, \u201cIf it\u2019s not an important class, call to ask for leave\u00a0ba. You won\u2019t be able to get anything out of class if you go in such a state anyway.\u201dPei Tingsong thought for a bit and in the end, did as Fang Juexia said. He hadn\u2019t had a good rest for too long now, he had been constantly on edge the whole day yesterday, and then he had drunk alcohol and had been out in the cold last night, so it would be strange if he didn\u2019t fall apart.Fang Juexia hadn\u2019t looked at him this entire time, and therefore, Pei Tingsong also couldn\u2019t find a way to tell him that he was sorry. It seemed that if he laid bare this matter, Fang Juexia would just toss his hands up and leave immediately. He didn\u2019t know what the hell had been wrong with him yesterday, saying so much nonsense. It would\u2019ve been fine if he had just forgotten it, but he just had to go and remember it all.\u201cI\u2019ll go outside and lie down for a while. If you feel uncomfortable anywhere, call for me.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong stopped him, but he didn\u2019t know what to say after he stopped him.He felt that his drunken confession last night had been an utter messy failure, and that it would have been better if he had not confessed anything.Fang Juexia stopped and looked at him.Pei Tingsong held things in for a long time, and finally resigned himself to his own backwardness. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, you go\u00a0ba. The sofa is uncomfortable, and you can drive my car back to the dorm. The car key is in the second drawer of the porch cabinet.\u201dFang Juexia stood there for a while, thinking of the words Pei Tingsong had said when he had been drunk and lying on him last night while causing trouble. Those were all words he would never say when he was sober.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll just be outside.\u201dPei Tingsong retracted his body into the quilt and turned around. \u201cYou go back\u00a0ba. I can do it myself, I\u2019m 20 years old.\u201d These words sounded as if he were angry and thus acting rashly, but Pei Tingsong was serious.He heard Fang Juexia\u2019s footsteps move farther and farther away, and his heart sank down with this sound as he closed his eyes.If he ever drank again, he would start writing his name backwards from now on.Not long after he closed his eyes, the sound of footsteps actually came closer.Pei Tingsong wanted to look back, but he didn\u2019t do so until Fang Juexia pulled him over, laid him flat, and then put a folded and twisted wet towel on his forehead.\u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t have any work today, so if I went back, I would just sleep. Xiao Wen has gone with Lu Yuan to Changsha and can\u2019t take care of you,\u201d said Fang Juexia as he spread out the towel.Pei Tingsong closed his eyes and wanted to give up. \u201cI don\u2019t need your care, you go sleep. The sofa outside is uncomfortable, so I\u2019ll go outside, and you sleep here. Anyway, I can\u2019t sleep, and I\u2019m not sleepy at all.\u201dFang Juexia held him down. \u201cPei Tingsong.\u201dHe stopped.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you wanted to be friends with me?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s normal for friends to take care of each other.\u201d Fang Juexia took the towel off his forehead, put it into a container of water, soaked it in water, and wrung it dry again. \u201cUnderstood?\u201dSo he really had said that.Pei Tingsong was so humiliated, he didn\u2019t know where to put his face at this moment; he had never thought that he would become like that after drinking alcohol. Upon closing his eyes, he could feel the back of Fang Juexia\u2019s hand that was stuck to his cheek\u2014it was cool. Yes, that\u2019s right. He really wanted to be friends with Fang Juexia. He had already changed, and since a long time ago, he hadn\u2019t\u00a0worn those colored glasses\u00a0while looking at him. He was willing to get close to him, admire him, and admit to the charms of his personality.He wanted to break through the barriers and become friends with Fang Juexia.Obviously, this is what he thought, but Pei Tingsong\u2019s thoughts couldn\u2019t help straying back to the situation of the kiss from last night, remembering that soft touch that he had never felt before.Even the shudder of his heart when their lips and tongues had entangled roughly together.\u201cI\u2026 What else did I do?\u201d Pei Tingsong opened his eyes, looked at Fang Juexia and added with a guilty conscience, \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s face was calm. \u201cYou wanted me to praise you. I praised you; you\u2019re very smart and very powerful.\u201d Having said that, Fang Juexia looked at him seriously and replied, \u201cI\u2019m not just saying that, Pei Tingsong. You really are very outstanding, I\u2019m just not used to expressing myself to you.\u201d\u201cYou may have forgotten it, so I\u2019ll tell you what I said last night again. I accepted your apology last night, and I know it was sincere.\u201d He looked into Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes, his eyes frank and honest. \u201cI\u2019m also very sorry for the coldness and neglect I\u2019ve shown you in the past two years. I\u2019ll treat you like a friend in the future.\u201d He took Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand and shook it, the corners of his mouth slightly raised. \u201cThe cold war has officially ended. We will shake hands and make peace.\u201dPei Tingsong lowered his eyes and stared at the hand grasped in his. He let go of it very soon, so fast that his warmth didn\u2019t even have the time to be transferred over.Fang Juexia repeated his words from last night, telling him everything frankly and directly. He broke the ice while in this sober state very maturely.He just left out that kiss.Pei Tingsong should be rejoicing. However, his chest felt blocked up for no reason, and his heart was beating feebly; it was probably because of his illness. He was very uncomfortable, so very uncomfortable.A cold towel was applied to his forehead several times, and the water soon needed to be changed, so Fang Juexia picked it up and walked to the main bedroom. The more Pei Tingsong thought about it, the more the bad taste in his heart grew. He knew that it would be very embarrassing to lay bare the situation, but with Fang Juexia not talking about it at all, he just felt really bad.He had never kissed anyone, had never made out with anyone, and even this so-called first kiss had been not-very-seriously taken away by Fang Juexia.He had also never felt like this before, as if his heart had been grasped tightly by something.His cellphone vibrated. Pei Tingsong picked it up and saw a message from Ling Yi.[The Original M-Dash: Xiao Pei! Are you awake? I want to eat the chocolate you bought last time! That box in Strong Ge\u2019s car, I\u2019ve opened it\u00a0ah~]Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t even remember when he had bought chocolate, so he had to just deal with it.[Kaleido\u2019s Number One Big Boss: You take it\u00a0ba.]Just after pressing send, he thought of something again, so he tried to resist his feverish state and without much energy, typed out a whole bunch of words, then deleted them again. Finally, in just the few seconds left before Fang Juexia came back, he hurriedly clicked send and threw away his cellphone.As soon as Ling Yi tore open the package, his cellphone vibrated again.[Kaleido\u2019s Number One Big Boss: Let me ask you a question. I have a friend who wants to make friends with another person, so he told him that, and it was pretty good originally, but then he messed up and accidentally, it was really very accidentally, he kissed him briefly, just briefly. Then he was so flustered that he called me and asked me for advice. You know I\u2019ve never done such a stupid thing before, so how can I help him? Yi Ge, you\u2019re a social butterfly who knows everything, so I\u2019m helping him by asking you. Do you think they can still be friends?]Sitting in the car, Ling Yi kept chortling away without stopping. Cheng Qiang was startled. \u201cWhat crazy are you smoking? What\u2019s so funny?\u201d\u201cPei Tingsong, that\u00a0dummy, accidentally kissed a man! Isn\u2019t it funny? Hahahahahaha!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019m in a hurry to tell my friend something.]He poked him and really got a reply.[The Original M-Dash: They can be friends. Friends should just be warm and intimate, and even kissing some more would be fine, don\u2019t worry\u00a0ah.]Really?Pei Tingsong\u2019s current expression looked like the meme of the\u00a0old man in the subway\u00a0looking at his cellphone. Soon, Fang Juexia came in carrying a bowl of porridge and asked, \u201cWhy are you still not resting? Today is your only chance to rest. There is a press conference being held for a new endorsement tomorrow.\u201dAfter locking his cellphone, Pei Tingsong pretended that nothing had happened and tried to divert his attention. \u201cUm, your cellphone was just vibrating.\u201dFang Juexia let out an \u201cen\u201d and sat down beside the bed. It seemed that he didn\u2019t plan to look at his cellphone.He picked up the bowl of thick porridge and stirred it with a spoon, making the hot steam from it churn up into a cloud. The gap in the curtains allowed a vertical beam of sunlight into the room, which just fell perfectly on Fang Juexia\u2019s face. His dark brown hair shone with a gold luster, his fine pale skin grew more transparent, and the capillaries in his eyes contained just a touch of cyan, thus seeming like a thread twisting, thin and shallow, with their tail-end hooking onto his red birthmark.Pei Tingsong thought of that white eustoma. It had also been exactly like this\u2014with the sun peeling off its skin, those fresh veins being exposed through the snow-white wound.\u201cEat this while it\u2019s still hot.\u201d Fang Juexia handed the bowl to Pei Tingsong and looked up at him.Hurriedly turning his head away, Pei Tingsong almost reached for it, but suddenly felt that this scene was wrong. He remembered the idol dramas that Ling Yi watched in the car every time they were traveling to events. When the hero in those shows was ill, the heroine always fed them food spoonful after spoonful, without the hero having to move around at all.Seeing him act unruly, a tiny frown appeared on Fang Juexia\u2019s and he asked with a little doubt, \u201cDon\u2019t want to eat?\u201dPei Tingsong took a deep breath and then started coughing endlessly. He pulled out all of his acting skills, which surpassed the extent taught in idol school, and pretended to be weak. \u201cI can\u2019t lift my hands\u2026\u201dFang Juexia felt that was strange. \u201cIs your fever that bad?\u201d He placed the bowl on the bedside table and reached for Pei Tingsong\u2019s forehead.Pei Tingsong watched him put down the bowl, and felt that everything was deviating from his imagination, but he couldn\u2019t say anything at this point.He couldn\u2019t actually directly tell Fang Juexia\u2014\u2018If you feed me, I\u2019ll eat it\u00a0ba.\u2019\u201cLogically speaking, your fever should have gone down after taking medicine\u2026 and there\u2019s no thermometer here.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s eyebrows twisted, and he thought for a while before proposing, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we still go to the hospital\u00a0ba? You get up and put on some more clothes, and we\u2019ll go to the hospital.\u201dAh?\u201cNo need, no need, I\u2019m not going to the hospital.\u201d Pei Tingsong knew that his illness wasn\u2019t that serious. \u201cI\u2019m already this old, and it\u2019s just a cold, there\u2019s no need to go to the hospital.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter how old you are. Your forehead is completely sweaty.\u201d Fang Juexia wanted to drag him up from the bed, but Pei Tingsong was adamant about not going. \u201cI\u2019ll just have something to eat and sleep for a bit, and then I\u2019ll be fine. I really don\u2019t have to go to the hospital.\u201dAfter hearing him say this, Fang Juexia had no other options. Thinking about it, he even felt a little guilty; if he hadn\u2019t just wrapped him in a bath towel yesterday, and had made him put on all his clothes properly, perhaps Pei Tingsong wouldn\u2019t have gone as far as falling ill.\u201cThen you\u2019d still better eat some of this. Although it doesn\u2019t really taste like anything, there\u2019s nothing else in your apartment besides rice.\u201d Fang Juexia stirred the porridge, scooped up a spoonful, and stretched it over towards his mouth. He reflexively continued, \u201cNext time\u2026\u201dHalfway through speaking, Fang Juexia suddenly paused and stopped talking. Even the hand that was stretching the spoon over to the corner of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth stopped.Next time? What next time? It couldn\u2019t be that he really wanted to cook for Pei Tingsong again?Pei Tingsong saw him pause and stop talking, and deliberately prompted him, \u201cWhat about next time? Will you cook something delicious for me next time? Last time, auntie even asked you to make fried rice for me.\u201d The porridge had even been sent right next to his mouth, and Pei Tingsong drew closer to it as soon as he finished talking. However, who would have known that in the next moment, the cellphone that Fang Juexia had abandoned to the side would begin to ring endlessly.\u201cWho\u2019s calling me\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia said to himself as he put the bowl down and went around to the other side of the bed to pick up the cellphone.There had been only one millimeter left before he could have swallowed the porridge. Pei Tingsong was so angry that he propped himself up directly and then helped himself to two big mouthfuls of it.Realizing that he\u2014Pei Tingsong,\u00a0all-powerful\u00a0for 20 years, a devil incarnate who feared neither the heavens nor the earth\u2014had been playing at a push-and-pull game with a bowl of porridge for such a long time, he really felt like he had to die laughing.\u201cAwake?\u201d Fang Juexia stood by the side of the bed as he took the call. His facial expression seemed to change, and his voice grew much lower. \u201c\u2026If grandfather woke up, that\u2019s good. I\u2019ll just\u2026 I won\u2019t go\u00a0ba, so to avoid that upon seeing me, he\u2019ll again\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong looked at him and kept feeling that this person had worries weighing on his mind.\u201cEn.\u201d Fang Juexia bowed his head as he spoke, \u201cI\u2019m also very busy now, and I can\u2019t head over there. Mom, take good care of him. Tomorrow? There\u2019s work tomorrow too\u2026\u201dHe was silent for a while before finally hanging up. With his back to Pei Tingsong, he sat by the bed, and then remembered that his phone had been vibrating because of messages, so he bowed his head to check them. Originally, there really had been many WeChat messages appearing on the lock screen interface, but as soon as he clicked on one of them, they all disappeared, leaving behind only an announcement saying that the group chat had suddenly been deleted.\u201cWhy did they suddenly delete it\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong clenched his fist and coughed. He asked in a hoarse voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s been deleted?\u201d\u201cA group chat.\u201d Remembering that this group chat did not contain Pei Tingsong, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t intend to say anymore, lest he find out that his group members had secretly created a group chat behind his back, and grow more angry at that. \u201cNothing really.\u201d\u201cThere is something\u00a0ba?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked tentatively, \u201cAuntie was the one who called you just now?\u201dFang Juexia nodded, but didn\u2019t say anything more.Pei Tingsong remembered that Fang Juexia\u2019s mother had come to Beijing last time because of his grandfather\u2019s illness. Listening to the phone call from just now, it seemed that it was still about that. He sort of knew about the situation, but he didn\u2019t know any specific details about what had happened. However, Fang Juexia\u2019s expression just now seemed to be very sad.Due to the environment he had grown up in, Pei Tingsong wasn\u2019t used to expressing his thoughts euphemistically at all. He just went straight to the point and did what he wanted. However, he also knew that Fang Juexia was a person who didn\u2019t want others to interfere in his private affairs; he hadn\u2019t even bothered to explain the situation concerning the hidden rules issue ever before.Fang Juexia looked at the porridge that had been touched. \u201cEat some more? You can only get better quickly by eating.\u201dUnexpectedly, Pei Tingsong grew so uncomfortable that he dropped his own body askew right next to Fang Juexia\u2019s hand, and his voice sounded so weak that it felt like it could start floating up. \u201cSo uncomfortable\u00a0ah, Fang Juexia\u2026 I hurt as soon as I swallow, and all my bones hurt, all over my body.\u201d\u201cHow is it so serious?\u201d Fang Juexia frowned, reached out and touched his face, then touched the back of his neck. All of these spots were really hot. \u201cThen what should we do?\u201dPei Tingsong looked as if he was about to ascend to the heavens. \u201cI think I\u2019d better go to the hospital\u00a0ba\u2026\u201dLooking at Pei Tingsong\u2019s sickly appearance, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t even dare to say anything harsh. \u201cJust now when I said we should go to the hospital, you refused to go. Now you feel worse\u00a0ba?\u201d He sighed, got up, and opened the wardrobe while asking, \u201cDo you have a turtleneck, lend me one.\u201d\u201cAh? There are some\u00a0ba\u2026 You can look for it.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t think too much about it. As soon as he did, he would end up recalling his own animal behavior of biting Fang Juexia\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple.Fang Juexia, with his back to him, rummaged through the wardrobe piece by piece before finding a dark green turtleneck sweater and taking it out. He was only thinking about covering up the wound, and he didn\u2019t have the time to care about anything else, so he just crisply and decisively took off his pajama top.At this time, Pei Tingsong, who was lying on the bed and pretending to be dead, looked up. He had just wanted to see which turtleneck Fang Juexia had chosen, but he hadn\u2019t expected a spotless, pale body to collide with his eyes. As Fang Juexia moved to pull the sweater on, his back muscles pulled at the lines of the back of his waist, looking just like a piece of flowing glaze porcelain.The mirror in the wardrobe reflected Fang Juexia\u2019s thin waist. His abdominal muscles weren\u2019t lumps, but were instead smooth and flat marks that looked like the character \u5ddd\u2014pliable, tough, and pale.His head flew as he turned his eyes away quickly.How could there be a man with such a thin waist?\u201cI\u2019m wearing this one.\u201d Fang Juexia turned around, pulling at the too big clothes, and looked into his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s fine\u00a0ba?\u201dPei Tingsong raised his eyes and let out an \u201cen.\u201dFang Juexia hadn\u2019t expected to hear any good words from him anyway. He picked up his pajamas and was ready to go change his pants, after which he would take him to see a doctor. \u201cAfter I go back\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give it to you.\u201dHe stopped and heard Pei Tingsong say from behind him, \u201cIt looks really good on you.\u201dFang Juexia turned to look at him, but Pei Tingsong turned his back to him and added, \u201cI bought it myself.\u201dHe was always so strange. Fang Juexia told himself to learn to get used to it. Pei Tingsong was just different from other boys, so he didn\u2019t refuse him immediately or say anything like \u2018no need, I will return it to you.\u2019\u201cYou also need to change your clothes quickly. If you really don\u2019t feel comfortable and don\u2019t want to change, just put on a thicker sweater and wrap yourself up in a thick coat.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Pei Tingsong sat up. His pale face currently carried a stubborn expression that declared that he would never concede. \u201cCool guys can\u2019t just casually wear anything when going out.\u201dFang Juexia finally started laughing from amusement. \u201cAlright, cool guy.\u201dAfter hastily tidying up, Fang Juexia, regardless of Pei Tingsong\u2019s strong opposition, wrapped him up in a huge cotton-padded coat. Pei Tingsong was originally tall, and now, he had on a huge cotton-padded coat.\u201cI look like a wall.\u201dHe really deserves to be studying literature\u2014 thought Fang Juexia as he sighed in his heart. This metaphor was superb.\u201cIt\u2019s windy outside, so it\u2019s good to wear more.\u201d Fang Juexia helped him into the car and went around to the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cFasten your seat belt.\u201dHe opened up the GPS on his phone and said to himself, \u201cLet me see first, where is the nearest hospital\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, wait.\u201d Pei Tingsong pulled his cellphone away from him and pulled his mask down. \u201cNone of the hospitals nearby are good, and there are also so many people there. I don\u2019t want to be photographed. You drive out first, drive out.\u201dFang Juexia looked at him, reasoned that the sick person was the most important, and so he did as he said, driving out of their little neighborhood and getting onto the road.\u201cThen where do you want to go?\u201dPei Tingsong let out a very long \u201cen\u201d, with his eyes shifting around and around, and his whole person shrank into his king size cotton-padded coat. Finally, he cleared his throat and said in a super small voice, \u201cI want to go to the hospital your grandfather is being treated at\u2026\u201dFang Juexia suddenly stopped the car, parking at the side of the road, looked at him, and said nothing.Pei Tingsong hurriedly tunneled out of his cotton-padded coat and explained anxiously, \u201cNo, um, you see, your grandfather came all the way to Beijing to see a doctor, then the hospital he chose must be very good, right? I\u2026\u201d\u201cSo this is why you suddenly wanted to see a doctor.\u201d Fang Juexia took a deep breath, and the sunlight outside the car window made him squint his eyes. \u201cYou actually don\u2019t feel that bad.\u201d\u201cI feel bad!\u201d Pei Tingsong took Fang Juexia\u2019s hand and put it on his head. \u201cYou feel that, it\u2019s still hot. I really feel bad.\u201d His words were filled with such urgency that he choked and started to cough violently and endlessly. He coughed untill it felt that his lungs would almost fall out, but he still didn\u2019t let go of his hand.Fang Juexia had a cold face, but also possessed a soft heart. Seeing Pei Tingsong cough to this extent, he knew that this person definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to endure work tomorrow. He pulled his hand away, unscrewed the thermos cup he had brought for him, handed it to him, and started the car again. \u201cThere will be no next time.\u201dAfter taking the cup filled with water, Pei Tingsong, who had coughed until his face turned red, drank some of it. He breathed a bit and then thought that his choking was too timely.The hospital that Fang Juexia\u2019s grandfather was staying at wasn\u2019t too far from here, only about a 20 minute drive away. Pei Tingsong was feeling really uncomfortable. It wasn\u2019t as exaggerated as he had been acting it to be, but he did still have a fever. As soon as the car started, he fell asleep with his head tilted down.Even in such a short while, he had a dream.In his dream, he was back to his childhood days, and was pushing his grandfather\u2019s wheelchair to bask in the sun in the small garden. They read quietly together, and the ivy had already grown green for an entire spring and was about to climb into the back window of his room.Then, he suddenly heard someone call out for him. The sunshine in his dream was cut into big pieces by a soft knife, the scene in his field of vision being cut into a bunch of broken shapes. He couldn\u2019t see the person who had entered clearly, but he just felt that the voice was familiar, clear and cold, while also revealing a hint of soft warmth.He woke up. As soon as he opened his eyes, he saw the owner of that voice from his dream.\u201cWear your mask securely.\u201d Fang Juexia helped him put on his coat, zipped it all the way to the top, and secured his hat. A slightly cool hand extended to the side of his face, the back of the hand then stuck to his cheek to confirm his temperature.\u201cWe arrived so soon.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice had become even hoarser. Having just woken up, his whole person felt a bit top-heavy. Even then, he didn\u2019t let Fang Juexia help him up, as if afraid that the other would laugh at him. \u201cI can walk by myself.\u201dFang Juexia looked at him, seeming to see a crumbling wall in front of him, and he couldn\u2019t help laughing.Pei Tingsong looked around and drew closer to Fang Juexia. \u201cIs this the hospital where your grandfather is?\u201dFang Juexia nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s go register\u00a0ba.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cHey, wait.\u201d Pei Tingsong grabbed his arm. \u201cYou go see your grandfather, it\u2019s fine if I register myself alone.\u201dFang Juexia stared at him and didn\u2019t speak. Pei Tingsong said again, \u201cReally, I really can go see a doctor by myself. You go quickly\u00a0ba. Will he be in the inpatient department?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go register.\u201d\u201cWhy are you acting as a person turning a deaf ear right now? Am I not speaking Chinese?\u201d Pei Tingsong caught him and asked, \u201cWe already came here, so you\u2019re not really not going to go\u00a0ba?\u201dPeople were coming and going around them, and Fang Juexia was reluctant to attract any notice towards them. He could only drag Pei Tingsong to a place where there were fewer people, then looked into his eyes and said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to see me, do you understand what I mean?\u201d The early spring wind had scattered Fang Juexia\u2019s bangs across his forehead, revealing the red birthmark at the corner of his eyes.Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t expect it to be like this, but Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes were plainly soft, just like water.He helped Fang Juexia by pressing down on the brim of his hat to cover his most recognizable mark.\u201cI don\u2019t know if he wants to see you or not, but I know that you want to see him.\u201dFang Juexia just looked at him, the water in his eyes trembling, then suddenly turned his head. The magnolia flowers in the hospital were blooming, cold and white as a pile of snow, but when the spring breeze blew, their stems seemed to soften, trembling with thoughts.Finally, he was still dragged to the inpatient department by Pei Tingsong. Based on the room number his mama had sent to his cellphone a long time ago, the two people finally found the exact location. Before, he had sent a lot of money to his mama, and had used his connections with a college classmate to have his grandfather admitted to this private hospital. He had even wanted him to live in the VIP ward, but it didn\u2019t seem to have worked. This was just a very ordinary single room, with a big bright window, from which some swaying magnolia flowers could be seen outside.On the bed lay an old man with his head tilted down, as if he had fallen asleep. Fang Juexia\u2019s mother gently took off the bifocals lying on the bridge of his nose and then took away his newspaper.Having been tossed around for a long time, Pei Tingsong was now sweating all over. He looked at the situation inside the room through the small window on the door of the room, then turned his head to glance at Fang Juexia\u2019s expression. Seeing that this person\u2019s posture was that of someone who wanted to desert the area in the face of danger, he immediately pushed the door to the room open. His two hands then grasped firmly onto Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulders, and he pushed him forward.Fang Juexia\u2019s mother raised her head and was stunned. She suddenly saw her son appear at the door, and then also saw Xiao Pei, whom she hadn\u2019t seen for a long time, tilt his head and smile at her as he mouthed out \u2018auntie.\u2019A surprise within a surprise.With the situation having come to a head, Fang Juexia could only grit his teeth and walk in. He smiled at his mother, then stood at the side of the bed, looking at his sleeping grandfather.His color looked pretty good, and there was a thin tube in his nostril, with a rising and falling chest, and also this slight snore.Fang Juexia looked at his mother and asked in a low voice, \u201cWas the operation successful?\u201dHis mother nodded. \u201cIt was very good, and he just said he wanted to eat an apple. I didn\u2019t even have time to cut it before he fell asleep while reading the newspaper.\u201dPei Tingsong followed Fang Juexia\u2019s example of sitting down and ran to sit beside Mama Fang. Mama Fang looked at him and asked, \u201cWhy are you wearing so much, you even have sweat on your forehead. Are you sick?\u201dPei Tingsong nodded and answered, \u201cI have a cold.\u201d Saying that, he put on his mask and only showed a pair of smiling eyes.From outside the window, the shadow of the magnolia tree could be seen reflected on his grandfather\u2019s bed, light and shadow dancing about. Fang Juexia just sat like that quietly, looking at his grandfather without saying a word. The scenario right now was already better than what he had expected. He could visit him so quietly, and his grandfather wouldn\u2019t drive him away in a fit of temper.Calculating it through, he had already not seen his grandfather for more than a year. The person sleeping in front of him seemed to have gotten a lot older, with his hair growing gray, and even his eyebrows now contained spots of white. Fang Juexia had never even imagined that this person would gradually grow older. In his memory, this person always seemed to stand upright, solemn and serious. No matter where he stood, it always seemed that he was standing on a three\u00a0chi\u00a0platform.He picked up the apple and the fruit knife by the bed and began to peel the apple. The sharp blade embedded into the apple\u2019s flesh as it spun forward bit by bit, while the red skin curled down bit by bit, looking like a slide that he had gone on as a child.There was a children\u2019s playground in his grandfather\u2019s little neighborhood, which had a red slide. As a child, he would only go there during the winter and summer holidays, and his grandfather would never let him go on the slide, nor would he let him lie by the windowsill to watch. He always said that if Fang Juexia broke his leg that way, there would be a world shaking scene to fight through back home.Only if he obediently finished a set of Mathematical Olympiad papers would his grandfather lead him outside with a straight face and play with him for half an hour on the slide. However, he wouldn\u2019t crouch down to catch him like other parents, he would instead always stand with his hands behind his back, watching him climb up and then slide down happily again and again.Half an hour\u2014no more, no less. When the time ran out, his grandfather would leave the playground.Tiny little Fang Juexia would slide down the slide and run after his grandfather\u2019s back. He would stumble forward until he could reach out and hook onto Grandfather\u2019s\u00a0 fingers. Then he would pant as his steps slowed down and go home with him.The apple peel had fallen across his entire knee, so Fang Juexia picked it up along with the whole apple and set it on the table. He got up to pour a glass of water for him and then went to Pei Tingsong, interrupting the mouthed conversation he was currently having with his own mama.\u201cGoing now.\u201d\u201cSo fast?\u201d Pei Tingsong took a look at Mama Fang. The other party already seemed fully satisfied and content, with a smile on her face, \u201cGo\u00a0ba.\u201d Mama Fang raised her head and told Fang Juexia, \u201cGood boy, you take Xiao Pei to get an infusion.\u201dFang Juexia nodded and didn\u2019t say much in return, simply pulling Pei Tingsong out of the room. He was silent the whole way\u2014registering him, leading him to see a doctor, and then taking him to get an infusion. The private hospital had a good environment, with fewer people here on a weekday than they had thought. They found an infusion room without any people in it and sat there as the IV dripped.Even after getting tossed around all morning, Pei Tingsong\u00a0 remained energetic before his mission was fulfilled. However, as soon as he came out of the inpatient ward, his symptoms grew much worse. He was dizzy, and his eyes grew blurry. When the nurse was using a needle to insert the IV, he glanced at it and felt that that one needle had turned into ten.\u201cIt\u2019ll be better after the infusion.\u201d Fang Juexia sat next to him and patted him on the back whenever he coughed.Pei Tingsong leaned against the back of the chair, looked at the transparent liquid medicine in the IV, and then turned to look at him. \u201cI want to eat apples, too.\u201dFang Juexia blinked. \u201cYet, you didn\u2019t say anything just now.\u201dTheir gazes held for ten seconds, then Pei Tingsong laughed. \u201cI\u2019m deceiving you, I don\u2019t want to eat it.\u201d He touched his throat with the hand that wasn\u2019t connected to the IV drip. \u201cMy throat hurts.\u201dThis action reminded Fang Juexia of his own throat, so he pulled at the collar of his sweater, looked down at the tip of his shoes, then glanced at Pei Tingsong\u2019s long legs, which were acting strangely, constantly being drawn in, then stretched out.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong finally opened his mouth, his voice in a rare state of uncertainty. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m being a busybody?\u201dFang Juexia unscrewed the thermos cup, drank some water, and then tightened it again. The warm water flowed down his irritated throat and warmed his whole body. Speaking truthfully, after seeing his grandfather lying on the hospital bed safe and sound, it seemed that the big stone that had been pressing down on his heart for a long time had finally been removed.Pei Tingsong was very eccentric. He didn\u2019t know much about the saying of \u2018not inquiring much into the affairs of people\u2019, and he neither understood nor cared about following such social etiquette. In any case, whatever Pei Tingsong wanted to do must succeed, and he was also the complete opposite of himself.But, to some extent, Fang Juexia was a little grateful. Grateful that Pei Tingsong had tried his best to build a step and had dragged him down to meet the person he wanted to see.He did not reply to Pei Tingsong\u2019s question from just now, but just looked at the white wall in front of him as he opened his mouth\u2014\u201cMy grandfather is a very conservative person. My grandmother passed away before I was born, and my mom is his only child.\u201dPei Tingsong was a little surprised. He hadn\u2019t expected Fang Juexia to actually tell him about his family.\u201cMy mom had never left him before she went to university. Later, she went to Guangzhou for college and met my\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia hesitated before speaking, \u201cMy father. Grandfather didn\u2019t allow them to be together, he felt that a dancer like my dad was very unreliable, and he didn\u2019t want my mom to leave him and go so far south. They had a big fight, and then my mom secretly got on a train, left Shandong, and got a marriage license with my dad.\u201dPei Tingsong listened quietly. With his background, it was a bit difficult for him to understand this kind of domestic conflict between two generations, but the elopement seemed to be a very romantic thing to him.But romance often came at a price.\u201cUntil I was born, my mom didn\u2019t go back. At first, he didn\u2019t want to see us. My mom told me that she stood at the door and kept calling and calling, but he wouldn\u2019t\u00a0 answer any of the calls and wouldn\u2019t open the door. Later, when I grew up a bit, he seemed to compromise a little. When I went back, he was willing to see me and even tidied up a small room for me. Occasionally, he would help me with my lessons.\u201d Fang Juexia lowered his head as he continued speaking very slowly and in a very low voice, \u201cMy grandfather is a math teacher and has taught all his life. He said I was smarter than my mom, sensitive to numbers, and a good sprout.\u201dThe story seemed to be developing in a better direction, but the sense of loss in Fang Juexia\u2019s voice couldn\u2019t be hidden.\u201cAnd then?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked.Fang Juexia drew in a breath. \u201cThen it was just me and my mom. Grandfather wanted us to come back to stay with him. But\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong watched his profile.\u201cBut I also liked dancing, I wanted to dance, so I stayed in Guangzhou to learn dance.\u201d\u201cHe was very disappointed. I was the same kind of person as my dad.\u201dIt was these simple and condensed words that allowed Pei Tingsong to see the miniature of Fang Juexia\u2019s childhood. He seemed to have thousands upon thousands of words in his heart, but these thousands upon thousands of words were all stuck in his throat, and he couldn\u2019t utter any of them.\u201cYou want to eat an apple?\u201d Fang Juexia got up, seemingly ready to go out. \u201cI\u2019ll go buy some for you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to eat that.\u201d Pei Tingsong grabbed his arm, ensuring that he couldn\u2019t leave. \u201cI said I was joking.\u201d\u201cOkay\u00a0ba.\u201d Fang Juexia sat back and looked at that white wall.Suddenly, he was hugged by Pei Tingsong. Crossing across his vision was the transparent IV tube that had gotten involved, and Pei Tingsong\u2019s arms were looped around his neck, embracing him.\u201cI feel so bad\u2026\u201d He had a sore throat, but his tone was soft as he said, \u201cLend me a hug.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s head shrank into the hollows of Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder. He was like a big sick dog right now, rubbing against him while holding him tightly. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t have the heart to push him away, so he convinced himself in his heart that if they were friends, hugging for a bit was very normal\u00a0ba.The little clock in his heart ticked by, matching with the drops of water that dripped down the IV. Drop by drop, they slid into his heart, tickling a bit\u2014just like a drop of morning dew gathered on the tip of a leaf after the spring rain, falling neatly onto his shoulder.\u201cFang Juexia.\u201d The silence lasted for a minute and a half, after which Pei Tingsong once again broke it with his voice.Fang Juexia set his own head on top of his head as a response, and while he was at it, also waited for his follow-up. In this bone-to-bone intimacy, Pei Tingsong stuck close to him, and in that warm voice that appeared after a low fever, said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you won\u2019t have any emotions when dealing with people you don\u2019t care about? There\u2019s always a basis for a temper like that. Your grandfather must be the same as you.\u201dAs he spoke, the warm air from his breath sprayed against the side of Fang Juexia\u2019s neck, carefully moistening the soft sweater.\u201cIt\u2019s because he loves you that he\u2019s sulking at you.\u201dFang Juexia was a little stunned, and the length of the second ticking in the little clock in his heart dragged longer, doubling, or even quadrupling in length at the moment.\u201cAnd you\u2019re not wrong, you\u2019re not wasting your talent at all\u2026\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s mind was in a whirl, as if he were the one who was sick. Every word being transmitted over from Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth\u00a0 left a lengthy shock.\u201cYou just belong on the stage.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The staff tested it several times, and didn\u2019t find any problems with it, so after getting the transfusion in the hospital, Fang Juexia led Pei Tingsong back to the dormitory and let him go back to his room to have a rest.The other people hadn\u2019t returned yet, so it was very quiet. Under the dual effects of the medicine and sheer fatigue, Pei Tingsong basically fell asleep just as his head touched the pillow. Fang Juexia left the bedroom after gently closing the door to the room, and went to the kitchen. He opened the refrigerator and looked into it, but didn\u2019t find what he wanted there.Wearing a hat and mask, he went downstairs, going towards the nearest supermarket. It was getting dark, and there were many pedestrians on the road, who were heading home as the sunset on their backs. Since their debut, their state of \u2018no one really being curious about them\u2019 had made it so that everyone in their group was used to going out to handle matters by themselves. Whether it was shopping or studying, none of these would attract much attention. Their lives weren\u2019t like the celebrity lifestyle in people\u2019s imaginations, and this lack of attention gave them certain freedom.Fang Juexia had, long before, created a list of things to buy in his heart, and thus went straight after his goal after he entered. He was a person who didn\u2019t visit the supermarket a lot, and he would plan everything out in his mind, assigning priorities in order to save time and energy to the greatest possible extent.While picking out snow pears, he received a message from his mama. Fang Juexia took out his cellphone and glanced at it.[Mama: Your grandfather woke up, and I told him you came to see him. He then asked why we didn\u2019t eat dinner together before you left. Your work is hard, so you need to eat well, understand?]Fang Juexia looked at these words. He could almost see the scene in front of his eyes, of what happened after his grandfather woke up. It probably hadn\u2019t been as mild as his mama had said.Maybe it had been more like\u2014 [Completely thoughtless, not even knowing to leave only after the adult wakes up, and then not even staying for dinner. I think the more he lives, the more he progresses backwards].But the gist of it was probably good\u00a0ba. He couldn\u2019t help thinking of what Pei Tingsong had said to him when he had been attached to the IV. His hand, that had been about to reply to the message, paused, and after that, he directly called her.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Mama Fang obviously didn\u2019t expect him to call her. \u201cIt\u2019s good you\u2019re busy\u00a0la,\u00a0you don\u2019t have to call back.\u201dFang Juexia stood in the snow pear section, surrounded by fruits of all sizes. \u201cI\u2019m in the supermarket right now. Mom, I wanted to ask you, when making tong sui, how do you pick the rock sugar for it\u00a0ah\u2026\u201dAfter shopping, he pushed his cart and came to a stand in front of the checkout counter, and started taking out all of the things in the shopping cart one by one.\u201cDo you need a shopping bag?\u201d The cashier was a young girl.Fang Juexia straightened up. \u201cNo need, I brought shopping bags.\u201d After saying that, he shook out the shopping bag that had been folded into a small square. Maybe it was that the appearance of a 1.8-meter-old handsome Ge with a shopping bag was really a bit funny and bewildering, for the cashier girl couldn\u2019t help but start laughing, while also\u00a0 at the same time, looking at him more closely.Just by looking a bit more closely, she recognized him.\u201cEh?\u201d The young girl\u2019s voice was full of surprise as she exclaimed, \u201cYou\u2019re Juexia Gege?!\u201dFang Juexia reflexively touched the birthmark at the corner of his eye with his hand, and sure enough, it wasn\u2019t completely covered up. He wasn\u2019t good at dealing with this kind of situation, where he had been recognized, so he could only smile, with his eyes that were revealed above the mask curving slightly.\u201cAh, it\u2019s really you!\u201d The young girl was so excited that she forgot to scan the items. She sighed emotionally at this face so close to her. \u201cSo good-looking\u00a0ah\u2026 By the way, Gege, you got on the Hot Search list today! I didn\u2019t expect I would also bump into you! I\u2019m so happy, this is the happiest day I\u2019ve had since I started working!\u201d\u201cHot Search list?\u201d Fang Juexia didn\u2019t understand her.\u201cYes\u00a0ah. Some netizens bumped into you and Xiao Pei when they went to a hospital to see a doctor, I saw this while just surfing the web around noon. I didn\u2019t believe it at first, but in the picture, you were wearing the same clothes you\u2019re wearing now, so it turns out it is true!\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t expect that just him and Pei Tingsong visiting the doctor would warrant getting photographed and then forwarded around on Weibo. Had they already reached this level of fame now?\u201cAre you guys sick? Are you alright?\u201dFang Juexia shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s just a cold, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cGege, you have a really beautiful voice!\u201dFang Juexia wasn\u2019t really used to meeting such enthusiastic fans when he went out, and all he could do was thank her constantly before returning to the dormitory with the things he had bought. When he opened the door, he heard some movement. He thought that Pei Tingsong had woken up, but didn\u2019t expect that it was Jiang Miao instead.\u201cYou\u2019re back?\u201d Jiang Miao was busy in the kitchen. \u201cHeard that Xiao Pei fell sick, so when Yiyi and I were on our way back, we bought some takeout for dinner, along with some pork rib soup. They\u2019re all very light dishes, and you haven\u2019t eaten either\u00a0ba.\u201c\u201cNo wonder it smells so good.\u201d Fang Juexia changed his shoes and went over to put his shopping bag down. \u201cI just went out to buy some stuff, and originally I was just planning to randomly make something when I got back.\u201dLing Yi, wearing slippers, came out of the bedroom with a bag of Lonely God Potato Twists in his hand. \u201cHow long has the little devil been sleeping?\u201dFang Juexia calculated and said, \u201cTwo hours.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go get him up for dinner!\u201dFang Juexia helped the captain dish out the food and set the table. He then sat down, took off his hat, and tasted the soup. It tasted fresh and smooth, with a tiny hint of the lotus root\u2019s sweet aftertaste.\u201cYou guys got on the Hot Search list today.\u201d Jiang Miao sat down and asked, \u201cDid you know?\u201dHe had almost forgotten about that.Fang Juexia took out his cellphone and logged into Weibo while telling Jiang Miao about how he had just been recognized at the supermarket. It had been a long time since he had redownloaded the Weibo app, but Fang Juexia pretty much hardly ever opened it. He had already formed the habit of not really using social networks.As soon as he logged in, the countless comments and private messages froze his phone again, and it took a long time before he could browse through them. After he clicked on the Hot Search list, he found that number 10 was #Accidentally met Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia#, and upon clicking on that, he came to the Weibo discussion that that cashier fan had been talking about.[@Exploding with luck little cutie: Quickly click on this and someone come and tell me, are these Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia? They are\u00a0ba!\u00a0Their real persons are super tall and super hot, but I dare not go forward. I feel like it\u2019s a little bad to do so in a hospital. But they\u2019re really so, so good-looking\u00a0ah,\u00a0both of them are so handsome!]There were several pictures below this, which included photos of them lining up to register together, and even photos of them standing outside the hospital. Most of them featured their backs or their side profiles, and they were a bit blurred, but the comments below the post had already exceeded 10,000.[@Super Flawless Jeweled Xerophyte: It\u2019s my fresh Juexia Gege!

As soon as he turned his head, he saw the small and weak Ling Yi piggybacking Pei Tingsong, who was akin to a mountain, and moving step-by-step out of the bedroom. He couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cWhat are you guys playing at?\u00a0Zhu Bajie\u00a0carrying his wife on his back?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a giant baby wife like him!\u201d Ling Yi was so tired that he was panting. Fang Juexia put down his cellphone and was ready to go over to help his poor roommate, but as soon as he went over, Pei Tingsong gave up on playing this boring game and stood up. Instead, Fang Juexia, who now had no chance to help, just touched his forehead.\u201cNo fever now.\u201d Fang Juexia was finally at ease.After having slept, Pei Tingsong\u2019s whole person had relaxed a lot. He wasn\u2019t as drowsy as he had been during the day, and now sported only a sore throat, which made speaking uncomfortable. \u201cHaven\u2019t had a fever since a long time ago.\u201dJiang Miao greeted him and said, \u201cQuickly come and have something to eat. This is from a very famous restaurant recommended by Ling Yi, try it.\u201dPei Tingsong sat down next to Fang Juexia. He discovered that he didn\u2019t have a spoon, but he was also too lazy to get up and get one. So, he pretended not to know what was going on and picked up Fang Juexia\u2019s spoon, which was hooked upside down on his plate, and then scooped a mouthful of soup into his mouth.\u201cThat\u2019s mine.\u201d Fang Juexia certainly wasn\u2019t that easy to fool.Pei Tingsong glanced at him. \u201cI\u2019m just going to use it. I\u2019m the sick person after all.\u201dFang Juexia had been dealing with this all day, so he really had nothing to say. That coquettish act he had put on during the day really was the secondary personality of this brat.Ling Yi lowered his voice to imitate Pei Tingsong. After imitating his words, he held his stomach and began to laugh. \u201cHe was already a subwoofer, but after catching a cold, his voice has turned into that of a broken gong. I\u2019m going to die of laughter. Pei Tingsong, you sound like my grandfather right now!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a grandson like you!\u201dDuring the meal, Ling Yi and Jiang Miao talked about what had happened during the filming of their program. Ling Yi was very good at describing things, and no matter what it was, as long as he expressed it, it would be really funny. Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help laughing. However, Pei Tingsong was still ill, and as soon as he laughed, he also started coughing, coughing so badly that his face turned red.Fang Juexia looked over at him, feeling a strange heartache, and instinctively wanted to pat him on the back, but he was also afraid of being teased by Ling Yi, so he ended up holding himself back. However, who could have known that while Pei Tingsong was coughing to death, he would catch Fang Juexia\u2019s wrist and place it on his back, while motioning to indicate that he wanted him to pat him on the back.\u201cWho else is like you hahahahaha!\u201d\u201cJuexia is like a handyman.\u201dNearly done coughing, Pei Tingsong took a deep breath and turned to smile at Fang Juexia.\u201cAs a Gege, you have to be more conscientious.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t know why, but he suddenly recalled the photo he had accidentally seen in Pei Tingsong\u2019s apartment. The face of that carefree child in the picture coincided with the face in front of him now.Very intriguing.The next day\u2019s event was starting at noon, and so, time was a little tight. Even before dawn, Cheng Qiang ran to the dormitory to act as a human alarm clock. He didn\u2019t even need to think about it to know that all of these people must still be sleeping, especially He Ziyan and Lu Yuan, both of whom had only gotten back to the dorm in the early hours of the morning, and Pei Tingsong, who was sick.However, to his surprise, he found that Fang Juexia had actually already gotten up, and not just recently. He was wearing morning running clothes and was standing near the kitchen counter.\u201cDon\u2019t make breakfast, Juexia. I\u2019ll get Xiao Wen to buy it for you guys.\u201d Cheng Qiang then hurried to wake up the others, leaving behind Fang Juexia\u2019s tardy response, \u201cI\u2019m not actually making breakfast\u2026\u201dCheng Qiang, with his old mother\u2019s heart, urged the several big boys to get up and tidy up. He then hurried them over to the van like he was herding ducks. Xiao Wen, who was already seated inside the car, handed the purchased breakfast to Jiang Miao. \u201cSplit it, and eat some more. Later on, you guys might not get time to eat.\u201d\u201cI want meat baozi!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this bok choy baozi\u00a0ba? Haven\u2019t you woken up, there are green leaves all over it.\u201d\u201cGive me a cup of soybean milk,\u00a0please.\u201dUpon seeing Pei Tingsong reach out his hand, Fang Juexia intercepted the soybean milk Jiang Miao was about to hand to him and put it beside his own seat. Pei Tingsong had on a bewildered expression; he wanted to speak, but his throat was uncomfortable. He was also very muddled from sleep, so he simply widened his eyes and looked at this soybean milk\u00a0thief, who didn\u2019t have a red face and whose heart wasn\u2019t beating any faster.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t speak. He quietly took out a thermos from the bag at his feet and stuffed it into Pei Tingsong\u2019s hands. Then, he bent at the waist, looked around for awhile, and finally pulled out the utensil box that had been hidden in the innermost location of the bag, took off its lid, took out a spoon, and handed it to him.Upon suddenly grasping a small jar in his arms, Pei Tingsong\u2019s brain short-circuited for a bit, but he still unscrewed the lid, and a fresh and sweet aroma wafted up to his face. He scooped at its contents with the spoon. The early morning sunlight entered through a gap in the car window and shone on the winter pear in the spoon, making it glitter and look translucent, just like rock candy.Pei Tingsong turned to look at him. He didn\u2019t know why, but he automatically switched to mouthing the words. \u201cFor me?\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s pale pupils drifted to the side, and he pursed his lips, not saying anything. He picked up the soybean milk that he had snatched, which was the first time in his life he had done so, held the straw, stabbed it in, and brought it to his mouth.That means it\u2019s for me!\u00a0A small white flower bloomed in Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart, with flower buds swaying under the spring sunlight.He had never eaten the tong sui made by Fang Juexia before, not even once. He had only heard of it from his other bandmates before. At that time, he had been quite disdainful, sniffing and saying stuff like \u201cisn\u2019t it just sugar water?\u201dYet now, Pei Tingsong had long forgotten what he had been like before, and contentedly scooped a big spoonful into his mouth. After having been boiled for a long time, the winter pear had turned soft, and with a tiny bit of fruit acid mixed with snow fungus soaked in rock sugar, it tasted sweet and moist, and his throat immediately felt much more comfortable.It was just that the scraped tip of his tongue hurt a bit when it encountered the hot tong sui, but that didn\u2019t hinder him from eating it at all.Lu Yuan was sharp-sighted, so as soon as he looked back, he saw this. \u201cXiao Pei, what good thing are you hoarding and eating by yourself?!\u201d\u201cWhy is his breakfast in a thermos?\u201d Ling Yi was still chewing on a meat baozi as he asked, \u201cDo we not deserve it?\u201dXiao Wen thought it was strange. \u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t buy anything in a thermos\u00a0ah.\u201dPei Tingsong hugged his honey jar and declared, \u201cThis is the tong sui Juexia Ge boiled for me. What are you guys trying to grab it for, are you guys sick?\u201dLing Yi clicked his tongue for a bit. \u201cOh, yo, getting sick is really something.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t compare, can\u2019t compare,\u201d Lu Yuan repeatedly shook his head. \u201cThe little devil\u2019s heart has grown confused from the honey.\u201dJiang Miao suddenly understood. \u201cNo wonder Juexia went to the supermarket to buy so many winter pears yesterday.\u201dEven Cheng Qiang, who was driving the car, realized something. \u201cI was just saying why Juexia had gotten up before it was even light outside.\u201dHe Ziyan picked on him while laughing, \u201cWhy do I remember someone saying previously that he hated eating sweet things most? Who was that?\u201dPei Tingsong cleared his throat. He glanced at Fang Juexia before beginning to white-wash himself. \u201cWho the hell knows? Anyway, I like eating sweets.\u201dEveryone had gotten up too early, and so after causing a little bit of ruckus, they fell asleep. Pei Tingsong was the only one who couldn\u2019t sleep. He discovered that although the thermos looked big, it was actually kind of small, and he could see its bottom soon, even though he hadn\u2019t eaten\u00a0 that much. He thought about it, then screwed the lid back on and set the thermos aside.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgFang Juexia seemed to be very sleepy. Ordinarily, he very seldom slept in the car, but today, just like the others, he couldn\u2019t stay awake. His head nodded up and down, swaying along with the car, giving off a rare silly appearance.Everyone had fallen asleep, so Cheng Qiang turned down the car radio\u2019s volume. Pei Tingsong glanced at Fang Juexia several times and felt that this person\u2019s head would soon hit the window.He stretched out his hand, grabbed the brim of Fang Juexia\u2019s baseball cap, exerted a bit of effort, and pulled him sideways. Now, Fang Juexia was no longer inclining towards the window, and Pei Tingsong had carefully helped him avoid a collision crisis.The privacy film on the window dyed the blue sky outside dark. As they drove through a shady road, the overhanging tree branches cast shadows across Fang Juexia\u2019s gently swaying pale face.\u201c\u2026\u2026 next is the weather. Today\u2019s temperature is 9 \u2103 ~ 14 \u2103.\u201dThe sound of the radio was reassuring.Click.Pei Tingsong\u2019s shoulder sank, the red birthmark having finally bumped into the hollows of his shoulder. Pei Tingsong sniffed, and pretended that his reaction time had been eroded due to his cold, pretending that he couldn\u2019t sense that someone had borrowed his shoulder to sleep on, and only turned his head and looked at the opposite window.In the darkened world outside the window, a tottering petal finally fell down.\u201c\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s cloudy and clear.\u201dWhen the car reached its designated location, they discovered that the stylists had already arrived ahead of time. Kaleido\u2019s new endorsement was for a cellphone brand that boasted high national popularity. Although they were representing only one of its cellphone series, it was still the latest new flagship model that was being pushed by the brand.If it had to be said, then the process of winning this endorsement was also very fantastic. The new cellphone models of this series came in six colors and were designed to follow the colorful and fashionable route, so the brand was targeting to hire young and popular idol groups to represent it, in order to match its image with its potential consumer group.It had always been that to find a spokesperson, they would get in contact with whoever was popular at the moment. Of course, the top group Seven Luminaries ranked first on their list, since after all, their popularity had been solid for two years. In order to forge a partnership with them, the brand had contacted them many times, but the response from the other side had always been very vague, and no matter how long it dragged on, they just couldn\u2019t finalize an agreement. Even when they could see with their own eyes that the products were about to go online, they still didn\u2019t finalize anything.Originally, this kind of thing often happened in the industry, especially with large brokerage companies; most of them were either dissatisfied with the endorsement fee being offered, or thought that the brand\u2019s influence wasn\u2019t enough for their group. Generally speaking, adding a few extra zeros to the deal would get the job done. However, it was exactly during this time that the K group suddenly grew in popularity, and their momentum just became fiercer and fiercer.The brand immediately tried to contact that side. Unexpectedly, Star Chart was surprisingly open to persuasion, and after the offer was given, they agreed to it, even saying that they could include an advertising song. Getting such a good deal, the cellphone brand team was naturally overjoyed. Both sides hit it off and finalized the contract within three days. To prepare for the launch of their new product, they were going to invite fans to come in-person, and were also livestreaming the whole process online. On top of all this, they were even going to use these new cellphones to livestream the whole process, showing that they had incorporated many gimmicks into this process.In order to cooperate with the brand promotion, Kaleido\u2019s look was also designed on the basis of the colors of the cellphones. Perfectly they had six people, and there were six colors. Fang Juexia wore a loose white sweater with black jeans, his dark brown hair had been textured a bit, with his bangs blown into a heart shape, and he sported a dark purple velvet choker around his neck, which perfectly covered up the injury on his throat. Pei Tingsong wore a loose grape-violet colored sweater, his short black hair had been blow dried upwards, and a purple hippie style sun visor was placed on his head.Ling Yi\u2019s hair had been styled so that he had little curls all over, just like a teddy bear. The stylist little Jiejie had then matched him with red jeans, and he looked especially cute. Jiang Miao was given the rare chance to wear a light yellow fleece sweater. It was smooth, and he looked very lovely. Lu Yuan was in a pea-green shirt with white trousers, and he was wearing a pair of half-rimmed glasses. He Ziyan was wearing a bright blue windbreaker, which was very eye-catching.As soon as they came on the stage, they were drowned out by the voices of their fans. In the beginning, everyone was calling out the names of individual members, but later, somehow, it turned into a uniform slogan\u2014\u201cKaleido\uff01 Kaleido\uff01 Kaleido\uff01\u201d\u201cWelcome, welcome, let\u2019s give everyone a grand introduction. Our global spokesperson for our FINO series\u2014Kaleido!\u201dAfter the six people got into position, they first carried out their usual greeting, then all of them bowed in unison to the audience, following that with a bow towards the live camera. Three whole seconds passed before they straightened up, and then they clapped along with the fans.\u201cToday, our Kaleido has taken a lot of care with their look, they really are the best spokesperson for this brand.\u201dBased on the program schedule, after the host briefly introduced the features of the new flagship model, their latest advertisement would begin playing on the big screen. As each member of the group appeared on the screen, fans below would scream.Ling Yi, who was standing to the side, whispered to Jiang Miao, \u201cWe spent so many all-nighters taking those pictures that I got all muddled. I didn\u2019t expect the results to still be pretty good.\u201dJiang Miao just smiled and didn\u2019t speak.\u201cWow, isn\u2019t this advertisement very handsome\u00a0ah!\u201d\u201cYes\u2014\u201dThe host started the interactive session. First, she demonstrated the cellphone\u2019s photographic capabilities. Then, she let everyone in Kaleido take the color cellphone that corresponded with their style, after which they had to go up to the cellphone that had been affixed to a table, and take a photo using that cellphone\u2019s voice function, even adding a color tone to the picture with this function.Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t very good at taking selfies and was afraid of screwing up in this segment. After all, his bandmates had all kinds of cute and cool styles. When it was his turn to step forward, for a moment, he couldn\u2019t think of any good positions, so he just held the cellphone in his hand slantwise in front of his face. The bright white body of the cellphone covered most of his face, revealing only a pair of beautiful eyes and the red birthmark at the corner of his eye.The clicked picture was automatically displayed on the big screen. Upon seeing this picture, the fans suddenly started to scream wildly. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t understand what had just happened. He was so confused that he looked around and thought that some mysterious guest had arrived on-stage.\u201cAHHHHHHHHHHH A FRESH SELFIE!\u201d\u201cJuexia Gege\u2019s eyes are so, so attractive!\u201dPei Tingsong, who was watching from the side, was about to laugh himself to death, but he started coughing as soon as he laughed. So as he coughed, he pulled Fang Juexia away, and went over to the spot himself. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn.\u201dHe stood there, straightened up his collar, covered half of his face with the dark purple cellphone, thereby revealing only one eye. His eye was directed slightly upwards, giving off a completely aggressive feel.\u201cWow\u2014\u201dThere was another burst of screaming. Only after seeing this did Fang Juexia understand that everyone had just been too excited upon seeing the selfies.\u201cOkay, next segment!\u201dAll the activities revolved around cellphones, and so naturally, they couldn\u2019t leave out topics like mobile games and apps. The organizer had seven tall stools placed on the stage, and the host sat on the far right to chat with the group members.\u201cOur fans must have a lot of questions to ask, so now, I\u2019ll draw one person out. Fans should remember that they can only ask questions related to cellphones.\u201d With that, the host cued Pei Tingsong, who was sitting next to her, \u201cThen Tingsong, go up and choose a fan\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cIf I pick, then I have to answer, right?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked in a hoarse voice. After saying that, he coughed with his back to the camera.Ling Yi commented, \u201cAnyway, you answer first, and you don\u2019t have to mind whether we answer or not.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright, alright.\u201d Pei Tingsong looked down at the crowd below that stage. \u201cThat girl in the white sweater dress\u00a0ba, she looks so excited, as if she wants to climb straight up onto the stage.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha.\u201dThat girl took the microphone from a staff member, took a moment to calm herself down, and then asked in a loud voice, \u201cGeges, can you disclose the nicknames you have for each other on your cellphones?\u201dShit.The microphone in Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand almost fell out.\u201cGood question.\u201d The host looked at Pei Tingsong with a smile as she said, \u201cThen Tingsong will go first? What nicknames have you given the other Geges in your contacts app, we\u2019re all very curious.\u201d Saying that, she looked down at the crowd below the stage. \u201cWhose Xiao Pei nickname do you guys want to see the most?\u201dA roar sounded out from below the stage, one that could even topple the mountains and overturn the seas. \u201cFang Juexia! Fang Juexia! Fang Juexia! Fang Juexia\u2026\u201dFang Juexia was also a little curious, so he turned his chair to face Pei Tingsong, who was beside him, and then smiled and raised his eyebrows up at him.\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong hesitated, only to hear Ling Yi pour oil on the already burning fire from behind him.\u201cYou need to take out your cellphone and read it out loud!\u201dHe Ziyan turned sideways to look over, and added some\u00a0embellishments\u00a0on this entire affair, \u201cRight, otherwise, we\u2019re personally going to take action\u00a0ah?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that, I just didn\u2019t bring my cellphone up with me.\u201dWho could have known that as soon as this sentence was uttered, Xiao Wen would come up on-stage with Pei Tingsong\u2019s cellphone, thrust it into his hand, and then quickly slip away.They could even do that??Under the full view of the public, Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t cause a fuss and get out of it, no matter how much he wanted to. He only hated the fact that he hadn\u2019t changed that nickname earlier.\u201cAlright, our Xiao Pei has opened the famous chat app now. Let\u2019s wait and see what his nickname for Juexia is?\u201dPei Tingsong also turned to face Fang Juexia. In fact, he currently had no face with which to face him, but he was afraid that Fang Juexia would peek at the nickname from the side.\u201cEn\u2026The nickname is,\u00a0Just a pretty face\u00a0and\u2026\u201dHe stuttered these few words , completely not in the style of a rapper at all. But with just these few words, everyone in the crowd down below had begun to scream.Fang Juexia\u2019s expression was a little puzzled. He picked up the microphone, and with a little questioning and threatening tone, asked, \u201cAnd what?\u201d He squinted as he added, \u201cPretty?\u201dLu Yuan was so excited that he seemed to look like a cat that had just seen a mouse in a granary. \u201cJust a pretty face and then what?!\u201dPei Tingsong had no other choice left, so he simply went for broke, locked the cellphone\u2019s screen, held the cellphone from one end, while using the other end to lift up Fang Juexia\u2019s chin, and with a little flattery in his voice, joked\u2014\u201cJust a pretty face and also still pretty~\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 48Chapter 48 \u2013 Falling Into A CloudTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksI want to hire you to be my exclusive dance teacher.This action immediately triggered a scream, and cheers almost broke throughout the whole studio. On the other hand, Fang Juexia, who had been flirted with, was calm. He simply leaned back and wrested away the cellphone in Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand.The other members, who were watching the excitement, didn\u2019t mind fanning the flames higher. Ling Yi\u2019s little tongue never stopped as it flapped, \u201cSo it turns out Pei Tingsong is such a person\u00a0oh!\u201dHe Ziyan, who was sitting at the end of the seating arrangement, added jokingly, \u201cJust a pretty face and also still pretty\u2014this is actually the nickname Pei Tingsong gave to one of his bandmates. Can you guys dare to believe it\u00a0ma?\u201dHaving said that, he pointed the microphone in his hand at the audience below, but who would have known that the fans below would yell loudly in unison, \u201cDare!\u201d\u201cYou guys really dare to believe anything.\u201d Lu Yuan added on, \u201cTo tell the truth, I also dare.\u201dAll of the fans below laughed. Jiang Miao looked at the people involved with a smile and put forward a suggestion, \u201cI feel like this way might be more fun. Xiao Pei just made public his nickname for Juexia, so now, let\u2019s take a look at Juexia\u2019s nickname for Xiao Pei, how\u2019s that?\u201dThe little captain was pretty much voicing the heartfelt wishes of the fans below. Before he could even finish his words, they started screaming, and the rest of his sentence was almost drowned out amidst their cheers.The host joked, \u201cThis is the best artist I\u2019ve ever interviewed. The group leader has already started to help me with the cues.\u201dLu Yuan said with a smile, \u201cCaptain is a cueing maniac.\u201dOriginally, the hot potato was still with Pei Tingsong, but now it had been thrown into Fang Juexia\u2019s hands.Even before Fang Juexia could react to this, he heard the girls below calling out his name in waves. He was still a little confused when he picked up his microphone. \u201cIs it my turn now?\u201dLing Yi called out, \u201cJuexia, don\u2019t let me down!\u201dHe Ziyan added, \u201cIt\u2019s time to hurt each other.\u201dLu Yuan shifted his high stool around. \u201cMelon seeds and peanut snacks are on sale in the front row\u00a0ah.\u201dListening on as his bandmates mercilessly fooled around, Pei Tingsong smiled and shook his head, and then looked at Fang Juexia.To be honest, he had created that nickname long back, all because of his prejudices and stereotyping of this person. Thinking about it now, he felt really apologetic towards Fang Juexia.However, Pei Tingsong was also very curious about how the person in front of him had nicknamed him. Based on his personality, he probably wouldn\u2019t make something up right now.\u201cEn\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia held up the microphone and adjusted the choker on his neck with a smile. \u201cIn fact, my nicknames aren\u2019t particularly interesting, so everyone shouldn\u2019t expect too much.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s best if it\u2019s like that.\u201d Pei Tingsong nodded with complete satisfaction.Ling Yi guessed boldly, \u201cIt may be Devil Incarnate Pei Tingsong!\u201dLu Yuan interjected, \u201cNo, it\u2019s Xiao Pei, Xiao Pei,\u00a0game loss guaranteed today.\u201d\u201cIt could also be\u00a0La La La, a Pinot Tree Supreme,\u201d He Ziyan said.\u201cHahahahahaha, what\u2019s the matter with this group?!\u201d\u201cWhat are they doing, is everyone competing for the spot of the number one slanderer in the group hahahaha?\u201dHowever, Jiang Miao said, \u201cJuexia wouldn\u2019t make up such nicknames. I guess it should just be his name?\u201dFang Juexia looked at their group leader with a smile. \u201cPretty much, but a bit more precise.\u201d He himself knew that his nicknames weren\u2019t funny, and he didn\u2019t want to arouse everyone\u2019s appetite, so he turned towards the involved party.Sensing that Fang Juexia had raised the microphone to speak, Pei Tingsong rubbed his ears and turned around while wearing an expression that showed he was listening intently with both ears.Fang Juexia said calmly, \u201cKaleido Pei Tingsong.\u201dAs soon as these words were uttered, the whole audience burst into laughter, and his bandmates\u2019 laughter was especially exaggerated.Pei Tingsong\u2019s face collapsed at a speed visible to the naked eye. He stood up from the high stool and pretended to leave the stage. \u201cFlying solo, flying solo from now on, I\u2019m not doing this anymore.\u201dUnexpectedly, a fan from below yelled in a super loud voice, \u201cThe beautiful baby is still doing it, you can\u2019t not do it!\u201d\u201cHahahahahahaha sister is so super loud!\u201d\u201cHahahahahahaha!\u201dBut he was just joking, and didn\u2019t take more than two steps forward after standing up before sitting down again. He sat his butt down right next to Fang Juexia, then pulled him over to face him. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you write Star Chart Company Kaleido Maknae Rapper Pei Tingsong?\u201dFang Juexia pursed his lips and replied naturally, \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m your Baidu Encyclopedia entry.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha!\u201d\u201cHahahahahahahahaha, Baidu Encyclopedia entry!\u201dLu Yuan was laughing so hard that he nearly fell over. \u201cThe little devil king also has this day!\u201dPei Tingsong let out a long sigh and faced the fans, complaining, \u201cYou guys see, the nickname I gave this guy was full of pretty, but what he actually nicknamed me was just Kaleido Pei Tingsong, isn\u2019t this infuriating?\u201dHe Ziyan clutched at his chest. \u201cXiao Pei\u2019s heart, all his love was wasted.\u201dLu Yuan commented, \u201cPei Tingsong who only knew about prettiness, Fang Juexia who just feels like they\u2019re colleagues.\u201dLing Yi added, \u201cLaying out a banner: Karma Exists.\u201d\u201cHahahahahaha!\u201d\u201cThe cross talk group is really quite enough!\u201dFacing the whole audience\u2019s ridicule, Pei Tingsong could only shake his head repeatedly while saying, \u201cFang Juexia is heartless.\u201dFang Juexia was a little embarrassed by what he had said, but he really did use that nickname for him; he had done the same for everyone.Was it a little too hurtful?Pondering on it, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t know what else to say, so he poked at Pei Tingsong\u2019s waist with his microphone.In the beginning, Pei Tingsong deliberately ignored him and turned his back on him. Later, only when Fang Juexia poked him in the back once again did he turn around, and holding his microphone in his hand, spoke \u201cThis segment has made me so sad, I\u2019m requesting for us to proceed directly to the next segment. Cellphone nicknames are the bane of my life.\u201dThe duration of the activity was also limited, and right then, the host had also wanted to bring the audience under control, so she followed Pei Tingsong\u2019s suggestion and commenced with the next segment.In fact, on the inside, Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t really not want to continue this segment. He just thought that if they really continued with it, what if Fang Juexia\u2019s nicknames for the others were really good, what then?Ling Yi had been Fang Juexia\u2019s roommate since even before they debuted, and usually, both of them were very close and intimate, so his nickname must be Yiyi. His nickname for their group leader must be Miao Ge or Little Captain, but anyway, all of their nicknames would be better than Kaleido Pei Tingsong.If it turned out to be like that, then wouldn\u2019t he be left with no face?The more Pei Tingsong thought about it, the more his slight discomfort with this matter grew. But after all, their relationship before in the group was there, and it hadn\u2019t even been as good as that between strangers. Fang Juexia using that nickname for him was justifiable; after all, didn\u2019t he himself nickname this person as\u2014 Just a pretty face?Summing it all up, Pei Tingsong just didn\u2019t want to hear Fang Juexia\u2019s intimate nicknames for others. He had to stop this segment and cut his losses.Next, they all chatted about the shooting of the advertisements for the new products, an area that had never been Fang Juexia\u2019s home court. However, he felt that Pei Tingsong spoke very few words here, and his participation wasn\u2019t high. He wondered whether it was because of the issue with the nickname.Just by looking at his appearance and daily style, Fang Juexia seemed to be more like the kind of person with a delicate and sensitive mind. Yet, in reality, his way of thinking was simple and direct, and there always existed a barrier between him and the outside world. In many cases, he was more like the straight man of steel that netizens liked to talk about.And right now, he discovered that Pei Tingsong, who looked very tiger-like, was actually the one with a delicate and sensitive mind.Therefore, Fang Juexia, who had always just regarded nicknames as a search index for his contact list, couldn\u2019t help but wonder if he should change that name to something that was less icy cold.Just a pretty face and also still pretty\u2026To be honest, Fang Juexia was skeptical about this nickname. After all, he was already used to Pei Tingsong\u2019s word games, so maybe, it could be that he had also just made up this nickname for fanservice this time around.He began to wonder what Pei Tingsong had really nicknamed him.The activity didn\u2019t end until the afternoon. The brand had invested a great deal of money on promotions, coupled with the fact that the livestream\u2019s popularity wasn\u2019t low, and then, adding on K\u2019s fancy group talk and the TingJue CP concentrated fluff moments, it rushed onto the Hot Search list, and became a hot conversation topic.The brand was very satisfied with this result and promised Star Chart to increase their advertising and offline publicity ventures with them in the future.\u201cYou guys will get more and more endorsements in the future.\u201d Cheng Qiang was feeling a bit emotional in the midst of his joy. \u201cAh, I seem to have an old mother\u2019s mentality now, feeling as though the kids I raised, all on my lonesome, are now starting to earn money to support their family. It really wasn\u2019t easy\u00a0ah.\u201dHowever, the six K members were fighting around in the car, and no one heard what he said.\u201cLing Yi, can you stop eating? Your chips have gotten all over my pants!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just going to eat it! Eat it! I\u2019ll even give some to Juexia to make you expire from anger!\u201d\u201cThank you\u2026..wu, it\u2019s so spicy.\u201d\u201cAiya, I forgot this is the Indian ghost pepper flavor.\u201d\u201cHahahahahaha, are you a demon? Giving Juexia ghost pepper spiciness!\u201d\u201cExcuse me, aren\u2019t ghost peppers Mexican?\u201dWitnessing his boss be completely ignored by his own artists, Xiao Wen, who was sitting in the passenger\u2019s seat, applauded awkwardly for him. \u201cQiang Ge is right.\u201dCheng Qiang, wearing an expression like that of a domineering president, started the car and crooked his neck to point at Xiao Wen. \u201cFasten your seat belt.\u201dWhen they returned to the company, they received more good news. On the basis of the previous pilot livestream episode of the \u201ccandy wrapper kiss\u201d, and Kaleido\u2019s recent continuous exposure, the view count for the first episode of the group ensemble livestream that came out last weekend on a certain network platform exceeded 5 million on its first day. Although it wasn\u2019t as high as that of many ultra-popular groups, for a group ensemble variety show targeted mainly towards fans that didn\u2019t have any publicity besides the pilot livestream episode, this was already a pretty amazing number.Taking advantage of the planning meeting, the boss mentioned details regarding the group ensemble show, \u201cBecause the feedback for the first episode was pretty good, the staff analyzed the data, and the most discussed topic was Xiao Pei and Juexia\u2019s CP.\u201dChen Zhengyun looked at the two of them. \u201cIt seems that our planning direction was still right this time, and we can now see the benefits this CP fanservice brings for the whole group. In fact, the rest of the discussed topics weren\u2019t much different; everyone here is a child with a good sense for variety shows, so keep working hard.\u201dAfter saying that, he took out two sets of contracts. \u201cThis is the new cooperation contract we got from two other network platforms, and it was only after seeing the view count for the ensemble show and the degree of discussion that took place on the initial network that they came to us. It just so happened that we hadn\u2019t signed an exclusive contract with this particular broadcasting platform in the beginning, so now, our broadcasting channels have also been increased.\u201dLing Yi was very surprised. \u201cReally? I thought only fans watched this.\u201dCheng Qiang explained, \u201cIt\u2019s mainly because you guys had a small fan base at the beginning, so to a certain extent, there was a lot of space for passers-by to enter. Now, you guys are at a turning point, where you are rising in national popularity, and so there will be a large number of passers-by who will want to turn into your fans after watching some of your performances or programs. The ensemble show is just the quickest way for them to get to know all of you.\u201d\u201cTherefore, the high view count on the ensemble show proves that the attention you all are attracting really has risen very high.\u201dFang Juexia could also sense this change. Even if he hardly browsed the Internet, he would get a lot of feedback from his mama and former classmates.A few days ago, a college classmate had even sent him a message, saying that all kinds of photos, which had been taken when he was studying, had built their own towering threads in the forum. There were photos of him in class, giving a presentation onstage, participating in the school mathematics competitions, participating in basketball matches, and even photos of him at sports festivals.These photos also seemed to have been posted over on Weibo, where they were also widely discussed.\u201cCheng Qiang is right.\u201d Chen Zhengyun continued, \u201cEveryone wants to see this variety show, but they also want to understand the real you, which is why we\u2019re planning more episodes. What\u2019s more, this ensemble job bears witness to the process of everyone starting from scratch and growing up. Every hard won job opportunity is being recorded, which then becomes very precious to both the fans and all of you.\u201dAfter that, he returned to the main topic of discussion\u2014planning the album. \u201cEveryone has been working hard these past few days, running to activity after activity, and we haven\u2019t stopped either. Several producers, artists, and I have discussed these demos for several days, and have finally decided on the main song of this album.\u201dAs soon as they heard the main song being mentioned, everyone grew a little excited. Fang Juexia even felt a little nervous; they hadn\u2019t come out with an album for so long that he had forgotten what it was like to record songs in the studio.\u201cWe decided to use He Ziyan\u2019s demo.\u201dWith that, Ling Yi and Lu Yuan started cheering for He Ziyan, \u201cYeah!\u201dSeeing that everyone was so happy, Fang Juexia\u2019s mood also suddenly jumped with joy, but then he heard Chen Zhengyun say, \u201cThe arrangement is very distinctive, very much in-line with your guys\u2019 style. However, the composition of the song still needs to be adjusted; there is a lack of melody, especially in the chorus. There are still things to be discussed.\u201dSpeaking of composition\u2026.Fang Juexia felt as if he had forgotten something, but he couldn\u2019t remember it at this moment. Pei Tingsong, who had originally been spinning his pen, suddenly raised his hand and spoke up, \u201cBoss, I have a suggestion.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re making progress\u00a0ah.\u201d Chen Zhengyun teased, \u201cYou even know how to use the word \u2018suggestion\u2019 now.\u201dNo one in the room bothered to stand on ceremony, and everyone started laughing uproariously. A smile even drifted across Fang Juexia\u2019s face as his fingers played with the pocket-sized tea-cup in front of him; it was made of boxwood, and was a part of the boss\u2019 collection.Pei Tingsong glared at them and continued, \u201cFor the composition part, I want to recommend Juexia Ge.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t expect Pei Tingsong to suddenly push him out into the spotlight. The wooden cup in his hand fell down in an instant and hit the table with a thud.He looked like a little mouse who failed to steal oil, instead running smack dab into kerosene. As he glanced at the boss, he stretched out his hand, snatched the little teacup that had tumbled far away, brought it back, and even patted it gently.With a smile on his lips, Chen Zhengyun turned his head and looked at Pei Tingsong. \u201cWhy are you suddenly dragging Juexia out?\u201dJiang Miao thought about it and said, \u201cYes\u00a0ah, why does Xiao Pei know that Juexia can compose music? The rest of us didn\u2019t even know this.\u201dLu Yuan commented, \u201cIt can\u2019t be one of Xiao Pei\u2019s pranks\u00a0ba?\u201dPei Tingsong picked up the small cup in front of him and pretended to throw it at him. \u201cAm I so idle and bored?\u201dHe Ziyan\u2019s face showed an unclear smile. \u201cThen that is to say, Xiao Pei has heard Juexia\u2019s music? Even I haven\u2019t heard it, hey.\u201d\u201cWow, I\u2019m so sad. I\u2019m actually Juexia\u2019s dearest roommate,\u201d Ling Yi lay on the table and complained, \u201cJuexia, you already don\u2019t love me anymore.\u201dListening to these repeated bombardments from his bandmates, Fang Juexia\u2019s ears turned red, and he kept waving his hand. \u201cNo, actually it\u2019s all an accident\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong interrupted his explanation, \u201cBoss, believe me, Fang Juexia is really very talented.\u201dHearing this sentence, Fang Juexia was stunned. All the clarifications he had come up with in his mind were forgotten in that instant.He suddenly thought of a phrase\u2014forceful and lofty in speech. Even though he knew that that phrase couldn\u2019t be accurately used here, at this moment, every word Pei Tingsong uttered hit his heart heavily, and every syllable echoed repeatedly within his empty chest.He looked at Pei Tingsong, and what was strange was that Pei Tingsong, who had originally been looking at the boss the entire time, seemed to feel something at that very moment. He turned his face, and their eyes, very coincidentally, met the other\u2019s.It was always like this. The frequency with which this kept happening was already too high for it to be categorised as just being a coincidence.His eyelashes trembled, but Fang Juexia didn\u2019t look away this time.Pei Tingsong recalled the swaying snow-white trees outside the hospital upon seeing this.Chen Zhengyun shrugged. \u201cAlright. Juexia, when you get back, send me what you wrote, and I\u2019ll listen to it.\u201dNot expecting the outcome of the meeting to finally be something like this, and also being caught off guard by Pei Tingsong selling him out, all Fang Juexia could do was nod and agree, \u201cOkay.\u201dIf such a thing had happened before, he would have definitely felt resistant inside. Even if he had tightly held this demo in his hands for a whole week, he didn\u2019t really want to take it out, and he also didn\u2019t want to be exposed passively.However, he had to admit that hearing Pei Tingsong\u2019s approval and praise was something that made him happy. The amount of happiness he was feeling right now even beat out the amount he usually felt because of most other people\u2019s praise.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgIt was just that Fang Juexia hadn\u2019t discovered yet, that in his heart, he had already subconsciously divided people into [Pei Tingsong] and [Others].After the meeting, since all six of them were there, everyone started to practice. Singing and dancing was a kind of technical work, and if even a day of practice was missed, people would become a little rusty. Previously, since Kaleido didn\u2019t have much work, they practiced almost every day. The one who was most intense about it was naturally Fang Juexia, and the laziest was Pei Tingsong.Lu Yuan had already come up with choreography for a part of the dance using the demo before, and so he took this opportunity to dance it out and show everyone.\u201cWow, that\u2019s cool!\u201d Ling Yi clapped like a little seal. \u201cThat move just now was so hot!\u201d\u201cWorthy of being Teacher Yuan.\u201d Jiang Miao also started clapping.He Ziyan stood with his arms akimbo and sighed, \u201cSo difficult\u00a0ah\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong was an airborne artist, and he had hardly practiced before, so his dance foundation was much worse than the others. However, he still counted as gifted, and had a good sense of rhythm. Therefore, although he was nowhere near Fang Juexia or Lu Yuan in terms of dancing, he wouldn\u2019t drag them down, and won through sheer stage charm.However, the choreography this time was really a little difficult, demanding high intensity and consisting of many shifts. He sat cross-legged on the ground and as he watched, kept scooting closer to Fang Juexia\u2019s side.Fang Juexia was completely engrossed in watching the choreography, and completely didn\u2019t notice the appearance of an extra person at his side. He didn\u2019t turn his head until Pei Tingsong bumped into his shoulder.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dThe music playing in the practice room was loud, so Pei Tingsong also said in a loud voice, \u201cThe dance this time is really difficult.\u201dSo?\u00a0Fang Juexia didn\u2019t understand his meaning. \u201cIt is a bit.\u201d\u201cSo,\u201d Pei Tingsong grabbed Fang Juexia and pulled him into his arms. \u201cI want to hire you to be my exclusive dance teacher. Help redeem me and not drag you guys down!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia blinked and replied, \u201cThe dance was created by Lu Yuan, you should let him teach you.\u201d\u201cTch.\u201d Pei Tingsong really couldn\u2019t say anything in reply to Fang Juexia\u2019s one-track mind.He copied Fang Juexia and stretched out his legs, even going to the extent of pressing his right leg onto this person\u2019s leg. \u201cAren\u2019t I Kaleido Pei Tingsong? Don\u2019t forget that I carry the name Kaleido in front of my name. If I can\u2019t dance well, that means Kaleido can\u2019t dance well. If Kaleido can\u2019t dance well, that means you, Fang Juexia, can\u2019t dance well.\u201dWhat kind of logic was this?If you said it over and over again, it seemed like a tongue twister.Fang Juexia knew that Pei Tingsong was still feeling unsettled about the nickname matter, and remembered that he had promised him that he would not be so indifferent towards him. So, he began to weigh on how to best change the nickname.How about getting rid of the Kaleido?Or calling him Xiao Pei?Neither of them seemed very good. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t have any good ideas right now, so he thought that he might as well let Pei Tingsong come up with one himself.Pei Tingsong, who had been waiting for his response for a long time, ended up waiting so long that he got tired. He stretched his hands out behind him, while wondering if he had been too deliberately ambiguous and had provoked Fang Juexia again.It couldn\u2019t be as far as that\u00a0ba, it couldn\u2019t be that Fang Juexia really was a little master\u00a0ah, not being able to speak a single word to him.All of a sudden, his ears grew warm, and he heard Fang Juexia\u2019s cool and chilly voice, followed by a warm breath, drift over.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me\u00a0ba?\u201d The words he blurted out were like a soft and moist cloud as they wrapped around Pei Tingsong while he was lost in fanciful thoughts. \u201cWhatever nickname you like, I can change it to that.\u201dIf you had never fallen into a cloud, you would never know how cold and soft a cloud was.Every cloud even contained a light sweetness.The huge mirror reflected their appearances. Fang Juexia looked like he was about to lie on his shoulder, and his side profile was as beautiful as a picture, pleasing to both the heart and the eyes.[Whatever nickname you like, I can change it to that.] Pei Tingsong practically unpacked these words in his heart, chewing over every\u00a0letter and syllable, and it felt even better than the taste of the winter pear tong sui.However, he restrained the delight that sprouted in him, and wearing the same expression he would usually use when he was teasing him, he turned his head.\u201cLet me think\u00a0ah.\u201dThe distance between the tips of their noses was shortened in a moment, with only 5 cm left.With this movement, Fang Juexia\u2019s pale face turned red. A bandage was stuck to his Adam\u2019s apple, and in Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes, it was like a medal that marked the spoils of war.He raised a hand and flicked Fang Juexia\u2019s forehead. \u201cDream on.\u201dAfter saying that, he raised his eyebrows. \u201cDon\u2019t think about being lazy. Until you earnestly want to change my nickname, I just want to be called Kaleido Pei Tingsong.\u201dThey stayed in the practice room until 1:30 in the morning, and since they still had to record the ensemble show the next day, they couldn\u2019t stay too long. Xiao Wen drove them back to the dormitory in the van. Although it was already midnight, there were actually still fans crouched there at the company as they waited for Kaleido. Although there had been fans who had done this in the past, the numbers were quite different, and they wouldn\u2019t stay so late.\u201cHe Ziyan! Fire Ge, your fur jacket is so good looking! Cool!\u201d\u201cMiaomiao! Teacher Yuan! I love you guys!\u201dHe Ziyan walked in the very front, waved to these fans in a familiar way, very naturally got into the passenger seat of the van, and rolled down the window. \u201cHurry home\u00a0ba, it\u2019s this late, and you guys are still outside. I\u2019m going to be angry\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cYiyi, look at Mama\u00a0ba!\u201d\u201cLingling! Mama loves you!\u201dLing Yi was especially good at extricating himself from awkward situations and waved to everyone with a smile. \u201cOkay, moms. Moms have seen their son\u00a0ba, so they can go home at ease!\u201dLu Yuan ran over and put his arms around his neck, trying to snatch the game machine that Ling Yi had grabbed from him before, which caused Ling Yi to scream madly, \u201cMama, save me!\u201d The two of them bickered and argued as they scrambled to occupy the second row of seats.\u201cHahahaha, Mama can\u2019t save you! Give it to Teacher Yuan!\u201dJiang Miao wore a mask and smiled. \u201cAre you cold? It\u2019s very cold\u00a0ba. Don\u2019t come so late next time.\u201d\u201cAhhhhhhhhhh, the little captain is too warm.\u201d\u201cThree Water, I love you!\u201dJuexia came out with Jiang Miao. He was wrapped in a big coat, and the hood of his sweater covered most of his face. He half lowered his head and kept bowing to the fans from the moment he exited the building, greeting everyone in a soft voice. Unfortunately, his voice was drowned out by the loud screams of the fans.\u201cJuexia!!! Juexia Gege!!!\u201d\u201cMama doesn\u2019t want you to bow! Stand up straight for Mama!\u201d\u201cOur Juexia works so hard, take a hot bath when you get back!\u201dThe last one was of course Kaleido\u2019s group tyrant, Pei Tingsong.\u201cAh, Pinot Tree Supreme, you\u2019re so hot!\u201d\u201cPei Tingsong, did you grow taller again?! How are your legs so long?!\u201dHe was about to fall over from sleepiness. It was still very cold during the early spring nights, and the current cold wind made him squint as he listlessly walked at the very back. \u201cStill not going home\u00a0ah? One look and anyone can tell you guys don\u2019t have enough homework.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha!\u201d\u201cPinto Tree Supreme, you have no heart! I\u2019m going to stop being your fan! I\u2019m going to climb the fandom wall!\u201d\u201cYou dare.\u201d Pei Tingsong put on an expression of trying to find that person, looked up and glanced around. \u201cWhose fandom are you climbing over to?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll climb over to Fang Juexia\u2019s!\u201dAt this time, Fang Juexia, who had been cued, was about to step into the car. Upon hearing his name, he turned around, saw that all of these little girls were laughing, and felt a bit confused.Pei Tingsong first glanced at Fang Juexia, then pretended to cold-shoulder the fan who had said that she\u2019d climb the fandom wall. \u201cGo, go, go, go quickly. I must see you in his Weibo comments tomorrow.\u201dWhen he finished talking, he stepped into the car and saw that Fang Juexia had already gotten a window seat. He had even opened the window to talk to the fans. \u201cYou guys go back quickly, don\u2019t let your parents worry.\u201d His voice was not loud, always getting covered up as soon as he opened his mouth, but his expression was serious, and with his eyebrows slightly twisted, he really looked like a worried Gege.Pei Tingsong sat next to him and deliberately squeezed next to him at the window to tell the fans, \u201cQuickly go home!\u201d\u201cPinot Tree Supreme, shut up!\u201d\u201cHey, you guys are fake fans\u00a0ba?\u201dWhen the car started, everyone was tired from practice, and this allowed Xiao Wen to experience a rare moment of quiet. However, he kept feeling that there was something he hadn\u2019t said yet, but he just couldn\u2019t remember it. While waiting for the traffic lights to turn, he flipped through the notes on his cellphone, and it was only then that he remembered about the event Cheng Qiang had told him to arrange, which hadn\u2019t been told to these guys yet.\u201cHey, you guys aren\u2019t asleep yet\u00a0ba?\u201dAs soon as he asked, Ling Yi and Lu Yuan tacitly began a snoring duet.Xiao Wen knew that they were doing it deliberately, and glanced at the rearview mirror as he said, \u201cIsn\u2019t tomorrow the filming for the ensemble show? It\u2019s going to be at an outside location\u00a0oh.\u201dAll of the six people in the car suddenly woke up. \u201cOutside location?!\u201d\u201cIt must be the Maldives, thanking the company, thanking the boss and Qiang Ge\u2026\u201d\u201cNo\u00a0la.\u201d\u00a0Xiao Wen turned around a corner and said, \u201cTomorrow is going to be an amusement park special.\u201d\u201cWow, an amusement park isn\u2019t bad either\u00a0ah!\u201dPei Tingsong sneered. \u201cYou guys are truly humans who are easy to satisfy.\u201d\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Xiao Wen hesitated for a moment, and then said, \u201cIn fact, to be more accurate, it\u2019s a haunted house special, and the other parts are just extra.\u201dThe roof of the car was almost overturned\u2014\u201cHaunted house??!!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49Chapter 49 \u2013 Haunted HouseTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksBecause you are very cute ah.In order to avoid running into too many other guests at the amusement park, the company specially arranged for the shooting of the ensemble show to take place at noon on a weekday. Although this amusement park only occupied a small area and couldn\u2019t be compared to the most famous large amusement parks, it boasted a full set of rides and attractions, and their haunted house was said to be the jewel of the entire place.It was a wonderful day, with the sun shining down and making people feel warm all over. As soon as the door of the car opened, all of Kaleido\u2019s six boys scattered in multiple directions, just like when ducks were released from their pen.\u201cWow, that roller coaster is so high\u00a0ah!\u201d\u201cI want to ride the pirate ship!\u201d\u201cIs there that kind of shooting game?\u201dFang Juexia calculated it through\u2014it had already been ten years since he had last come to an amusement park. Looking at these facilities, even he felt a bit of yearning. The sun was so bright that people were finding it difficult to even open their eyes, so Fang Juexia stretched out a hand to cover his eyes as he looked at the carousel not far away.Sunlight was an efficient tool in generating illusions, and the scene before his eyes took on the tone of an old Polaroid film, one that made him fall into a trance when he shook it out. A seven or eight-year-old boy suddenly appeared on the candy-colored wooden horse, a streak of red at the corner of his eye. At his side were his father and mother, and they turned and turned\u00a0ah, repeating this circular arc, looking as if they could spin for a lifetime, laugh for a lifetime.That seemed to have been the only occasion when his parents had accompanied him to an amusement park together.\u201cYou like these kinds of things that kids play with\u00a0ah.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s voice came from behind him. Fang Juexia turned his head, pulled himself out of his memories, and then shook his head.Pei Tingsong turned his head and looked at him as he spoke, \u201cYet, you were so fascinated while looking at it.\u201dFang Juexia wore a white baseball cap, revealing his whole face, looking fresh and comfortable. Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help looking at him a few times more. He saw that the tips of Fang Juexia\u2019s pale ears appeared almost translucent in the sunlight, and even the tiny blood capillaries in his earlobes were clearly visible.\u201cI came here as a child.\u201dHe noticed that Fang Juexia\u2019s chest heaved while saying this, as if he was taking a deep breath.\u201cThat\u2019s good. When I was a kid, I never came to this kind of place,\u201d Pei Tingsong said casually.\u201cReally?\u201d Fang Juexia thought that was unbelievable. \u201cYour parents didn\u2019t take you there?\u201dPei Tingsong put his hands into his coat pocket and shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t see them more than ten times a year.\u201dFang Juexia asked, \u201cAt the same time?\u201dPei Tingsong shrugged, \u201cSeparate. There are even fewer meetings with both of them together.\u201dHis voice was still a little hoarse, and as he said that, he did seem to be a bit pitiful. Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t very good at comforting others; his own situation wasn\u2019t that much better, and moreover, Pei Tingsong, who possessed such a strong character, definitely wouldn\u2019t want to be comforted by an outsider like him who wasn\u2019t in the know.So Fang Juexia just raised his head, slightly tilted his face upwards, and smiled at him. \u201cSo this is your first time.\u201dThe first time experiencing an amusement park.The birthmark at the corner of his eye appeared a little translucent under the sun, now carrying a bit of orange, looking just like a piece of candy.\u201cHappy?\u201dHe didn\u2019t know whether this sentence had directly poked his nerves, or if it was because he saw this cold face burst forth with a rare smile, but Pei Tingsong seemed to have been bewitched by it, and really felt a tiny bit of happiness.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be happy about? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m a kid.\u201dHe turned his head to catch sight of their intertwined shadows, seeming to be closer and more intimate than the people themselves.The directing team came out with the cameras, gathered all six of them together to record the beginning segment, explained the entire day\u2019s arrangement, before finally leading everyone to the site of the main activity of the day.\u201cToday, for our Kaleido ensemble show horror special, we\u2019ve come to the abandoned medical school in the horror section! This is the most famous haunted house in this amusement park. There are two floors inside and only one traversable route. Everyone can be rest assured that you won\u2019t get lost.\u201dLing Yi complained, \u201cDirector, do you think I am afraid of getting lost?\u201d\u201cHahahaha.\u201dThe haunted house in front of them looked a bit different from the usual pitch-black cave-like haunted houses; it was an old two-story building, which really looked like an abandoned hospital. Big X\u2019s were painted on the walls with red paint, and the plaster on the walls was about to fall off. There were several rusty sign-boards hanging on the top of the gate, written on which was the name of the hospital. Naturally, a hospital had windows, but every window here had already been nailed tight with planks, making its interior airtight.Fang Juexia looked up, and although his expression still showed calmness, his heart had long grown unsettled.It must be very dark in there\u00a0ba\u2026.He had been worried about this matter since last night. There were a pitiful number of light sources in a haunted house, and if someone like him, who suffered from night blindness, entered it, then he would probably be no different from a blind man feeling his path around in there.Fang Juexia could already see the scenes where he\u00a0 bumped around, felt about, crawled, and rolled inside.\u201cThis looks alright\u00a0ah,\u201d Pei Tingsong declared with an expression of \u2018I\u2019m not afraid at all\u2019. \u201cHow frightening can it be?\u201d\u201cXiao Pei isn\u2019t very old, but he is very brave,\u201d Lu Yuan teased him.He Ziyan followed up with, \u201cHe himself is a devil, so can he be afraid of ghosts?\u201dJiang Miao laughed. \u201cA man even ghosts fear\u2014Pei Tingsong.\u201dThe director continued to explain the process, \u201cThere are six of you here, so everyone can divide themselves into your own chosen groups.\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t we finish it off just by walking through it once? And we still have to split into teams.\u201d Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t understand what was scary about all this. He turned to his bandmates and asked, \u201cWho is afraid\u00a0ah?\u201dEveryone raised their hands in one mass move, and Fang Juexia, upon seeing this, also raised his hand, albeit after half a beat, taking the same stance as everyone.This boyband\u2019s group spirit always came from nowhere.The director shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not just simply walking through it\u00a0oh. This time, in order to increase the difficulty level, we specially put each one of your guys\u2019 chibi dolls in each room, so they total to six dolls. After you guys go in, you have to bring out all of the dolls before you can be declared to have successfully completed this challenge.\u201dOnce this was announced, there was wailing everywhere.\u201cHow come we also have to get the dolls? What dolls do we have to take out?\u201d\u201cWho can go in and still stay rational\u00a0ah?!\u201d\u201cDirector, I don\u2019t want to go in, I really can\u2019t do it\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough,\u201d said the director, who had long gotten accustomed to this group\u2019s daily moaning and groaning. She looked just and stern as she ordered, \u201cNow, let\u2019s start forming groups\u00a0ba.\u201dAs soon as she said that, Ling Yi hugged Juexia\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m going with Juexia! One look and you can tell Juexia isn\u2019t the kind of person who\u2019s afraid of ghosts, so it\u2019s perfectly right to follow him.\u201dPei Tingsong glanced at the abandoned hospital. It was pitch-dark, and with Fang Juexia\u2019s night blindness, he\u2019d be completely lost and blind in there.\u201cFang Juexia will go with me.\u201d Pei Tingsong stepped forward and dragged him to his side.\u201cWhy? First come, first served! Aren\u2019t you not afraid of ghosts? And you still want to grab him from me!\u201d Ling Yi took Fang Juexia\u2019s hand and asked, \u201cJuexia, who do you say you want to go with?\u201dFang Juexia was about to open his mouth, but Pei Tingsong directly pulled him to hide him behind his body. He then stretched out a hand to grab onto Ling Yi\u2019s small head so that he couldn\u2019t get close to the two of them.\u201cHe will definitely choose me. You give up on this idea forever\u00a0ba.\u201dThe director promptly interrupted, \u201cHow about this\u00a0ba? Juexia, Ling Yi, and Xiao Pei in one group, while the remaining Ziyan, Lu Yuan, and Xiao Miao will be in another group. We\u2019ll base it on age, that\u2019s okay\u00a0ba?\u201dLing Yi replied, \u201cObjection!\u201dPei Tingsong said, \u201cYour objection is overruled.\u201dAfter hearing the director\u2019s announcement, Fang Juexia broke away from Pei Tingsong\u2019s clutches, twisted his wrist around a bit, and came out from behind Pei Tingsong\u2019s body.In fact, just now, he had almost called out Pei Tingsong\u2019s name. If it were any other activity, he would have been fine partnering with anyone, but there was no light in the haunted house, and Pei Tingsong was the only person here who knew about his night blindness. Overall, it would be more reliable to go in with him.\u201cThen first, Xiao Pei\u2019s group.\u201dLing Yi gave a start. \u201cWe-we\u2019re starting so soon?\u201d Saying that, he immediately stuck himself to Juexia just like a magnetic doll. \u201cJuexia, you have to protect me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try my best\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple rolled up and down, and he climbed up the steps of the haunted house with great anxiety.Pei Tingsong followed behind the two of them. Ling Yi stretched out a trembling hand and gently pushed open the dusty hospital door. With a squeak, the door opened, and there was a damp air inside of a place that had never been aired out. Pei Tingsong\u2019s throat still hadn\u2019t healed completely, and he coughed as soon as he stepped in.Upon hearing him cough, Fang Juexia looked back at him before quickly turning his head forward again.The first floor was similar to that of an ordinary hospital, but with the lobby deserted, the chairs against the wall devoid of people, and a semi cylindrical front desk was in the middle. Large red arrow stickers were pasted on the floor, outlining the way for the guests coming in.\u201cWhere can the dolls be\u00a0ah\u2026\u201d As soon as Ling Yi spoke, his voice started to float up.Fang Juexia was still calm. \u201cThey should be in those places with cameras.\u201dFollowing the arrows, the three people slowly moved towards the front desk. Ling Yi was so scared that he was holding onto Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder, and revealed only half of his head as he hid behind Fang Juexia\u2019s body.Fortunately, the main door wasn\u2019t closed, so he could still sort of see.Just as Fang Juexia had thought of that, a\u00a0bang\u00a0sounded out, and the door moved inwards from the outside to slam shut!\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d Ling Yi was so scared that he was actually stomping his feet. \u201cScared me to death!\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t find it strange to see Ling Yi scared to such a state, but what was strange was that Pei Tingsong actually suddenly hugged his right side. Fang Juexia, wearing a look of complete surprise, turned his head toward Pei Tingsong to look at him. \u201cYou\u2019re also afraid\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cWho said that? I\u2019m just trying to protect you.\u201dFang Juexia couldn\u2019t see his face clearly at all and didn\u2019t know whether he was really afraid or just pretending. If Pei Tingsong was really scared, then they were really done for. Two scaredy-cats and a blind man, when would they be able to finish the task?Ling Yi\u2019s voice shook as he spoke, \u201cIt\u2019s too dark here\u2026 They don\u2019t have even a single light?\u201dAs soon as he said that, the sound of a strange music box suddenly resounded within the lobby\u2014ding ding dong dong\u2014 and lingered in the hall. Fang Juexia could count as being quite brave, but even he was affected by this ghastly atmosphere.\u201cAh, this music is really,\u201d Pei Tingsong was about to curse, \u201cI even have goosebumps.\u201dThe music suddenly clicked to a stop. Seven or eight lights on the walls of the hospital lobby lit up, emitting a faint yellow light. However, for Juexia, they were basically useless. All of a sudden, a girl\u2019s voice came out of the radio, a thread of eeriness in her sweet voice. \u201cWelcome to the horror medical school\u2026 Excuse me, but what is your illness?\u201dThe last word, \u2018illness,\u2019 suddenly turned into a scream, and not far from them, at the vacant front desk, a female ghost with disheveled hair suddenly stood up. She was wearing a nurse\u2019s uniform and a nurse\u2019s hat, her pupils were all white, and her face was covered in blood. She also held a piece of paper in her hands, which she proffered out; it was red all over.\u201cAHHHHHHHHHHH!\u201dThe two screams, one high and one low, stacked together. Fang Juexia felt that his ears were about to explode, but he couldn\u2019t see anything clearly. He just felt his left side go empty, for Ling Yi seemed to have let go of his hand and run away. He looked over towards the sound of footsteps. \u201cLing Yi?\u201d\u201cAh, don\u2019t come over! I\u2019m going out, I\u2019m going out. Begging you guys to not come over here\u2026\u201dHe really ran away\u2026..Fang Juexia then thought of Pei Tingsong\u2019s scream just now. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you weren\u2019t afraid?\u201dPei Tingsong hadn\u2019t recovered from the fright caused by the ghost nurse yet, and his voice sounded completely weak. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t know that it would be so horrifying before I came in\u00a0ah! Also, I have never even been to a haunted house before, so how could I have known whether I\u2019d be afraid or not?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t even know whether you\u2019d be afraid or not, and you stated you weren\u2019t scared of it.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of saying that now?\u201d\u2026.The pair of white eyes on the ghost nurse opened wide, as they floated back and forth between these two people. Her hands were already feeling sore from keeping them up, so she couldn\u2019t help but interrupt these two strange but beautiful flowers, \u201cHey, do you guys want this\u00a0ah?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t see clearly, so he could only fumble around after stretching out his hand. However, Pei Tingsong grabbed hold of the document with a swish, and then he even bluffed, \u201cYou! Do you have any dolls here?\u201dThe ghost nurse Jiejie pulled her wig open and looked down to find a doll. \u201cHere.\u201d\u201cThank you\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong took the doll and dragged Fang Juexia, who still wanted to bow, into running away, only to hear the ghost nurse Jiejie yell from behind them, \u201cRemember to give this paper to the doctor in Room 202~\u201dThey heard Ling Yi\u2019s screams sound out from a distance, probably from the second floor, with each scream higher than the next.\u201cLing Yi is about to hit the\u00a0dolphin note.\u201d Fang Juexia looked up towards the second floor.Pei Tingsong\u2019s usual cool, fast talking routine had disappeared, leaving behind only the attribute of a trembling chatterbox. \u201cAh, it\u2019s really scary, it\u2019s too scary, why would anyone make such a horrifying place? Are those people who like to have fun in haunted houses all abnormal? They\u2019re all crazy\u00a0ba\u2026\u201dFang Juexia, who had practically been hefted up and carried away by him, wondered, \u201cDon\u2019t you study philosophy? And you\u2019re still afraid of ghosts\u00a0ah. Shouldn\u2019t you be an atheist?\u201dFollowing the red arrows, Pei Tingsong, with his long legs shaking, arrived at the stairs located at the rightmost part of the lobby. With every step he made, a light on the wall beside the stairs lit up, and they seemed to be proximity lights. \u201cWho told you that philosophy equals atheism? Early philosophy and religious studies were part of the same school of learning!\u201dAlthough he was afraid, he still carefully helped Fang Juexia slowly climb up the stairs one after the other. \u201cBesides, so atheists must be brave\u00a0ah? What kind of logic is\u2026\u201dJust as they tottered around the corner, from within the midst of the pitch-black darkness, a ghost wearing a patient uniform suddenly stood up. With long fangs and a livid face, he came at them!\u201cFuck! What the f\u2026\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong was so scared that he let out a whirlwind of curses as he threw his entire body against Fang Juexia, pushing him directly against the foot of the wall.Since this was for the group ensemble show, they\u2019d have to mute his audio for this episode later. Fang Juexia fumbled around in order to reach out and cover his Didi\u2019s mouth with his hand. \u201cShh\u2026 It\u2019s fake, it\u2019s fake. Your throat isn\u2019t even all better yet, don\u2019t yell.\u201d\u201cWu! Doll\u2026.Wu!\u201dOnly then did Fang Juexia remember. \u201cRight, right, has the doll been lost?\u201d He released his hand, upon which Pei Tingsong also released him. He then felt around for a long time on the ground, and when he found the lost doll, he pulled Fang Juexia up and ran away with him.\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard.\u201d Fang Juexia sensed where the scare actor was and bowed towards him, but because he couldn\u2019t see, he ended up bowing in the wrong direction.A perfectly good guy suddenly bowing to a wall devoid of ghosts\u2014 this actually scared the scare actor instead.Pei Tingsong tightly held onto Fang Juexia\u2019s hand and dragged him to climb the stairs\u2014deng deng deng\u2014and he didn\u2019t even dare to turn his head around. The proximity lights continued to light up with the sound of their footsteps, and finally, with great effort, they entered the second floor. Different from the lobby on the first floor, this floor contained a long cross-shaped corridor. There were four rooms in total, some with their doors open, and some with locked doors. The lights on the ceiling were dreadfully dim, and some of them seemed to be broken as they kept flickering non-stop.Even before he took a step, Pei Tingsong was so horrified that his scalp felt numb. \u201cCan this background music stop for a while\u00a0ah,\u00a0it keeps playing non-stop!\u201dFang Juexia, who was holding the document in his hand, kept thinking about what had happened at the front desk. \u201cThe girl from just now told us to go up to the second floor to room 202 to find the doctor.\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Pei Tingsong gripped Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder with one hand and moved with crab-like steps to the right side of the corridor, slowly inching forward. \u201cRoom 202\u2026 202, this one\u00a0ba.\u201d As soon as he looked up, he saw the metal tag with 202 written on it, and there was also something that looked like blood spattered on it. Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t dare to look at it more closely as he walked to the closed door.Fang Juexia also touched the door. Out of habit, he raised his hand and knocked. \u201cIs there anyone there?\u201d\u201cNo one is there, only ghosts!\u201d Pei Tingsong grasped the door handle and twisted it.A poker-faced Fang Juexia said, \u201cIn this world, there are no\u2026\u201d\u201cAh!!!\u00a0Holy shit!\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s cursing gave him a violent start. They were caught completely unaware by the ghost standing in front of them as soon as the door was opened. Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t see, so he just walked forward and ran into the scare actor who was playing the ghost.\u201cEh? Sorry, sorry, I ran into you, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d He stretched out his hand to touch the staff member, and then pulled Pei Tingsong into squeezing past this fake ghost to enter the room. \u201cDon\u2019t just casually curse people out\u00a0la.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like I meant to!\u201d Pei Tingsong felt that every new place they arrived at, part of his soul went missing, but Fang Juexia, throughout all of this, maintained an attitude of being completely fine, not panicking at all. \u201cFang Juexia, are you a psychopath? You\u2019re not scared at all.\u201dIt\u2019s not like I can even see anything.Fang Juexia tightened his grasp on this guide dog, who was constantly on the edge of mania, and walked into the room bit by bit. He tentatively called out, \u201cDoctor?\u201dPei Tingsong, holding a doll in one hand and Fang Juexia in the other, tried to keep his spirits up, and looked around the room. The light was dim, and the furnishings looked like those found in an ordinary clinic. A table was placed not far in front of them, and behind the table was a swivel chair, the back of which was facing towards them.Just based on intuition, Pei Tingsong knew that whatever was in the chair would be horrifying when it turned around.\u201cWarning\u00a0ahead, warning ahead, warningaheadwarningaheadwarningahead\u2026\u201dFang Juexia frowned and asked, \u201cWhy have you basically started up a barrage?\u201dPei Tingsong covered his eyes using the doll in his hand, grabbed the document from Fang Juexia\u2019s hand, and threw it onto the table in front of him.\u201cT-take it. Doctor, isn\u2019t this what you w-want?\u201dFang Juexia was amused by him. \u201cPei Tingsong, you\u2019re stuttering.\u201dThat chair swiveled around as expected, but Pei Tingsong kept his sight limited to the area below the doctor\u2019s head. He just saw him collect the document, slowly open a drawer, and take a chibi doll out from it.Pei Tingsong took one step forward, stretched his hand, grabbed the doll\u2019s foot, picked it up, and ran out. Upon seeing that ghost standing at the door, he once again started trembling from fright.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cAre we going now?\u201d Fang Juexia felt the door frame and waved at his back. \u201cSee you again.\u201d\u201cAgain??\u201d Pei Tingsong stuffed the two dolls into Fang Juexia\u2019s hands. \u201cTake them quickly. Stand here and don\u2019t move\u00a0ah.\u201d After that, he swiftly rushed over to the open door opposite this room, tactically executed a quick squint over the room, finally found a doll lying on a shelf full of disgusting specimens, and ran away after grabbing it. The fake corpse sitting inside the room didn\u2019t even get the time to scare him, he simply ended up watching this tall guy dash in and run away with his own eyes.Room 203 was an inpatient room with three beds. With their ten fingers tightly clasped together, Pei Tingsong pulled Fang Juexia into the ward, making sure to walk close to the wall. Pei Tingsong looked around to see if there was a doll while continuously chanting, \u201cDon\u2019t mess with me, don\u2019t mess with me, don\u2019t mess with me\u2026\u201dThe first two beds were empty, and there were neither any patients nor dolls in them. However, the curtain was pulled around the last bed.\u201cAh, this must be really horrifying. I don\u2019t want to go over there, please don\u2019t scare me, don\u2019t scare me\u2026\u201d Chattering on like a broken radio, the shivering Pei Tingsong still drew close to the last bed.Fang Juexia whispered beside him, \u201cYour hands are shaking so hard\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong clenched his teeth and pulled the curtain open. He was so frightened he directly backed up. \u201cAH!!!!!\u201d\u201cWow, that\u2019s so good, your voice just hit F5 right now. Is it possible for you to sing high notes too now?\u201d\u201cIs that the main point?!!\u201dHis guide dog\u2019s fur was about to explode. Fang Juexia held back a smile, and half-holding him while rubbing his back, consoled, \u201cIt\u2019s fake, it\u2019s fake, it\u2019s all fake.\u201dReclining on the bed was a fake corpse, whose facial features were blurry, and he held a doll in his arms.\u201cAh, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t,\u201d Pei Tingsong stretched out two fingers, lifted the doll\u2019s head, and pulled it out. \u201cFour now, and there are still two left, let\u2019s go quickly.\u201dThe last room was a mortuary, and was lit up with faint green light. As soon as Pei Tingsong opened the door, the \u201ccorpses\u201d inside, which were a bunch of\u00a0possessed corpses, sat up one by one. This scared Pei Tingsong so much that his legs went soft, and he fell directly onto the side of the door.\u201cEpicurus,\u00a0Democritus,\u00a0Lucretius,\u00a0Spinoza,\u00a0Hobbes,\u00a0La Mettrie,\u00a0Feuerbach,\u00a0Sartre\u2026\u201dFang Juexia felt around in the dark and pulled Pei Tingsong up. He felt this action of his was completely inexplicable and asked, \u201cWhat are you chanting?\u201d\u201cThe great\u00a0ath\u2013atheists\u00a0in history, bless and protect me, bless and protect me, don\u2019t let them mess with me.\u201dFang Juexia couldn\u2019t help laughing. He copied the manner in which Pei Tingsong was chanting and started reciting, \u201cOne times one is one, one times two is two, one times three is three, one times four is four\u2026\u201dProbably because of how fear tended to make some people more agile, Pei Tingsong quickly managed to find the last two dolls. \u201cWhy is it that you recite the multiplication table all the time?\u201d\u201cAll the time?\u201d Fang Juexia didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhen else did I recite it?\u201dPei Tingsong took his hand and ran out of the mortuary. \u201cWhen you were drunk, you kept reciting it for the whole night!\u201d\u201cReally\u2026\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t know what had happened; everything was utterly pitch black in here, and he, who couldn\u2019t see anything, could only be dragged to and fro by Pei Tingsong. But, whenever Fang Juexia heard him scream and curse, he didn\u2019t feel like it was scary at all, instead, he just found it very funny.\u201cYou\u2019re even laughing.\u201d After exiting the mortuary and returning to the corridor, Pei Tingsong leaned against the wall and took a deep breath. Finally, this thing could count as being done. After following the arrows to go downstairs, this entire ordeal should be over with.\u201cHow can you still laugh?\u201dFang Juexia, who was holding a pile of dolls, tried very hard to suppress his laughter. \u201cBecause you are very cute\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cCute??\u201d As soon as he heard that, Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t feel pleased, and so he feigned a very cool and very powerful look. \u201cWho are you saying is cute?\u201dHowever, this haunted house didn\u2019t offer him any breathing room. As soon as he was about to harshly defend himself, a group of people, all of whom had only one leg, actually appeared at the end of the corridor, with all of them dressed in school uniforms and hopping towards them just like\u00a0jiangshi. All of them held a pen in their hand and their gesture made it seem that they were going to stab the visitors with it.Pei Tingsong was so frightened by this that he once again let out a string of English curse words. He thought that these ghosts would all rush over together to frighten him, but unexpectedly, they actually rushed at Fang Juexia. Three or two of them even grabbed his shoulders and arms.Fang Juexia, who was forcibly taken away, was still a little confused. \u201cHey? How come there are so many\u00a0ah\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, the dolls are gone.\u201d Fang Juexia only had one task in mind.Pei Tingsong was scared to death, and his courage had nearly been shattered, but even though he was trembling, he still went forward to push the strange ghost students aside. \u201cDon\u2019t pull him, thank you, thank you\u2026.\u00a0God! Da Jie, your make-up is too scary\u2026\u201dUpon grabbing hold of Fang Juexia\u2019s wrist in the dark, Pei Tingsong\u2019s suspended heart finally fell back down. \u201cCome here.\u201d He jerked fiercely, and pulled Fang Juexia back into his arms.The ghost students behind them were still trying to perform their crazy siege scene, and so Pei Tingsong was left with only the option of holding Fang Juexia against the wall as he tried to block the ghosts with his back. \u201cDon\u2019t come here, you guys. Quickly go away\u00a0ba, go.\u201dShifting Fang Juexia closer to himself had been done in too much of a hurry, and he had not been able to control either his strength or the distance between them. Pei Tingsong\u2019s head lowered, and he overlooked the last few inches of distance between them, thus accidentally rubbing the side of Fang Juexia\u2019s face.In this fleeting moment, his soft lips skimmed past smooth skin and stopped at Fang Juexia\u2019s ear.It was dark and chaotic, but Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t feel that at all. His back was against the ice-cold wall, but Pei Tingsong\u2019s chest stuck against him was warm, very warm.Their bodies were stuck so close to one another that they were nearly hand in glove. Pei Tingsong\u2019s chest\u2019s undulations, due to agitation, produced a vivid tide in Fang Juexia\u2019s body.He could smell the tiny bit of cologne Pei Tingsong was wearing\u2014sea salt mixed with a hint of musk, as wisps of it wafted up, rubbing against the side of Fang Juexia\u2019s face just like its owner. Hot breaths kept puffing right into his ear; these big breaths, enlarged and elongated in the dark, tangled around him like seaweed and kissed him all over his body.The office ambush, the horror assault, the weird music being played in a loop, and the ghosts dressed in disguise\u2014 all failed before that.It wasn\u2019t until this moment that Fang Juexia started to feel shivers.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong chanted in a low voice, and who knows who he was chanting it to. He tentatively looked back, and only after realizing that all of the ghost students had already disappeared did he let out a breath.\u201cThey finally left.\u201d Pei Tingsong let out a long sigh of relief and looked at Fang Juexia. \u201cDo you still think I\u2019m cute?\u201dHe didn\u2019t know if it was because it was too dark, but Fang Juexia seemed to have been nailed scared into his spot, like a little bunny that didn\u2019t dare to move.You could still get scared enough into falling down even without being able to see anything?All of a sudden, Pei Tingsong, who was half a step late in realizing that they had been too close to each other before, quickly separated from Fang Juexia and squatted down in a hurry. \u201cA-all the dolls are lost, I\u2019ll go pick them up.\u201dFang Juexia leaned against the wall and took a deep breath.Right now, he was like a stranded fish that had just been rescued by the tide.\u201cLet\u2019s go\u00a0ba.\u201d Pei Tingsong held a stack of dolls in his left arm and held onto Fang Juexia with his right hand. They quickly left the creepy corridor on the second floor, and Pei Tingsong hurried downstairs as fast as he could without making Fang Juexia fall over or trip, and then followed the arrows to find the exit, finally exiting this damned abandoned hospital.\u201cWow!!! They finally came out!\u201d\u201cLing Yi, this coward, abandoned you guys and pumped his short little legs to run out the entire way.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one with short little legs!\u201dJiang Miao came up to the two people and asked, \u201cYou guys are alright\u00a0ba?\u00a0You guys are very powerful\u00a0ah, you brought them all out.\u201dPei Tingsong hugged the dolls, his soul almost gone. \u201cI will definitely have nightmares tonight.\u201dThe director looked at the time and announced, \u201c29 minutes and 34 seconds, a bit faster than we expected, very good!\u201d29 minutes 34 seconds. As Fang Juexia chanted this number in his heart, only then did he discover that his internal clock had completely failed.Because of Pei Tingsong\u2019s presence, it hadn\u2019t ticked for a single second. It was broken, completely broken.It was a small haunted house, but they seemed to have spent a long time walking its confines. The clock in his heart was no longer objective, and no longer could it measure and accumulate time on the basis of the established criteria.He Ziyan glanced at the two people\u2019s hands. \u201cAnd you\u2019re still holding hands.\u201dThese two people were startled at the same time and hastily separated their intertwined hands.\u201cThe next group is going in! Ziyan, Yuanyuan, and Miaomiao, get ready!\u201d\u201cOkay\u2014\u201dFang Juexia walked a few steps towards the front by himself and crouched down. He didn\u2019t know what lingering fear was still pestering him, for he clearly hadn\u2019t even seen one ghost.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Pei Tingsong came up to him and also crouched down. \u201cI just walked out in a hurry, did you bump into something? Let me see.\u201dFang Juexia shook his head, took off his hat, straightened it out and then put it back on his head. The brim of his hat covered his eyes, and he buried his head into his knees. His fine pale neck stretched out, and as lights shone there, his thin layer of sweat was laid sparklingly bare.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Pei Tingsong crouched in front of him, touched his knee, and stretched his hand to cover Fang Juexia\u2019s exposed neck.Fang Juexia said in a muffled voice, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s palms were covered in damp sweat, and it seemed as if they were pressing on the hot temperature under his skin, imprinting that along with the hallucination of the endless low breaths by his ear directly into his flesh and blood.\u201cMy legs are a little soft.\u201d\u2014The author has something to say :K Omake:After He Ziyan, Lu Yuan, and Jiang Miao enter the haunted house\u2014\u2014They meet the little Jiejie at the front desk:He Ziyan: \u201cWow, uniform allure.\u201dLu Yuan: \u201cFire Ge, your tastes are a bit strong\u2026\u201dThe little Jiejie hands over the papers:Jiang Miao: \u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard\u00a0la~\u201dReached the second floor:He Ziyan: \u201cEach person, search one room\u00a0ah.\u201dOpen the door, see a ghost:He Ziyan: \u201cWow\u2026\u201d Goes around them.Lu Yuan enters the specimen room. \u201cOld He, your doll is so ugly.\u201dJiang Miao enters the inpatient ward. \u201cThere\u2019s a bed here.\u201d Pulls open the curtain. \u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard\u00a0la,\u00a0oh, it\u2019s fake.\u201dThe three of them pull open the door of the mortuary, and all the corpses sit up. All three of them sigh emotionally, \u201cWow, so cool.\u201d They close the door and pull it back open, and the corpses sit up again.The three people: \u201cWow, so cool, do it again!\u201dCorpses: Are you guys just playing with us?Ghost students came up, and they pulled them to do karaoke together.\u201cHave you heard our songs before? Kaleido, have you heard of us?\u201dGhost students: Confused\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The atmosphere was awkwardly quiet outside the haunted house.Ling Yi scratched his head doubtfully. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it scaring them? They didn\u2019t enter the same haunted house as us\u00a0ba.\u201dHe Ziyan, Lu Yuan, and Jiang Miao came out much faster than they had. The three of them jogged out, each person carrying two dolls in their hands, and they seemed to be panting a bit.Pei Tingsong immediately tugged Ling Yi over to witness this. \u201cAren\u2019t they also panting? They were still scared a little bit, okay.\u201dLu Yuan swung his arms around a little. \u201cNo\u00a0ah,\u00a0we were just dancing around inside.\u201d\u201cYou guys are cynically toxic\u00a0ba?\u201d\u00a0Ling Yi asked with an incredulous expression.\u201cTch.\u201d Pei Tingsong looked completely disdainful, brooding in his heart about how everyone had raised their hand before they had entered the haunted house. \u201cThen when I had asked if anyone was scared of ghosts, how come everyone raised their hands?\u201dHaving stood there the entire time without interrupting, Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help letting out a laugh when he heard that. He then copied what Pei Tingsong had said before in the haunted house. \u201cNone of them had gone in before, so how could they have known if they were scared or not? Only after going in did they realize they weren\u2019t scared.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha, yeah.\u201dLing Yi was actually feeling very proud of himself. \u201cOnly I am an honest child, having a very accurate understanding of myself. Ling Yi, Ling Yi, the inside and the outside all agree.\u201dPei Tingsong didn\u2019t continue to struggle with the issue of them raising their hands anymore, for all of his attention was being attracted by Fang Juexia as he stared at his expression of having to work very hard to hold back a smile.This guy was actually starting to make jokes about him now?He unceremoniously stretched out both of his hands to hold Fang Juexia\u2019s face and vigorously kneaded it. \u201cYour mouth is growing strong now\u00a0ah, Fang Juexia.\u201dNormally, since Pei Tingsong often teased him while making moves at him, Fang Juexia should have become long used to it. However, he didn\u2019t know why, but when Pei Tingsong touched him now, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t feel right. His heart started beating very fast, and even his fingers felt numb.\u201cLet go of me.\u201d He pushed Pei Tingsong aside, looking as if he had received an electric shock, and retreated back several steps.Fang Juexia\u2019s skin was too thin, and as soon as it was rubbed, it turned red and hot. Seeing him like this, Pei Tingsong was left stunned for a second. All of a sudden, he found that his senses also seemed to have developed the freedom to choose whether to let the sensation last or not; it turned out that not every feeling would disappear at the same time, just like how the smooth and soft feeling of his fingers rubbing against the other party\u2019s skin hadn\u2019t dispersed up to now.For Fang Juexia, his senses instead remained still.Shaking the hands that had already come down, Pei Tingsong coughed several times, took a bottle of water from a staff member\u2019s hand, and applied a bit of strength to unscrew the tight bottle cap, with his palms even growing red from the force he used. Yet, the sensation left from when he touched Fang Juexia\u2019s cheek still stubbornly refused to leave.Thinking of this, he suddenly wanted to tease Fang Juexia by pranking him. Probably because he had lost so much face in the haunted house, he was eager to find something to make up for it. So Pei Tingsong walked over to him while carrying the water bottle, calling out his name. Fang Juexia raised his hand, the redness in his cheeks having halfway faded. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cI also don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s acting was quite real, his entire face showing doubt as he continued, \u201cFor the past two days, my tongue keeps hurting. Before, I thought it was because I had a cold and it was inflamed, but now, even though my cold is much better, the tip of my tongue somehow keeps hurting more and more.\u201dAlthough Fang Juexia didn\u2019t have many expressions, he also wasn\u2019t really a person who could pretend, so as soon as he heard Pei Tingsong\u2019s words, his face changed a bit.\u201cHelp me look, did the skin break? It even hurts when I drink water.\u201d Saying that, he put the water bottle down on the ground, opened his mouth, and slightly stretched out his tongue. Fang Juexia stared at the tip of his tongue, and there really was an obvious wound there. Pei Tingsong saw him reflexively shrinking away and raised a hand to pull him back. \u201cYou\u2019re so far away, and you can see\u00a0ah,\u00a0your eyes are just that good?\u201dFang Juexia blinked quickly and licked his dry lips. \u201cIt looks like\u2026it looks like there\u2019s a small wound, an ulcer. It\u2019ll probably take a few more days to get better.\u201d\u201cAn ulcer?\u201d Pei Tingsong purposefully emphasized these words, in order to aggravate a certain someone\u2019s guilt. He then frowned and complained, \u201cWhat to do? It hurts a lot\u00a0ah, I can\u2019t even eat any food. How could I have bitten my own tongue?\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s eyes drifted away to the side, his guilty conscience clearly written on his face. \u201cDrink more water and eat more fruits and vegetables. It\u2019ll get better very soon, it\u2019s not very serious.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Pei Tingsong stared at him. He couldn\u2019t imagine how this person had hardened his heart to both bite and hit him. He was particularly curious about what Fang Juexia\u2019s expression and mood must have been like at that time. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a small medicine box? Is there any medication to treat ulcers in it?\u201d\u201cThere is.\u201d Fang Juexia finally took the initiative to open his mouth, saying, \u201cAfter we go back, I\u2019ll spray a little for you, and it should stop the pain.\u201dPei Tingsong laughed innocently. \u201cThen thank you Ge,\u00a0la.\u201dFang Juexia whispered \u2018no problem\u2019, then picked up the water bottle, which was on the ground, in a hurry, unscrewed it, and took a drink.\u201cThat\u2019s my bottle.\u201dHe nearly spit it out, but he held back in time, and so his cheeks bulged.\u201cYou drink\u00a0ah, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Pei Tingsong felt that he had pretty much found the most interesting thing to do in the world, which was teasing Fang Juexia. Watching as he swallowed awkwardly, he went ahead and added another sentence.\u201cYou still mind that with me\u00a0ah.\u201dAfter all the haunted house specials were recorded, the director announced the results, \u201cThe elder group here\u2026\u201dHe Ziyan and Lu Yuan objected in a united voice, \u201cWhat elder group\u00a0ah?!\u201dJiang Miao smiled. \u201cOnly I am an elder, oh well.\u201dThe other two were still not satisfied. \u201cDirector, we\u2019re still fresh meat, okay?\u201d\u201cOkay, okay, okay, you\u2019re not the elder group, not the elder group.\u201d The director immediately changed her words. \u201cThe senior citizens group took 18 minutes and 23 seconds, and even sang a song while inside.\u201dLing Yi laughed loudly. \u201cHahaha, the senior citizens group!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny? You lost, okay?\u201d Pei Tingsong pressed down on Ling Yi\u2019s head, which, because of the laughter, was trembling, making his hair look like flowers fluttering chaotically. When he turned his head, he saw that Fang Juexia was also laughing with his head half-lowered, and so the corners of his mouth rose up.Fang Juexia looked good when he laughed, but he just didn\u2019t laugh often.\u201cThen is it time to punish the younger group?\u201d\u201cYes\u00a0ah, we\u2019re waiting for that.\u201dThe director group took out a lottery box, within which were many lots of rolled up paper. Pei Tingsong had a headache as soon as he saw this. \u201cNo way\u00a0ba,\u00a0we have to draw lots again? Can you guys come up with some new trick\u00a0ah?\u201dA staff member, who didn\u2019t appear on camera, said from behind the screen, \u201cHow about we do a spinning wheel next time? Let Xiao Pei spin it around with a\u00a0whir\u00a0himself.\u201d The rest of the people all laughed. Pei Tingsong always had bad luck, and so this time, he simply didn\u2019t even reach his hand out. He just raised his chin to Ling Yi a few times. \u201cYou, go and draw.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Ling Yi swung his two sleeves around, protesting, \u201cIf I draw something bad, won\u2019t you just throw the\u00a0blame\u00a0on me? I\u2019m not going to do such a stupid thing.\u201dIn the end, Fang Juexia was the only one from the losing younger team who was willing to take this blame. He held the lottery box and shook it without saying anything, shaking it very seriously at that. This action of his made him look a little silly, and Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help but complain, \u201cWhat are you doing? It\u2019s really like you\u2019re drawing lots.\u201dFang Juexia glanced at him, and his light brown pupils were very bright under the sun. With just a glance, he turned back, shook the box, and while wearing a completely calm expression, imitated Pei Tingsong\u2019s famous scene from within the haunted house\u2014 \u201cGreat atheists in history\u00a0ah, bless me to draw a good lot\u00a0ba.\u201cAll the people on scene laughed at that, and the director also fanned the flames. \u201cLater, remember to add a subtitle. This sentence from now on will be called the \u2018Haunted House Paradox\u2019.\u201d\u201cHahahahahaha.\u201dHowever, sadly, Fang Juexia, whose full attention was concentrated on poking fun at others, didn\u2019t expect that he would once again throw himself into a pit. As soon as he unfolded the paper he drew from the lottery, a smear of darkness appeared before his eyes.He hadn\u2019t really been infected by Pei Tingsong\u2019s bad luck\u00a0ba?\u201cJuexia, read out the contents of the punishment.\u201d The director reminded him.Fang Juexia\u2019s voice became a little weak as he said, \u201cBungee jumping\u2026\u201dHe Ziyan let out a meaningful \u201cwow\u201d and said, \u201cA warrior\u2019s game.\u201dLu Yuan was also excited. \u201cHurry up, I want to see your guys\u2019 leap of faith!\u201d\u201cJuexia is very good at drawing\u00a0ah. Bungee jumping is also a major attraction of the park, coming second only to the haunted house.\u201d The director said, \u201cThe total height of the bungee jumping here is only\u00a025 meters. In fact, it\u2019s not very high.\u201d25 meters still wasn\u2019t high\u2026. Fang Juexia converted this specific figure into the image of the actual height in his heart, and as soon as he thought about it, his legs started to feel soft. He had been a bit afraid of heights since he was a child, and even though he didn\u2019t have a serious fear of heights, he still didn\u2019t even dare to touch high-altitude events. He hadn\u2019t expected that after hiding away from it thousands and tens of thousands of times, he wouldn\u2019t be able to hide from this disaster this time. And of course, it just had to be this doomed activity of bungee jumping.Aware of Fang Juexia\u2019s renewed silence, Pei Tingsong bumped his shoulder against his. \u201cAre you afraid\u00a0ah?\u201dHe had thought that Fang Juexia would struggle a bit, but he hadn\u2019t expected him to raise his head, and with a completely serious expression, nod twice. Unexpectedly, he was very honest.Pei Tingsong was amused by his appearance and laughed. \u201cWeren\u2019t you laughing at me quite happily just now? I thought you feared nothing in this life,\u201d he teased, but upon seeing that Fang Juexia looked very nervous now, he put on a comforting look. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s much faster than the haunted house. You just go up and then, with a whoosh, jump down, and it\u2019s over really fast. You see, even Ling Yi isn\u2019t afraid.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, even I\u2019m not afraid?\u201d Ling Yi stared at him, and then became abuzz with excitement. \u201cMy favorite thing is high-altitude projects.\u201dGod. Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t understand this spirit of pursuing excitement. However, if he was willing to bet, then he had to be willing to lose, and since they were also recording it for the ensemble show, it wouldn\u2019t be good if he deserted the field of battle. The big group moved from the haunted house attraction to the bungee jumping area. The number of tourists in the park had increased by now, and many people started to follow them and take pictures. In order to save time and to distract these followers, the production team split into two groups. The winning group of three people went to go shoot their part, and another group followed the three bungee jumpers.They took the elevator to the top. As soon as the door opened, the strong wind made his coat puff up. Fang Juexia zipped himself up, experiencing the strong stimulation of being at a great height in just a glance. They were way too high up, so high that the whole amusement park\u2019s landscape was laid out before their eyes. The bungee jumping platform also just had to be built with completely tempered glass, and it had been cleaned very well, with not even a single thing obstructing one\u2019s view, and so every step was completely terrifying.As soon as they came out of the elevator, Ling Yi excitedly went to go find and chat with the coach. Fang Juexia only dared to take small step after small step as he exited it.Only after seeing these hesitant steps did Pei Tingsong realize how scared Fang Juexia was, so he carelessly grasped his shoulder and leaned against him.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t push him away; standing at such a height, he didn\u2019t dare to move. What\u2019s more, Pei Tingsong\u2019s action was very effective. Having someone close to him in this high up place let Fang Juexia\u2019s heart feel a little calmer, since he now had the assurance that there was something he could at least lean on.\u201cYou\u2019re really not afraid at all.\u201d He opened his mouth and said, while his eyes were still aimed down.Pei Tingsong nodded. \u201cWith regards to bungee jumping, I\u2019ve done\u00a0100 or 200 meter\u00a0ones, so compared with that, this is all child\u2019s play. I\u2019ve also done extreme skiing, rappelling, low altitude skydiving, and surfing. I can do all these extreme sports, and I like them very much,\u201d he said all this with great familiarity and with a smile. \u201cBy the way, I can also fly a plane, the kind you need a license for.\u201d\u201cReally powerful.\u201dHow could such a person be afraid of ghosts? Too strange. Fang Juexia\u2019s attention had been diverted a little, but when he looked at the empty space below his face, his heart still palpitated.\u201cDon\u2019t look down there.\u201d Pei Tingsong moved Fang Juexia\u2019s face to face himself. \u201cYou clearly know you\u2019re scared, but you still look.\u201dFang Juexia nervously swallowed. \u201cWeren\u2019t you the same in the haunted house\u2026.clearly, you were scared, but you still continued with the task.\u201dPei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help laughing. Fang Juexia really had the face to say that, without even thinking who he had really done all that for.He found that when people started getting along with each other, they could really change and influence each other. This guy in front of him hadn\u2019t learnt anything good from him, instead learning all this bad stuff; he had stolen his entire temper, and if they didn\u2019t mention anything else, he was at least becoming increasingly smooth at talking back at people.A staff member came forward to help Pei Tingsong put on the protective gear, and it was only then that he released Fang Juexia\u2019s hand. \u201cThen you just learn from me\u00a0bei. Anyway, I know no matter how scared you are, you will still jump.\u201d Then he turned and asked the staff member to help him fix his belt and rope.\u201cYou know again,\u201d Fang Juexia said this, but his tone was not rhetorical. It was very light and very calm, seemingly lighter than the wind on the high platform, but somehow it still floated into Pei Tingsong\u2019s ears.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgPei Tingsong, who was just one step away from leaping off, stood still on the edge, then suddenly turned back and laughed at him. \u201cYeah, I just know. Because you are Fang Juexia.\u201dThese words pierced through some unknown part of Fang Juexia\u2019s heart, making him feel both a bit sour and numb, while also making him a little happy. However, he didn\u2019t want to think too much about the meaning of that. He had noticed himself spending too much time and energy every day studying each word Pei Tingsong said to him. It was really strange, and it really wasn\u2019t in line with his straightforward logic for life.Maybe it has nothing to do with him at all; it might just be his neurotransmitters being stimulated by the high altitude.The staff member put a GoPro helmet on Pei Tingsong\u2019s head and started the camera. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t really dare to watch the scene of the moment he jumped down. He thought it would be frightening, and could only hold the pole and half turn around, as he listened to Ling Yi and other staff members count down in unison.His heart pounded heavily for those last three moments, and then he heard Ling Yi\u2019s cheers.His shoulders gradually relaxed, and Fang Juexia took a deep breath, then gave a long exhale, but his tension was undiminished. Soon it was Ling Yi\u2019s turn. He rushed over and hugged Fang Juexia tightly. Only then did he stand on the edge of the platform and say, \u201cJuexia, watch me! I\u2019m going to jump!\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s face turned a bit pale, but he still turned around, and attempted to smile at Ling Yi. \u201cGood luck.\u201dLing Yi happily blew him a kiss, and then he loudly started the countdown, \u201cThree! Two! One!\u201d At the moment he leaped, he was still shouting, \u201cThe younger group is the most handsome, long live Kaleido and Dominoes\u2014\u201dNow, only he was left on the high, tall platform. Fang Juexia could hardly feel the existence of his legs at this point. He wanted to crouch down, but the floor was also transparent. He felt numb all over, and his palms were soaked in cold sweat.\u201cIs Juexia OK? Would you like to give it a try?\u201d The staff member took his arm and consoled him, \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary to punish him\u00a0la. Anyway, two people have already jumped.\u201dAnother staff member also nodded and said, \u201cYes\u00a0ah, if he\u2019s really scared of heights, he\u2019s probably really uncomfortable.\u201dIn fact, to be honest, since they had already come all the way up here, Fang Juexia really wanted to give it a go. He had always thought that if he tried bungee jumping, his threshold for tolerating heights could be raised a little bit.\u201cI can try,\u201d he finally said, taking off his hat and handing it to the staff member. Then he called out to the coach. \u201cTroubling you to please help me put on my armor, thank you.\u201d\u201cThe little handsome Ge has a lot of courage\u00a0ma.\u201d The coach was a cheerful middle-aged man, and he reassured Fang Juexia, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, our safety measures are very much in place. You just take a deep breath, close your eyes, fall back, and it\u2019ll be over. It\u2019s very simple.\u201dHowever, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t hear a single word of this as he concentrated on dragging himself little by little over to the edge of the jumping platform, and his legs felt so soft that he could hardly stand, only being able to pull on the coach\u2019s arm. Forget about even looking down, his eyes were tightly shut, and he didn\u2019t dare to open them.The coach pulled the belt and patted Fang Juexia on the shoulder twice after confirming that it was safe. \u201cGood luck, little handsome Ge. One jump gives you great popularity, and two jumps give you a great fortune.\u201dOnce would be enough, it would be over soon.He even imagined the sensation of weightlessness in his mind in advance, just to prepare himself to be able to endure it better later.He wasn\u2019t afraid, he wasn\u2019t afraid at all.Don\u2019t be scared, don\u2019t be scared, don\u2019t be scared\u2026\u201cPrepare yourself\u00a0ah, I\u2019m going to start the countdown. Three\u2014\u201dThe countdown was suddenly interrupted. \u201cEh? Why have you come back?\u201dCome back? What coming back?He heard the coach laugh, and then also pat his arm as he said, \u201cYou see, what I said is right\u00a0ba, someone really wanted to come back to jump a second time.\u201dThe strong wind had disturbed Fang Juexia\u2019s soft hair, making him look like a miserable small animal. He hesitated, frowning, and slowly opened his eyes. In his shaking field of vision appeared Pei Tingsong, who walked on the transparent glass floor step by step, with the spring sunshine making his smile seem lazy.\u201cYou\u2019re really about to jump\u00a0ah.\u201d He looked at Fang Juexia, who was already dressed to go, and his eyes were full of smiles.Fang Juexia, who had been long rendered unable of speech, only nodded his head slightly, making himself appear even more pitiful. He didn\u2019t know what Pei Tingsong wanted to do by coming up here; did he want to witness his first bungee jumping experience? Or did it count as being more of an experience if he stood here and watched this joke? He thought a lot in his head, and his pupils swayed with his thoughts.The more Pei Tingsong looked, the cuter he thought Fang Juexia was. He also saw him quietly holding the coach\u2019s arm and unconsciously raised his eyebrows.\u201cHe\u2019s afraid of heights.\u201d Pei Tingsong walked over to the coach and said to the staff, \u201cI\u2019ll join him, and we\u2019ll do a two-person jump.\u201dThis sentence came suddenly, and no one could have imagined it. Fang Juexia also looked at him, without saying a word. Pei Tingsong directly reached out and pulled him back, joking, \u201cWhat are you looking at me for, are you moved\u00a0ah? If you\u2019re moved, cry a bit for me to see.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing back here?\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s voice carried his usual cold tone as soon as he opened his mouth, but his hand had already transferred from the coach\u2019s arm to Pei Tingsong\u2019s wrist, and he held him tightly, as if subconsciously, he was looking for a more familiar and comfortable sense of security.\u201cIt was really refreshing jumping down, and I want to do it again.\u201d The coach helped them put on the two-person protective gear. Pei Tingsong raised his hand and neatened Fang Juexia\u2019s hair, which had been disturbed by the wind. His tone was much softer as he said, \u201cBy the way, I\u2019ll help you get through this heavenly tribulation.\u201d\u201cHeavenly tribulation.\u201d Fang Juexia repeated these two words in a low voice. He was surprised; this child who had grown up abroad somehow had learned all these strange and eccentric things. However, these words were also quite appropriate right now; this really seemed to be a rather big disaster in his twenty plus years of life, and the danger level put it in the top three.With this in mind, he glanced at Pei Tingsong again.This guy\u2019s danger level was high, too. He was really too panicked at the moment, so much so that he was picking any path he could find to escape, which led him to solving one danger by relying on another.The staff member was about to place the helmets on them when they discovered that the last GoPro was broken and couldn\u2019t record any footage. \u201cShould we wait a bit? Wait for them to bring up the previous one.\u201d\u201cJuexia after great effort made all his mental preparations, and who knows if he\u2019ll dare to go if we wait. How about we just don\u2019t record his perspective?\u201d Another staff member contacted someone at the bottom of the attraction with a walkie talkie, telling them that they would only take the perspective of the jump from the top, and they discussed to just to take the perspective of Pei Tingsong jumping down, while someone else recorded from the bottom for Fang Juexia.The coach fixed the rope and confirmed it again. \u201cOkay, we\u2019re ready. Two little handsome Ge, you can double jump now. Shall I give you a countdown?\u201dPei Tingsong shook his head, said thank you, and then pulled on Fang Juexia\u2019s arm to get him to move forward bit by bit. The wind on the platform became stronger and stronger, wheeling around in midair. The cold air held them tight, and the clear blue sky almost seemed as if it were within reach. Amidst the roaring wind, Fang Juexia heard Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice. He told him to close his eyes, so he really closed his eyes.He had never done anything too crazy in his life. Even when pursuing his dream, he made sure to follow his own rules and procedures that he controlled, thus making steady progress step by step. Stability gave him a sense of security. Being derailed, revelry, and loss of control\u2014these were all the sorts of dangerous factors Fang Juexia had tried to avoid for his 20 plus years of life.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you a story\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cA story?\u201d Fang Juexia listened to his voice and raised his head.\u201cEn.\u201d Pei Tingsong stood on the platform, turned his back onto the high altitude he was about to fall into, faced Fang Juexia who had closed his eyes, stretched out his arm, and pulled him into his arms. \u201cDid you know? It\u2019s said that bungee jumping originated in\u00a0Vanuatu, a country in the South Pacific archipelago. People there believe that only those who have undergone the high altitude test count as adults. So, hundreds of years ago, the men of their tribe would tie their legs with vines, then jump from a wooden tower more than 30 meters high, and stop with a\u00a0shh\u00a0no more than 10 centimeters above the ground.\u201d\u201cAnd then?\u201d Fang Juexia, who still had his eyes closed, asked.\u201cAnd then\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong lowered his head to confirm that he had already stepped onto the edge, and half of his foot was hanging in midair. He continued, \u201cThe villagers would hold a big bonfire party for him to celebrate his determination and courage. They viewed this high fall as a great rite of passage.\u201dAt the end of this story, he put his arms around Fang Juexia and fell back. Without the tension created by the countdown, everything came too quickly, and utterly without warning. Fang Juexia\u2019s heart almost came to a sudden halt; he was hugged and then fell into a storm, a complete vortex of weightlessness.So it turned out\u2014a real fall was like this. Every crevice of his body was penetrated by the galloping wind, and his soul smashed into the empty sky. Fear, hesitation, and timidity were all swept away by the wind, and from instinct, that one-way hug turned into a tight mutual hug. Both of their body temperatures were hot, and their heartbeats also collided together, striking directly into each other\u2019s chests. These senses were all telling Fang Juexia that he was not alone.He fell while being hugged, completely safe and free.\u201cWould you like to open your eyes?\u201dThe roaring wind was like a howling alarm, but it couldn\u2019t stop his voice. Fang Juexia tried to open his eyes. The inverted view that came into his vision was too intriguing\u2014he saw the whole world spinning up into the sky, and also saw Pei Tingsong close at hand. Their gazes met in the wild wind, and Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes were laughing, his dark pupils reflecting the open sky, and his own face as well. It was just like in the story; they fell through and hung in the air with courage and determination.When the alarm finally stopped, Pei Tingsong drew closer to Fang Juexia\u2019s ear\u2014\u201cYou\u2019re an adult now, Gege.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He untied the rope and returned his feet to the ground. His steps didn\u2019t feel quite right, with each step feeling as if he was still stepping in the clouds, moving up and down, deep and shallow.\u201cHow are you now?\u201d Pei Tingsong walked up to him in a few steps and asked, \u201cAre you less scared now?\u201dScared.After this experience, he had finally managed to calculate\u00a0 the magnitude of all these dangers. There was nothing that could compare to Pei Tingsong, he was the biggest and most uncontrollable risk.\u201cMuch better,\u201d Fang Juexia looked at the shadow on the ground and answered.He only had a vague memory of the latter part of the trip to the amusement park, half of his soul seeming to still be hanging in the air 20 meters away for that whole duration. Later on, no matter what they played or did, he only seemed to be vaguely participating. Even the director joked that they seemed to have badly scared Fang Juexia out of his mind. Later, more and more fans had come to watch them, so they had to finish the shoot ahead of time.After a day of playing, and then even getting to end work early, everyone was especially happy. Lu Yuan went to the company to meet with the choreographer, and He Ziyan also went with him to discuss the arrangement of the music. Jiang Miao\u2019s little sister was about to celebrate her birthday, so he pulled in Ling Yi, who was always good at handling people, to accompany him in buying gifts and ordering a cake for a surprise party.Fang Juexia\u2019s plan was to go back to the dormitory to take a bath, rest for an hour, and then go to the company\u2019s practice room to practice dancing. However, when he came out of the bathroom, he realised that he and Pei Tingsong were once again the only ones left in the dormitory. The other party was just like him, he had also just taken a bath, and was wearing a set of white cotton pajamas as he took out a bottle of ice water from the refrigerator and gulped it down.He wasn\u2019t completely over his cold, yet he was already wearing so little.However, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t utter these kinds of nagging words, because it didn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with him. He closed the bathroom door and headed straight back to his bedroom. He helped Ling Yi by picking up a Minion doll that had fallen onto the floor and put it on the table before going to bed.The orange light of dusk climbed from the balcony to his dark blue quilt. He set an alarm and retracted his body into his quilt. The remnant sensations of the high altitude activity\u2014that kind of feeling that the heavens and earth were spinning around\u2014 only became more obvious when he closed his eyes. He was very uncomfortable, so he turned over and lay on his stomach, burying his head in the pillow in an attempt to reduce that feeling of weightlessness and vertigo, but it had little effect.[You\u2019re an adult now, Gege.]Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice repeatedly echoed in his ears, and his heartbeat was unsettled, just like the man who carried\u00a0seven buckets\u00a0up the hill, but then eight down the hill, and he found it hard to sleep peacefully.Suddenly, he heard footsteps, and when Fang Juexia turned his head, he saw a pair of long legs by his bed. He was a little startled, and somehow subconsciously pulled up his quilt to cover his head.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Pei Tingsong wanted to pull his quilt down. \u201cI thought you were sleeping.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep,\u201d Fang Juexia said in a muffled voice.\u201cHave you forgotten what you promised me?\u201dRight. He had really forgotten about it. He was all messed up by bungee jumping and the so-called rite of passage.Fang Juexia was afraid to face Pei Tingsong, but every time he tossed and turned restlessly, Pei Tingsong would simply appear in front of him again, and he always possessed a strong reason to trouble him in his hands, making him unable to avoid him.He gave up struggling and let Pei Tingsong pull the quilt away. Half-squinting, he saw Pei Tingsong and the medicine box he was carrying.He was actually becoming more and more delicate nowadays; before, when he had been actually wounded, with blood seeping out of the wound, he had still struggled against Fang Juexia and wouldn\u2019t let him wrap his wound up.Forget it, anyway, however anyone put it, since he was the one who had bit him, he had to carry some of the responsibility. Fang Juexia lifted the quilt and sat cross-legged on the bed. He took the medicine box and opened it to rummage around it in order to find the powder for oral ulcers. He tried his best to imitate the calm posture of a doctor as he instructed, \u201cYou sit down.\u201dPei Tingsong sat by the bed, and then discovered that a patch of Fang Juexia\u2019s hair had curled up, making him look a bit silly.\u201cYou\u2019re sleeping now, so you won\u2019t sleep at night?\u201dHe found it. Fang Juexia took out the box of powder and shook it. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep for a while and then go to the practice room. I won\u2019t come back at night.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not afraid to break your waist if you practice like this day after day\u00a0ah?\u201d\u201cI already have a waist injury.\u201d Fang Juexia spoke of it as if commenting on nice weather. He took out a long and thin cotton swab and dipped it in the powder.But upon hearing that, a bad taste formed in Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth. He had clearly been interacting with Fang Juexia for two years now, and he hadn\u2019t even known about his waist injury. He glanced at Fang Juexia\u2019s waist, and with no rhyme or reason, he suddenly recalled what Fang Juexia had looked like when changing in his apartment before. Pei Tingsong flung his eyes open and said, \u201cThen you need even more rest.\u201d\u201cEveryone wants to rest. But for things like dancing, even a\u00a0 day\u2019s rest will make your body lag behind for a day. People who rest too much will become rusty and turn stupid onstage.\u201d He drew closer. \u201cStick your tongue out.\u201dPei Tingsong did so. Afraid of blocking the light, Fang Juexia tilted his head to get closer, his eyes fixed on the little white spot at the tip of Pei Tingsong\u2019s tongue \u2014 the root of all evil. Fang Juexia\u2019s mood turned a bit strange when he thought about how this little white spot was caused by his own teeth. He couldn\u2019t really describe it.He shouldn\u2019t think deeply about it, he was afraid of revisiting the night of that incident.The cotton swab dipped in that powder was dabbed on that spot very lightly and slowly. Seeing the tip of his tongue shrinking back, Fang Juexia raised his eyes and observed Pei Tingsong\u2019s expression, asking, \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201dPei Tingsong pulled back the tip of his tongue and looked blankly at the person in front of him. He felt like he had made a wrong decision. He had plainly intended on teasing Fang Juexia with this, but right now, the one feeling unsettled was actually himself. After seeing Fang Juexia lying on the bed, he had instinctively lightened his steps, and when he heard that Fang Juexia had a waist injury, he started to feel guilty and worried.When he saw Fang Juexia raise his eyes, his heart started to pound. Dusk had made his eyelashes half translucent, and they seemed to be flickering slightly.Whatever had been applied to his tongue wasn\u2019t some panacea, but just a peaceful butterfly. It paused for a bit, before fluttering away again.\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d Fang Juexia asked again.Pei Tingsong blinked in confusion. \u201cA little bit.\u201d\u201cEndure it\u00a0ba.\u201dHe could only stretch his tongue out once again, and his eyes fell on this face that was so close to him. Whenever Fang Juexia was serious, his eyebrows would twist slightly inward, his lips would open slightly, and he could see the moisture inside his mouth. That could count as being a place familiar to him, after all, he\u2019d been in there once before.Pei Tingsong felt that he should just endure it, so he tried to divert his attention.The tip of his tongue was being stimulated by the powder, like a slight, thin needle pricking at his heart. He gradually started to fall in love with this slight pain; the scent of shower gel on Fang Juexia\u2019s body smelled very nice, clean and comfortable, similar to that of anesthesia.Even though he had witnessed many open and free friendships, Pei Tingsong also knew that there should be no kissing between friends, let alone deep kisses. Being a friend should be simple and natural, with conversations and chatting, understanding each other\u2019s preferences and lifestyles, and sharing in each other\u2019s joys and pains. There would be no burdens while communicating, and when hugging, it would be like you were holding your right hand with your left hand. That was a friend.But alcohol had taken its turns in capturing their minds, and they had shared surprise kiss after surprise kiss, these kisses stacking up on top of each other. It seemed that from the beginning, this friendship wasn\u2019t pure.Yet, he truly felt that Fang Juexia was good, and really wanted to establish a friendship with him.His eyes floated back, and Pei Tingsong accidentally saw the neckline of Fang Juexia\u2019s pajamas slip down, revealing to his view a field of snow-white skin that he could see completely clearly. He drew the tip of his tongue back into his mouth and coughed violently a few times after turning his head.\u201cYour throat doesn\u2019t feel good?\u201d Fang Juexia asked.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgPei Tingsong straightened himself in a rather unnatural manner, while also helped Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder go up. \u201cDon\u2019t always slouch, isn\u2019t your waist sore?\u201dFang Juexia also sat up straight and asked with a flat tone, \u201cWhat are you always caring about my waist for?\u201d\u201cWho cares about your waist?\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s didn\u2019t accept this, and even his voice grew loud.This person\u2019s clothes were too loose, and he just had to look down to see everything clearly. Also, when he changed clothes, he didn\u2019t know that he should duck away, and he also always looked at others with those kinds of eyes, completely unaware of what effect they had on the onlooker.Listing down Fang Juexia\u2019s many sins, Pei Tingsong seemed to have discovered a way to vent. Right, it was all his fault. If, at the very beginning, Fang Juexia hadn\u2019t gotten drunk and hadn\u2019t kissed him, he wouldn\u2019t have returned the favor while being drunk himself. Without the interference of this entanglement of lips and tongues, he wouldn\u2019t be twisting himself into knots over the purity of their friendship.Clearly, he had been unfettered since he was a child and had never cared about anything, but now, he had to start worrying over these little things.It was all Fang Juexia\u2019s fault.\u201cDone.\u201d The person who had started it all, and who didn\u2019t know anything, gently created a breeze with his palm to help Pei Tingsong relieve the pain at the tip of his tongue. \u201cDrink more water and take some vitamins.\u201d After saying that, he lowered his head to find the bottles of vitamin B and vitamin C tablets in the box, and then stuffed them into Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand along with the powder.He didn\u2019t want to apply the medicine himself; he still wanted Fang Juexia to apply it for him.\u201cThis medicine is applied three times a day, and if your tongue hurts badly, you can also apply it some more.\u201dBut with what standpoint would he demand that? They were all adults.\u201cOkay.\u201dUpon hearing Pei Tingsong utter that \u2018okay\u2019, Fang Juexia was a little surprised. It was rare that he was so obedient.\u201cGo to sleep\u00a0ba.\u201d Pei Tingsong stood up and took the medicine box away, but then heard Fang Juexia say from behind, \u201cI also can\u2019t seem to sleep very well. I feel dizzy, and it\u2019s hard for me to close my eyes.\u201dPei Tingsong replied, \u201cIt may be because of the after-effects of your fear of heights, you may dream of being high up when you sleep, and it will feel even more uncomfortable at that time. Don\u2019t go to sleep for now, find something relaxing to do.\u201dAfter saying that, he left. Fang Juexia\u2019s room suddenly became empty, so he simply got up, went to the balcony, picked up a watering can, and watered his flowers and plants. He had bought a cactus at a roadside stand a long time ago, and it wasn\u2019t a ball cactus type, but a long one. He squatted down and plucked some thorns from the cactus.He had seldom watered it before and had never cared about it. Fang Juexia raised the watering can and sprinkled a bit of water on it, not daring to give it too much.Do something relaxing.Fang Juexia took out his Sudoku book and sat on the lazyboy placed in the balcony. This way of calming and concentrating his mind had once been 100% effective. However, this time, as he held his pen, those numbers gradually started to shake and jump around in the empty space.Could it be that he was too tired recently?He closed his eyes and opened them again. His eyes scanned the first row and first column, trying to figure out the answer. Yet, he kept being distracted unconsciously, his soul spiraling out of control just like in a sudden fall.When he came back to his senses, what had been written in the book wasn\u2019t a number, but a person\u2019s name.Pei Tingsong went back to his room and turned on his computer. He wanted to finish writing the lyrics he hadn\u2019t finished before, but as soon as he opened it, he saw his fjx folder. He couldn\u2019t help but click on it again, and wore headphones to listen to Fang Juexia\u2019s ballad demo once again.He had never written lyrics for a love song, and he always felt disinclined to write them. Most love song lyrics were boring in his eyes. Two or three hackneyed and stereotypical lines would get chewed over repeatedly, and there was no essence left in the song, just dregs.But this song was a love song\u00a0ba.Even if it wasn\u2019t a love song, he could hear a love song-like feeling from it.Pei Tingsong held his pen and quietly listened to Fang Juexia\u2019s voice. The scene of him laughing suddenly appeared in front of his eyes, as he said to him in the sunny amusement park, \u2018This is your first time, are you happy?\u2019The sounds of the piano and humming flowed slowly, subconsciously controlling the pen in Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand, and it made rustling sounds as it wrote on the paper\u2014[A dreamlike amusement park with thousands of lights in viewWooden horses chasing each other, an old dream coming trueBundled into admission is the sunlightHelping me give the corner of his eye a love bite]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What was it? Why did he write this?Pei Tingsong crossed out the last sentence and scratched it out many times. Later, he simply tore that page from the notebook, crumpled it into a ball, and threw it onto a corner of the table.From beyond his earphones, he suddenly heard the sound of something breaking outside the window. He stood up and looked out, and saw that there was a figure wandering around on the balcony next door. Fearing that Fang Juexia was bumping around into things again, Pei Tingsong put down his things and went over there, even knocking on the door twice this time.\u201cWhat are you doing? Making such big movements.\u201d He deliberately made himself sound like he was complaining, \u201cTerribly noisy.\u201dWalking over, he saw Fang Juexia cleaning up the fragments on the ground. Pei Tingsong was startled again before he quickly pulled him away. \u201cHey, don\u2019t use your hands\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, the edges of this flowerpot aren\u2019t very sharp.\u201d Fang Juexia threw the last piece of clay fragment into the trash can. Only then did Pei Tingsong discover that the flowerpot he had broken had held a cactus in it.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He squatted down and pointed to the fallen cactus. \u201cRetaliation\u00a0ah?\u201d\u201cYour imagination sure is rich.\u201d Fang Juexia swept the soil together and transferred it all into a spare flowerpot, but he didn\u2019t really know where to start with this cactus. So he started to instruct Pei Tingsong, \u201cLift this up.\u201d\u201cWhy me\u00a0ah?\u201d\u201cBirds of a feather flock together.\u201d Fang Juexia poked a hole in the soil and said, \u201cPut it here.\u201dPei Tingsong pinched a long thorn at the top of the cactus with two of his fingers, and it wobbled into the hole dug by Fang Juexia.\u201cYou\u2019ve been working on these plants this whole time\u00a0ah.\u201d Pei Tingsong glanced at the Sudoku book Fang Juexia had left on the lazyboy, but what was strange was that there were no numbers written on it, though there did seem to be a line of words written instead.\u201cEn. And you?\u201d Fang Juexia used his body to block his gaze as he started to pack the soil with both hands. \u201cWhat were you doing just now?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t expect that the topic would shift back onto him and hesitated. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t plan to wait for him to give an answer, instead standing up and closing that Sudoku book. Unexpectedly, he suddenly heard Pei Tingsong say from behind him, \u201cI want to fill in the lyrics for your demo.\u201dFeeling uncertain, Fang Juexia turned his head and saw Pei Tingsong sitting cross-legged on the ground as he continued, \u201cBut I\u2019ve never been in love, I don\u2019t know how to write lyrics for a love song.\u201dThis was the first time that he learned from Pei Tingsong himself that he had never been in love, and it made quite an impact. Fang Juexia sat back on the lazyboy and was silent for a while. \u201cThat song is not necessarily a love song.\u201dPei Tingsong raised his head and looked at him. Fang Juexia hugged the Sudoku book to his chest and spoke quietly, \u201cAfter all, based on what you said, I also shouldn\u2019t be able to write love songs.\u201dBy that he meant\u2026 He had also never been in love? Pei Tingsong sort of couldn\u2019t believe it; very few girls would not like Fang Juexia\u2019s appearance during his school days, and his personality was warm, aside from those instances when he was dealing with Pei Tingsong and acted a bit cold.Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help questioning, \u201cIs that really true\u2026 I don\u2019t believe there were no girls chasing you at your school.\u201d\u201cThere were. But I didn\u2019t have any time at all.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s expression was very frank, and he leaned back. \u201cI started to learn dancing at a very early age. I was very tired every day, but I also had to study hard, and I had to go to the dance studio immediately after school. Later, as you know, my dream of being a dancer failed. Who knew that on the way to school, I would be discovered by one of Astar\u2019s talent scouts and thus became a trainee. At that time, I was also studying and practicing at the same time. I worked hard every day, and I didn\u2019t even have any time to get enough sleep, so how could I have any energy left for puppy love?\u201d\u201cSo you want to date, but you don\u2019t have time to?\u201d Pei Tingsong reasoned, but he still thought that this conclusion wasn\u2019t right. \u201cIf you really met someone you liked, you wouldn\u2019t say you couldn\u2019t squeeze out some time to spend with them.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s answer came out of the blue, short and firm. Pei Tingsong accidentally pricked himself on one of the soft thorns of the cactus, and the thorn sank into his flesh.He hesitated, but then still asked, \u201cWhy?\u201dA pink and orange cloud was floating in the sky. Fang Juexia stared at it without moving. \u201cBecause\u2026\u201dHe hesitated and didn\u2019t know how to tell Pei Tingsong, or whether to tell him at all. Fang Juexia really abhorred the sensation of conducting self-introspection; opening himself up even once ran the risk of there being an emotional breach.It was really terrible to lose control. He was afraid that he would become the kind of person who would lose control.Pei Tingsong noticed something, so he changed the topic himself. \u201cIn fact, I also don\u2019t want to.\u201d He then added, \u201cAt least, I haven\u2019t wanted to before. I read a psychological paper once that had the sentence, \u2018Children\u2019s emotional enlightenment is the reflection of their parents\u2019 feelings.\u2019 As for me, I haven\u2019t really seen or been around my parents since I was a child. It was only when I grew up a bit more that I realized that they didn\u2019t get married out of love.\u201dHearing this, Fang Juexia turned around, curling up on the lazyboy as he looked at Pei Tingsong. \u201cThen why did they get married?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s pretty ironic actually. My mother\u2019s ancestors were the first generation of overseas Chinese immigrants, and they were also very rich while in China. After they immigrated, they did business in the United States for many years. Her family was huge, and counted as what they call \u2018old money.\u2019 My grandfather was the youngest and only son of his generation, but he really had no talent for business and also had no interest in it. When he was young, his businesses always failed, and several of his companies went out of business.\u201dSeveral companies. Fang Juexia thought\u2014Sure enough they\u2019re rich to easily bear that cost.\u201cI felt it was like that. Your grandfather\u2026\u201d He paused after speaking halfway. He had originally wanted to say that his grandfather looked like an urbane gentleman, but in the first place, he had accidentally seen that photo.\u201cWhat about my grandfather?\u201dFang Juexia lay across the sofa and shook his head. \u201cI feel like he should be like you\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s much better than me. He had great literary talents, and although his businesses failed, he wrote very good books. He published novels and poetry anthologies under a pseudonym. Later, he didn\u2019t want to do any business and just wanted to live his romantic life.\u201d Pei Tingsong took a deep breath. \u201cMy mom was his only child, so she was used to being like a princess; besides having a pretty face, she couldn\u2019t really do anything else. The elders of the family felt that their commercial businesses couldn\u2019t just collapse like that, so they chose a \u2018new money\u2019 man to marry her.\u201d\u201cMy grandfather told me that he was very opposed to that decision at that time. It would be very painful for two people who didn\u2019t love each other to be together, and that turned out to be true. Before giving birth to me, they were still reluctantly living together, but after giving birth to me, my mom just started travelling all over the world, enjoying and living the extravagant life she likes. My dad became busy making money, even though he already has so much that we still wouldn\u2019t be able to use it up by our next lifetime.\u201dFang Juexia could hardly imagine what it was like to grow up in such a family.\u201cThen, if you haven\u2019t seen your parents since you were a child, you don\u2019t miss them?\u201dPei Tingsong smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve already forgotten what it\u2019s like to miss my parents.\u201d He continued, \u201cI couldn\u2019t stay at home by myself, so my grandfather came to live with me.\u201d\u201cI later fell in love with hip-hop and thought it was the most effective carrier for emotions in the world. After that, I had even less of a heart to waste myself in constantly fruitless relationships; I just wanted to find an outlet and express myself.\u201dFang Juexia finally understood why Pei Tingsong was so contradictory. Like his grandfather, he found himself placed in an inappropriate mold, but his choice when facing this was to resist fiercely\u2014against his parents who had never accompanied him, against the golden cage he was enclosed in\u2014and to pursue what he really liked, regardless of the cost. All of a sudden, he felt like hugging this person. However, he knew that this impulse came from an overflow of his sympathy, and Pei Tingsong might end up cold-shouldering him, so he just sat up, not daring to go forward.He now knew the reason why Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t believe in love. How could someone believe in something they\u2019ve never seen?Pei Tingsong shook his hands and said in a relaxed tone, \u201cIn fact, many famous philosophers remained unmarried all their lives. Plato, Descartes, Spinoza, Kant, Schopenhauer, Sartre\u2026. You can\u2019t even count all of them.\u201d Then he seemed to have thought of some pretty good argument, so he added, \u201cDo you know the poet\u00a0Lermontov? He said something before\u2014 \u2018I crave for sadness, against my bliss and love, in truth; They sank my mind in idle\u00a0gladness.\u2019\u201dThis was a very novel and realistic statement.Fang Juexia repeated what he had just said in his heart and seemed to feel that recounting his memory was really not such a big deal. Although Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t ask, he still chose to open himself up; he didn\u2019t want to be the only listener in such a situation.\u201cHave I\u2026.never mentioned my father?\u201dPei Tingsong didn\u2019t expect that Fang Juexia would actually say anything. He had already realized that the word \u2018father\u2019 was like an obstacle to Fang Juexia. Every time he spoke, he would habitually avoid using that word.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cYes.\u201dFang Juexia put his hands on his knees. \u201cHe was a very talented dancer before. My mom loved him very much, and they loved each other very much. Just as I told you last time, they were desperate to be together no matter what.\u201dWhen it was told like that, it sounded just like a fairy tale love story, or one that was found in poetry. However, Pei Tingsong already knew this one\u2019s ending.\u201cLater on, they had me, and our family was very happy. Recalling it now, I feel like it is no exaggeration at all to describe my childhood with the word \u2018happiness\u2019. I used to be a child who grew up with love as well.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes floated towards the last glimmer of light that lit up the sky in the distance, and his Adam\u2019s apple rolled. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken about the matters that happened later\u00a0 before, how I found out that I had night blindness and then failed to get chosen. This didn\u2019t actually count as being a big blow to our family, but then my father, he got a very good chance, a chance that allowed him to basically change his life.\u201dFang Juexia looked at him. \u201cA very famous ballet asked him to play the leading role. He practiced for this ballet for a full four months. I also looked forward to the opening performance every day during that period, counting the days as I went to school, just waiting for that day. I remember it very clearly; at that time, I was lying on my desk and drawing the last X on the calendar when the phone rang, and after hearing just a few sentences, my mom slipped down the wall and sat down on the ground.\u201dHe tried to describe it to Pei Tingsong, gesticulating with both hands. \u201cThe ending move at the end of the ballet was a falling action, in which the lead dancer would fall back into a net. At my dad\u2019s last rehearsal before the opening of the show, everything went perfectly, and he finally ran off the stage to fall down, but that net hadn\u2019t been fixed properly.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s tone didn\u2019t contain many fluctuations as he said this, it was rather simple and straightforward, as if he was stating a matter completely unrelated to himself. \u201cHe fell down from the height of a few meters and broke his leg.\u201dPei Tingsong looked at Fang Juexia, trying to find a trace of sadness on his face, so that he could offer words of comfort. But Fang Juexia was too calm, not even showing a slight frown.\u201cNot only did he miss the best opportunity and what would have been the highlight of his career, he also couldn\u2019t continue to dance after that. That leg left a lot of problems, basically spelling the end of his career.\u201d\u201cAnd then? Did he change careers?\u201dFang Juexia pulled at his sleeve, feeling a little cold. \u201cAnd then\u2026 and then, he drank and smoked a lot every day. He smoked right at home, and when my mom told him that it was bad for children, he didn\u2019t care. They quarreled every day, most of the time over me. Once, he got drunk and even told me that I would be a loser just like him in the future. He had been jerked around by the heavens, and I had not been born with the qualifications to dance on a stage.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s voice finally trembled. He sniffed and continued, \u201cI became very afraid to see him, and afraid of seeing alcohol at home. He once had a quarrel with my mom, and he couldn\u2019t help but hit her. When he sobered up, he held her and cried at the same time. It\u2019s very contradictory, right? That people could actually turn out to be like this.\u201d Saying that, he looked at Pei Tingsong and smiled, before shaking his head.\u201cMy mom still loved him very much, and kept hoping that he would pull himself together. But it didn\u2019t work. He tried again and again, failed again and again, and even started getting involved in illegal drugs. One day, when I came home from school, I found that all the valuable electrical appliances in the house were missing. I thought it was a thief, so I checked what else was missing.\u201d Fang Juexia poked the tips of his slippers with his index finger and then buried his head in his arms. \u201cI saw that all of his clothes in the closet were missing. He never came back after that.\u201d\u201cLove is truly very fragile and has a short shelf life. Sometimes you can\u2019t wait for it to change, and even a single straw can crush it. \u201d Fang Juexia was so calm right now that he seemed like an outsider to the whole story. \u201cMy mom is still waiting for him even now. She\u2019s not willing to move, so she stays in that small house in Guangzhou. When she\u2019s free, she can look at the door for an entire day. Just for those few short years of happiness, she ended up paying with pain for the rest of her life.\u201dPei Tingsong got up, went to crouch in front of Fang Juexia, reached out, and rubbed the top of his head.\u201cThe story I\u2019m telling is very ordinary\u00a0ba, it\u2019s not as grand as you were looking forward to.\u201dThe beginning of happiness in love stories were all very similar: the lovers burned at each other\u2019s touch, their souls and bodies collided together, they hated that they couldn\u2019t live a lifetime in a second and end their lives in a kiss. However, the final chapters of the tragedies were all different from each other, and they ended grandly, with a sense of ceremony. The thing that tragedies most feared was there being no drama at all, leaving only a sloppy ending.Pei Tingsong now understood why Fang Juexia always closed himself off and managed his emotions like a machine; it was because he felt that he had no other choice.He had spent so many years not only groping in the dark, but had also taken his father as a mirror, one that could only reflect failure. He hid this mirror in his heart and glanced at it from time to time in order to restrain himself.Pei Tingsong gently rubbed his head, his voice low and gentle as he said, \u201cSo that\u2019s why you don\u2019t believe in love, because you\u2019ve lived through a failed case.\u201dFang Juexia belatedly felt afraid. He had even cut open the deepest part of himself in front of Pei Tingsong, and had revealed his fragile\u00a0center. He seemed to have not only said it for Pei Tingsong to hear, but also for himself.\u2014Don\u2019t just casually fall into a relationship.Fang Juexia poked his finger into the ground, and after lowering his head, drew a line as he said to Pei Tingsong and to himself, \u201cYou can give many examples of rational numbers, but it\u2019s impossible to recite them all, right?\u201dPei Tingsong nodded. \u201cEn.\u201d\u201cBut you know what? Given a number axis, you can take any point, and the probability that the selected point is a rational number is zero.\u201dFang Juexia raised his head, and his cool eyes reflected the now completely darkened sky.\u201cThat is the so-called \u2018true love.\u2019\u201d\u2014The author has something to say:[On why the probability of getting a rational number from any point on the number axis is zero.]First we have to clarify what zero means.This problem is a measure theory problem, which uses logic to estimate zero. It is very difficult for me to explain a mathematical problem in an easy way, because that wouldn\u2019t be rigorous. I suggest that everyone search for it, and there is a lot of theoretical analysis and discussions about this topic. Measure theory is a problem of functional analysis, and children of the mathematics department should have learned it before.Let\u2019s make it clear that an event with zero probability is not equal to an impossible event. This is a probability problem, and you can also search for\u00a0specific proofs and theories\u00a0on it.Finally, they have become completely honest with each other and have taken a big step forward. TingJue will now begin to heal each other.They are both in love for the first time, and they are a little different from other children, so they will be a little slower, but they will be more desperate and uncaring about personal danger when they are really in love.

    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 53Chapter 53 \u2013 New Album PreparationTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksYou will have to admit it one day.Pei Tingsong understood Fang Juexia\u2019s words in less than an instant.The vast majority of people in this world kept searching for true love in a vast sea of people, having been lulled into mistakenly believing that they could definitely fall in love with someone for a lifetime by stories. Every single one of them thought that what they would obtain would be honey that wouldn\u2019t dilute over their lifetime, but in reality, most of their love stories were like poor quality cans that would soon expire. As the poisonous industrial chemicals were consumed one mouthful at a time, the sweet delusions would eventually dissipate, leaving behind only painful after-effects. These after-effects would last for at least months, at most years, or maybe even for an entire lifetime.No one could deny the existence of rational numbers, but when compared with the densely packed irrational numbers, those sparse points were rarer than shooting stars.He suddenly became curious, so he didn\u2019t think deeply before opening his mouth.\u201cIf, and I\u2019m just coming up with a hypothesis here,\u201d Pei Tingsong asked, looking straight into Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes, \u201cIf you really fell in love with someone someday, what would you do?\u201dFang Juexia met his gaze in silence, and his eyes flickered uncontrollably. He had been left stumped by this question. It seemed that pretty much as soon as he had started to comprehend things, he had excluded this question from his life plans. He had never thought about the possibility of falling in love with anyone, let alone making deductions about how his heart might feel when or if that happened.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He finally stuck to the facts. \u201cThis hypothesis is meaningless. People are a collection of complex physiological mechanisms, and you can hardly control one of your own nerves, let alone\u2026\u201dLet alone trying to control the emotions that surged when you fell in love with someone.He didn\u2019t finish the rest of his sentence; he didn\u2019t know why, but in front of Pei Tingsong, he couldn\u2019t say it all out loud, and so, he simply swallowed his next words. He shrugged, then threw this problem back. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Pei Tingsong thought for a while before answering, \u201cAlthough I haven\u2019t seen any true love, and also don\u2019t really want to aspire towards any such thing, if it really appears\u2026\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t hide from it.\u201d He raised his eyebrows. \u201cEven if I ended up choosing an irrational number, it wouldn\u2019t matter, for I would still treat\u00a0it\u00a0as a rational number. It\u2019s a little idealistic, but I believe that some things can be transformed by my will.\u201dFang Juexia admired his pluck. These kinds of words, if they came from other people, would be quite a bit like moths heading toward a flame, but when Pei Tingsong uttered them, somehow, they felt completely different.\u201cSo, your mother is also like this, using her own will to wait. At least in her heart, what she is still holding onto is a rational number. Her love is still not dead.\u201dFang Juexia had to acknowledge that statement. Buried deep in his mother\u2019s heart was the belief that that person would always come back. However, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t believe it. \u201cBut you can see from her example that the overwhelming majority of people suffer from failed love, and you haven\u2019t even seen a successful example with your own eyes. Aren\u2019t you afraid of stepping straight into failure?\u201dFacing Fang Juexia\u2019s question, Pei Tingsong looked very relaxed. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of failure, and moreover, I\u2019m even not afraid of low probability and scarcity. On the contrary, I like it a lot.\u201dWord by word, he stated boldly and frankly, \u201cWhat I want is the rarest thing.\u201dFang Juexia was left speechless. They were both the fruit of failed families, but while one indulged only in freedom, the other precisely dodged mistakes; they held opposite ideals while also carrying extreme attitudes towards love. But even so, Fang Juexia had to admit that he was convinced by Pei Tingsong\u2019s words.Pei Tingsong\u2019s cellphone suddenly rang, interrupting this debate of their views on love. After he picked it up, he simply replied with a few sentences and hung up.\u201cThe boss asked us to go to the company to finish the main song together.\u201d He got up and stretched. Fang Juexia also stood up, placed the cactus in a safe corner, picked up a spray can, sprayed some water onto it, observed it closely, and then sprayed a little more. He seemed to have discovered something by accident, and with a little surprise coloring his tone, he said to himself, \u201cIs it going to bloom?\u201dPei Tingsong looked at him squatting on the ground and seriously pulling on the top of the cactus, and couldn\u2019t help laughing again.\u201cFang Juexia, you are someone who is living with your grandfather\u2019s shell draped over you.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t understand his meaning. He turned around and looked over at Pei Tingsong, still holding the small spray can in his hand.\u201cYour father is a man who regards art as his life, and your mom is someone who is heedless of danger when it\u2019s for love. Don\u2019t you stress science? The power of genes is very powerful, and you are the child of these two people.\u201d Pei Tingsong put his hands in his pockets and said with a smile, \u201cSo, in your bones, you are actually also a romantic.\u201d\u201cYou will have to admit it one day.\u201dSaying that, Pei Tingsong left, leaving Fang Juexia alone on the balcony. He remained stunned for a minute and then turned to stare at the cactus.Romantic\u2014this word was pretty much like a\u00a0hyperbola\u00a0to him.When they hurried to the company, they found that Boss Chen Zhengyun was also there. He had already heard Fang Juexia\u2019s lyric-free demo in advance and kept heaping praise on it, especially after discovering that Fang Juexia was naturally sensitive to melody. To a large extent, composing music was a job that only those with inborn talent could do. It was difficult for some people, no matter how hard they studied musical theory, to write a catchy melody with highlights.\u201cWe\u2019ve been developing you in the dance track this entire time, and even thought this way was particularly correct. Now it seems that the company came really close to missing out on a treasure.\u201d Chen Zhengyun himself used to be a singer-songwriter. Before he had started the company, he had already transformed himself into an excellent producer who had written a lot of songs. He was unstinting in his effusive praise for Fang Juexia\u2019s talent. \u201cSince it\u2019s the main song, we still hope that it will be a song where its performance becomes a more important factor than the melody itself, but also that it will be easy to sing, so that people can remember it after just hearing it once.\u201dAnother company composer used the guitar to play their modified main song for them to hear.\u201cThis counts as the third version, we have been discussing it for several hours already. Ziyan came back and helped us modify it.\u201dPei Tingsong sat on one side. \u201cAfter changing it too much, it\u2019s easy for your ears to go numb, and you can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s good or bad anymore.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I called you guys here.\u201d Chen Zhengyun began to needle him again, \u201cHow about you, how are the lyrics? Have you pinned down the concept for this song?\u201dPei Tingsong told the truth, \u201cMy mind\u2019s in a bit of a mess right now. This song is a bit of a mix, and there are many concepts that it can incorporate. It\u2019s very hard for me to figure out a core\u2026\u201dJust then, the door opened again, and Jiang Miao and Ling Yi entered. \u201cYou\u2019re all here\u00a0la.\u201d\u201cI came late.\u201d Jiang Miao moved a chair and sat down. Chen Zhengyun said that it was no problem, then added, \u201cXiao Miao, I asked them to bring over your guzheng.\u201dEveryone began to discuss things again, but Fang Juexia was still recalling the music that had just been played by the composer. He split the melody apartin his mind, part by part, and even tone by tone.While the others were still discussing, Fang Juexia sat in front of an electronic keyboard, played a very simple chord, then tried humming the composer\u2019s melody from just now, but every time, he ended up getting stuck in the middle. He tried again and found that it was still the same.Pei Tingsong also discovered that he was trying to do something alone, so he sneaked over and sat next to him. \u201cDo you have an idea?\u201d\u201cI think what you said just now is right,\u201d Fang Juexia said as he put both his hands on the black and white keys. \u201cOur melody is too full, and not smooth. In fact, that\u2019s totally unnecessary, and its spark can be created with the musical arrangement. If the melody is too full, it\u2019s easy for people to feel confused when listening to it and be unable to remember the tune.\u201dHe tried cutting off part of the melody, then hummed, and it immediately sounded a lot better. Pei Tingsong nodded. \u201cBut like this, the strong feeling of the song will be reduced.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Fang Juexia was very sure and explained, \u201cBecause right now I\u2019m just playing the simplest chords for you, but the musical arrangement is the soul of dance music. The point of the melody is for essence, not for volume; a good musical arrangement can fully reflect the arrangement, rhythm, and artistic conception of a song.\u201dLooking at his serious appearance, Pei Tingsong suddenly felt that Fang Juexia was particularly good-looking.As he played, Fang Juexia suddenly remembered the famous Pipa song, \u2018Ambush On All Sides\u2019 that Jiang Miao had played last night when he was practicing his guzheng. At that time, he had even run over specifically to listen to it. The sweeping strings, in the very beginning, were full of murderous spirit, somewhat creating the scenario of an empty city using one song to push back thousands of troops.A melody appeared in his mind, and after Pei Tingsong heard only a few parts, his attention was completely drawn towards it. \u201cThis is nice. The changes in tone are all connected, and it gives off a strong Chinese feel.\u201dFang Juexia smiled and used the electronic keyboard to play some more music. Soon, other people were also drawn over, and Chen Zhengyun looked at him and asked, \u201cIs this what you just wrote?\u201dHis hand stopped, and Fang Juexia noted the score down before telling everyone his own thoughts, \u201cWe have been adding things to the melody this entire time until now, only making it more complicated. Maybe it\u2019s because I haven\u2019t been involved in the creation of the previous compositions this whole time, and because I just listened to the demo of this composition right now that I can count as having the point of view of a pure listener. After listening to the piano composition played by Sir just now, I found that, in fact, we have added too much into the melody. It\u2019s hard to hear the different things in the highly complex arrangement, but we can discover that by playing it on just the piano alone.\u201dHe tried to play the chorus of the song. \u201cWith good dance music, even with the simplest chords, it can sound very good\u00a0unplugged, and that is the underlying main melody. I tried playing it just now, and found that there were many redundant parts to this piece. Cutting some of them out and adding catchy melodies will make it much better.\u201dListening to the part he had just played, Pei Tingsong suddenly thought of something and asked Jiang Miao, \u201cMiao Ge, can you play a guzheng part?\u201dUpon hearing him say this, Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help but be a bit surprised. Before he even had to say it, Pei Tingsong had already understood what he had been thinking; it was kind of incredible.Jiang Miao sat down beside the guzheng with a smile, and stuck his fingers in place. \u201cPlay what?\u201d\u201cJust sweep the strings, I\u2019ll come in as you play.\u201d Fang Juexia also put his hands on the piano keys, waiting for Jiang Miao\u2019s signal. Jiang Miao lowered his head halfway down, his fingertips gathered slightly, and then, as his wrist shook, a sound swept out, just like a murderous wind.This was exactly the effect that Fang Juexia wanted. When Jiang Miao swept out the second tone, the sound of the electric keyboard came in to replace the chorus, and Fang Juexia hummed the changes he had made to the tune. He Ziyan soon realized the kind of style he wanted and took out an electronic drum pad to drum out the rhythm.This whole cooperation was very simple and thrown together, but it produced an amazing blend of music. Fang Juexia continued, \u201cBefore, only the elements were given out, but there was no main concept, which made it feel very chaotic. But yesterday, I heard Miao Ge practicing with Pipa music, and the first few chords and strings of \u2018Ambush On All Sides\u2019 are very murderous. I was thinking that our song this time can be based on the concept of a warrior.\u201dHe was usually quiet, but when he talked about his understanding of music and the stage, his eyes filled with light. \u201cLike ancient marching drums and formations, as well as sword dancing, these all have the same origin as song and dance performances. We can take the concept of a warrior, use a strong rhythm and an aggressive arrangement to create a composition weighed with a sense of sorrow and conviction, and I believe we can integrate this well into the effect we wanted before.\u201dHe Ziyan was suddenly inspired and used his\u00a0MIDI\u00a0to pick out an electronic sound, which was very similar to the sound of a sword. He said to Jiang Miao, \u201cYou sweep the strings again.\u201dThe MIDI\u2019s imitation sword sound integrated with the guzheng\u2019s sweeping strings, just like swordsmen fighting.\u201cYes, that\u2019s a good concept.\u201d Chen Zhengyun also said, \u201cWhen the time comes, we can put in a sample of real sword sounds and put it together with the electronic sounds, to give it a sense of interlacing with virtual reality. Then, the feel should be closer to that of the glint and flash of cold steel.\u201dPei Tingsong was suddenly inspired. He seemed to have seen the scene from \u2018Ambush On All Sides\u2019, of being forced to\u00a0stand and fight, so he became engrossed in writing down a few lines, getting the key notes down.The whole room of people stayed up all night for the sake of the song, and none of them felt tired at all. Later, Lu Yuan came, and they sorted out the melody for the whole song. Pei Tingsong pretty much dished out the first version of the lyrics for the song right then and there, and so they simply moved to the studio to record the demo along with the words.By the time they came out of the studio, daylight was already out in full. The six boys collapsed on the sofa of the recording studio, head to head; Chen Zhengyun teased that they looked like a litter of puppies. Fang Juexia felt lucky; although they hadn\u2019t made their debut in a large company with rich resources, they had more freedom to create here.\u201cWe\u2019ll work hard these next few days to complete the musical arrangement as well. Everyone should practice well, and we\u2019ll strive for the month after next, no, we\u2019ll send out the notice next month itself.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re finally going to have a second album!\u201d Ling Yi excitedly bit on He Ziyan\u2019s coat and was slapped away by him with the comment, \u201cYou really are a Chihuahua.\u201dKaleido\u2019s popularity was increasing day by day, and more and more work, events included, was also coming in. However, in order to prepare for the second album, the company pushed off a lot of these business activities. Except for some variety shows and endorsements that had been signed prior to this, they didn\u2019t arrange any other work for the group, all so that they could concentrate on practicing. After all, Kaleido was a boy-band, and while popularity and exposure were important, the song and stage were still the foundation of any boy-band. Only by handing over a satisfactory answer using this foundation could they prevent the popularity they had now from becoming a bubble that could burst at a touch.While creating the songs, they had also started a new round of style planning and MV planning. Star Chart paid a lot of money to invite a stage costume designer to specially design clothing for the six of them to use during the MV filming and the stage performances. In the past, the company had been too poor to spend much money on styling, but now that Kaleido was making money, that money would be used\u00a0wisely.Due to his regular studies, Pei Tingsong had never dyed his hair since their debut. However, the concept of the album this time was very aggressive, one which tallied best with Pei Tingsong, and dyeing the hair was a powerful tool to attract attention. The planner and stylist came up with many schemes. His original hair color was too black, so they first bleached his hair and then dyed it silver-white.Getting hair dyed was a pretty tedious process. Pei Tingsong had been studying and practicing the songs at the same time, so it was quite hard on him already. On top of that, he couldn\u2019t even sleep in on the weekend, getting pulled up early in order to get his hair bleached. He was so sleepy that he fell asleep several times during the process, and felt hungry when he woke up.\u201cSo sleepy\u00a0ah.\u201d The hair colorist couldn\u2019t help laughing.\u201cToo sleepy.\u201d When Pei Tingsong saw the plan they had designed, he thought of something, and he asked the hair colorist, \u201cWhat color is Juexia\u2019s hair this time?\u201d\u201cJuexia\u00a0ah, he may be dyed black this time.\u201dBlack hair. Pei Tingsong imagined it\u2014Fang Juexia\u2019s skin was pale, the color of his eyes was light, and his hair was already brown. However, he gave off a very strong distant feel, and his temperament was too cold. The company had wanted to make him seem more friendly to make it easier to suck up fans, so had always had his hair dyed dark brown. Now, upon switching to black hair, the contrast with his skin color would grow stronger, and he should look even more colder.\u201cThen when is he going to get it dyed?\u201d\u201cHe may be in a little later, anyway, he doesn\u2019t have to get his hair bleached. The ones with unusual colors go first, to try out the colors, and after you\u2019re done, it\u2019ll be Ling Yi\u2019s turn.\u201dHe had thought Fang Juexia would come here today. Pei Tingsong thought for a bit, then took out his cellphone and opened WeChat.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgJust as he completed an hour of dance practice in the practice room, Fang Juexia\u2019s cellphone rang. He picked it up and saw that it was Pei Tingsong.[Guide Dog: Where are you? What are you doing? I\u2019m starving.]What did this count as? Did he want him to deliver food? Fang Juexia thought about it and deliberately pretended not to understand.[Just a pretty face and also still pretty: Practice room, dancing. Order takeout if you\u2019re hungry.]After sending that message, Fang Juexia felt very happy. He leaned his head against the wall and gently tapped against it. The little clock in his heart ticked ten times, and then his cellphone vibrated again.[Guide Dog: Hello, I\u2019d like to have one\u00a0fried crab roe\u00a0and one\u00a0scallion oil noodles\u00a0with less oil.]He even sent over a \u2018please, please\u2019\u00a0emoticon.Fang Juexia looked at the time, picked up his clothes, stood up, and left the practice room. There was a snack bar located below their company that had been in business for more than ten years, and their\u00a0small steamed buns\u00a0and\u00a0pan fried buns\u00a0were unique. When people in the company ordered from them, they often ordered ten baskets at a time to be delivered upstairs. Fang Juexia also had the owner\u2019s phone number saved in his cellphone, but he still went downstairs himself, wearing a hat and mask to buy it in person.He didn\u2019t know why he did so, he probably just wanted to go for a walk.\u201cYi? Juexia, you haven\u2019t been here in a long time\u00a0ah. What do you want to eat?\u201d The owner was a very warm-hearted middle-aged man, with a little bit of a Shanghai feel to him, and was especially kind.Fang Juexia ordered what Pei Tingsong wanted, then added a cup of soybean milk. \u201cTroubling you to please pack it up for me.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay, no chili sauce for the pan fried buns, right?\u201d The owner was familiar with his tastes.\u201cI do want some.\u201d Fang Juexia immediately said, \u201cSome chili sauce.\u201dThe owner\u2019s busy hands stopped. \u201cYo, starting to eat spicy things\u00a0la?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia said with a smile, \u201cFor the child in our group.\u201d\u201cOh ~\u201d the owner also smiled. \u201cYou guys all have really good relationships, just like brothers.\u201d As he said that, he had already finished packing all the snacks, and handed them to Juexia. \u201cCome again next time\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cThank you, boss.\u201dIt was strange; Pei Tingsong had originally been terribly sleepy, but after he sent the message to Fang Juexia, he felt so energetic that he couldn\u2019t even fall asleep after closing his eyes. He looked at himself in the mirror, and feeling completely bored, started to hum.\u201cWhat song is this?\u201d The hair colorist checked how his hair color was fading and said casually, \u201cIt actually sounds very nice.\u201dOnly then did Pei Tingsong realize that what he was humming subconsciously was the song written by Fang Juexia.\u201cJust randomly humming\u2026\u201dHe had almost leaked Fang Juexia\u2019s song for him.Just when he was feeling guilty, a pale hand appeared in front of him, holding a takeout box and setting it on the table in front of him. Pei Tingsong raised his head in surprise and saw Fang Juexia, who was completely wrapped up, with only his eyes and birthmark showing.\u201cIt\u2019s no use covering up so tightly.\u201dHe could recognize him just by his hands.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t understand his meaning. \u201cWhy is it of no use?\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s next words changed as they came out of his mouth. \u201cI mean, what\u2019s the use of not covering that birthmark? Is there a second person in this world with such a birthmark?\u201dThat sounded pretty reasonable. Fang Juexia looked in the mirror and touched the birthmark at the corner of his eyes. Then he thought of something, turned to him, and said, \u201cEat quickly, it won\u2019t be good when it gets cold.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really starving.\u201d He grabbed a pan fried bun, took a bite, and asked in a muffled tone, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to eat?\u201d\u201cI had breakfast.\u201d Fang Juexia didn\u2019t even sit down. Pei Tingsong suspected that he might have really come here just to give him something, and maybe he was about to leave.\u201cYou eat some more.\u201d Pei Tingsong used the excuse of body management to make Fang Juexia eat as well. Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t beat him, and could only sit next to him and eat a pan fried bun.Fang Juexia was very refined when eating, licking his lips every time he took a bite. The more Pei Tingsong observed him, the more he felt that Fang Juexia was different from many of the boys he had met, though he couldn\u2019t exactly pinpoint what was different.After eating a whole pan fried bun, Fang Juexia cleaned his hands with a napkin. Noticing that Pei Tingsong had been staring at him the entire time, he felt strange, and asked, \u201cWhat are you doing staring at me?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d Pei Tingsong shifted his gaze away and quickly changed the topic. \u201cMy scalp hurts a bit.\u201d As soon as he raised his hand, his wrist was gripped by Fang Juexia.\u201cDon\u2019t scratch.\u201d Fang Juexia said, \u201cBleaching your hair does hurt your scalp a bit, so don\u2019t get the bleaching cream on your hands.\u201dPei Tingsong kind of liked the feeling of being minded by Fang Juexia. He also didn\u2019t know why that was so; plainly speaking, he was the kind of person who would want to go west when he was told to go east by others.\u201cBut my scalp just really doesn\u2019t feel good.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Fang Juexia lowered his head and pinched Pei Tingsong\u2019s forearm. Pei Tingsong hadn\u2019t been expecting that at all. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cThis way, you\u2019re distracted.\u201d Fang Juexia pinched again, then raised his head and laughed at him.Pei Tingsong\u2019s gaze moved from his smiling eyes to the corners of his mouth, as well as the lips he had just licked lightly. However, the other party soon became immersed in continuing this pinching game and didn\u2019t notice Pei Tingsong\u2019s dazed eyes.The hair colorist, who was scrolling through his cellphone, suddenly laughed. \u201cHey, the episode of your amusement park ensemble show has come out. Haunted house special.\u201dHis voice suddenly pulled Pei Tingsong out of his thoughts, while also making Fang Juexia let go of Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand, for he turned his head and asked, \u201cSo fast? I didn\u2019t even see it.\u201d\u201cYou guys are all on the Hot Search. Quickly, go have a look!\u201dFang Juexia took out his cellphone, logged into his rarely used Weibo account, and saw a familiar name as soon as he entered the Hot Search list.\u201cNumber two and number three on the Hot Search list is you, eh.\u201dUpon hearing the end of Fang Juexia\u2019s words and his cute tone, Pei Tingsong was rather proud, and felt especially good. So he cleared his throat, and while wearing a look of being a frequent caller on the Hot Search List. \u201cReally? How did I get on the Hot Search again?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Fang Juexia showed him his cellphone, his face filled with the desire to share. \u201cLook.\u201dPei Tingsong, deliberately, only shot a glance at it, but in the end, his eyebrows were the ones that ended shooting up.#Pei Tingsong Haunted House##Pei Tingscared#Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s fear.]\u201cNo way, is it that funny?\u201d He looked at Fang Juexia with an expression of complete bewilderment.The hair colorist little Ge laughed loudly. \u201cVery funny\u00a0ah, hahaha, I started laughing so hard that even wrinkles appeared on my face!\u201d\u201cWhat to do?\u201d Fang Juexia took back his cellphone with a smile. \u201cYour persona has collapsed.\u201d\u201cDo you think it\u2019s too late to spend money to get rid of this Hot Search entry?\u201dFang Juexia looked at him and laughed again.Seeing his persona of being the main aggressor in the group collapse so quickly, Pei Tingsong\u2019s whole person turned absent-minded and dazed. The hairdresser blow-dried and trimmed his hair, and the final silvery effect was quite good. \u201cWow, all of a sudden, there\u2019s a bit of a manga feel to you.\u201dFang Juexia looked at him from the side and also thought that he was good-looking. Pei Tingsong originally had pale skin and well-defined facial features, and now, with his hair dyed silver, he gave off more of a mixed-blood feel. He would definitely be very eye-catching on the stage.The hairdresser poked Pei Tingsong\u2019s forehead. \u201cYour hair was very stiff before, and just now, I was worried whether dyeing you like this would make your hair completely frizzy. Now, it seems to be okay.\u201dWould his hair soften a little after bleaching? Fang Juexia was curious and reached out to touch a lock. Who knew that Pei Tingsong would notice. He had thought that the little devil king would reach out to slap his hand away, so Fang Juexia reflexively started to pull his hand back while ducking away from his reach, but before he could even try to do so, Pei Tingsong caught his wrist. He just held onto Fang Juexia\u2019s hand like that and guided it to the top of his head.Fang Juexia froze and heard Pei Tingsong say with a laugh, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to rub it, then rub it well.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Fang Juexia stretched out his fingers in a very well-behaved fashion and rubbed his hair twice. It was really soft and felt nice to touch.Pei Tingsong asked, \u201cDo I look good with my hair dyed this color?\u201dFang Juexia nodded, removed his hand, and also shifted his gaze away while seriously replying, \u201cYou look good.\u201dIn order to cover up his new hair color, Pei Tingsong left the salon wearing a baseball cap, along with the hood of his white hoodie drawn up, for double protection. The two of them headed back to the company by car, where they recorded songs with the other members. Once they started recording, the session ended up lasting through the afternoon.These days, besides dancing, they would record songs, and they pretty much lived at the company. Fortunately, since everyone\u2019s voices were in good condition today, the recordings sounded very good. In addition, the period of time until their comeback had been amply arranged this time, so everything was in order, and there was no need to rush their work. The company didn\u2019t want their throats to get too fatigued, so they let them head back early to rest.Cheng Qiang sent them back to the dormitory. \u201cThe previous door lock for the dormitory was attacked, and we suspect that it was because the address got exposed on the group ensemble livestream in previous episodes, which attracted stalker fans. We\u2019re already investigating the issue. Safety comes first, so the company has removed the camera in the dormitory, and the group ensemble show from now on may focus more on shooting at outside locations.\u201d\u201cThey removed it\u00a0ah.\u201d Ling Yi was elated. \u201cBefore they took it down, I didn\u2019t even dare to sneakily eat things! I was afraid I\u2019d be filmed.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still eating! You guys will have to sing soon, and I\u2019ll have to report your weight daily to the higher-ups.\u201d Cheng Qiang knocked on his head. \u201cYou guys rest\u00a0ba, the livestream will start in a while, at seven o\u2019clock. You\u2019re on the Hot Search list right now, so we can\u2019t just waste the traffic.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2014\u201dFang Juexia had gotten up at six that morning, and now he was so sleepy that he couldn\u2019t even keep his eyes open. He refused Ling Yi\u2019s invitation to watch a movie, instead going straight to bed and falling asleep. Pei Tingsong watched the cooking competition between Jiang Miao and Lu Yuan in the kitchen for a bit before leaving with a slice of watermelon to stroll to the sofa and ask Ling Yi, \u201cWhere\u2019s your roommate?\u201d\u201cHe fell asleep,\u201d replied Ling Yi, staring at the screen, not looking back at all. \u201cWent to sleep as soon as we got back, too tired\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go take a look.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing going to look at someone sleeping\u00a0ah, pervert?\u201d Ling Yi glanced at him and said, \u201cYou little white-haired devil, you\u2019ve been sticking close to our Juexia every day recently\u2026 don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know.\u201dPei Tingsong was like a dog whose tail had been stepped on. \u201cWho\u2019s sticking close to him every day?\u201d He turned around and made to leave. However, after taking not even two steps, he stopped and threw the watermelon rind in the garbage can beside the sofa, while adding a retort, \u201cWeirdo.\u201dPei Tingsong went back to his room and slammed the door shut.\u201cSo angry, who provoked you?\u201d He Ziyan took out a mini-broom to sweep the floor, just like a community master.\u201cNo one.\u201d Pei Tingsong pretended that nothing had happened and went back to his desk, where he randomly flipped open a book. He Ziyan brought the broom over to his side, helping him sweep the area around as he said, \u201cPei Small Six, I\u2019m sweeping away all these paper balls in this corner for you\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Just after Pei Tingsong uttered that, he acted as though he had received a sudden electric shock, and then immediately rescued a paper ball that he had forgotten in the corner from being swept away by He Ziyan. \u201cThis one I still want.\u201d\u201cWhat\u00a0ah, why are you this nervous?\u201d He Ziyan smelled the scent of gossip. \u201cShow Ge? It can\u2019t be a smutty little poem you wrote\u00a0ba?\u201d\u201cNo, they\u2019re lyrics\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart felt weak; if these lyrics were seen by He Ziyan, then this misunderstanding would grow much larger.However, He Ziyan really didn\u2019t let this go, placing the broom in his hands next to his bed. \u201cLyrics? What lyrics am I not allowed to see?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re just\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t know what to say, when the door suddenly opened, and Lu Yuan howled from outside, \u201cCome out to eat!\u201d\u201cRight away!\u201d He Ziyan answered, before winking at Pei Tingsong and teasing, \u201cDo you have a girl you like at school?\u201d\u201cHow can that be?!\u201d\u201cThen what else are you getting so worked up about?\u201d He Ziyan sat down beside his bed. \u201cXiao Pei, you and Juexia are the only two remaining members of our group who have been solo since birth, yes? Now you want to abandon your Juexia Ge and open up your own house\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t know how to explain it to him. \u201cI really haven\u2019t started dating anyone.\u201d\u201cI know you haven\u2019t, if you really had, it\u2019s not something your face can hide.\u201d He Ziyan looked at him for a while before speaking, \u201cI just feel like you\u2019ve been strange recently, you always randomly start giggling by yourself.\u201dWhat\u00a0ah? Exactly where and when did he start randomly giggling?Pei Tingsong recalled his past behaviour carefully, but he was completely lost on the kind abnormal behavior he had displayed previously. He Ziyan patted his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, don\u2019t think about it, go out and eat\u00a0ba. Oh, right, we\u2019re going to livestream in a bit, so remember to find a wool hat to hide your new hair color.\u201dKnowing that Fang Juexia was asleep, Jiang Miao specially left a sandwich for him and didn\u2019t wake him up. In order to manage their body weight, none of them could eat too much, and their menu was full of light and healthy fitness meals.Fang Juexia slept in a daze and had a dream. In his dream, he was back at the small house, where he had grown up. He was back in the South, where the walls were all wet, and the certificates stuck to them had also gotten wet, with the corner of one such certificate gradually curling off. He went over and tried to stick the certificate back onto the wall, but he couldn\u2019t reach it.He had changed back into a child.Leaving the bedroom, Fang Juexia caught sight of the food on the table that had gone cold. He felt a little hungry, but he couldn\u2019t stomach anything right now, for he smelled the smell he feared very much\u2014the smell of alcohol that was too thick to disperse. Hesitating to step out, he left the kitchen and walked step by step towards the room that frightened him. The smell of alcohol grew stronger and stronger as he got closer, making it difficult for him to breathe.The quarrel happening currently in the room was clear and audible. Through the crack in the door, he saw his mother get grabbed by her hair and then shoved to the ground. His heart suddenly seized, and he fiercely pushed the door open, and waiting for him was an ashtray that hit him.The moment the glass ashtray smashed into him, it turned into a gray fog before his eyes.\u201cGet the fuck out! Everyone get the fuck out!\u201dA hand stretched out from the thick fog and grabbed his collar. \u201cYou look at the birthmark on your face, how ugly it is, you can\u2019t be the lead, you know? You\u2019re just like Dad, you won\u2019t be able to succeed all your life!\u201dCan\u2019t I succeed\u2026.The hand pushed him away, and he fell to the ground. When he stood up, darkness surrounded him all over. Only a spotlight hit his small, thin body, illuminating it from top to bottom. He was pushed onto the stage to be displayed like an inferior and incomplete exhibit.His father\u2019s hysterical voice sounded from all directions, deafening him, and he had nowhere to hide.\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of going blind as soon as you get onto a stage? A cripple on-stage! Do you know what a cripple is?\u201d\u201cLook at me, your dad! This is what a cripple is!\u201d\u201cThere will come a day when you turn into me, do you know that?! You\u2019ll turn into trash just like me.\u201dThe last light also went out completely. Fang Juexia covered his ears in desperation and shook his head frantically. He didn\u2019t want to be the person his father was talking about, didn\u2019t want to become the second him.He wanted to dance, he wanted to be the center of the stage. Fang Juexia stood up and kept practicing in the dark. He fell down, crawled up, and started again. He fell down again and again, until he simply couldn\u2019t stand up ever again. From the beginning to the end, all he had was darkness and injuries.A cripple.Trash.A person born to fail.Could this be his life?His breathing grew more and more rapid, and Fang Juexia wanted to find an exit; he didn\u2019t want to be trapped here any longer. He had to admit that even after so many years, he still hadn\u2019t gotten used to it, and that he was still afraid of the dark.[ I know no matter how scared you are, you will still\u00a0jump. ]Suddenly, Fang Juexia heard a familiar voice. He looked back, but there was no one behind him.Who was it?Why do you know that?[I just know.][Because you are Fang Juexia.]He suddenly woke up from his dream, like resuscitation after drowning.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201dThat familiar voice from the dream appeared again. Fang Juexia opened his eyes and looked at the source of the voice.Pei Tingsong placed the sandwich on the cupboard at the head of the bed and touched Fang Juexia\u2019s forehead. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? You\u2019re covered in cold sweat. Were you dreaming of bungee jumping again?\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s inflamed nerves finally relaxed. He shook his head, then nodded once, before retracting\u00a0 into his quilt. \u201cI had a not-so-good dream.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been sleeping for nearly two hours, aren\u2019t you hungry now\u00a0ah.\u201dFang Juexia once again shook his head, covering his face with the quilt. Only now did he feel his heart pounding; it was fine to dream of past events, but he had even heard Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice in his dream. And then, as soon as he woke up, the person from his dream appeared in front of him. This kind of experience made it difficult for him to open his mouth or face Pei Tingsong.Clearly, he had good intentions in coming here to give him the sandwich, but forget about being thanked, it seemed that he wasn\u2019t even going to get a look from Fang Juexia. Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart felt small and tight. \u201cThen I\u2019m leaving, when you wake up, you eat it yourself.\u201dHe said he would go, but Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t actually leave at all. Looking at how Fang Juexia seemed to be just now, he was still a little worried. His feet remained stuck to the ground, he couldn\u2019t move a single step. He just stood by the bed, unmoving, as he looked at him.Not long after, Ling Yi and He Ziyan ran in with their cellphones in their hands.\u201cWe started the livestream!\u201d Ling Yi suddenly fell on the bed and hugged Juexia from across the quilt. \u201cAh, my baby Juexia! Are you awake?\u201dSeeing Ling Yi pounce on him like a wolf, the barrage immediately boiled up.[AHHHHHHHH JUEXIA!!!][The Roommate line is too sweet!][jxgg nestling in that quilt is really too cute\u00a0ah!][Why is Pei Tingscared in Gege\u2019s room? What are you doing?][Hahahahahaha, Pei Tingscared! Sisters give full marks for current affairs!]Pei Tingsong grew even angrier as soon as he saw Ling Yi behave like this, and so directly pulled him away. \u201cGet off, you\u2019re pinning him.\u201dLing Yi refused, \u201cJuexia didn\u2019t even say anything to me, so what are you saying? I\u2019m not pinning him, this is called a hug!\u201d Saying that, he became more unbridled and directly lifted up Fang Juexia\u2019s quilt to wiggle inside it. \u201cWow, it\u2019s so warm in this quilt.\u201dHe really was something. Pei Tingsong opened up the other end of the quilt and also wormed his body in, as if he was demonstrating a move.[Hahahaha, Pei Tingscared, how are you not scared now? So willing to fight][Doing that is not allowed, I\u2019m the only one who is Gege\u2019s number one I vow]Suddenly, there were two more people on the bed, and the quilt was being pulled from side to side. Fang Juexia, who had nearly fallen asleep again, looked muddled. He peeked his head out and blinked, and then saw He Ziyan sitting by the bed with his phone pointed at him.\u201cAre you making a video?\u201d Fang Juexia asked dazedly. Ling Yi hugged his back inside the quilt as he exclaimed, \u201cWe\u2019re livestreaming!\u201d\u201cLivestreaming\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s mind was confused, and he soon shrank back into the quilt. His view inside the quilt was very narrow and dark, and his eyes blinked slowly. He seemed to be able to see a person lying in front of him. He didn\u2019t know what was going on, but seized by an odd impulse, he stuck out his hand and poked this person, and whatever it was that he poked, it felt hard.He happened to have poked some abs.His hand was caught suddenly, and Fang Juexia instantly realized what was going on. This was Pei Tingsong; besides that person, no one else would grab him like this. He immediately pulled his hand out of his grasp and hid at the other end of the bed.\u201cJuexia, you\u2019re going to squeeze me out!\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgUpon seeing that he was hiding from him, Pei Tingsong grew even more unhappy. He pulled Fang Juexia over in one move and stuck up right against him. \u201cYou\u2019re about to squeeze him out, didn\u2019t you hear?\u201d With that, he fished Fang Juexia up. \u201cDon\u2019t cover your head when you sleep, your breathing will get blocked.\u201d[AHHHHHHHH XIAO PEI IS SO GONG!][As long as there are no ghosts! Pei Tingsong is still the number one gong in K!]He didn\u2019t know if it was just a psychological effect, but Fang Juexia\u2019s breathing really was a bit blocked. Fortunately, Ling Yi quickly changed the topic and began to read the questions appearing in the barrage.\u201cAh, the ensemble show\u2019s preview,\u201d Ling Yi clapped his hands as he explained, \u201cBecause we went on a lot of rides in the amusement park this time, there was a lot of material, so we cut it into two episodes. The key point is that next episode, I, K\u2019s number one big boss, am bungee jumping! Super exciting, you must remember to go watch it!\u201dHe Ziyan added, \u201cOnly those people who lost went bungee jumping. We later went to play bumper cars.\u201d[I like bumper cars, too!][It turns out bungee jumping is a punishment\u00a0ah! Ahhhhhh, I\u2019m so looking forward to the next episode!][I watched the haunted house special while eating, and I didn\u2019t think it would be so funny when I started it! I even spat out my food and almost got beaten up by my mom][jxgg is still dazed, so cute]After they chatted for a while, Fang Juexia suddenly felt a little hungry, so he turned to Pei Tingsong and gave him a meaningful glance, wanting him to help him bring the sandwich over. Pei Tingsong raised his eyebrows, with an expression of \u2018beg me\u2019. Fang Juexia reached into the quilt and pinched his arm.Pei Tingsong stared at him and even more didn\u2019t want to help him get it. Seeing him be like this, Fang Juexia could only soften his stance by rubbing his fingers twice on the spot he had just pinched. Only then did Pei Tingsong let the matter drop, and handed him the sandwich lying on the bedside table.Pei Tingsong really was like a little dog; if you pet him, he\u2019ll be nice and obedient and listen to you. Fang Juexia took a bite of the sandwich on the plate, and Pei Tingsong put the plate in front of him to avoid crumbs falling down onto the bed.[Hahahaha, Ling Yi is so funny][Ah, what are these two slyly doing?! So cloying!][PTS\u2019 expression just now, so sweet!][CP fans, don\u2019t dance in front of the actual people involved, okay][Fire Ge was so hot when he got up close just now! I want to slide on the bridge of Fire Ge\u2019s nose!][Why haven\u2019t Miaomiao and Yuanyuan come yet\u00a0ah?][Question, question! Geges, what is your ideal type like?]\u201cIdeal type?\u201d Ling Yi saw this question in a glance. \u201cThe ideal type as in the type you like?\u201d He turned to look at He Ziyan and asked, \u201cCan we say this, Fire Ge?\u201d\u201cWhy not? Do you like men\u00a0ah?\u201d[Hahahahahahahahahahaha He Ziyan is awesome!][Hahahahahahahaha, Fire Ge is just your Fire Ge!][Hahahaha, do you like men][01 is suddenly out of the closet]\u201cGo to the side.\u201d Ling Yi stretched out a foot, kicked He Ziyan, then solemnly cleared his throat before answering, \u201cMy ideal type\u2026. Let me think\u00a0ah. Because I\u2019m from Sichuan, and all the girls there are fair and clear-skinned, I prefer the fair and clear-skinned, small and lovely type.\u201d\u201cHe Ziyan, it\u2019s your turn!\u201d He clenched his fist and put it in front of He Ziyan like he was holding a microphone, then asked, \u201cPlease tell us, what\u2019s your ideal type?\u201d[It\u2019s uniform allure][Hahahahaha\u00a0ah\u00a0hahaha, enough uniform allure! My whole head is full of ghost nurse Jiejie!]\u201cThe type I like is the kind-hearted type.\u201dAs soon as he finished saying that, Pei Tingsong clicked his tongue and retorted, \u201cQuit that. I\u2019m kind-hearted, so do you like me?\u201dHe Ziyan immediately followed that up with\u2014 \u201cI like you\u00a0ah!\u201d[Hahahahahahaha why is the main gong seducing the other main gong?!][All the melons in this group have a myriad of relationships, PTS and FJX, HZY and PTS]Fang Juexia took a bite of the sandwich and asked more specifically, \u201cWhat about the appearance?\u201dHe Ziyan looked at the camera. \u201cI don\u2019t ask for much, as long as they\u2019re beautiful, and best would be if they have long, straight black hair and long legs.\u201d[That\u2019s called not asking for much????][Ge??? You\u2019re making fun of me??][Alright, next.]Ling Yi clenched his fist and put it in front of Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth. \u201cFour Ge, your turn.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d This was the first time Fang Juexia had ever faced this type of question. Let alone an ideal type, he had never even imagined what he would be like in love.Ling Yi started to rescue him from siege. \u201cPlease note that this is not a still picture.\u201dSurprisingly, Pei Tingsong realized that he cared about Fang Juexia\u2019s answer. He was just curious about what kind of answer this guy, who avoided falling in love, would state, and what kind of person he would like.After hesitating for a long time, Fang Juexia finally said, \u201cEn\u2026. I might like confident people\u00a0ba.\u201d[I\u2019m confident\u00a0ah, Ge! Look at me! My ID is Fang Juexia\u2019s only wife online, see how confident I am!][Hahaha, enough sisters!]\u201cJust the kind of person who can do very well in their field of expertise. I find such people very attractive.\u201dHe Ziyan couldn\u2019t help teasing, \u201cJuexia\u2019s description here doesn\u2019t sound like that of a girl, but more like that of a big boss.\u201d[Big boss in women\u2019s clothes??][Hahahahahahaha what is going on with the barrage for this group\u2019s livestream!]Fang Juexia felt that he had also gone a bit off track in his answer, and he was even beginning to suspect that he hadn\u2019t woken up properly and was talking nonsense. In order to not cause any misunderstandings, he went ahead and casually added some descriptions, \u201cJust, appearance isn\u2019t particularly important to me. Someone who looks nice when smiling, and is gentle and cute, it\u2019s all very good. I\u2019m not very picky.\u201dGentle and cute. These two words ran into Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart like two bees buzzing around here and there, stinging painfully. He thought it over and over again, and thought that that was as different from him as the heavens are to the earth.No, wait, why was he comparing himself to that description?\u201cWhat about Xiao Pei?\u201dPei Tingsong was still distracted, but Fang Juexia pulled on his sleeve, and he realized what was going on. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn now?\u201dWhat kind of person was his ideal type?He was still immersed in the impact of Fang Juexia\u2019s answer just now, and was a little out of state. \u201cSimilar to Fire Ge\u00a0ba, I haven\u2019t thought about it.\u201d\u201cThis guy, and you were actually saying stuff about me?\u201d\u201cWhat did I say about you? Did I say you like people in uniforms?\u201dFang Juexia lowered his head and saw the half remaining sandwich gripped in his hand. For no reason at all, he recalled the description of He Ziyan\u2019s ideal: beautiful, long and straight black hair, long legs. He thought about it, and a girl who fit all these requirements actually appeared in front of him. He couldn\u2019t see her face clearly, but when she stood beside Pei Tingsong, they seemed to be very well-matched.It was so sour.He chewed the pickles in the sandwich, and the stimulation of his taste buds poked at his heart.Seeing him frown, Pei Tingsong reached out and gave him a glass of water. \u201cHere.\u201dFang Juexia took a look, shook his head, and forced himself to swallow the pickle that he didn\u2019t like one bit. He didn\u2019t know what the matter with him was, but he didn\u2019t want to drink the water Pei Tingsong was offering. Pei Tingsong suddenly lifted up the quilt and left without saying a word. Ling Yi and He Ziyan didn\u2019t know what was going on, and after glancing over, they simply continued to livestream and chat with the fans about other things.With the bedside becoming suddenly empty. Fang Juexia also didn\u2019t speak any more; he felt that he had eaten in a bit too much of a hurry just now, and the food stuffed in his esophagus didn\u2019t seem like it would go down, so his heart also felt blocked, while he felt bad. He lowered his head and patted himself on the chest.Just a little while later, a well-defined hand appeared in front of him, holding a glass of sweet orange juice.When he looked up, he saw Pei Tingsong awkwardly raise his hand and tug at the brim of his woolen cap as he handed the cup directly into Fang Juexia\u2019s hand. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want plain boiled water, this one should be good\u00a0ba.\u201dThe glass that was in his hand was cold and icy, with glistening golden fruit juice wobbling around in its interior.\u201cIt\u2019s sweet, quickly drink it\u00a0ba.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Xiao Pei said something about sweet?][omg really so doting (covers mouth)][AHHHHHHHHHHH WHAT DID I SEE!!!][The main players started dancing on my head!!!!][PTS: handsome appearance and kind heart with no cueing required][AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH THE SPECIAL POLICE ARE GOING TO GET ME!][FJX is loved by everyone, I\u2019m carrying him away][AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH]Both of the two involved parties had yet to become aware of this current situation. Fang Juexia, who had thought that Pei Tingsong had lost his temper with him, was a little surprised to see the orange juice. He took a sip of the juice, and sure enough, it was really sweet. His strange symptoms disappeared in an instant, as if this juice was more effective than even a panacea. He didn\u2019t finish it though, and just as he was about to put it aside, Pei Tingsong intercepted him to take hold of the cup, and then drank the remaining juice.Ling Yi stared at the barrage on the screen and said, \u201cWhat questions do you guys still want to ask?\u201d Just then, all of them suddenly heard the door open.\u201cThe trailer for the first episode of \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019 has come out!\u201d Lu Yuan carried a laptop and came in with Jiang Miao as he added, \u201cFreshly out, let\u2019s watch it together?\u201d\u201cAh, it finally came out!\u201d Ling Yi was excited and rubbed his hands together. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for a long time now, Escape is so slow.\u201dLu Yuan put his laptop in the middle of the bed and turned on the speaker. \u201cOf course, you think it\u2019s our ensemble show\u00a0ah, just randomly cut the footage together and then you can broadcast it.\u201dJiang Miao immediately said, \u201cHey, it\u2019s wrong to say that\u00a0ah, speaking as if the production team for our ensemble show doesn\u2019t take a lot of care.\u201d Saying that, he specially looked at Pei Tingsong and said, \u201cLittle Ge had such a hard time last episode\u00a0ah, getting fatigued to death just censoring out Xiao Pei.\u201dFang Juexia immediately laughed and glanced at Pei Tingsong.\u201cWater Ge,\u201d Pei Tingsong rolled his eyes. \u201cYou\u00a0really are my Ge.\u201d[Hahahahahahaha even Miaomiao is starting to complain about Pei Tingscared!][He\u2019s finished, the group tyrant\u2019s position is crumbling down]He Ziyan adjusted the livestream camera on his cellphone and announced, \u201cHello everyone, it\u2019s time for a \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019 trailer reaction video! If you want to watch it with us, you can go to Weibo and click play on the preview yourself.\u201d[Okay!! Order received!! ][It\u2019s time to cut an expression pack from this video! Good luck, sisters!]Jiang Miao told Lu Yuan, \u201cTurn the brightness a little higher, and also turn the volume up a bit.\u201d\u201cDone.\u201d\u201cShh, it\u2019s started.\u201dAt the beginning of the trailer, in the middle of the dark, was a TV, broadcasting the news, but there seemed to be something wrong with it. The TV screen kept flashing, to the point that the images on it couldn\u2019t be seen clearly. Fang Juexia listened carefully to the sound being played in the background, and there seemed to be a faint sound, like that of the buzz of an alarm.The image playing on the TV was suddenly interrupted, and the once dark screen turned into a complete snowy white screen, which was flickering constantly.Ling Yi rubbed his arm and said, \u201cWow, the beginning here gives off a bit of a horror film feel.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it a suspense show though?\u201d Lu Yuan remarked.A voice-over appeared, and its content was from the anonymous letter Zhai Ying had received.[Hello detective, what I want to ask you to do this time is to find a fugitive. He is steeped in crime and is very good at hiding his identity\u2026.]Jiang Miao frowned. \u201cSo it is a homicide case again this time as well?\u201d\u201cIt feels like it is!\u201d Ling Yi rubbed his chin as he declared, \u201cLet me see who the killer is this time. Don\u2019t be caught by this famous detective, Kaleido\u2019s Ling Yi.\u201dThe trailer\u2019s point of view kept moving forward, showing that the camera was getting closer and closer to the TV, until the snowy screen dominated the entire screen. Suddenly, this snowy image twisted into a whirlpool of black and white, making everyone dizzy. The voice-over suddenly disappeared, and a pocket watch started to swing back and forth on the screen. The background sound appeared once again, and this time, it could be heard clearly that it was a steady male voice, systematically chanting out the words for the hypnosis.As it swung back and forth, the chain of the pocket watch suddenly broke. The scene transitioned into the moment a pair of pale hands, holding a small blade, managed to make the last cut to separate a rope.\u201cThose were Juexia\u2019s hands\u00a0ba?!\u201d Ling Yi looked back and winked at Fang Juexia, to which, Fang Juexia only winked back in response.The scene of cutting the rope quickly changed to the scene of a pair of handcuffs being unlocked. The sound of the hypnosis stopped suddenly, and another voice appeared\u2014[I have a premonition that I\u2019m about to die.]The view switched to the execution area for when a player was eliminated. The bright red circle on the floor indicated a player\u2019s departure, and the voice of the program group\u2019s narrator appeared\u2014[Player XXX has died.]However, Pei Tingsong\u2019s name had been removed from the audio by the program group. Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help but sigh in his heart; the program group had actually edited the audio from when Xia Xiqing was reading Zaozao\u2019s diary into the scene of Pei Tingsong\u2019s execution, thus creating a disturbance amongst the audience.Lu Yuan was suddenly excited. \u201cWho died? Did the person who discovered the killer\u2019s identity die, so he had had that premonition?\u201dPei Tingsong smiled. \u201cGod knows.\u201dEveryone\u2019s attention turned back to the trailer again. At this late moment, the BGM finally rolled in\u2014 the drums were strong, the rhythm not fast at all\u2014containing a bit of a depraved and morbid feel to it. Close-up shots of all the six guests\u2019 faces flashed by one by one, each clip appearing on a drum beat. The last clip that appeared stayed on the screen, and it was of Zhou Ziheng\u2019s face as he raised his eyebrows and stated, \u201cThere may be more than one victim, but there is only one killer.\u201dThe screen changed with the beat, and before each new person appeared, a black screen would appear first.Xia Xiqing asked, \u201cDo you think I killed him?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Shang Sirui shrugged. \u201cI want to keep my solo character. I don\u2019t have a partner.\u201dZhai Ying\u2019s action of squinting looked very alpha as she questioned, \u201cDid the killer kill off the one he thought was the real white knight?\u201dThen, the scene transitioned again, this time to show Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia, who were handcuffed and bound, as they confronted each other from the opposite ends of a table. The corners of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth angled upwards, and he asked, \u201cDid you draw the killer?\u201dFang Juexia raised an eyebrow. \u201cYes\u00a0ah, you\u2019re with the killer in the very first game. How do you feel about that?\u201dThe handcuffed Pei Tingsong leaned forward, and lying half-prostrated across the table, looked at Fang Juexia with both eyes, making a pitiful and innocent expression. \u201cI\u2019m especially scared.\u201dRight after saying that, he started to smile, and soon burst out laughing.Ling Yi couldn\u2019t help but turn on the mic. \u201cWow, Pei Tingsong, your laugh right here is so scary\u00a0ah! Like a psycho murderer.\u201dOnce again, the screen went completely dark, and the background music paused, as if leaving behind a breath in that moment. A metallic-sounding narration appeared next, filled with tension\u2014[Attention, players\u2014]The screen lit up, and the music started up again. What appeared was the scene of Xia Xiqing walking out of a room, but the camera didn\u2019t show his face.[This season will introduce a new character for all players\u2014 the double-faced knight.]Two cards appeared on the screen, displayed on the surface of a cellphone, one representing the white knight of light, the other representing the black knight of darkness. This shot soon transitioned into another scene\u2014moving-grid paintings on the wall, torn wallpaper, and black and white doors.Xia Xiqing laughed into the camera. \u201cI am the double-faced knight.\u201d\u201cWhat a coincidence.\u201d Pei Tingsong raised his eyebrows. \u201cSo am I.\u201dFang Juexia raised his eyebrows, hints of doubt visible in his eyes, the birthmark at the corner of his eye clear. \u201cThen which camp did you choose?\u201dIn the next shot, the final door slammed open, and a line appeared under the backlit exit\u2014the double-faced knight has escaped with his life.Even if there was no image, Pei Tingsong\u2019s low voice was particularly clear as he declared\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s not important which camp I chose.\u201d\u201cAs long as our alliance has not been dissolved, I am your knight.\u201dAt the end of the trailer, there was a whistle from the BGM, carrying with it a sense of suspense.\u201cWorthy of \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019!\u201d The six people all clapped together.\u201cOur old four and six had a lot of scenes\u00a0ah, one look and you can tell they\u2019re cannon fodder characters.\u201d\u201cHahahaha, it\u2019s true.\u201dBanter was banter, but Fang Juexia had to admit that the producers for \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019 could really play. Every trailer of theirs had enough of a suspenseful feel to it, and the atmosphere it created was also first-class. However, there were no spoilers revealed at all, and anyone who didn\u2019t end up running with the wrong idea from this trailer was pretty good. On top of that, this time, they had departed from normal practice, not even bothering to hide the killer at all, simply showing him off directly for everyone to see. They were really bold.\u201cI know what\u2019s going on!\u201d Ling Yi fiddled with the nonexistent Detective Conan bow-tie in front of his neck. \u201cXiao Pei is the knight! Right, right?\u201d He said this and immediately shook Fang Juexia\u2019s arm. \u201cIf I guessed right, blink.\u201dFang Juexia couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you\u00a0ah, we\u2019re still livestreaming.\u201dLing Yi took the plunge. \u201cOff! Turn it off now!\u201dImmediately, the barrage wasn\u2019t okay with that.[Hey, hey, hey, a certain someone, pay a bit more attention!][Turn off the livestream???? 01, you look at Mama\u2019s face and say that again?][Are we so unimportant?]Jiang Miao seriously analyzed, \u201cI feel that the game this time is very complicated. The first half of the game focuses on the killer, and I thought there would be only one special role, that of the killer, like in the first season. But I didn\u2019t expect that in the second half of the trailer, a double-faced knight would suddenly appear. It looks really exciting.\u201dFang Juexia recalled how he had trembled due to nerves while filming, and it had been really exciting.Lu Yuan started to tremble. \u201cI even got goosebumps from the way Xiao Pei was laughing.\u201d\u201cAccording to the way in which the program group did this before,\u201d He Ziyan said, \u201cthe more villain-like you look, the less likely you are to be the villain, so that\u2019s just a feint. So Xiao Pei\u2019s character is definitely on the side of good.\u201dLing Yi reached over to Fang Juexia and began to shake his arm again, asking once again, \u201cRight? If it\u2019s right, blink!\u201dPei Tingsong raised his hand and made a gesture of zipping up his mouth, and then stretched his hand over to Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth and zipped it for him.[Hahahahahahaha silent as the grave Pinot Tree Supreme][Fortunately, the program team didn\u2019t invite 01, otherwise, with him like this, he would start up a livestream to reveal spoilers right after filming][I think Fire Ge\u2019s analysis is reasonable\u00a0ah. The program group made Xiao Pei look like a villain, but maybe he was the one who was killed by the killer!][Juexia Gege\u2019s styling looks so good (Key mistake! Juexia baby\u2019s elegant and refined glasses look is so good!][Ah, broadcast faster\u00a0ba! One week is too hard!]The previous disturbance about the selection of guests for the show had already made Escape 2 eye-catching, and it became popular before filming even started. With the trailer finally being released, coupled with the strong return of the original team and a new hot CP, it naturally became a hot topic of discussion.When the guest lineup had been officially announced, the newly added idols had been criticized by most netizens the entire time, and there had been long article after long article about how this new season was going to become an unworthy sequel to the stellar first season. However, after seeing Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia face off at the same table, the public opinion changed a lot.[@Has Escape For Your Life Broadcast today: AHHHHHHH MY ESCAPE!! The quiet\u00a0bb\u00a0little Ge wearing glasses really looks good, I\u2019m really fragrant again][@223333: Shit, where did the escape crew find so many immortals? The handsome Ge in handcuffs, that part where he said he was scared and then started laughing, I just made up an entire story about a psycho serial killer in my head.]This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org[@Today\u2019s words haven\u2019t been memorized yet: Suddenly get the CP feel for PTS and FJX! Sick and pampered younger gong x calm and refined shou, really good match! No wonder they went from the Arctic Circle to being a red hot CP!][@ New Year\u2019s cake is not sticky: Wow, this trailer is longer than the one before. With the news broadcast in front combined with the letter to the detective begging for help, I feel that this is also like last season\u2019s \u201chomicide\u201d model. The killer should also be related to the murderer in the plot. Does the combination of the pocket watch and recitation mean there\u2019s hypnosis? And the new knight role is so cool\u00a0ah! Can be black or white, very worthwhile! However, according to the program group\u2019s usual routine, I feel that the more exaggerated people are in the trailer, when it comes to the actual drama, they will all be people on the good side. Don\u2019t dare to make random bets, drumming on my bowl and waiting for next Friday!][@Cherry flavored Coca Cola: FJX is really darn good-looking\u00a0ah.

Fang Juexia\u2019s temperament is excellent. He plainly gives off a cold sense of great distance, but when he speaks and frowns, I feel that he is seducing me!

You\u2019re so gong, so what ghosts are you afraid of\u00a0ah, Didi?][@To have Pinot you have to plant Pinot Tree Supremes replying to @Never pursuing stars again: Hahahahaha, k*ll them all and exec*te them immediately!]With the silly ensemble show that went beyond their fan circle, combined with the trailer and blessing of a very popular variety show, Kaleido once again boarded the Hot Search list. The follower count for the group\u2019s official Weibo and the group members\u2019 individual Weibos all grew rapidly, and the warm-up for the new album in the ensemble group show also came in handy. More and more people began to pay attention to their new album.Coincidentally, at this same time, Astar\u2019s Seven Luminaries had also just made their comeback. Yesterday, they had already started up on their stage performances. The major forums had already opened threads to discuss the achievements of the two groups\u2019 comebacks. However, most of them still thought that 7L and K weren\u2019t of the same order of magnitude at all, and so their achievements could not be said to be equal.Star Chart and all the members of Kaleido knew better than anyone else how important this comeback truly was; this was a watershed moment, which could decide whether they would go up or down. With their popularity being so high now, if they had good results, there would definitely be a big batch of new fans, and it wasn\u2019t impossible for them to soar after that. However, if they\u00a0fell down on their faces and got stepped on, they would be ridiculed to the center of the earth and beaten back into their original state.Originally, entertainment networks didn\u2019t have any singing programs, but due to the increasing demand for idol groups and the growing demand for stage performances, major video platforms began to produce their own singing programs. In the past two years, such shows had seen stable audience numbers, but after all, its history was short, and these were capital platforms that relied on money. The waters here were very deep, so it was difficult to achieve fairness and justice.When Kaleido had first debuted, they originally could have had a month of playtime, but because of the hidden rules rumors, they were boycotted by anti-fans. Their playtime was then reduced to one week, and they could only perform one main song. Their second mini album didn\u2019t make much of a splash, Star Chart not having enough money to manage everything. They could only give way to the platform compressing opportunities and making room for other groups.The entertainment industry was very realistic, and right now, Kaleido was on fire. Even before the new album was even released, there were already platforms contacting them and inquiring about their comeback performance schedule in advance in order to cooperate with them.Fang Juexia had always stayed out of the business of the fickle emotions of the entertainment circle. He was like a through and through outsider, having nothing to do with anything aside from singing and dancing. Every day, besides practicing with his bandmates, he would spend time recording, and the whole group\u2019s time was arranged in such a way that they were completely packed.In the dressing room, he changed into a loose white cotton and linen shirt and black trousers with wide legs. As Fang Juexia closed the cabinet, he received a WeChat message from Liang Ruo. Even from before that charity party, a long time had passed since Liang Ruo had messaged non-stop to contact him like he used to way back before. Originally, Fang Juexia had thought that Liang Ruo had given up, and so he hadn\u2019t expected to receive another message.He opened it and looked at it.[Astar Liang Ruo: Juexia, I don\u2019t mean to badger you. I have something very important to tell you, and when you have time, call me, it\u2019s really very important.]Fang Juexia swiped left to delete the message after reading it and followed everyone into the practice room.In order to make their group dance look as neat as knives chopping down in unison, Star Chart had specially found two choreographers from within the company, and had put one in the front and the other in the back, in order to thoroughly grasp everyone\u2019s details, thus striving to achieve the best overall effect they could create through endless practice.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s rest\u00a0ba,\u00a0and continue in the evening.\u201d The choreographer clapped his hands and said, \u201cYou guys can eat something. By the way, Juexia.\u201dHaving been called out, Fang Juexia raised his head, even as sweat dripped into his eyes.The choreographer came over and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been practicing a little too hard recently. I know you\u2019re a hardworking child, but if you go on like this, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll get injured again, and you won\u2019t be able to handle all the performances later.\u201dFang Juexia nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be more careful.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be too nervous, there are still two weeks until we shoot the MV, and there is plenty of time.\u201d The teacher patted him on the shoulder, praising, \u201cAnd you\u2019ve already done a great job.\u201d\u201cThank you, Teacher.\u201dAs soon as the choreographer left, Lu Yuan yelled for everyone to go eat. Fang Juexia had no appetite, so he let them go first.He was the only one left in the practice room. Fang Juexia lifted the hem of his shirt and wiped his sweat, looking at himself in the mirror. Maybe the WeChat message from just now had reminded him of his practice sessions at Astar before. The people who had debuted as Seven Luminaries had all been people who had once worked hard in the same practice room with him. The competition in big companies was 100 times more severe than that seen in small companies, and every day before his debut, he had been on tenterhooks about his chances of survival. At that time, he had pretty much gotten used to even sleeping in the practice room.The previous songs and dances, he had already gotten them down pat. Even now, he believed that he could complete the whole performance of those songs without even a single mistake. But now, everything was new, and it felt like he was starting all over again. He had to practice the way he did before, all the way until there was not even the slightest possibility of making any mistakes at all, and only then could he be rest assured to go onstage and perform.With this in mind, Fang Juexia started the music again, stood in front of the mirror, untied the black tie he was wearing, took it off, then blindfolded himself with it, tying it into a knot behind his head.He had returned to the familiar darkness again.Here was the preset stage, and every move was strictly controlled by him to be within the predetermined distance, and he nailed down where his position in the group was. In the dark, his five bandmates appeared one by one and gathered together to form the complete group dance. Even a little error in distance could cause mistakes on the stage, and a single mistake may result in an unimaginable chain reaction. He couldn\u2019t afford to gamble, so he could only practice repeatedly to minimize his failure rate.After practicing the group dance blindfolded, Fang Juexia connected his cellphone with the stereo and prepared to practice the dance break in the middle of the song, which he would need to perform alone. He took off his shoes and stepped barefoot on the floor of the practice room.The choreography for this part had been composed by him and a Chinese classical dance teacher. It incorporated the dance style of Chinese classical dance, and contrasted with the strong choreography used for the chorus part of the song. Every movement was big and open, being extremely flexible but also very tough, in order to look just like\u00a0floating clouds and flowing water. For the sake of stage effect, they had added a lot of difficult movements. Although he had missed his childhood dream, Fang Juexia, having been trained in the essentials of Chinese classical dance, hadn\u2019t lost the skill even after so many years, and could still execute these movements very easily.Taking a deep breath, he threw himself forward, as if to explore the sea, then jumped up again, repeating the motion twice. He raised his legs, drew his upper body back, soared up like a swallow, and then fell back steadily. Moving alongside the sounds of the piano, Fang Juexia\u2019s right leg remained steady on the ground alone, his left leg lifted up high at the side, almost forming a vertical line with his right leg, perfectly completing the final fixed-point action of raising and controlling his leg.His hearing became particularly sensitive in the dark, and he seemed to hear a click while the music was changing.\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201dWere they back?Feeling suspicious, Fang Juexia slowly lowered his raised leg, put his hands behind him, and undid his blindfold. However, as soon as he took it off, he found that something was wrong.The light in the practice room had been turned off, and nothing could be seen.Before he could react, the invader in the dark forced his hands behind him quickly, pushed him all the way to the mirror, and pressed down on his shoulders, forcing his whole person to stick to the cold mirror. A warm and dangerous body temperature came up to cling right against him from the back. Since he had just finished dancing, Fang Juexia had not yet had the time to adjust his breathing, and his chest heaved violently, while his toes caught on the cold floor unconsciously.A light laugh sounded out through the darkness, and Fang Juexia instantly saw through the situation. \u201cPei Tingsong.\u201dHe let out a slight sigh. \u201cHave you had enough fun?\u201dThe other side seemed to wait for a while before finally letting go, saying lazily, \u201cYou\u2019re really boring.\u201dFang Juexia turned around and leaned back against the mirror. \u201cYou\u2019re not boring at all, while others were dancing, you turned off the lights and came to plunder.\u201dPei Tingsong just smiled, but didn\u2019t say anything in reply. He had just gone out to buy something to eat, and in passing, had also bought some for Fang Juexia. Who would have known that as soon as he came upstairs, he would see Fang Juexia blindfolded as he practiced dancing. He looked really good when dancing, and his body was just like a cloud, especially during that moment at the end, when he had raised his leg, and his loose trouser leg had slid down along his straight and pale leg. He was too pretty.This was the first time Pei Tingsong had seen him practice in this manner. He couldn\u2019t control his evil thoughts and wanted to play a prank on him.\u201cTurn on the light.\u201d Fang Juexia sat down against the mirror.\u201cNo.\u201dHe knew that Pei Tingsong wouldn\u2019t be so well-behaved and obedient. Fang Juexia wanted to see the time, so he said, \u201cThen bring me my cellphone.\u201dPei Tingsong turned on his cellphone flashlight, went to the stereo, took hold of his cellphone, then came back to squat in front of Fang Juexia, ordering, \u201cBeg me.\u201dThe cellphone\u2019s flashlight shone on his face. After intense exercise, his red skin was soaked with hot sweat, and his birthmark looked as if it was about to melt. Fang Juexia, who had just stopped his dance practice, was full of lazy energy from head to toe, so he just raised his eyes and stretched out his hand towards him.Seeing him like this, Pei Tingsong actually felt reluctant to refuse, so he handed his cellphone to him. Sitting in front of him, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of that move, that one where you took off into the sky just now? It\u2019s really beautiful.\u201dAs soon as the topic of dancing was raised, a faint smile appeared on Fang Juexia\u2019s face. He picked up his tie from the ground and put it around his neck, whispering, \u201cSwallow style purple gold crown.\u201dNice name, too. Pei Tingsong\u2019s gaze followed Fang Juexia\u2019s hand as it fell onto his open shirt collar, and then, he looked away. \u201cBlindfolded like that and dancing, you\u2019re not afraid something might happen?\u201d\u201cWhat can happen?\u201d Fang Juexia looked down at his cellphone and replied slowly, \u201cThe floor of the practice room is so flat, it\u2019s not like I can trip and fall.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t the \u2018something\u2019 he meant to imply.\u201cJust like what I just did, turning off the lights and knocking you out. You would have no room to fight back.\u201dThe corners of Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth hooked up, and without lifting\u00a0 up his head, he retorted, \u201cBesides you, who else would do something like this to me?\u201dHe wasn\u2019t sure what nerve these words poked, but Pei Tingsong felt two different things at the same time\u2014 he was at ease, while also finding it hard to endure. This kind of contradictory mood had started to appear rather frequently in recent days, and it would constantly pull at him, holding onto his heart.He swiveled his neck a few times and incidentally distracted himself by telling Fang Juexia, \u201cEat something. I brought you a salad.\u201dFang Juexia took a deep breath. His whole person slid down against the mirror like a soft snake as he ended up leaning on the floor and propping his head on his extended arms. \u201cI\u2019m so tired, I don\u2019t have the strength. Let\u2019s talk about it later\u00a0ba.\u201dLooking at him lying like this, for reasons unknown to him, Pei Tingsong\u2019s ears actually started to get hot. He stood up, went to pick up the salad he had bought, and then came over to grab Fang Juexia\u2019s cellphone away from him.\u201cEat it quickly. This young master specifically went to go buy it for you, and if you don\u2019t eat it, I\u2019m going to start cursing.\u201dFang Juexia wasn\u2019t the Fang Juexia from before, the one who would hide from him and pretend he was empty air, and hadn\u2019t been so for a long time now. When he heard this, he laughed. He lay on his side and looked up at Pei Tingsong. \u201cGo ahead and curse.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 56Chapter 56 \u2013 The Point Of No ReturnTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksWhat was so urgent ahReally\u2026 Pei Tingsong thought that his temper had been too good recently, and he had spoiled Fang Juexia until he ended up like this. Just as he was about to speak, the cellphone in his hand vibrated. He glanced at the lock screen and saw the words [Astar Liang Ruo].Within a split second, his mood plummeted down to reach the bottom of a valley, while an inexplicable angry heat rose up within him internally. Pei Tingsong wasn\u2019t a good-natured person, and when he thought about how Fang Juexia had just asked him to bring over his cellphone, maybe it was because he had wanted to chat with Liang Ruo. Seeing him get involved with that person like this made Pei Tingsong\u2019s chest grow stuffier and stuffier. However, he still held back and didn\u2019t want to lose his temper at Fang Juexia, and he also had no standpoint to justify losing his temper. So, he just placed the cellphone, with its screen upside down, on the ground, pulled Fang Juexia up and stuffed the salad box into his arms.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t count as being someone with a sensitive personality, but even he could almost immediately feel that Pei Tingsong wasn\u2019t happy. He couldn\u2019t explain why; he just thought that Pei Tingsong should retort back, but instead, he was so stuffy and silent, and the atmosphere seemed to have turned a bit wrong as well.Yet, if Pei Tingsong was really angry, his reaction should be much greater than just this.Very strange.\u00a0Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t grasp the reason behind it, and he didn\u2019t want to expose this right now, so he opened the salad box instead and ate a few mouthfuls, after which he saw the cucumber slices there. He had long disliked cucumbers, and that sandwich from a few days ago had left him with some trauma over pickles, so he used his fork and moved all of the cucumber slices to a corner of the box, then ate the other vegetables and chicken breast pieces.Pei Tingsong saw this series of small actions. He had originally been sulky, but now, he kind of wanted to laugh. \u201cHey, how old are you, that you\u2019re still picking through your food? I\u2019m two years younger than you, and I don\u2019t even pick through it.\u201dFang Juexia placed the fork on the side of the box and emphasized while mumbling, \u201cThree years younger.\u201d\u201cTwo and a half.\u201d Pei Tingsong picked up his fork and ate all the cucumber slices he had just picked out.In Fang Juexia\u2019s opinion, sharing food with another person was a very ambiguous thing, especially if one ate the food that the other person didn\u2019t like. Because when he was very young, he had seen his dad also be this way\u2014 he would eat the celery that his mama didn\u2019t like while telling her not to be picky.Seeing that he was in a daze, Pei Tingsong knocked on the side of the box with his fork. \u201cWhat are you thinking about? You\u2019re so engrossed.\u201dFang Juexia returned to his senses and said, \u201cNothing, just that I don\u2019t think you\u2019re behaving like a young master at all right now. People who didn\u2019t know better would think the company has wronged you and isn\u2019t giving you any food.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m adhering to the fine tradition of not wasting things and not being picky about food. That\u2019s why I could grow to be 1.9 meters, and you could only grow to a height of 1.8 meters.\u201d\u201cYou got taller again?\u201dPei Tingsong was even a little proud. \u201cJust measured yesterday, exactly\u00a0190.\u201d Saying that, he got up and went to the door, to turn on the light in the practice room.\u201cKaleido has no room for such a big Buddha like you.\u201d Fang Juexia picked up his cellphone from the ground. He just wanted to glance at the time when he saw Liang Ruo\u2019s name displayed on his lock screen.He had no feelings towards Liang Ruo and theoretically, he also didn\u2019t believe him when he said he had important matters to discuss with him. After all, there was almost no intersection between them now, except for unequal competition. If it was about what happened in the past, he had already distanced himself from that issue a long time ago, and didn\u2019t want to look back anymore.All of their other bandmates also came back, and Fang Juexia was actually glad that they hadn\u2019t returned any earlier and caught him alone with Pei Tingsong, with the lights off.No, why was he afraid of that? He didn\u2019t do anything wrong.Fang Juexia realized that recently, he was always falling into this contradictory mire woven between logic and emotion. Rationally, he had never done anything that would produce any apologetic feelings, shame, or guilt, but these emotions kept surging up nonetheless.Especially guilt.In the middle of the night, they were brought to the studio in order to complete the recording of the last song of the whole album. It was a hard-earned achievement, and Cheng Qiang sighed, \u201cFinally finished it. You\u2019ve all worked hard, go back and take a hot bath, and we\u2019ll have a meeting at 10 o\u2019clock tomorrow morning. Xiao Wen will pick you guys up, so don\u2019t sleep too late.\u201dJust as he said that, another round of wailing emerged\u2014\u201cAnother meeting\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve gotten so numb to meetings recently. As soon as Boss speaks, I start feeling sleepy.\u201d\u201cAlright, you guys,\u201d Cheng Qiang sent them out of the studio with the final words, \u201cTomorrow\u2019s meeting is to discuss the styling and MV design, it probably shouldn\u2019t be too long. Anyway, even if you guys didn\u2019t have a meeting, you would still have to get up early to practice. At least while having a meeting, you can also have a bit of a rest.\u201dBy the time they returned to the dormitory, Fang Juexia\u2019s cellphone already had no power left. He went back to his room and charged it.\u201cYiyi, are you taking a bath?\u201dLing Yi, who was already lying on his bed, said, \u201cYou go first\u00a0ba, I\u2019ll scroll through Weibo for a while.\u201dFang Juexia let out an \u201cen\u201d, found a medicinal plaster in his desk drawer, and took a clean set of pajamas from the wardrobe before going to the main bathroom.He took a quick bath and put on his pants. Injuries were inevitable while training, and recently, the intensity of their training had increased. Although he had made sure to rest well and stretch properly, things would still happen. Fang Juexia took off his top, pressed the back of his slightly sore waist, and tore off the cover on the plaster while aiming it at his injury through the mirror. However, it was really a little hard to look at the mirror in this manner, and his head was twisted around until it was sore.He was about to twist his hand around to reach his back when the bathroom door suddenly opened. He thought it was Ling Yi who was entering, but when he looked up, he saw Pei Tingsong instead.The other party seemed to be a bit surprised. \u201cThe door wasn\u2019t locked, so I thought nobody\u2026\u201dFang Juexia blinked a few times before standing up straight with the plaster still in his hand. \u201cOh, I\u2026 I wanted to stick this on.\u201dSure enough, those strange, illogical emotions sprang up in his heart once again.Pei Tingsong scratched his head while grabbing the door handle, neither leaving nor staying. Thinking of the awkward posture Fang Juexia had been in when he had pushed the door open just now, he simply offered, \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201dHe came over just like that and stretched his hand out to take the plaster. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t even have the time to refuse anything.\u201cWhere do you want to stick it?\u201dFang Juexia turned his back to him and thought of the scene when Pei Tingsong had played a prank on him in the practice room in the afternoon. He twisted his hand around to the back of his waist, pressed above the curve of his waist on the right with his fingers, and released it again. \u201cHere\u2026\u201dHis skin was dazzlingly pale under the strong light of the bathroom, and there were also water droplets rolling down his back. That illusion of the tug of war in the practice room appeared here again, and Pei Tingsong\u2019s breathing grew tight. He pulled out a towel to dry the residual water on Fang Juexia\u2019s waist for him. His index finger and middle finger pressed together to then poke against Fang Juexia\u2019s waist a few times. \u201cHere?\u201d\u201cA little to the right.\u201d\u201cHere?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201dPei Tingsong felt that something wasn\u2019t quite right with him; his heart had started beating faster and faster, and his thoughts were completely disorganized. But it wasn\u2019t like he hadn\u2019t seen Fang Juexia without a top on before; he had even held him in his arms for an entire night and hadn\u2019t thought anything of it at that time.So, what was going on right now?He stuck the plaster he held in his hand onto that spot, smoothed it out with his fingers, and then, with his head half lowered, he said, \u201cOkay, done.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cThank you.\u201d Fang Juexia reached out and rubbed it, then picked up his pajamas and put them on, buttoning it with his back towards Pei Tingsong, only turning around after he was done. \u201cDo you want to take a bath?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Pei Tingsong kind of had no way to look at Fang Juexia directly right now. He knew that he was being very strange like this, and he felt feverish, so he could only divert his attention. \u201cIs your waist okay, why do you need to stick that on? Has your waist injury been acting up again?\u201dFang Juexia wiped his hair with a towel. \u201cNo. I\u2019m just a little sore. That wasn\u2019t a pain killer, that was just medicine to relieve soreness.\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s good\u2026\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t speak any longer, instead making room for him and closed the bathroom door behind him. However, Pei Tingsong remained standing in the same place for a while, waiting for his mind to reach a peaceful state before he locked the door. He reached out a hand to take off his top, and the light in the bathroom made him fidgety. When he was mixing around in the underground rap scene, he had seen many people try to stick close to him as they showed off their lust and desire openly, but he had felt nothing at the time, and had even kind of detested this low-level animal instinct.Pei Tingsong was a paradox; he seemed very worldly, but in fact, he didn\u2019t count as being someone who had transcended beyond the boundaries of this world, or even someone who had been out and about in society for very long. He was like a dragon\u2019s\u00a0reverse scale\u00a0stuck at the border, a thorn, someone who didn\u2019t listen to advice and refused to obey. He looked like a rich second generation, but in fact, he was just a piece of white paper. A very stubborn piece of paper that couldn\u2019t be lit easily, but once a spark started burning, there would be no turning back.The water dripped down, and the bathroom was full of hot steam. As he washed, the image of Fang Juexia standing right here and taking a bath appeared in his mind. Pei Tingsong turned the water tap to cold and hastily finished up.Fang Juexia returned to his room and saw a message from Liang Ruo, along with four missed calls as well. He didn\u2019t know why Liang Ruo was being so persistent and was hesitating on whether to reply or not when a new message popped up on his WeChat.[Guide Dog: If you have a sore waist, you can pad it with a small pillow while you sleep.]Pei Tingsong lay on his bed and was flipping the pages of his book when his cellphone finally vibrated.[Just a pretty face but also pretty: I don\u2019t have a small pillow.]This Fang Juexia was really more terrible than any straight man of steel. Pei Tingsong put down his book and turned his head to look around. There were two pillows on his bed, one big and one small. The big one was for him to prop himself up against the bed, and the small one was from the bay window of his apartment. Now, he used it to sleep on.He picked up the pillow and got ready to go out, but then he thought that if he went out like this, He Ziyan would see. Pei Tingsong sat on the bed and thought about it, then stood by the window and turned his head to look at the balcony next door.Fang Juexia had just spread out his quilt when he heard a click. He suddenly turned around, for it seemed as if something had hit the balcony. Walking over to see what it was, he saw a black backpack, which had impartially hit the cactus, leaving it all crooked now.He straightened the cactus with a gardening hoe and said to himself slowly, \u201cWhat was so\u00a0urgent\u00a0ah?\u201d Only after finishing up with that task did he go to deal with the unknown black bag. As soon as he opened it, he found that it was a small white pillow. Fang Juexia walked to the left side of the balcony with the small pillow, and looking at the window next door, uttered thank you in a low voice. He hadn\u2019t expected a hand to extend out of the window and give two cool waves in reply.With a small pillow supporting his waist, Fang Juexia had a good night\u2019s sleep. However, the other person separated by a wall, kept tossing and turning all night, dreaming about Fang Juexia\u2019s appearance when dancing, his bright and clean back, and the way he used to walk and laugh with others the whole time.\u201cWow, Xiao Pei, why does your face look like you\u2019ve spent the whole night indulging in carnal desires? Could it be\u2026.wu!\u201d Before Ling Yi could finish speaking, Pei Tingsong, who was sitting beside him, covered his mouth. \u201cLaozi didn\u2019t sleep well, don\u2019t mess with me.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d He Ziyan had recently grown more and more in love with teasing him, \u201cXiao Pei didn\u2019t sleep well, and his own roommate didn\u2019t know. It was Gege who wasn\u2019t good, Gege recently hasn\u2019t taken care of you properly, it\u2019s all Gege\u2019s fault.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s eyelids drooped, and he was full of world weariness.Chen Zhengyun came into the meeting with people from the planning department. \u201cMorning, it\u2019s been tiring recently\u00a0ba?\u201d\u201cTired to death~\u201d\u201cIt will be a bit tiring in the earlier stages, and it will become a lot easier after recording finishes.\u201d Chen Zhengyun motioned to the planning director, then gave a brief account of his recent work to the six members of Kaleido . \u201cOur expected comeback launch date is April 5, so we still have more than two weeks to go. Yesterday, we confirmed the shooting site of the MV and just signed the contract. In a moment, Director Zhang will tell you about the conceptual design of the MV, and the stylist group will arrive in half an hour.\u201d\u201cThe focus of this work is still on practicing the main song. We will start shooting the MV next Monday, so for the next few days, everyone should rest well and strive to be in their best condition for the shoot.\u201d With that, he also gave Ling Yi a special look. \u201cRecently, everyone\u2019s weight control has been very effective. I\u2019ve seen all the numbers, and it\u2019s good.\u201dLing Yi shook his head with pride.Cheng Qiang checked the schedule. \u201cAt present, it\u2019s arranged like this\u2014The first notice will be released early morning on the 26th, and then each member will release a notice day by day. On the 2nd, the whole MV will be released, and then an entirely exclusive sales channel will be opened on the music platform. The 4th will be a mini fan meeting for your new album, and on that same day will be your first live performance of your main song. At the same time, the scene of your singing will be recorded, which the singing program will broadcast on the 5th.\u201dThis arrangement already counted as being very humane, not too packed nor too slow, and giving them enough time to practice.Pei Tingsong asked, \u201cIf all the songs and the MV are made public at the same time, will it reduce traffic on both sites?\u201dChen Zhengyun replied, \u201cWe are still discussing this point. Maybe, we will release the main song first at the end of March. We have to see when\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his words, the door of the conference room was suddenly opened, and a staff member burst in with a look of panic and called out, \u201cPresident Chen!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You\u2019re so flustered.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s bad, Ka-Kaleido\u2019s album\u2019s demo was leaked, and now, it has spread all over the Internet!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 57Chapter 57 \u2013 A Massive Rock Falls DownTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksIt\u2019s my duty to tell youIn a split second, the meeting room fell into an uproar.Fang Juexia frowned, took out his cellphone, logged into Weibo, searched for [Kaleido new album], and found that everyone was really discussing the leaked song in real time. He felt his scalp go numb and just couldn\u2019t bring himself to believe that such a thing had happened.Chen Zhengyun\u2019s brow was locked in a frown. \u201cWhen did you discover this? On which platform, and have you contacted that platform yet?\u201dThe staff member placed the laptop in front of Chen Zhengyun. \u201cWe just checked it, but we are unable to trace it back to its original source now. However, what we do know for sure is that at 9:47 a.m., a big marketing account released the song in the form of a video. Just now we found the company this marketing account belongs to, and then we paid to talk with them. Now, that video has already been deleted, but many people have already downloaded it through that account, and now it\u2019s continuously spreading. In addition, the other party is claiming that he wasn\u2019t the one who started it, and that he had just forwarded this video.\u201dHe Ziyan had also found the video. \u201cB station also already has it, and its popularity is still very high. It might even make it onto the homepage.\u201dFang Juexia listened to the video for a bit. This was the second version of the early demo; the lyrics were still in English, and it was the previous composer\u2019s version.Cheng Qiang felt this very strange. \u201cWe have been strictly confidential from the beginning to the end, and the composers we cooperated with are also recognized as people with very high professional ethics within the industry. How could our song get leaked?\u201dFang Juexia said, \u201cThe leaked song is the demo from before, not the final studio version. Fortunately, this means we can exclude the recording technicians, composer, and the recording management department from any suspicion, and our list of suspects can be narrowed down to the staff members who were selected to modify the demo in the early stages.\u201dJiang Miao also nodded, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s right. If we think about it calmly, we just finished recording the last song yesterday. If the person who leaked the song had enough power, they should have been able to directly leak the full version of our main song, which would have had a greater impact on us.\u201dLing Yi was a little worried. \u201cWhat should we do now? Although this demo isn\u2019t the finished song, it getting released ahead of time completely disrupts our plan, and the number of people who will buy the album and listen to the whole official song will also decrease.\u201dChen Zhengyun thought about it and then instructed Cheng Qiang, \u201cContact each platform hosting this video, and tell them they have to remove this copyright-infringement demo off of their shelves as soon as possible. Next, two announcements must be made, along with sending out a lawyer\u2019s notice. One will be posted in Kaleido\u2019s official Weibo, and the other will be posted on Star Chart\u2019s company Weibo, both emphasizing the illegal status of the leaked song. Inform the big fanclubs and stations, and call on the fans to report and boycott the leaked song, and to not be a second disseminator.\u201dThis was already the fastest reaction they could execute. Yet, because of how rapidly the Internet was changing nowadays, it was hard for one to even imagine how fast information spread. Let alone the fact that the release of this leaked song had obviously been well thought out and prepared beforehand. More than a dozen marketing accounts had released the demo at the same time, all listed with tags that Kaleido still had trending on the Hot Search list. Upon deleting one, another one popped up, and there was an unending stream of the video on all the major platforms.Chen Zhengyun pinched his own\u00a0Jingming acupoint, lowered his head, and said in a deep voice, \u201cIt\u2019s because they saw you were going to become explosively popular, so they deliberately tried to prevent this explosion before the comeback even happened and strike a blow against everyone\u2019s music chart numbers.\u201dPei Tingsong spun the pen in his hand, and he seemed to be especially carefree in this crowd of despondent faces. \u201cIf they want to leak, then leak it\u00a0bei.\u00a0If they set their mind on doing this, we can\u2019t hide from it. Maybe it will get on the Hot Search list later, and frankly, no matter how fast we move, we can\u2019t kill all the cockroaches.\u201dCheng Qiang motioned for him to shut up. \u201cXiao Pei, don\u2019t be sarcastic right now\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat he meant was that we might as well\u00a0flip the tables.\u201d Fang Juexia looked at Chen Zhengyun and suggested, \u201cXiao Pei is right. Since the other party\u2019s hands have already stretched all the way into our company to steal a song, they are\u00a0determined\u00a0to let this demo spread. They will definitely buy a spot on the Hot Search list to build momentum. We might as well\u00a0take advantage of this\u00a0and inflame it a bit to let more people know that we are going to release songs soon.\u201dHe Ziyan shook his head. \u201cBut it\u2019s too risky to proceed like this. If you follow the normal process, it\u2019s better to not exceed five days from the day of the song release to release the MV, so as to continue the popularity. In this case, when we do release the notice of our comeback and the MV at the beginning of April, we will have, by then, passed the peak of our freshness and popularity, and no passers-by will go to see it.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s face was calm, but his next words were astonishing, \u201cSo we must make our comeback ahead of time.\u201dChen Zhengyun looked at Fang Juexia in silence. This child had already announced to everyone what he wanted to say, but couldn\u2019t bear to utter. In this Internet era, the success of a song was not only due to its excellent quality, but also due to its careful publicity, especially so for idol music, which only possessed a small potential of gathering an audience of passers-by. Thus, the first day the publicity started was regarded as the beginning of a song\u2019s life. And a leaked song meant that the life cycle of this song was rapidly shortened, even leading to its premature death.A lot of leaked songs were abandoned in the end.However, they couldn\u2019t just casually give up. This song was these children\u2019s\u00a0heart\u2019s blood, and their best chance at changing their fortunes. The only option left to them was to change the schedule and the publicity period in order to try and save the album from ending up with a reduced life cycle as much as possible.This also meant that the originally abundant half a month of prep time would now be compressed to only three or four days. Kaleido would have to hurry and shoot the MV regardless of whether it was day or night, and the whole company would have to work desperately together to ensure that the comeback took place before the popularity died off.\u201cInform the people in the public relations department to urgently deal with the audio source of the leaked song, and that its transmission must be minimized. People in the stylist group don\u2019t have to come to the meeting, decide all the clothing styles before 5 p.m., and we\u2019ll start shooting the MV at 8 p.m.\u201dChen Zhengyun\u2019s eyes swept over the boys present at the meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s 10:35 a.m now., and you\u2019ll have to be in the styling room at 4:00 p.m., so the hours in-between are the last hours you\u2019ll have to rest. I hope everyone will have a good sleep, because a tough battle is what\u2019s waiting for all of you ahead. Although we are not a powerful company, no matter what happens, Star Chart will always be your backer.\u201dWhen they came out of the meeting room, everyone\u2019s mood was a bit unstable. Even Cheng Qiang wanted to start cursing, but in order not to affect them, he only picked out good things to say, comforting them that it was free publicity and so on when they were in the car. He sent the six people back to the dormitory and rushed back to the company to deal with the urgent affairs.Fang Juexia had kept silent since he had gotten into the car. He turned on his cellphone and stared at the previous day\u2019s missed call.Of course, the people who leaked the song knew that Kaleido\u2019s only way to save themselves was to push their comeback to an earlier date. However, once they made their comeback early, they would inevitably run into Seven Luminaries. There was no doubt that, at least for the moment, the number of their fans couldn\u2019t be compared at all. If you hit a stone with an egg, the beneficiary could only be the stone.Astar might have even prepared the press release by now.Combined with Liang Ruo\u2019s abnormality in recent days, Fang Juexia became even more convinced that his judgment was correct. As soon as Cheng Qiang left, he went to the balcony and dialed Liang Ruo\u2019s number.The other party seemed to have guessed that he would call, for his tone carried a little regret in his greeting. \u201cJuexia, you are finally willing to contact me.\u201d\u201cMake the long story short, tell me who did it.\u201dThe other side laughed as he asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you regret it? If you had come to me earlier, things may have played out differently.\u201dThis sentence violently stabbed into Fang Juexia\u2019s sore spot. As a lump formed in his throat, he heard Liang Ruo give an address.\u201cI have evidence that can help you ferret out that person responsible for this in my hand. Although your company isn\u2019t big, it\u2019s been badly battered right now, and the possibility of you guys figuring out the leaker\u2019s identity is too small. If you still want to find that bad egg, come find me. By the way, don\u2019t bring your cellphone. I don\u2019t want to hurt myself while helping you.\u201dPei Tingsong completely couldn\u2019t sleep after everything that had happened. He recalled all of what he had seen and heard in the company these past few days, trying to figure out if there had been any suspicious people or things.But somehow, he suddenly recalled the message from Liang Ruo that he had seen in Fang Juexia\u2019s cellphone.When he went to Fang Juexia\u2019s room, he only saw Ling Yi there, who was getting ready to rest. \u201cWhere\u2019s Juexia?\u201d\u201cHe just went out and said he\u2019s going downstairs to buy something.\u201d\u201cWhen did he leave?\u201dLing Yi thought for a bit. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while\u00a0ba.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s heart sank, and he asked, \u201cDo you have Liang Ruo\u2019s contact information?\u201d\u201cLiang Ruo?\u201d Ling Yi frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about 7L\u2019s Liang Ruo?\u201d\u201cWho else?\u201dLing Yi sat up and said, \u201cI don\u2019t have it, but I can ask some friends. What do you want it for\u2026\u201d Before he could finish talking, Pei Tingsong left, tossing behind the sentence, \u201cSend it to me when you find it.\u201dPei Tingsong went downstairs, and sure enough, saw that Fang Juexia\u2019s car had disappeared. He got into his own car, and he had just started it up when he received the number from social butterfly Ling Yi. He put on his earphones and was about to dial it when he paused, and finally changed to calling Fang Juexia\u2019s number.No one answered the phone the entire time. Pei Tingsong called again after he drove out, and the one who answered the phone was actually Ling Yi. \u201cHe didn\u2019t take his cellphone with him when he went downstairs.\u201dPei Tingsong totally didn\u2019t believe the excuse that he had gone downstairs to buy things. He parked his car on the side of the road. He originally wanted to call his older sister, but after thinking about it, he gave up and dialed Liang Ruo. He called three times before someone finally answered.Liang Ruo was in the hotel suite he had booked for the past two days, waiting for Fang Juexia. A strange number kept calling him, and he finally answered, \u201cHello? Who is it?\u201d\u201cPei Tingsong.\u201d The other party went straight to the point, and his tone wasn\u2019t good. Liang Ruo was surprised for a moment, thought about it and then felt it was no surprise, asking, \u201cYou\u2019re looking for me?\u201d\u201cWho the hell is looking for you, where\u2019s Fang Juexia? Did you call him away?\u201dLiang Ruo laughed. \u201cYou got to the bottom of the matter so quickly, he wasn\u2019t such a person before\u00a0ah.\u201dPei Tingsong hated hearing Liang Ruo talk about the past the most; he had never been part of Fang Juexia\u2019s past.\u201cBe more well-behaved and tell me where you guys are. Don\u2019t force me to find someone to search for you.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019m afraid of you, who made you a young master? You can force me to death just by moving your fingers around a bit.\u201d Liang Ruo generously gave him the address. \u201cI also have to thank you for coming to me instead of directly using your great capital background to kill me, this ant.\u201dJust then, there was a knock on the door. Liang Ruo\u2019s voice carried a smile as he said, \u201cAiya, Juexia is here.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dLiang Ruo didn\u2019t end the call, but put his cellphone into the pocket of his bathrobe as he went to open the door.Sure enough, it was Fang Juexia who stood outside the door. His face was cold, and it seemed that he did not even want to step inside the room. \u201cGive me the things, and I won\u2019t tell anyone it was you.\u201d\u201cYou come inside.\u201d Liang Ruo pulled at him, and Fang Juexia lifted his hand to push him away before entering by himself.\u201cI know you won\u2019t tell anyone it was me, and I know you don\u2019t have a cellphone with you right now.\u201d Liang Ruo closed the door. \u201cI understand you so well.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t want to hear all this from him, and his patience was already running out. \u201cDon\u2019t waste your time on useless matters.\u201d\u201cWhat useless matters?\u201d Liang Ruo sat on the sofa and said, \u201cJuexia, it\u2019s not only your time that is precious. My time is very precious, too. Do you know how many paparazzi have their eyes pinned on me? In order to have a good talk with you, I booked this room many days in advance and kept trying to get in contact with you, but you didn\u2019t even bother replying with a word. \u201cFang Juexia looked away from him and stood in the same place without saying a word.Liang Ruo also stood up. \u201cI\u2019m not asking for much. Just stand here and listen to what I want to say, and I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d\u201cSpeak.\u201dLiang Ruo seemed to have drunk a bit of alcohol, for his whole face was red. He took a deep breath. \u201cI like you. Since a long time ago, when we were still trainees, I have liked you.\u201d Upon seeing Fang Juexia frown at this, Liang Ruo laughed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know\u00a0ba. There are too many things you don\u2019t know. Back then, how badly I wanted to debut with you\u00a0ah, every single day, I dreamed of standing on the stage with you. Yes, I wasn\u2019t qualified; forget about being compared with you, I couldn\u2019t even compare against many other trainees. Even if you comforted me and encouraged me, I knew I couldn\u2019t debut.\u201d\u201cI was so anxious that I could hardly stand it. Then guess what?\u201d He shrugged as he spoke, \u201cPresident Jin said that he could help me and wanted me to come find him. I didn\u2019t know what he meant by help at that time, I wholeheartedly just wanted to debut with you, so I went.\u201dThen Liang Ruo began to laugh bitterly. \u201cOnly when I woke up lying on his bed did I know how he helped me.\u201dFang Juexia was a bit startled. Back then, he hadn\u2019t asked Liang Ruo much about how those things had happened.\u201cI was very scared. But President Jin told me that I would definitely be able to make my debut. So, for this opportunity, I sold myself. But I don\u2019t know why other people knew about it, and you also knew about it.\u201d Liang Ruo suddenly shed some tears, and he hastily wiped them away. \u201cAs soon as I knew you knew, I felt like I was finished. I didn\u2019t dare to face you, and even more so, I didn\u2019t expect that you would go up to the senior management and make a report because of me, and stand up for me.\u201dAt that time, the president of Astar was not surnamed Jin. Fang Juexia just couldn\u2019t stand the higher-ups treating trainees this way. Almost everyone thought that this matter had nothing to do with them personally, and felt that as long as the fire didn\u2019t burn themselves, they could bear with it. But Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t. He knew that the harder he pushed on this issue, the easier he would be to break, but he couldn\u2019t give up his \u2018self\u2019 for this so-called future.\u201cI know when you went to make the report. I went to President Jin, and I kept pleading with him. You don\u2019t know what he did to me, but I endured all of it, because he told me that as long as I was obedient, he would let you debut smoothly, just that they wouldn\u2019t promote you that much anymore.\u201d Liang Ruo\u2019s eyes grew more and more red as he continued, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t expect you to leave by yourself.\u201dHe laughed, his voice shaking a bit. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to find you so many times after that, just because I wanted to explain it all to you. But you, you didn\u2019t seem to care at all.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgFang Juexia was a person who could quickly and completely remove himself from any relationship or emotion; this was a skill he had learned from spending his childhood in the dark. But in other people\u2019s eyes, he appeared to be too cold when he was like this.\u201cIt was only later that I found out that when you weren\u2019t around, there was no point in me debuting\u00a0ah. Everyone already knew that I had sold my body to get to the top. Even if they had all signed a confidentiality agreement, when we came away from the cameras, all of them sneered at me and made innuendos about me, and I didn\u2019t even have a way to keep on living in the dormitory. Since everyone thought I advanced this way, I just became a demon, and decided that no one else should try to feel good either.\u201dLiang Ruo let out a breath. \u201cI said a bit too much right now. Just a few days ago, President Jin was drunk, and only then did I find out he wanted to prevent you guys from becoming popular. I knew that if I told you guys about this matter in advance, I might be finished. I hesitated for several days, and still decided that I wanted to tell you.\u201dHe took out a USB flash drive from his pocket. \u201cThere are some recordings here; I took advantage of when he was sleeping to record his WeChat voice messages. Originally, there should have been screenshots as well, but if I sent those to you, I might really end up dying. There are some people mentioned in the voice messages, and you should be able to figure them out.\u201dFang Juexia held the USB that was given to him, and his mood turned complicated. He didn\u2019t know what to say. He had pretty much nearly forgotten all those minor details of what had happened that year, but he had never regretted leaving the company. After he had stood up on this issue, no one had helped him, and although Liang Ruo seemed to have silently accepted the hidden rules situation, all the dirty water had been poured on Fang Juexia instead. Fang Juexia had also gritted his teeth and endured, not even trying to explain it clearly, because he knew that once he explained it, Liang Ruo would be torn to pieces.This was already hitting the bottom line of his tolerance about that situation.\u201cAlright.\u201d Liang Ruo laughed and stated, \u201cI finally told you all these things. I\u2019ve been afraid to say it out loud for two years, and I also didn\u2019t know how to say it to you. Don\u2019t worry, me confessing to you was because it had grown too uncomfortable for me to hold it all in, but I don\u2019t need any response from you. You are too good, and I don\u2019t deserve you.\u201dHe stepped closer. \u201cI\u2019m not a good person, but I\u2019m not as bad as everyone thinks I am. Juexia, thank you.\u201dFang Juexia finally opened his mouth. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u201cYou have. You have helped me a lot, and you are the best and the kindest person in the world. In the future, there shouldn\u2019t be any more opportunities where our paths cross in the future.\u201d Liang Ruo stretched out his hand. \u201cCan you hold me one last time? Just like before.\u201dLooking at Liang Ruo\u2019s red eyes, Fang Juexia found that he couldn\u2019t harden his heart in the end. He reached out and hugged him for a short while.\u201cThank you.\u201dA satisfied smile appeared on Liang Ruo\u2019s face. He took a look at the time, went to the door, and opened it. Fang Juexia thought this action was strange, but when he looked in that direction, he discovered that Pei Tingsong was standing outside the door, wearing a hat and mask, his eyes indifferent.He was a little surprised. \u201cPei Tingsong\u2026\u201d\u201cI told him the address.\u201d Liang Ruo looked at Pei Tingsong, took out his cellphone from his bathrobe pocket and ended the call. \u201cIt\u2019s over. I\u2019m giving you your one-sixth back.\u201dOnly then did Fang Juexia realize that Pei Tingsong had heard the entire conversation between the two of them. His heart suddenly seized, and even though he clearly knew that he hadn\u2019t done anything, he still felt flustered.Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t lose his temper; on the contrary, he appeared to be very calm. He went to Fang Juexia, grabbed his wrist, and pulled him out of the room and the hotel. He didn\u2019t speak the entire way to the car, which only served to make Fang Juexia feel even more uncomfortable.When they got to the underground parking lot, Fang Juexia tried to get out of his grasp. \u201cMy car is over there.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re taking my car back, let Xiao Wen drive your car back later.\u201d Then he opened the front passenger\u2019s door and directed Fang Juexia to get in. After that, he walked around and got into the car himself, wearing a cold expression as he said, \u201cFasten your seat belt.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Fang Juexia didn\u2019t move and\u00a0 just turned his head to look at him.Pei Tingsong saw that he wasn\u2019t moving, so he leaned over to help him fasten his seatbelt, after which he prepared to start the car. However, Fang Juexia pulled the key out. \u201cYou\u2019re in an upset mood right now, and it\u2019s not safe to drive like that.\u201d He didn\u2019t understand what had actually happened to Pei Tingsong and what part of everything Liang Ruo had just said in the call right now had provoked him. \u201cWhy are you angry?\u201dPei Tingsong leaned back against the driver\u2019s seat. He was extremely irritated on the inside, and so he pulled off his mask as he stated, \u201cI\u2019m not angry.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re angry.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s tone was definite on this. However, he just couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on. \u201cIf you\u2019re dissatisfied with anything, just say it, it\u2019s okay even if you want to mock me or curse me out like you used to.\u201dPei Tingsong let out a bitter laugh and then looked at him. \u201cFang Juexia, do you really think I\u2019ll become my past self again?\u201dFang Juexia was stunned. On seeing Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes, his heart ached inexplicably.Pei Tingsong looked down, then looked up at him again. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling right, right now. Even I don\u2019t know what\u2019s fucking wrong with me. I\u2019m just especially angry, especially\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t go on. After a pause, he let out a breath. \u201cYou came to find him alone, not even bringing your cellphone with you; did you just not worry that something would happen to you? You trust him that much?\u201dFang Juexia was dumbstruck, and he tried to explain, \u201cNo, I was\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me in advance? Do you know how hard it was for me to find this place? Do you know that the entire way here, I was so afraid that something would happen to you, I was almost about to ask my Jie for a favor, and my hands kept shaking the whole time I was driving. Why, why didn\u2019t you\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s smile looked rather bleak. \u201cAm I so unworthy of your trust?\u201dThis sentence somehow pierced straight through Fang Juexia\u2019s heart. He felt very bad; plainly speaking, he was a person who didn\u2019t like to explain things, but now, because of Pei Tingsong\u2019s tumultuous emotions, he desperately searched his mind to come up with the appropriate words to explain the situation. \u201cNo, Pei Tingsong, listen to me, I had just come out of the meeting, and I was very tense. The moment I confirmed that this matter had something to do with Astar, my first reaction was to go deal with it, and you know, I just have that kind of personality, I\u2019m\u2026\u201dHe found that every word he uttered sounded so lifeless, so he couldn\u2019t keep going on. He just didn\u2019t want to make Pei Tingsong sad. As he kept talking, Fang Juexia\u2019s own voice began to shake. \u201cCan you\u2026.not think that way?\u201dHearing him like this, Pei Tingsong suddenly couldn\u2019t get angry anymore. He buried his head into his arms and lay on top of the steering wheel, feeling like a shameless madman. He had just heard a confession that had nothing to do with him, and without any warning, he had an emotional breakdown. He just didn\u2019t expect to hear that Liang Ruo really liked Fang Juexia, and it was even that kind of like.How could he like Fang Juexia?Why could the likes of Liang Ruo even like him?With these thoughts in his mind, he just silently kept listening to every word of the other party\u2019s sincere confession, listened to their past, and the hug at the end, not able to do anything about it all\u2014he was just like a bystander who had nothing to do with this matter. He had, with great care, piled up so many beautiful memory fragments related to Fang Juexia, continuously gathering more and more, making it seem as if they could keep on like this, holding their \u201cfriendship\u201d up high and never falling down.But when he heard Liang Ruo\u2019s words, he suddenly realized that he was the stupidest fool in the world. He had directed and acted out this so-called pure friendship, endured the small torture brought by Fang Juexia\u2019s proximity, and he hadn\u2019t even known what he really wanted.The beautiful fragments that he had saved up in his heart had also, one by one, left a wound there. For so many days, his attitude blowing hot and cold, his mood that kept getting tugged around, his heartbeat being affected by every one of Fang Juexia\u2019s words and deeds, his torment caused by trying to control his desires, his insomnia, his shame and resentment, his anxiety\u2014 all of these had deepened and grown overstocked, and it was only now that he finally discovered the source.Seeing him remain silent this entire time, Fang Juexia\u2019s heart was left hanging in the air. He wondered if Pei Tingsong had misunderstood his relationship with Liang Ruo. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to hear that when I came over here. As I have already said before, I haven\u2019t cared about these past matters for a long time now. Even if I heard some details I didn\u2019t know about the past today, they won\u2019t change anything.\u201dAt this point, Fang Juexia felt that he had really gone crazy. He hadn\u2019t even wanted to explain to anyone that the rumors about him and hidden rules were unfounded, but here, he actually spoke so much nonsense and did so many illogical things with Pei Tingsong. All of a sudden, he felt that he didn\u2019t want to struggle any longer. He just wanted to get out of the car and get some air, so he lowered his head and undid his seat belt.With a click, the strap was released. However, at this very moment, his hand was grabbed by Pei Tingsong.\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d Pei Tingsong covered his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. There\u2019s no need to explain all this to me. It\u2019s me who was wrong, I just went off on you.\u201dThis was already the second time that he had heard Pei Tingsong formally apologize to him. It seems that this child, who was born rebellious, was always apologizing to him.\u201cYou didn\u2019t go off on me.\u201d Fang Juexia corrected his words and held his hand instead. \u201cYou\u2019re just sulking.\u201d\u201cI exploded at you in my heart, it\u2019s just that you don\u2019t know about it.\u201d Pei Tingsong said in a muffled voice, \u201cSo, I still have to say, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dWith that, Pei Tingsong raised his head and looked at him, then continued, \u201cThere\u2019s something else too. If I say it now, you may think I\u2019m crazy or have experienced too much excitement recently. That\u2019s alright, because I also just understood it in the past three minutes. I don\u2019t want to hide and tuck myself in and pretend that I can\u2019t see things clearly even now.\u201dThis all was too absurd. Waking up to a realisation at any other time would have been fine, but he just had to choose this moment. Their group was suffering from the biggest attack so far, a tough battle was imminent, everyone was firmly stretched tight, and this was a moment where even a straw landing on a heap could cause a collapse.Pei Tingsong had moved the rock that had been lying across his heart.Looking at Fang Juexia\u2019s penetrating eyes, Pei Tingsong let out a \u201cfuck\u201d, rubbed his face, looked up at him again, and said, \u201cFang Juexia, every word I\u2019m going to say after this is serious. You have to believe that I\u2019m not joking or pranking you,\u00a0okay?\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t know what he was going to say, but he still nodded.Pei Tingsong sincerely confessed, \u201cI, Pei Tingsong, chose a point on the number axis today. It wasn\u2019t chosen arbitrarily, it was a very serious decision. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s rational or irrational, and to be honest, I don\u2019t care. But it\u2019s my duty to tell you.\u201dHe raised the hand that Fang Juexia was holding. \u201cThis is that chosen point.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His strong and stable logic system was defeated at this moment and lost all its operational power.His eyes shifted from their clasped hands to Pei Tingsong\u2019s face. Choosing a point\u2014he couldn\u2019t understand the meaning of this more clearly. There was no other person in the world who could comprehend the meaning of this phrase better than him, because this was originally what he had said to Pei Tingsong, describing his closed and negative view of love, and how he did not believe that people could really find true love.But just now, Pei Tingsong had reconstructed his own words.Too straightforward, even more straightforward than the three words, \u2018I love you.\u2019Fang Juexia opened his mouth, but couldn\u2019t speak. He seemed to have lost his ability of speech.\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to give a response now,\u201d Pei Tingsong said seriously, \u201cand I know that whatever you say now would be a rejection towards me. In fact, you don\u2019t have to care too much about it. You can take what I said today to be some kind of self introduction.\u201d\u201cWhen I say \u2018I like you\u2019, it really is no different from when I say \u2018My name is Pei Tingsong, and I\u2019m 20 years old\u2019. There\u2019s no difference, it\u2019s all self-expression.\u201dToo many things had happened today that Fang Juexia hadn\u2019t expected. He hadn\u2019t expected Pei Tingsong to come and find him, he hadn\u2019t expected Pei Tingsong to be angry, and even more so, he hadn\u2019t expected Pei Tingsong to use his own rational number theory that refuted true love, as a way to express his feelings.Similarly, he hadn\u2019t expected that when the three words \u201cI like you\u201d fell onto his ears, his heart would jump and start beating really fast, as if it had gone crazy. Clearly, not that long ago, he had heard the same three words being uttered by another person, but at that time, he had still felt normal and even steady.Suddenly, Fang Juexia realized that he was still holding onto Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand, and so he hurriedly let go. \u201cBut, you said you weren\u2019t gay before.\u201dPei Tingsong actually wasn\u2019t abashed at all about what he had said before with such certainty. \u201cPeople\u2019s self-awareness also needs to undergo a process in order to develop, doesn\u2019t it? When I was sure I wasn\u2019t gay, I didn\u2019t like you yet. Now I can firmly refute the me of that time, because I have strong arguments against him now.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t know how to deal with this. As this person\u2019s undisguised gaze and confession just fell onto his eyes and ears, it felt as if magma was flowing through his whole body. His throat was hot, his chest was hot, and so were his ears.He had never met such a person in his 23 years of life. This person wasn\u2019t afraid of anything, and he could even criticize his past self logically and fairly.Fang Juexia looked up at him. \u201cThen why tell me now?\u201d But as soon as these words came out, he thought of how Pei Tingsong had told him to believe him before his confession, so he added, \u201cI\u2019m not questioning your attitude, and I also don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing this on a whim.\u201dHis hand being released was within Pei Tingsong\u2019s expectations, and being asked for the reason behind his words fit completely with Fang Juexia\u2019s style of doing things.Pei Tingsong replied without any reservations, \u201cCan you imagine? I\u2019m someone who hates lying the most, but I was deceiving myself every day, telling myself that my mood and actions were just out of friendship. In fact, from the very beginning, this friendship was false. I not only deceived myself, but also deceived you. It\u2019s unfair for you to have to accompany me in such an act, and I don\u2019t want to continue to get close to you by using our so-called friendship.\u201dThese words were like an alarm bell, striking against Fang Juexia\u2019s heart. All those emotions of his that tended to appear so frequently these days, contrary to his logic, seemed to resonate with this statement.\u201cWhat\u2019s more, in this next period of time to come, we will be facing very difficult matters and will be badly battered. I don\u2019t want you to feel that you are carrying anything; you should know that I am your comrade-in-arms and the most special one. I\u2019m the comrade-in-arms who likes you. I\u2019ll accompany you in charging forward and shattering the enemy lines, and I\u2019ll also protect you unconditionally.\u201dHe spread everything out, without any disguise or decoration, for Fang Juexia to see. Knowing that Fang Juexia believed in logic, he explained the logic behind all his actions and didn\u2019t let him overthink matters.\u201cAlso,\u201d Pei Tingsong continued to confess, \u201cthe reason why I just lost my temper was because I was jealous of Liang Ruo. I was afraid of losing you, and I was afraid that you would be moved by him. Although I know that you can\u2019t be moved by just two or three sentences, but as long as there was even the smallest possibility, I was afraid.\u201dHe laughed. \u201cAnd I know that if I didn\u2019t express my feelings for you, you wouldn\u2019t be able to understand why I was angry right now. You could only reflect on yourself about whether you had done something wrong. The scene just now was very touch and go, and even if we reconciled, you would continue to blame yourself. I can\u2019t endure you being like this, just like I couldn\u2019t bear to hear your explanation just now.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t bear to hear his explanation.Fang Juexia\u2019s nose stung a little. He didn\u2019t know how long it had been since he had felt like this.Pei Tingsong looked at him with clear eyes. \u201cLosing my temper was because of reasons of my own, and I had to tell you that.\u201dEvery word of his was a straight ball, without any beautiful ambiguous words, and no word games or any other implications in them. Fang Juexia knew that this was something only Pei Tingsong could do.It was just like in that \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019 escape room episode, where when Pei Tingsong had first found the medical record and immediately confirmed his role as the knight, he had, in the next few minutes, quickly formulated a plan, taking each step after that with determination and boldness.That was Pei Tingsong.But Fang Juexia was confused. He didn\u2019t know whether he should respond right now, or even what he should respond with. All these things had come on too quickly, and he seemed to have been thrust back into the role of cautious Black Knight now, where he was unable to see his heart clearly, while also being afraid of taking the wrong step. In just one day, he had received two confessions, and both even came from someone of the same sex\u2014it was more dramatic than a TV series.What puzzled him the most was why, when he had heard Liang Ruo\u2019s confession, he had felt nothing but slight surprise, but in the face of Pei Tingsong\u2019s confession, even thinking felt like it had become so very difficult.Fang Juexia repaired his broken down thought process with great difficulty and tried to say, \u201cI\u2026 I haven\u2019t yet\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong interrupted him, \u201cDon\u2019t say it. At least, not now.\u201d He lay on the steering wheel again, looking as if he had changed back to what a 20-year-old boy should look like. \u201cWhat I just did, maybe you think it\u2019s pretty\u00a0bold, but I\u2019m actually really afraid of being rejected by you. I know you must be confused right now, in fact, I am too. I\u2019ve never been like this before, this is the first time.\u201dHe turned his head and faced Fang Juexia. \u201cTeacher Fang, don\u2019t collect all the tests so fast, give me a chance.\u201dFrom under the brim of his hat, his eyes shone brightly. \u201cLet me pursue you a bit, okay?\u201dThis was the first time Pei Tingsong had called him that, and Fang Juexia\u2019s ears turned bright red, with his person following that in a stammer, \u201cP-pursue me?\u201d\u201cOtherwise? Who made me like you?\u201d Pei Tingsong was not shy at all, and the more he talked, the smoother he became. \u201cYou know what kind of a person I am. As long as I want something, it\u2019ll inevitably be mine.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019d better drive back by myself\u00a0ba\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia tried to open the door and get out of the car, but Pei Tingsong grabbed his arm and threw his own words back at him, \u201cYou\u2019re in an upset mood right now, so it\u2019s not safe for you to drive.\u201d He finished saying that, and even raised an eyebrow at Fang Juexia as he added, \u201cHow was that? I\u2019m a good student\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia was left tongue-tied, and even now, he once again came to the realization that he had no way to deal with Pei Tingsong.Taking the car key back from Fang Juexia, Pei Tingsong told him to fasten his seat belt, but Fang Juexia was still in a daze, frozen and not speaking.\u201cHey, do you want me to help you?\u201d Pei Tingsong tilted his head and looked at him.Fang Juexia immediately reacted and pulled the safety belt buckle.\u201cOkay, returning home.\u201dPei Tingsong didn\u2019t speak any more along the way. Fang Juexia could feel that he was deliberately leaving him with room to organize his thoughts. His small internal clock had broken down, so this journey back to their dorm seemed to go by so fast that they had already arrived before he had time to think through everything.The defense system he had worked on perfecting so hard for 23 years had been attacked just like that, and it was tethering on the point of collapse. Sure enough, Pei Tingsong was the biggest crisis of his life.His hand went into his pocket and bumped into the USB drive, and Fang Juexia\u2019s heart seized again. From the moment he had gotten hold of this evidence, his whole person had fallen into thoughts of self-blame. However, after being hit by Pei Tingsong\u2019s unexpected confession, he had almost forgotten about this matter.It was already half past one when they got back to the dormitory, and everything was really quiet inside; everyone should be resting in their own rooms. Fang Juexia supported himself on the cabinet by the entrance as he stood with his back to Pei Tingsong.\u201cYou\u2019re still worried about the matter with the leaked song,\u201d Pei Tingsong directly declared.Fang Juexia turned around and hung his head in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m a person who seldom thinks about what-ifs, and I don\u2019t regret any of the things that happened in the past. But today\u2026\u201d\u201cYou regret that you didn\u2019t respond to Liang Ruo a bit earlier.\u201dFang Juexia couldn\u2019t deny these words from Pei Tingsong. He looked at a very vague stain on the tip of his canvas shoe and didn\u2019t speak.\u201cDo you know? Liang Ruo wanted to help you, and even though I don\u2019t like him very much, I admire the courage he had shown this time. He didn\u2019t hang up my call and let me listen to the whole thing, which also shows that he had already resigned himself to the situation and didn\u2019t want us to have a misunderstanding. Liang Ruo\u2019s original intention in doing this and his execution of it were all good. However, Juexia, even if you had replied back to him three days ago and had gotten hold of this evidence, could we really have avoided this unexpected calamity?\u201dPei Tingsong continued, \u201cYou are so smart that I don\u2019t need to say these words. Even if we had gotten the evidence in advance, they already had the song. If they wanted to leak it, sooner or later, they would still do so. They could sacrifice the people who stole the music and throw them away, that person would just be like capital to be used. If Astar really wanted to compete maliciously, no matter how many days we knew about it in advance, we couldn\u2019t have stopped it.\u201dFang Juexia certainly knew that, but he was too used to carrying everything by himself. He was already used to tracing the root of his mistakes back to himself. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t know the despicable means of competition in the entertainment industry. Even if Astar didn\u2019t do anything, Kaleido had become a thorn in the eyes of many people. They could avoid some bad things for today, but it would be very hard to avoid everyone who was targeting them. Becoming popular itself was the original sin.Pei Tingsong threw the car key onto the cabinet by the entrance and said to him, \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself for an unstoppable\u00a0stab in the back, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201dHearing this, Fang Juexia\u2019s whole person relaxed, as if a heavy weight had been lifted from his mind. He still hung his head, but his body swayed back and forth. As he kept swaying, his head lowered to lean against the front of Pei Tingsong\u2019s shoulder, and he took in a deep breath.Seeing him like this, Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help raising his hand, pausing for a moment, then setting it down by his own side again. He coughed quietly and said in a low voice, \u201cHey, leaning against a man who has just confessed to you, aren\u2019t you too unguarded?\u201dFang Juexia immediately raised his head, leaned back against the entrance cabinet, and looked directly at him with that pair of beautiful eyes.Unexpectedly, Pei Tingsong smiled back at him, specially switched to a British accent and told him in an affected tone, and in English, \u201cObviously though, I am a gentleman.\u201dBeing teased by him like that caused Fang Juexia to accidentally let out a laugh.\u201cDon\u2019t be happy too soon.\u201d Pei Tingsong said, \u201cBecause you have more important things to do now, and I am very clear on the current situation, so I have chosen to be a gentleman. But don\u2019t forget what you said yourself, my bottom line lies in the third quadrant.\u201dFang Juexia, who was smiling, choked at this declaration. He quickly changed his shoes and headed for his room like a refugee. He only let out a breath when he closed the door.Ling Yi was wearing a frog eye-mask and sleeping sprawled across his bed with a little Minion in his arms. Fang Juexia went over to cover him with the quilt before sitting on his own bed.He tried his best to drive Pei Tingsong out of his mind, calmed down a bit, and then took out the recording to listen to it once. The voice really belonged to President Jin, and he did sound pretty drunk.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t doubt the authenticity of the recording. The reason why he was willing to go to Liang Ruo without his cellphone was that he understood him clearly and knew that he didn\u2019t have a bad nature. Liang Ruo didn\u2019t even check whether he really had his cellphone with him and pretty much didn\u2019t care if Pei Tingsong recorded the call before he revealed the entire story. He must have really wanted to make a break with the past.The recording mentioned the names of several people. Fang Juexia had a vague impression of them, but he wasn\u2019t very familiar with them; they weren\u2019t staff members he often came into contact with. He pondered over it, then called Chen Zhengyun. He was probably busy handling matters and only picked up the phone after a long time. Fang Juexia made a long story short and just said that he had gotten very reliable evidence, but he couldn\u2019t say who had given it to him. He could only report the names of the people involved in the incident to him.Back when Fang Juexia had left Astar and come to Star Chart, Chen Zhengyun had inquired about his whole situation in private and had talked with Fang Juexia about it. He knew the reason behind Fang Juexia falling out with his former company, and knew that there were many secrets involved in it. The entertainment industry was full of secrets, a fact which he understood clearly.\u201cUnderstood, I\u2019ll send someone to privately check these people. In fact, I guessed it was AS. They can\u2019t be held accountable for this kind of matter on the surface, and the company is also responsible for having been negligent.\u201d Chen Zhengyun comforted him by saying, \u201cMisfortune and fortune all depend on one another, so don\u2019t be too nervous. Have a good rest and leave the rest to the company.\u201dEnding the call, Fang Juexia put down the USB, placed it in the corner of a drawer, then lay on his bed, looking at the texture on the ceiling.For him, there was no difference between gay or straight love. Love was love, and was something that he didn\u2019t trust and found to be a contradiction.But even with that being so clear to him, he still couldn\u2019t make up his mind and decisively reject Pei Tingsong, while also warning him not to get close.He was too confused. Fang Juexia closed his eyes and recited multiplication tables in his heart.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgWhen he opened his eyes again, he found Ling Yi lying on his bed and snoring. Fang Juexia had been awakened by this little snore, and he rubbed his eyes vaguely before taking a look at the time. It was 3:30.\u201cYiyi.\u201d He pushed Ling Yi\u2019s shoulder and sat up. \u201cWhy are you on my bed?\u201dLing Yi suddenly woke up. \u201cJuexia get up.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already up.\u201d\u201cOh, yes, yes, yes.\u201d Ling Yi got up from his bed and let out a giant yawn. \u201cJust now, my alarm clock rang, and as soon as I opened my eyes, I came over to see you while half-asleep, because I wanted to wake you up. Yet, after calling out to you twice, I just fell asleep on your bed.\u201d Saying that, he got off the bed and stretched. \u201cI\u2019ll go and see the rest of them.\u201dFang Juexia folded his quilt before leaving his room. Seeing that everyone was already sitting at the table, he was surprised. \u201cMiao Ge, you didn\u2019t sleep? Why did you even cook food?\u201dJiang Miao, who was dividing up chopsticks, looked up at him. \u201cNo\u00a0ah, I didn\u2019t make this. When I woke up, it was on the table. I don\u2019t know who ordered this takeout.\u201d\u201cMe.\u201d Pei Tingsong came out of the bathroom. \u201cIt was just delivered, and it\u2019s still hot. All of us have just slept but we didn\u2019t eat any lunch\u00a0ba, so let\u2019s eat more and it\u2019ll be easier to work in the evening.\u201dLing Yi rushed up to give Pei Tingsong a bear hug. \u201cThank you President Pei for\u00a0feeding\u00a0us!\u201dOnly after Fang Juexia went over did he discover that Pei Tingsong had ordered a lot of Cantonese dim sum, as well as scallop shrimp porridge\u00a0and\u00a0steamed sliced fish porridge.\u201cEn! This\u00a0chicken feet\u00a0is delicious\u00a0ah.\u201dLu Yuan ate a mouthful of\u00a0tripe stew\u00a0and commented, \u201cStrange, strange, what Xiao Pei actually ordered today was dim sum, not pizza.\u201dHe Ziyan said with a smile, \u201cMaybe he received a call for Chinese food in his dreams.\u201dPei Tingsong retorted, \u201cI just wanted to eat dim sum, is that not okay\u00a0ah?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d Jiang Miao gave each of them a bowl of porridge with a smile. When he handed one to Fang Juexia, he asked, \u201cHow is it, is what Xiao Pei ordered authentic?\u201dFang Juexia nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s quite delicious, I haven\u2019t eaten these in a long time.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d senior foodie Ling Yi turned the logo of the restaurant on the box around as he observed, \u201cThis place is pretty expensive. I\u2019ve only dined in the restaurant before, I didn\u2019t know you could order takeout from here.\u201dEveryone chatted idly with each other as they ate. It seemed that after waking up, they had all tacitly agreed to filter out the leaked song incident in the morning from their conversations. No one talked about it or even mentioned it, all of them wholeheartedly only thinking about their upcoming shoot that night.After drinking a bowl of warm porridge, Fang Juexia felt much more comfortable from head to toe. No matter when he ate it, his hometown food had the wonderful effect of calming his mood. It seemed that what he had eaten wasn\u2019t food, but rather a sense of familiarity.To him, familiarity meant stability.Xiao Wen was quite punctual in picking them up. On the way, he comforted them by saying that the company had dealt with the situation in a timely manner. The scope of the leaked song wasn\u2019t as large as they had imagined, so they shouldn\u2019t worry too much about it. As soon as the six people got out of the car, they went straight to the studio, and their first set of make-up took several hours to finish. Their costume was an improved black military uniform, with similar styles but different details for each member. It would match with the first set they had, with red being the main color in that one.The ensemble show cameraman had also come to shoot and record the whole filming process. When he caught Pei Tingsong, who had already finished getting his make-up and hair ready, he asked him if he liked his make-up look and hairstyle this time. Pei Tingsong grabbed the camera lens and waved in reply, \u201cIt\u2019s very good.\u201d\u201cWhich part is your favorite?\u201d\u201cFavorite\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong walked to the big mirror, and the camera followed him. Unexpectedly, he suddenly sat next to Fang Juexia, who was getting his hair done. \u201cMy favorite is this part.\u201d Then he pointed at Fang Juexia\u2019s birthmark.\u201cWhat?\u201d Fang Juexia had just finished asking when he\u00a0 saw the camera through the mirror, and then he understood.The makeup artist had gone out and used a fine lip liner along the lines of that birthmark to draw out a more complex red pattern, which made it look like the spiraling tail feathers of a phoenix. Paired with a military cap, there was an abstinent aesthetic beauty to Fang Juexia.After finishing up the makeup and hair of the last member, they finally entered the filming location. Fortunately, the director they had invited was a good friend of Boss Chen Zhengyun, and was also a famous music video director in the industry. He had deigned to do a favor for an old friend and started work for this music video early, setting up an emergency shoot.This wasn\u2019t the first time they had shot an MV, but it was the first time they\u2019d filmed one with such a high intensity. From 8:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., after changing two studios, they finally moved to an outside location. Then, after filming from early morning to the afternoon, they only finished at sunset, which is when they went to the green screen shed to make up some shots. These six people worked non-stop for a full 25 hours, dancing that single dance they didn\u2019t know how many times, and at the end, found that they almost couldn\u2019t even lift their arms up.\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard.\u201d After finishing up the filming, they bowed to all the staff members one by one. They were so sleepy that they could hardly say anything else. The cameraman in the studio asked them how they felt, and all of them were confused. The group leader, Jiang Miao, strongly tried to keep his spirits up and said something, and then Lu Yuan made a joke, and it was only after that that the group\u2019s spirits started to rise up, and then everyone chimed in.\u201cWhat did Juexia think of how the shoot turned out?\u201dFang Juexia smiled at the camera. \u201cThe outside location is very beautiful, and in previous MVs, we had very few shots taken on outside locations. The Chinese style setting in the interior studio was also very cool. I hope everyone will like this MV.\u201d\u201cTired?\u201dHe nodded honestly and smiled again as he added, \u201cBut very happy.\u201dHowever, they didn\u2019t have much time to sleep; their comeback launch date had been moved up, which meant that the company needed to release all kinds of promotional photos and videos immediately. The six of them took turns getting half an hour\u2019s worth of sleep in the company car. When they got out of the car, they discovered that there were fans everywhere outside the company building. There were also some substitute photographers and media outlets mixed in with fans, and being afraid of exposing their hair color, each of them got out of the car with a coat over their head, wrapped up very tightly.\u201cJuexia Gege!!!\u201d\u201cXiao Pei! Pei Tingsong!\u201d\u201cLing Yi, look at Mama! Ling Yi, you\u2019re the hottest!\u201d\u201cHe Ziyan, good luck!\u201d\u201cLu Yuan! Jiang Miao!\u201d\u201cGood luck Kaleido! Dominoes will never accept defeat!\u201dBack at the company, they changed into a new style, shot three promotional videos for the app, and then waited for the portraits for the music album to be shot.The first photo studio for the portraits was a dark one. When everyone was getting their portrait taken here, a light would be cast specifically onto their right eye, and the surrounding background would be relatively dimmed. For normal people, this environment would be just a dim one, but for Fang Juexia, it was like someone had turned off all the lights. After the first portrait was done, and as soon as Ling Yi took over, Fang Juexia wanted to see how his picture had turned out. He wanted to head to the side of the monitor, but everything in his sight was very blurred. He slowed down and walked forward bit by bit.He could hear the photographer\u2019s voice getting closer and closer to him, and used that to judge which direction to go in.However, what he didn\u2019t know was that while he was getting closer to his destination, he was also nearing a stair step. As he took a careful step forward, his foot actually stepped on empty air.His body lost its balance instantly, and his center of gravity tilted forward. Fang Juexia\u2019s heart was violently startled, but unconsciously, he found himself falling into an embrace. The familiar smell of sea salt and musk wrapped around him, both unexpected and safe.\u201cThat was you taking the initiative.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s guide dog had changed. Instead of coming to his side immediately and helping him to where he wanted to go, he stood in front of an established trap instead, calmly waiting for him to walk through a flat area, holding his spot at that unknown stair step in front of him as he moved closer and closer to it.Thus throwing himself into his arms.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He\u2019s too tired. He hasn\u2019t slept for a long time, and now he doesn\u2019t even have the strength to go down the stairs.\u201d Saying that, he turned his head back and looked at Fang Juexia. \u201cRight?\u201dFang Juexia quickly distanced himself from Pei Tingsong a bit and then followed along with his ready-built excuse, opening his mouth to agree, \u201cEn, I\u2019m a little dizzy.\u201dPei Tingsong let out a light laugh, and Fang Juexia knew that he had done this on purpose; perhaps early on he had been standing and watching at the side just for this, just waiting for him to take the bait. When he thought about it, he felt that he had been duped, and found that he simply couldn\u2019t swallow this down. He then pretended he couldn\u2019t see anything and stepped on Pei Tingsong\u2019s foot.Seeing the smiling face suddenly change into one of surprise, Fang Juexia finally felt the amusement behind teasing others.\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake, I miscalculated.\u201dHearing Pei Tingsong\u2019s inexplicable words, Fang Juexia looked up and asked, \u201cWhat?\u201dPei Tingsong pointed at his feet, with the corners of his mouth quirking up as he tried hard to look serious. \u201cI should have worn\u00a0AJs today, you stepped on me in vain.\u201dThere were few boys who didn\u2019t know the meme of [Can I step on your AJs and kiss you], and Fang Juexia was no exception. His face turned red again, and he could only pretend that he didn\u2019t understand. \u201cCrazy.\u201d\u201cYo, even cursing people out now.\u201d Pei Tingsong laughed and teased, \u201cThis is you just blindly playing with me and tossing me away, you know.\u201dThe photo assistant, who kindly brought them two hot mochas, overheard a few of their words, and asked with a smile, \u201cWhat are you guys talking about?\u201dFang Juexia took the coffee awkwardly and explained, \u201cNothing, Pei Tingsong hopes that our sales can be a little greater this time.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Pei Tingsong added on quickly, \u201cI hope there will be less fans\u00a0playing around\u00a0with us and more fans truly in love with us in this world.\u201dThe assistant little Jiejie also nodded. \u201cI\u2019m a true fan, and keep waiting for your new album\u2019s purchase link every day.\u201dThe topic had gotten completely distorted. Fang Juexia lowered his head to drink the coffee and quietly quit this conversation where the people conversing were actually talking about two entirely different things.The toll continuous work took on the body was huge, but these six people were very professional and still maintained their expressiveness. Even the photographers who had been part of collaborations many times couldn\u2019t help praising them in front of Cheng Qiang, \u201cThey have really improved a lot and become more and more professional.\u201dCheng Qiang was overcome with emotion upon hearing this. \u201cIt\u2019s too difficult for these ones in my family. Now, I\u2019m not even asking for them to be wildly popular or successful, but I hope that things will go more smoothly for them in the future. \u201c\u201cThey will, there is no gold that does not shine.\u201dAfter the studio photoshoot finished, they were rushed to an outside location, so they slept for a bit in the car on the way, then got up and immediately went to get their hair and makeup done.The concept of this album was \u201cwar\u201d, and the company\u2019s original plan for the outside location shooting was to take everyone to\u00a0Xinjiang\u00a0for the shoot, but all their plans had been disrupted by the leaked song. Everything had been moved up, and there was no time to fly so far to get that particular view, so they could only find the nearest desert park.This batch of major publicity pictures were different from the modern military uniform style photos that had been taken in the dark indoor studio. The stylists had taken inspiration from the warrior swordsmen of the past to design costumes with an archaic style. Everyone\u2019s make-up and hair were fashioned to imitate an ancient style, and they were made to look like a team of swordsmen who had been ambushed and were forced to fight to survive.The wind was very strong at this outdoor shooting location. Fang Juexia had to borrow a white silk scarf from the stylist to cover his face, and then he ran to the monitor to watch Pei Tingsong\u2019s shoot.Pei Tingsong\u2019s style looked very evil. He was dressed from head to toe in a very ominous black, even his forehead was wrapped with a cloth that was two fingers wide, and on his right cheek was a battle wound drawn on by the stylist.He crouched on the yellow sand, a shining saber hoisted on his shoulder, and raised his chin, while holding a strand of straw at the corner of his mouth. His expression was restrained, but his \u2018always looking down upon others\u2019 eyes were, at present, full of emotion, ostentatiousness, along with radiating off a murderous aura.\u201cThis white hair gives off a good feeling.\u201d Ling Yi couldn\u2019t help sighing, \u201cXiao Pei can go act in something,\u00a0yi.\u201dFang Juexia felt the same way in his heart, but if Pei Tingsong was really asked to go and act in something, he would definitely feel that doing that would be akin to ignoring his own proper occupation. After all, if you told this guy to go East, he would definitely head West.Ling Yi chattered and chattered on, then turned his head to look at Fang Juexia, and his eyes were full of surprise as he exclaimed, \u201cJuexia, doing you up like that makes for a really good look! It goes so well with your white clothes.\u201dAfter completing Pei Tingsong\u2019s photography session, the group of photographers turned around to see where the chattering sounds were coming from, and when they saw Fang Juexia, their eyes lit up. \u201cThis veil is worn well. We\u2019ll have to take a few shots of it like that later too.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Fang Juexia looked awkwardly at the stylist and explained, \u201cThis is Cindy Jie\u2019s silk scarf, I\u2019m just using it to block out the sand.\u201d\u201cJuexia, don\u2019t worry about it!\u201d The stylist Cindy yelled from behind him. \u201cIt\u2019s a great honor for this silk scarf to appear on camera draped on a celestial!\u201d\u201cCelestial hahahahahaha, Cindy Jie is too funny.\u201dPei Tingsong finished his part and came over. \u201cThis evil wind is blowing so hard that the sand is flying into my throat.\u201d Saying that, he began to cough wildly.He Ziyan started up his mocking mode. \u201cA famed swordsman succumbs to tuberculosis.\u201d\u201cCough, cough, cough\u2026cough, cough!\u201d Pei Tingsong coughed while drawing closer to Fang Juexia, who thought that he was coming to lay his head on his shoulder, but didn\u2019t expect Pei Tingsong to just stand in front of him and cough non-stop.Fang Juexia wanted to say something, but he also thought it was a little funny. Pei Tingsong was behaving just like a child like this, a child pretending to be wronged and pitiful, standing right in front of an adult, begging for a hug. He was completely stunned; this guy really had no bottom line. He was very resourceful and flexible, and did not care about disgracing himself at all.\u201cJuexia, we\u2019re starting!\u201d\u201cOkay, heading over.\u201d Fang Juexia answered, and then got ready to leave. As soon as he took a step forward, he caught sight of Pei Tingsong\u2019s completely aggrieved face. He was too lazy to cough any more, and just kept looking at him.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t look back at him. His naturally cold face didn\u2019t fluctuate too much, though a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. \u201cComing.\u201dHe patted Pei Tingsong on the back twice quickly and lightly before he left.Pei Tingsong froze for a moment, then turned around and looked at Fang Juexia\u2019s figure walk away, with his white clothes fluttering, and suddenly felt like he had completely come back to life.Fang Juexia\u2019s individual photography session featured him on a horse. Although he had never ridden a horse before, this horse was surprisingly easy to ride. He couldn\u2019t even be described as gentle so much as having no temper at all. As long as he was fed some grass and his head was rubbed, he would become extremely obedient and would carry him motionlessly.\u201cJuexia, pull the bow string wider\u2026 a bit wider than that.\u201dThis was the first time he had used a real bow and arrow, so he felt that something wasn\u2019t quite right. \u201cLike this?\u201dPei Tingsong was squatting on the ground drinking soda water. However, upon seeing this scene through the monitor, he suddenly stood up, and put his soda water aside, while threatening Ling Yi not to drink it secretly. Then, clapping his hands, he went straight over to Fang Juexia, saying, \u201cMr. Jiang, wait a minute, I\u2019ll teach him.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t expect Pei Tingsong to also know archery. He thought that since he was already talking about teaching him, it must not be false, so he was ready to dismount the horse in order to let Pei Tingsong guide him. Unexpectedly, Pei Tingsong stopped him. \u201cDon\u2019t come down.\u201dWith that, he stepped on the stirrup, flipped over, and sat firmly behind Fang Juexia. Fang Juexia was a little surprised and looked back at him, asking, \u201cYou can ride?\u201d\u201cIn my middle school, I even won second place in the youth equestrian club, in my whole school.\u201d Pei Tingsong raised his eyebrows, encircled his arms around Fang Juexia from the back, then supported the hand that was on the bow. \u201cAnd I was also the champion in the archery club.\u201dUpon suddenly being hugged by him from behind, Fang Juexia\u2019s heart seemed to stop beating, his ears started buzzing, and all he could do was stare frozenly at the scene in front of him.\u201cPut this hand here and raise it a little bit more.\u201d Pei Tingsong drew an arrow from the quiver behind him and rubbed the arrow. \u201cThe props group is pretty good\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cWould you like to try shooting one?\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice was in a rare state of being very patient and gentle. He guided Fang Juexia\u2019s hands personally as he fully drew the bow, aimed all around for a bit before finally locking onto his target\u2014 a big stone not too far away that had a strange shape.His voice lingered in his ears as he instructed, \u201cI\u2019ll count three, two, one, and then you\u2019ll let go, okay?\u201dFang Juexia nodded. Pei Tingsong\u2019s low voice as it counted down overlapped with the heartbeats in his chest, creating a very powerful emotional pulse resonance.Just as his nerves were stretched taut, Fang Juexia released the string from his hand, and the arrow flew like the wind, accurately hitting the stone, and after the collision, fell to the ground.A staff member clapped and said, \u201cPowerful. Juexia is naturally talented at everything\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you praise me?\u201d The corners of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth carried a smile, and he put his chin on Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder. \u201cTeacher Fang, how did I teach?\u201d\u201cGet down quickly.\u201d Fang Juexia didn\u2019t dare to even look back. \u201cI have to get on with the photoshoot.\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m just a tool man,\u201d Pei Tingsong sighed. Since the order had been given, he couldn\u2019t not follow it. \u201cIt\u2019s really just like killing the donkey as soon as he leaves the millstone, or tearing down the bridge after crossing it, or casting the bow aside when all the birds are gone, or killing and stewing the hounds after the hares are\u00a0caught\u2026.\u201dFlipping over and dismounting, Pei Tingsong patted his clothes. Suddenly, a pale hand stretched out in front of his eyes. As soon as he looked up, he saw Fang Juexia, who was slightly bent over. His face was veiled, but his eyes were smiling.The thing he handed over to him was a fruit candy wrapped in cellophane. Pei Tingsong\u2019s expression brightened, and he threw the candy up in the air before catching it firmly. \u201cWhere did you hide all of that\u00a0ah?\u201dFang Juexia pointed to his belt. \u201cJust two, giving you one as a reward.\u201d\u201cOkay, let\u2019s start shooting the first batch!\u201dPei Tingsong left the center of the picture, went back to the rest canopy set up beside the monitor, and sat down next to his other group members. He held the candy in his hand, reluctant to open it. The sunlight slanted into the canopy, making the candy wrapper glitter.His mood at the moment was exuberant. When this word appeared in his mind, Pei Tingsong was once again impressed by the appropriateness and delicacy present in Chinese vocabulary.It was completely true that his chest was now stuffed full with a hundred little skylarks, dancing and fluttering about.\u201cXiao Pei, quickly look at what I just shot!\u201d Ling Yi ran over to share his photographic masterpiece with him. On the screen of his cellphone was the shot of when Pei Tingsong had encircled Fang Juexia with his arms while they were riding on a horse and pulling a bow. \u201cDidn\u2019t I take a super beautiful picture?!\u201dLu Yuan\u2019s head also drew closer. \u201cWow, if this was posted online, there would definitely be a lot of CP fans writing Wuxia\u00a0AU.\u201dPei Tingsong asked suspiciously, \u201cWhat\u2019s an AU?\u201d\u201cCome, let me give you a good talk as a senior fellow literary researcher.\u201d Lu Yuan took him by the shoulder. \u201cAU means that the setting I wrote is different from that of the original. For example, with you two\u00a0ah, you\u2019re actually idols, but if someone wrote a doujinshi about you two with a Wuxia background, featuring both of you as swordsmen, then that would be a Wuxia AU.\u201d\u201cOh, I understand\u2026\u201d Ling Yi had now learned just enough to perform. \u201cThen I want a rich AU!\u201dHe Ziyan, who was resting on one side, was so amused by him that he started laughing. \u201cGe will write you a beggars\u2019 group AU.\u201d\u201cHahahaha.\u201dFang Juexia sat on the horse and focused on his photoshoot, completely unaware of what his bandmates were discussing.The photographer stood on an elevated platform, and the camera lens captured the top to bottom view. Fang Juexia\u2019s upper body was leaning back, nearly lying on the horse\u2019s back. The white gauze was lifted by the wind, and his face appeared hazy. Only one eye directly faced the lens, and a wisp of long hair, that was lifted by the wind, fell right on the birthmark at the corner of his eye.\u201cThis one could even be a cover shot for a big magazine.\u201d The photographer was quite satisfied and took the camera over to his assistant. \u201cLook, this one must be put inside the album.\u201dThe several big boys waiting in the rest canopy were still horsing around, but Pei Tingsong\u2019s gaze never left Fang Juexia from the beginning to the end.He kept watching from a distance when after the shoot, Fang Juexia, who was lying on the horse\u2019s back, pulled at the reins, raised his waist, and returned to a sitting position. His flexible waist was just like a soft whip, striking at Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart in that moment.After the publicity photos were all taken, the group rushed back to the dormitory to sleep. However, they could only sleep for four hours at most, before they were scheduled to take part in the recording of a singing program. Due to the leaked song, Kaleido could only compress their time as much as possible and desperately work, while at the same time, the disturbance about the leaked song online hadn\u2019t even stopped for a day.After the lawyer\u2019s notice was sent out on the first day of the incident, Star Chart had announced Kaleido\u2019s early comeback date on their official platform, while also releasing the first wave of the advance publicity photos they had shot, which included six pictures with over-exposed close-ups of the six people\u2019s eyes. The caption was as simple as the date\u20143.23.The fans who had already been waiting for a long time excitedly left comments below the official Weibo post. Kaleido had not made a comeback for a year already, so as soon as this simple notice was released, the number of forwards for this post quickly flew past 100,000.[@siilu: AHHHHHHHHH MY LITTLE OBSCURE K HAS FINALLY STOPPED STAYING AT HOME AND PICKING AT THEIR TOENAILS!!!][@Is Kaleido making a comeback today: Making a comeback!!!!][@TingJue is real: Wuwuwuwu, these six eyes are so beautiful! Even with just the eyes, I can recognize them all clearly! I miss you guys so much!]This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org[@Heaven will not tolerate K not becoming popular: God, I nearly started crying when I saw this Weibo post.]However, there seemed to be a problem. Some fans had gone to Cheng Qiang\u2019s official Weibo and asked about the date of Kaleido\u2019s comeback before. At that time, Cheng Qiang\u2019s reply had stated early April. This screenshot soon spread and was seen by more and more fans, and their hearts ached sorely.[@Nearly cancelled K also has to be pasted well today: It\u2019s really difficult for my K. Clearly, they were supposed to back their comeback in early April, now they\u2019re forced to adjust it to March 23 because of the leaked song. I can\u2019t imagine how the Geges have been living these days, I\u2019m afraid they can\u2019t even sleep every day. They waited a whole year to release an album and ran into such a bad situation.][@Fairies just spit out fragrance: The dog that leaked the song deserves de*th][@A tiny Domino: My heart is aching for all the Geges, this time we must all give them the best numbers!]Kaleido\u2019s sudden rise to popularity had already attracted the attention of many groups; if it had just been a sudden rise in popularity, then that would have been fine, but there was also a hot shot CP in this group, with its number of fans increasing every day. This kind of popularity power really made people\u2019s eyes turn red with jealousy. The marketing accounts and anti-accounts from everywhere rained down upon them one after another, stirring things up, and everyone wanted to take advantage of the chaos to pull at their hind legs and make them stumble.The fastest and darkest part of the drama was the anonymous area. Kaleido, this group that had appeared from a small company and had since grown ascendant, had the least voices in the forums. Plainly speaking, this new release date of their album going ahead of schedule would inevitably make them run into Seven Luminaries, and Fang Juexia, a key figure of the group, also shared a subtle relationship with Seven Luminaries. Several long threads were all discussing the result of the collision between the two groups.[In this 7L vs. K big battle, who does everyone think is going to win? Confirm\u00a0ah.][Is the owner of this thread kidding me? 7L has only released their album for a week, and the sales volume of their digital albums has already exceeded one million. The number of listens for the main song reached the number two rank in the 30-day listens list already, and the number one song on that list is one that was released in early March, so according to this trend, it will be toppled soon. Not to mention the number of hits on their MV, why don\u2019t you go look at Bilibili? It only took three hours for it to reach the top of the music section. I won\u2019t talk about the company, so as not to have people accuse me of bullying others. Even K\u2019s song has been leaked, and don\u2019t tell me that it doesn\u2019t matter since the leaked song is a demo, it matters a whole lot. When the whole song comes out, it\u2019ll be good if it\u2019s able to get into the top ten listens within 30 days.][7L\u00a0ba, I was originally looking forward to a fight between K and 7L this time, but now, the song has been leaked. Besides, 7L\u2019s new album has been strategized really well this time, and they have achieved quite good numbers. Even though it\u2019s not very\u00a0special, but that doesn\u2019t affect the fact that it\u2019s just popular\u00a0ah.][Is this kind of thread interesting? I really can\u2019t understand why K is so desperate to get their comeback out now? Do they want to die early and reincarnate early? To tell you the truth, I haven\u2019t seen any precedent of a song that was leaked becoming popular afterwards, the big guys\u2019, whose songs leaked, all abandoned them directly. Maybe Star Chart can\u2019t afford new music\u00a0ba.][You\u2019ve all bought 7L, to the point that I really want to not buy it\u2026][These are the facts\u00a0ba, it\u2019s all been unfair from the beginning. The resources and publicity that big companies have are different, and they\u2019re also willing to spend more. At the beginning, K definitely wanted to avoid 7L, so they chose to make their comeback in early April. Now, they have no backups, so they have to make their comeback ahead of time, just like an egg striking against a rock. K is always so unlucky, every time they think they can ascend, they end up kicking an iron plate.][FJX is just fated to never become super popular\u00a0ba\u2026]Before the formal confrontation between these groups took place, the direction the wind was blowing online was almost all the same, with everyone declaring that Kaleido\u2019s album this time would, for sure, fail. However, Star Chart\u2019s public relations team was also guiding public opinion. Although Kaleido\u2019s popularity had already improved, it still wasn\u2019t as good as that of Seven Luminaries, so now that people had already tied them together, they simply took advantage and let them link the two groups together even further, in order to let more passers-by know that Kaleido was also going to release an album and fight against Seven Luminaries.Despite the constant struggle happening on various social platforms, the company didn\u2019t permit its members to look at them, so that they would devote themselves entirely to the new album.After a few hours\u2019 rest, they were called up to participate in the song performing program \u201cMusic Live House\u201d on the CloudTV platform early in the morning. This would be the first live performance of their new album, and it was very important.\u201cToo snobbish.\u201dAs he waited for the hairdresser to put in his hair extensions, Fang Juexia heard Cheng Qiang swearing, and was curious. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Qiang Ge?\u201dCheng Qiang put his cellphone in his pocket. \u201cBack when they knew we were going to release a new album and found us for a collaboration event, they took the initiative themselves to offer to shoot a comeback backstage video of you guys and put it on both CloudTV and their Weibo. Now they\u2019re great, telling us their staff has a scheduling problem, and that they can\u2019t shoot it, so there will only be that one live performance.\u201dSo it was like that.Fang Juexia had known for a long time that relationships in this circle ran hot and cold. At the beginning, everyone had thought that he would definitely make his debut with Seven Luminaries, and that he would be officially promoted by the company, so everyone came to him and flattered him, as if everyone were his friends. But as soon as he left Astar, these \u201cfriends\u201d disappeared overnight and became deathly silent characters resting in his contact list.He said comfortingly, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, didn\u2019t we bring our ensemble show cameraman anyway? It\u2019s all the same no matter who films it.\u201d\u201cYes\u00a0ah, Qiang Ge.\u201d Ling Yi also added, \u201cLook at me. I\u2019ll raise my voice and sing you a song for free.\u201dCheng Qiang laughed. \u201cCome on, you can sing on the stage in a bit\u00a0ba, don\u2019t break your voice singing for me.\u201dAfter listening to Cheng Qiang\u2019s words, Fang Juexia kept feeling empty, as if he was missing something. He looked around the room through the mirror, and then realized they were missing Pei Tingsong. If he was here, he would definitely be full of fire, and maybe he would change the lyrics once they went on-stage again.Where did he go?Speak of the devil and he will come; a knock sounded from the rest area door, and Jiang Miao got up to open it. He saw Pei Tingsong coming in with a pile of things and saying, \u201cQuickly help me with this.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Xiao Pei recently?\u201d Lu Yuan took the coffee from him as he questioned, \u201cHow can you be so sensible? Have you been possessed by some angel?\u201dAs he looked into the mirror, Fang Juexia heard the stylist say, \u201cJuexia, your hair extensions are good, go have a rest first, and I\u2019ll do Ling Yi\u2019s hair.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve troubled you.\u201dHe got up, and wrapped in his black military costume, went to the couch and sat down. Pei Tingsong distributed coffee and cake to everyone. \u201cOkay, you guys take it\u00a0ba. There\u2019s sugar in that package\u00a0ah, and if you want to add it, add it yourself.\u201d After he finished distributing everything, he also came to sit down on the sofa next to Fang Juexia.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t get any coffee or cake, and he was empty-handed. He glanced at Pei Tingsong, who was sitting beside him. The other side looked at him and smiled at him. \u201cWhat are you looking at me for?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d Fang Juexia turned his head back.Pei Tingsong stared at the ensemble show cameraman, and when he turned around to go film Ling Yi, he quietly took out a small dark green bag and put it in front of Fang Juexia. Inside this bag was a Venetian latte with milk and no sugar, a small, exquisite, and beautiful cake, and a small thermos cup.Seeing him like this, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t understand. He couldn\u2019t get why Pei Tingsong hadn\u2019t given it to him a moment ago, and why he had to hand it over to him secretly now.\u201cEat it quickly\u00a0ah.\u201d Pei Tingsong opened the cake box for him, put a fork in it, and pushed it in front of him. \u201cIt\u2019s super delicious, trust me.\u201dThe little cake had well-organized layers, and looked delicate and beautiful. Fang Juexia had gotten up early in the morning and hadn\u2019t eaten anything, so he was also a little hungry. In their group, it had always been tradition that everyone would eat the stuff, which someone had bought, together, so he had gotten used to that a long time ago. However, now that it was Pei Tingsong giving him cake, he actually felt a little bit unaccustomed to it, so he kept hesitating and not moving.\u201cYou\u2019re 23 years old, it can\u2019t be that you want me to feed you?\u201dAs soon as he said this, Fang Juexia immediately moved and took a bite of the cake. He had always liked sweet food, and the cake was just right.Seeing that his eyes had lit up, Pei Tingsong was very satisfied. \u201cDelicious\u00a0ba?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Fang Juexia looked at him. \u201cWhat kind of cake is this?\u201d\u201cTiramisu.\u201d Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t answer in Chinese, but in Italian.Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t too particular about desserts, but tiramisu was such a classic dessert that everyone knew about it, so as soon as Pei Tingsong mentioned it, of course he knew what it was. However, he just had to say its name in Italian, which made what he ate seem to be less of a cake and more of an ambiguous and warm heart.He guiltily drank some coffee to cover up his expression, put down his fork, took out his cellphone, and sent Pei Tingsong a message. His tone was serious as he clattered away on the keyboard.[Just a pretty face and also pretty: You need to be a little more restrained.]But just after sending that message, Fang Juexia thought again about whether he had been too fierce. He hesitantly typed out a few words with his fingers, then deleted them as he reconsidered the wording.Before he could send it out, Pei Tingsong\u2019s reply to his message had already arrived.[Guide Dog: Understood, Teacher Fang.]Seeing that he was being so obedient, Fang Juexia felt even more ashamed.[Just a pretty face and also pretty: Thank you for your cake. Why did you give it to me secretly, like a thief?]Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t seem to see that he was still messaging. He was busy unscrewing the thermos cup and putting it in front of Fang Juexia. He glanced at it, and its contents seemed to consist of snow pear slices. They were cut into big and small pieces, and the sweet smell wafted up to his face.Fang Juexia\u2019s heart suddenly softened. He had never thought that Pei Tingsong would actually stew tongsui for him.His cellphone vibrated. He picked it up and saw the latest message.[Guide Dog: Because I only bought it for you; I picked it out very seriously. If the others knew, they would scold me to death.]And then another message came right after\u2014[Guide Dog: Teacher Fang, I\u2019m so good, you can take me away\u00a0ba.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At that time, he had originally wanted to take a cute little dog home, so as soon as he had entered, he had headed straight for the Pomeranians.What he didn\u2019t expect was a little husky to stand at his side, its blue eyes staring fixedly at him, clutching non-stop at the cage and sticking out his little tongue. As soon as Fang Juexia came near, it started to joyfully thrash around, hating that it couldn\u2019t bite open the cage and jump into his arms.At that time, Fang Juexia had suddenly felt his heart soften. He gave up on the plan that he had prepared for a long time, took this little guy away, and because of his small black abacus bead-like eyebrows, he gave him the name Little Abacus.If Little Abacus had back then turned into a dog yao and could talk, he should have said the same thing when he was hopping around back then\u2014take me away ba, take me away ba.Two heavy knocks suddenly sounded on the lounge\u2019s door.\u201cKaleido!\u201d A staff member wearing a headset pushed open the door and half leaned into the room. \u201cStand by, there are still three more before you guys are on.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Cheng Qiang answered just as the last member, Ling Yi\u2019s, styling was also completed. \u201cAll of you should have your earpieces on\u00a0ba, we\u2019ve tried them all at the company, so they should be okay. There also should be no problem with the sound system of the singing program. Don\u2019t worry about the numbers, anyway, we\u2019re here to perform. It\u2019s most important that you all enjoy the stage.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t get any time to reply to Pei Tingsong\u2019s words. During the time it took for them to adjust the earpieces, he glanced over at him, just to see the corners of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth quirk up at him.Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t seem to strongly need any response, he just expressed himself directly and enthusiastically, just like he did normally. Fang Juexia had to admit that he had never encountered such a person in his life before.People will be afraid of the unknown, but they will also be inevitably attracted by the unknown.They were arranged to wait outside the passageway connecting the stage and the rest area, where many people were coming and going. Ling Yi took in all kinds of deep breaths and patted his chest, back, and arms like an old man in the park. \u201cWhat to do, I haven\u2019t been on a singing show for a long time. I\u2019m a little nervous.\u201dLu Yuan hugged him. \u201cIsn\u2019t it just a dress rehearsal? There\u2019s nothing to be nervous about.\u201dJiang Miao said with a smile, \u201cYes\u00a0ah, the situation this time can\u2019t be worse than that of the charity party last time, when the stereo got scrapped, and didn\u2019t we survive that incident?\u201dIn order to ease the atmosphere, the ensemble show\u2019s cameraman asked them some styling related questions while carrying his camera.\u201cThis make-up is very special, what do you guys think of it?\u201d\u201cSo\u00a0cool.\u201d He Ziyan drew close to the camera, and his dyed red hair with slight curls scattered in front of the forehead. \u201cSee this wound on my cheekbone? Isn\u2019t it really lifelike? The stylist did these for us, and it\u2019s called\u2026\u201d He thought for a moment, which was when Lu Yuan picked the conversation up, \u201cWar wound makeup!\u201d\u201cRight, there is an abrasion on my cheekbone and a cut under my eyebrow. Everyone, please rest assured that we didn\u2019t get into a fight, this is all make-up.\u201dLing Yi giggled. \u201cI\u2019m the only one whose wounds came from a fight.\u201dFang Juexia abruptly added, \u201cThe group doesn\u2019t have any evidence of that.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha!\u201d\u201cLing Yi, forget it,\u201d He Ziyan pressed his head down. \u201cIf you jump up, you can fight with my ankles.\u201dJiang Miao continued to explain into the camera. \u201cOur styling is more bold this time round; I might be the only one who is more conservative and whose hair was dyed dark brown, because the stylist thinks that I need to match with the image of a guzheng. My war wounds are mainly the wound at the corner of the mouth and the one on my hand, which may be featured later.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Lu Yuan asked deliberately.\u201cConfidential.\u201d Jiang Miao smiled and walked over to stand in front of Pei Tingsong, who was adjusting his ear piece. Pei Tingsong faced the camera with one side of his profile, and raised his eyebrow.\u201cXiao Pei\u2019s hair color is the most eye-catching of us all this time. It\u2019s platinum, and he\u2019s also wearing cosmetic contact lenses.\u201dPei Tingsong took the initiative to look directly into the camera lens. His left eye was a very transparent blue, but his right eye was blood red. Like He Ziyan, he had a wound near his cheekbone, and coupled with white hair and his three-dimensional facial features, he made quite an eye-catching figure.After introducing their youngest member, Jiang Miao pulled Ling Yi over again. \u201cLing Yi\u2019s hair was dyed\u00a0gray blue\u00a0this time. I feel like it\u2019s very suitable, because Ling Yi is very pale. Teacher Yuan has pencil gray hair color, also very cool.\u201dLing Yi nodded. \u201cI especially like our military uniform this time. There are several sets, and aren\u2019t they handsome?\u201d He turned around in a circle. \u201cThis uniform is all black, and also has a kind of chain medal epaulet at the top of it. It\u2019s more of a European design style type, but the stylists have also designed some more costumes in the Chinese style, which will be worn in future promotional performances.\u201dThe cameraman specially asked, \u201cHow come with your six military uniforms, some are short and some are long?\u201dLing Yi looked down and said, \u201cYes\u00a0ah, me, Miaoxiao, and Teacher Yuan all have short ones, while Fire Ge, Xiao Pei, and Juexia all have longer ones, basically like overcoats.\u201dThe cameraman turned to Fang Juexia and stated, \u201cJuexia\u2019s coat is actually the longest.\u201dFang Juexia smiled. \u201cBecause there are some small surprises.\u201d\u201cJuexia also has hair extensions!\u201d Ling Yi walked up to him and pointed to his styled hair behind him. \u201cYou see, he dyed his hair black just so we could add black hair extensions and then tie it all up into a high ponytail. It\u2019s very similar to the way ancient young master swordsmen wore it, right?\u201dPei Tingsong looked at him. As he had thought, the contrast between his black hair and cold white skin tone had become more obvious, making Fang Juexia\u2019s temperament seem even colder. With those \u2018wounds\u2019 on his neck and cheek, and the red drawing by his birthmark, this whole person exuded a temperament that was extremely cool and elegant.\u201cWill you be putting in hair extensions and taking them out every time?\u201dFang Juexia shook his head. \u201cNo, while we\u2019re carrying out promotions and performing, I will be keeping my hair long.\u201d\u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d\u201cJust\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia laughed and replied, \u201cI\u2019ve never had such long hair before, and it even becomes a little heavy when I tie it up. I just feel like girls are very powerful; it should be hard work for them to do their hair every day, so I feel the same way now.\u201dLing Yi was a little surprised. \u201cWhat a strange perspective.\u201dFang Juexia insisted, \u201cIt\u2019s really not easy. I had to wear high heels once because of a punishment game, and found that it\u2019s really hard for girls. Our society pays too much attention to girls\u2019 appearance, and even if it\u2019s imperceptible, it\u2019s still a kind of pressure\u00a0ba. I hope that everyone can live a more free and comfortable life.\u201dJust then, a staff member, with a sign hanging around their neck and standing at the other end of the corridor, waved to them, \u201cThere are still two more performances to go, Kaleido, enter.\u201dAs instructed, they entered the backstage waiting area through the passageway. The light wasn\u2019t strong here, though there were many people. As soon as they stepped in, Fang Juexia felt someone grab his arm, then pull him two steps to the right, which made him stick close to a person\u2019s arm.\u201cI\u2019m going to start working.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice contained a smile.His guide dog work? Fang Juexia lowered his eyes, and the corners of his mouth quirked up slightly.Coincidentally, the ones performing on the stage right now was Seven Luminaries. Although he couldn\u2019t see the stage, Fang Juexia had already heard the comeback song they were currently singing before, and could also hear Liang Ruo\u2019s voice. They were singing half-live and half-lip synching, with the sound of the parts being lip-synched being very obvious. Even two years after their debut, Seven Luminaries\u2019 live performances continued to, as always, garner criticism online. On average, they weren\u2019t especially good at lip-synching, and when their state wasn\u2019t good, they would have more obvious accidents onstage. But in most people\u2019s minds, idols themselves were just inferior singers, and besides Star Chart, there were few other companies that would focus on their artists\u2019 singing skills, focusing instead on stage performance expressiveness.Kaleido counted as an exception. In addition to the super high-performing double lead singers, the singing skills of the other members were also quite steady. Even Lu Yuan, who had, in the beginning, entered the company bearing the identity of a dance champion, had, under Chen Zhengyun\u2019s instruction, trained his singing skills to a level that was very laudable.However, individual strength was one factor, but if one had no capital to pave the way, it was as rare as the hair of a phoenix or the horns of a giraffe to use strength alone to forge a path of flowers forward in this industry.\u201cDoes anyone want to go to the bathroom?\u201d Ling Yi suddenly wanted to go to the bathroom, but no one else wanted to. He grabbed Fang Juexia\u2019s arm. \u201cJuexia, will you accompany me?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Without waiting for him to refuse, Ling Yi started running forward, dragging him along. The bathroom wasn\u2019t that far from the backstage, they just had to go through a dark passageway. Being forcefully dragged to the bathroom door by Ling Yi, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry, so all he did was speak through the bathroom door, \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you outside.\u201dHe stood at the edge of the dark passageway, looking down and recalling lyrics. The shadows of the passageway shrouded him in darkness, and he wasn\u2019t eye-catching. Two staff members, who were waiting in the wings, moved the stage props to the backstage area and leaned to a side to take a break. They didn\u2019t notice Fang Juexia\u2019s existence.They also didn\u2019t notice that they had lost a foam letter while moving the props. It was about the size of a book and had fallen by Fang Juexia\u2019s feet. They listened to Seven Luminaries\u2019 song and started to chat.\u201cJust listening to Seven Luminaries\u2019 performance is really not good, you really have to see the people.\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t compete with the fact that they have so many fans\u00a0ah. Hey, do you think Kaleido\u2019s comeback this time will be a loss? I\u2019ve just glanced through it, and their new song was already released in the early hours, at 12 am, but the number of clicks they\u2019ve gotten is far fewer than Seven Luminaries. It\u2019s been almost six hours\u00a0ba, and they still only have 20,000 favorites on the music platform.\u201d\u201c20,000 isn\u2019t bad, this 20,000 must be the result they managed to get after acting pitiful to their fans. What die-hard fans did they have before\u00a0ah?\u201d\u201cBut Seven Luminaries\u2019 main song already has 120,000 favorites! And it\u2019s still climbing up, while Kaleido\u2019s, in comparison, is just small change. Besides, there are no passers-by who would favorite this kind of main song sung by idols.\u201d\u201cHow can they compare with Seven Luminaries\u00a0ah, just looking at their number of fans, can we compare them? Yes, Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong are very popular recently, but fans who joined because of this are more or less just fans playing around\u00a0ah, would they really buy your albums just because they like your CP\u00a0ah? The music platform depends mainly on potential passers-by audiences for the songs, and whoever\u2019s album can go beyond this circle, is whoever\u2019s album that can sell more. On top of that, Kaleido\u2019s demo was even leaked, so like hell they can sell, they can\u2019t be saved.\u201d\u201cAlso, speaking of Fang Juexia, he\u2019s so good-looking, and his talent is on an entirely different level, but how can he be so unlucky?\u201d\u201cWho the hell knows\u2026\u201dThe person who started answering was left stunned, because the person they were just talking about, Fang Juexia, appeared in front of them at this moment and handed over their foam letter A.\u201cYour prop.\u201dFang Juexia was tall, and he was born with a cold face that radiated a strong sense of distance. In addition, his voice was also cold, which always gave people the feeling that he was hard to approach. These two people who just happened to be flapping their gums behind his back now felt guilty.However, Fang Juexia actually didn\u2019t take their discussion to heart. He had just wanted to give this prop back to them, so he had slowly stepped forward and drawn closer, based on the sound of their voices.The other person\u2019s face was very surprised. He pulled on his colleague\u2019s sleeve and whispered, \u201cPei\u2026.Pei Tingsong.\u201dPei Tingsong? Fang Juexia was just about to turn around when his shoulder was caught hold of.\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you for a long time, and of course\u00a0you\u2019re here acting as a lost and found for others\u00a0ah.\u201dFang Juexia was about to speak when he suddenly heard another voice. It was a woman with an impressive voice, and she called out the names of the two people directly. \u201cAre working hours for you guys to rest and flap your gums?\u201d\u201cChief-chief director.\u201dWhen Fang Juexia turned around, a stage light shone on that spot and perfectly hit the lady in a blue suit. She looked very capable and experienced.So this turned out to be MLH\u2019s program director.\u201cIf the entire props group followed the work attitude you two have, I feel like none of them should work any more.\u201d She reprimanded them and sent them away. Ling Yi also came out of the bathroom at this time and ran around looking for them. He soon saw them and ran towards them.Unexpectedly, the female director actually apologized to them.\u201cThis circle is just like that. However, I\u2019m very optimistic about the stage performance you guys will display. I was in the director\u2019s studio at the charity party last time, and the scene of how you guys rescued that performance is still fresh in my memory.\u201d Saying that, she then looked at Fang Juexia. \u201cEspecially you, no wonder you are the core of the team.\u201dFang Juexia dropped his eyes and thanked her. Then came a call for them from a staff member through their earpieces, so they said goodbye to the director and joined the others.If it wasn\u2019t for the two staff members chatting with each other, Fang Juexia would not have known the number of hits their music had received so far. The company intentionally didn\u2019t want to tell any of the group members, presumably because they were also worried that it would affect their first live performance.However, Fang Juexia was precisely the opposite of this. After hearing those harsh words, he seemed to have become more able to integrate himself into the song, and into the stage itself.Because Kaleido\u2019s current situation now perfectly coincided with this song.\u201cLights in place!\u201d\u201cNumber one in position!\u201d\u201cNumber two in position!\u201dThe voice of the staff members came in one after another.Kaleido\u2019s background stage setting was very special. On the stage wall behind them were military orders written in calligraphy, along with many weapons, and situated right in the middle of all this was a red drum with its drum face facing forward. Half a meter in front of the drum was a black sandalwood guzheng, which was Jiang Miao\u2019s own guzheng. On each side of the stage were three battle flags that had their six names written in calligraphy on them.All the members stood in a line on the stage, with Ling Yi at the front. Jiang Miao made a gesture towards the director\u2019s studio. \u201cKaleido in position.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d All the lights on the stage switched off, and the last call came from the director\u2019s studio, \u201cKaleido\u2019s\u00a0Break Through\u00a0recording begins!\u201dAs the accompaniment music began, a sample of Chinese opera beats sounded out, and a\u00a0jinghu\u00a0began to play the first melody. In the center of the stage, an odd number of lights turned on, and the camera panned from top to bottom. When the camera focused on their faces, Ling Yi shook his wrist to snap open a folding fan, and his Beijing Opera Aria began.\u201cHearing the pounding of the golden drums send the corners trembling, my ambitions to break through the gates of heaven are sent flying.\u201d He held a red folding fan in his hand and only fanned it twice. \u201cWhy bother talking about the clown King Shan, with one sword, I can block millions of soldiers and send them all\u00a0running!\u201cThe last few words were high pitched and sweet, with the lingering notes at the end full of charm. This opening shocked the hundreds in the audience; everyone looked at each other, not expecting to actually hear such an opening on an idol stage.\u201cHoly crap, this is Beijing Opera\u00a0ah?! Too awesome!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve even got goosebumps!\u201d\u201cThis is\u00a0Lady Mu Guiying Takes Command,\u00a0is K\u2019s lead singer that strong?\u201d\u201cThis is the song that leaked\u00a0ba.\u201dKaleido\u2019s fans started their crazy support mode, shouting out the names of all the group members one by one in tune with the intervals of the accompaniment.The accompaniment was still in the beginning beats of the Beijing Opera music, and then a clear flute sound shot through, acting like some kind of signal. Ling Yi closed the folding fan and threw it into the air.There was a command from the director\u2019s studio\u2014[Number one, follow the camera up, Number two get ready\u2014]When the camera panned down, the single line formation maintained by the six people was already no more, as they had separated. Jiang Miao stepped forward and sang in a long-drawn out voice, \u201cThe yellow sand everywhere lifts the blood mist sown, break through the formation to vie for the throne.\u201cFang Juexia went next, coming to stand in the center of the group. His long hair, tied up high, floated with his actions, appearing free and easy, cool and ethereal, perfectly creating the opening atmosphere. \u201cAll my ways forward have been blown, all that is left is to wait for your ambush to be thrown.\u201cThe sound of the drum began to appear in the accompaniment, and their presence gradually turned majestic. Under the drum\u2019s rhythm, the whole group danced together, and the consistency of their movements was amazing. The rhythm grew stronger and stronger, and the climax ushered in the variation of a guzheng, which, with three strums, gave the feeling of thousands of troops crossing over.Ling Yi walked forward.\u00a0\u201cOne stone creates a thousand ripples, and two fingers create tens of thousands of sounds. Escape by the moon at night, march through snow covered grounds.\u201d[Number three!]This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgIn the middle of the camera, Lu Yuan executed a forward somersault to reach the center of the stage, which attracted the audience\u2019s cheers again. The most outstanding thing was that, during this somersault, his mic was completely on, and his voice didn\u2019t shake at all. \u201cIt\u2019s life or death with our backs to the water, burn all the bridges to slaughter the\u00a0qilin. Behead\u00a0Yama\u00a0alone with a grin, with our bloody flags and banners fluttering within.\u201dThe delicate drumbeats brought the atmosphere to its peak, and the impact presented by the image of the knife-life group dance being executed by the six of them was extremely strong. In the accompaniment, every sweep of the guzheng strings seemed to carry a very murderous air.He Ziyan walked to the very front under the sound of a flute. The choreographed hand movements combined into a technique of\u00a0twirling a sword around. When he finished, he grabbed his headset and began to rap, \u201cHiding my abilities and biding my time so, I\u2019ve been waiting for this battle since long ago. Be careful if your morals don\u2019t match up below, or every last square inch will be a mess yo.\u201cThe choreography during the rap part was relatively casual, and He Ziyan swung his open military coat backwards, half crouched down to be the focus of the camera, and sneered, \u201cJust be a wordless vase, and mess around less with real voices in place. I admit my besieged base, but let\u2019s see you after karma\u2019s grace!\u201cStanding up, He Ziyan shook his head to the rhythm that got faster and faster, and retreated from the edge of the stage step by step. \u201cA thousand troops and horses have driven the six of us to a desperate place, but believe it or not, I\u2019ll go my own way and slaughter a bloody road out of this space. Whether a hero wins or loses in this face, success or failure depends on just this race.\u201d At last, he performed a gentleman\u2019s bow and ended his part. \u201cThank you so much for making your secrets known, in the future I\u2019ll have prestige that\u2019s far blown.\u201dThis part was clearly talking about the situation of the leaked song, and the eyes of the fans of other groups grew large. They didn\u2019t expect that the lyrics of this \u201cBreak Through\u201d song would be so targeted.As the song started to transition, the sharp sound of a blade being unsheathed appeared in the accompaniment. Ling Yi walked forward and sang in a high voice, \u201cA new generation has already arrived, that you dare not admit nor claim.\u201cHe Ziyan\u2019s melodic rap cushioned him from behind, \u201cWhoever surrenders is whoever agrees for a naked blade to pierce through your\u00a0body and name.\u201cFang Juexia\u2019s transition aria came next. From the edge of the stage, he crossed past four people, stood on the C position, and started to really dance on the fly right there and then.[Number 1, move over! Cut over to Number 4 showing the face!]Fang Juexia\u2019s military coat was the only one that was tightly fastened and had a completely abstinent air. He turned his cheek and sang in a high penetrating voice, \u201cPlease hurry up and line up by my sword for death to claim.\u201cJust as the last note sounded, Pei Tingsong suddenly appeared in the camera\u2019s frame, grabbed Fang Juexia\u2019s collar in one move, and their side profiles were suddenly positioned close to each other. \u201cDon\u2019t blink or blame, ten steps and a person will be dead and maimed.\u201cFang Juexia pushed him away and disdainfully raised up his left eyebrow.This on-stage choreographed interaction immediately aroused a huge scream from the audience, and dozens of fans called out in an exaggerated way akin to that of hundreds of people calling out, nearly covering the sound of the accompaniment.Five people walked to form a circle, and standing in the center of the circle, Lu Yuan raised his wrists, the white bandages wrapped around his wrists swinging. \u201cWait and watch me\u2014\u201dEvery single move of the rest of the group members was controlled by him, it was as if he had reins tied to their bodies. Six voices raised, entering a chorus\u2014[Feel free to question bloodless battles from dirty hidden rulesA night escape to fight against the false world to see who creates god and foolsNo matter what you hear or argue, just say that heroes don\u2019t have origins or jewels]The rhythm of the accompaniment grew faster and faster. Everyone knelt down, only leaving Jiang Miao standing upright, who sang, \u201cDon\u2019t ask about the future, you ghoul.\u201cThe whole group got up, and at the moment when the rhythm became so dense that it seemed it was about to rush to the climax of the song, the next beat suddenly turned out to be empty.Fang Juexia, who had moved to the C position, raised his hand and positioned his fingers into the shape of a gun. In the close-up, he reached up to his temple\u2014\u201cListen to me break through the line with one song, fool.\u201cThe most explosive electronic sound drop in the entire song appeared, and the strong rhythm caused the entire audience to boil up. The real sampled sounds of swords swinging overlapped and interlaced with the sharp electronic sounds, creating a sense of space where the glint and flash of cold steel could be felt clearly.This part of the dance had\u00a0 large and interwoven movements, but each action of theirs accurately stuck to the rhythm laid out by the electric sounds, and the whole section was performed very powerfully. The atmosphere in the whole studio reached a new high, seeming just like the scene found at a music festival. At the end of the section when the music dropped, all the members sang again in unison, \u201cListen to me break through the line with one song, fool.\u201cOnce again, the formation changed into a long line. With the plucking of guzheng, everyone tilted away from the line, going left to right, revealing Pei Tingsong at the very end. At some point, he had come to a stand in front of the red taiko drum, and with the accompaniment, he beat the taiko drum hard to signal the start of the battle again.Flipping the drumstick in his hand around, Pei Tingsong flipped over the guzheng and came to the front. He shook his military coat open and began to rap, \u201cIn this world here, with open and hidden fights that scare, there are knives hidden in smiles everywhere. When we wait for advice there, getting evil insidious tasks isn\u2019t rare.\u201cFang Juexia thought that this time Pei Tingsong wouldn\u2019t change the lyrics on the spot, but he was still too naive. This idea had swayed in his mind for less than a second before he heard Pei Tingsong\u2019s second creation.\u201cThe unpolished leaked song is out of tune beware, how do you like the lyrics here? If it wasn\u2019t full of ridicule and despair, how would you know I\u2019m the\u00a0crane screaming in the marsh air.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s steps were full of gangster spirit, and he picked up the folding fan from the ground, opened it abruptly, and fanned himself.\u201cHeart festering with a jealousy flare, there\u2019s still no medicine for this evil affair. The original lone forces cut a wound with due care, and drank the hot blood to live immortal and fair.\u201cThese changed lyrics were so sharp that they seemed to hate the fact that they couldn\u2019t directly pierce Astar\u2019s lungs. Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t say a single dirty word, but he still gave them absolute hell, and Fang Juexia really had to admire that.He held the folded fan like a knife and ferociously sliced it across his chest. Pei Tingsong\u2019s face showed a morbid smile, and he wiped at the corner of his mouth. \u201cBut I was born an irritable bear, so I\u2019ll bite back if you dare.\u201d At last, he turned his back and randomly threw out the folding fan. \u201cThe sound of the guzheng unsheathes the sharp sword with a flare, to lift up your heads and break the heavens bare.\u201cThis rap was so deadly that it almost shocked the entire audience.\u201cShit, Pei Tingsong is too real!\u201d\u201cHe nearly started naming names\u2026\u201dThe musical arrangement changed again, and with the sound of horses neighing, the lead singers stepped forward again. The coordination of the dance for the song was very orderly, and their aura grew even stronger than during the first chorus. The fans below were also more vocal in their support, and when this mixed in with the war-like sounds of the accompaniment, it had the feel of delight and the unrestrained nature of people fighting their way out of a siege.[Feel free to question bloodless battles from dirty hidden rulesA night escape to fight against the false world to see who creates god and foolsNo matter what you hear or argue, just say that heroes don\u2019t have origins or jewelsDon\u2019t ask about the future, you ghoulListen to me break through the line with one song, fool]They thought there would be another techno drop here, but didn\u2019t expect the background sounds to suddenly quiet down. All that was left was the sound of the military drum, one beat after another resounding continuously. All of a sudden, the stage went completely dark; there was no light, and only the drumbeats continued.When the lights lit up again, the guzheng sounded, but it wasn\u2019t the one pre-recorded into the accompaniment, but a real performance. There were only two spotlights, and only two people left on the stage. One spotlight was on Jiang Miao, sitting in front of guzheng. The other was on Fang Juexia, who stood alone with his back to the stage.His military overcoat had already been taken off, and all he was wearing now was a\u00a0moon white wide sleeved hanfu. The audience below were surprised by this unexpected choreography.\u201cMy God!!!\u201d\u201cAh, this look!! Amazing!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s Fang Juexia?\u201dWith Jiang Miao\u2019s guzheng music accompanying him, Fang Juexia began his solo dance. He raised his arms and lifted his legs, his movements as light as clouds. The string sounds were steadily getting faster, and he threw himself forward, as if jumping in to explore the sea, then jumped up again, repeating the motion twice. The amazing difficulty of the swallow style purple gold crown dance made the audience scream.After several rolling cloud bridges, Fang Juexia came to the guzheng, lowered his hand, picked up a long sword from the stand, and danced with it, looking as elegant as an immortal.Not good.Fang Juexia felt that his waist was being jerked around by some force, and upon looking down, he saw that the mic box fixed on the back of his waist had fallen off, just hanging by a thread in the air. His expression didn\u2019t change as he temporarily altered his choreography. He turned while lifting his leg up at its knee and grasped at the black cord. He shook his wrist around, and the mic box seemed to toss around in the air for an eternity before it was firmly caught by Fang Juexia.It was a long process to him, but it appeared as just a flash for the audience. Few people discovered how amazingly Fang Juexia had saved his solo performance.He hid his hand holding the mic box behind his back and danced with the sword in his right hand. His waist was as flexible as the soft sword in his hand, and when the sound of the guzheng gradually fell, he stabbed the long sword in front, stood on one leg, raised his left leg up high, and stood in the center of the stage like a crane.With the movement of a few sweeping strings, the guzheng\u2019s music started to change. Once everyone returned to the stage, Jiang Miao covered the chair he had just been sitting on, and the group gathered to hide behind Fang Juexia. Lu Yuan opened his mouth and began the transitional bridge. \u201cClose your eyes, and listen to the sounds of the fighting that goes up to the skies. I\u2019m sure this time I won\u2019t be confined to difficult cries.\u201cLing Yi followed after, his high pitched voice very penetrating. \u201cThere is no shortcut on the road to this famed prize, I believe only in me and never in fate\u2019s reprise.\u201cThe chorus reappeared. Lu Yuan, who was the main dancer, stood in the C position. Everyone was in an arrow shaped formation, and Fang Juexia was right behind him.[Feel free to question bloodless battles from dirty hidden rulesA night escape to fight against the false world to see who creates god and foolsNo matter what you hear or argue, just say that heroes don\u2019t have origins or jewelsDon\u2019t ask about the future, you ghoulListen to me break through the line with one song, fool]The last intense EDM drop pushed the atmosphere in the entire studio to the very top. It made it seem that they weren\u2019t recording for a song show at all, but more like the scene of a Kaleido concert. Everyone\u2019s senses were mobilized, and they moved with the music until the end of the fire.The rhythm slowed down, and the six people walked back towards the stage. The accompaniment changed to become the part from the beginning again, where the strings were plucked and the Beijing Opera sounds of the guzheng were played, while the background sound had faint wind and sounds of snow whistling mixed in.With the sound of the flute, Pei Tingsong took a black military overcoat in his hand, and as the cold sound of the strings shivering were heard, he put it on Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulders. Fang Juexia walked neither fast nor slow towards the old fashioned chair in front of the guzheng and picked up the long sword that had just been laid atop the guzheng. The others also began to circle around toward the chair, displaying their ending movements.Jiang Miao\u2019s voice was mild and gentle as he sang, \u201cThe yellow sand everywhere lifts the blood mist sown, break through the formation to vie for the throne.\u201cPei Tingsong stood behind the chair, his eyes filled with violence. Fang Juexia turned to sit in the chair and leaned into it lazily. After wiping the blade with his fingers, he threw the sword indifferently to the ground in front of him and sang the last sentence of the whole song\u2014\u201cAll my ways forward have been blown, all that is left is to wait for your ambush to be thrown.\u201cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Kaleido\u2019s\u00a0Break Through\u00a0recording is over! Hard work everyone.\u201dAfter hearing the director\u2019s voice, the six people relaxed, stood in a row, and bowed deeply towards the audience. Their names were being called out in every direction of the stage, the voices of the audience seeming to rush towards them in waves.Fang Juexia was standing in the very center, and as he bowed, his nose actually stung a bit, even despite him keeping up his usual calm and controlled self. The cold reception that they had received ever since their debut, and the sadness that they had experienced at wanting to perform but having no stage to do so\u2014clearly, all these were feelings that he had long gotten used to, but standing on the stage to perform and promote their song after a whole year made all these feelings come rushing back up again.Despite the popularity he had gained in recent days, which had never had before, and even gaining new fans who liked them, as far as Fang Juexia was concerned, being able to win everyone\u2019s applause while on the stage was the thing that he really loved.When they left the stage, they all bowed to the different staff members they encountered on the way, saying \u201chard work everyone\u201d to each person. Even Pei Tingsong, who had disdained to do something like this before, had been subtly influenced to do so. He supported Fang Juexia in walking through the dark by the sash around his waist, all the way until they came to the brightly lit passageway.\u201cWe\u2019re clocking out! We\u2019re clocking out!\u201d Ling Yi was extremely happy as he exclaimed, \u201cWe\u2019re off work at last!\u201dLu Yuan also followed him in swaying around, and the two people inexplicably went from walking normally into jumping around like zombies. \u201cSuddenly, I want to eat\u00a0sea worm dumplings, I\u2019m starving.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s order take out later\u00a0ba!\u201d\u201cOkay\u00a0ah!\u201dSeeing his bandmates being so cute, Fang Juexia\u2019s mood calmed down a little. Once they were back in the lounge, as soon as the door closed, Fang Juexia suddenly felt that his overcoat, which had been hanging over him, get taken away. A hand grabbed his waist and moved him back and forth, and when he turned his head, he saw that the culprit was Pei Tingsong.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Pei Tingsong checked carefully and said, \u201d I just saw your mic box fall from the side of the stage, it didn\u2019t pull at your waist\u00a0ba?\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s eyes immediately widened a bit, and in a rare instance, his words sped up as he asked a little nervously, \u201cYou saw that? Was it very obvious? What to do? Maybe everyone saw it, this belt doesn\u2019t really fix the mic box in place, and it gets thrown around as soon as I execute any big movements.\u201d He sighed and added, \u201cAfter practicing for so long, I still slipped up.\u201dAs soon as he said that, Pei Tingsong took hold of his face with both of his hands, and then proceeded to squeeze his face out of shape. \u201cWhat are you talking about\u00a0ah,\u00a0I asked if there was something wrong with your waist, and you tell me you slipped up instead.\u201dFang Juexia froze for a moment, and then broke away from his hands, and rubbed his face. \u201cMy waist is fine, that mic box isn\u2019t heavy.\u201d He didn\u2019t look at Pei Tingsong directly, but added in a low voice, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dJiang Miao heard what Fang Juexia had said just now, and came over to pinch his shoulder. \u201cJuexia, that didn\u2019t count as you slipping up at all, that\u2019s called rescuing the performance. I was right behind you playing the guzheng, and I was really scared when I saw it, but you were really handsome when you flipped over that mic box. And by the reaction below the stage, it shouldn\u2019t have been noticed by many people.\u201d With that, he purposefully glanced over at Pei Tingsong. \u201cIt was just Xiao Pei, I guess his eyes don\u2019t blink at all.\u201dIn the past, Pei Tingsong would definitely have been in a hurry to refute that statement, but now he shamelessly admitted it straightforwardly, \u201cThat\u2019s true, how could I blink with you guys performing like that?\u201dFang Juexia was a little embarrassed, so he looked down and didn\u2019t talk any further.Cheng Qiang came in through the door and hugged them one by one. \u201cToo great, you guys were too great! Worthy of being my puppies! While watching, I nearly turned into an old man with tears streaming down my cheeks.\u201dLu Yuan started laughing after being hugged. \u201cStrong Ge has become more and more educated recently.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense!\u201d Cheng Qiang pulled Pei Tingsong in and hugged him, then pointed at him, chiding, \u201cYou\u00a0ah, you changed your lyrics again.\u201dPei Tingsong shrugged. \u201cThat was just what I wrote last night. It was too late to add it to the studio version, but I thought it was too much of a pity, and that I should sing it anyway.\u201dWhen it came to the topic of changing the lyrics, Fang Juexia thought of a point, and couldn\u2019t wait to say, \u201cJust now, Xiao Pei said some lyrics of \u2018The original lone forces cut a wound with due care\u2019, and then it\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd drank the hot blood to live immortal and fair,\u201d Pei Tingsong took over.\u201cYes!\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s expression was full of praise. \u201cThose words were too wonderful, it was really great.\u201dPei Tingsong hadn\u2019t not heard praise from others before; he had actually heard too much of it, and there had also been all kinds of\u00a0exaggerations. One simple sentence of \u2018it was really great\u2019 didn\u2019t count as much, but as long as it was uttered by Fang Juexia, he felt that it was better than anything. He had never been so happy.Fang Juexia continued to elaborate on his idea, \u201cOur choreography was based on the original lyrics, but since the live version has been changed, I think we can change our actions to match the lyrics in our next performance.\u201d Then, he made a motion of digging out his heart and said, \u201cWhat do you guys think?\u201dLu Yuan clapped. \u201cThis is good, six people depicting the scene together should make a great impact. When we get back, let\u2019s arrange it!\u201dWatching them start a discussion centered around the stage again, Cheng Qiang felt emotional. These children had just finished a very difficult performance, but even after descending from the stage, they actually didn\u2019t take the time to relax as if having survived a disaster, and they also didn\u2019t go to fuss over their comeback album\u2019s numbers and ranking. Instead, they wholeheartedly focused on the stage and on their performance, just thinking about how to make their performance even more brilliant.They deserved a better future.Thinking of this, Cheng Qiang clapped his hands and said, \u201cI\u2019ve already greeted the program team, and we won\u2019t be participating in the award ceremony that\u2019ll happen in a bit. Anyway, we\u2019re not candidates, so it\u2019s meaningless to waste time here.\u201d\u201cAfter this, there is a fan meeting being hosted for the new album, and that will be entirely livestreamed, so nothing can go wrong there. Go back first and rest, have a meal, and then practice all the programs you will perform at the meeting, especially each of your solos.\u201dWhen they exited MLH\u2019s studio, they discovered that fans had surrounded the building from the outside. All of these fans were holding Klein blue fan signs and kaleidoscope lights. As soon as they saw Cheng Qiang coming out of the studio, they began to scream. The group members lined up in a straight line as they came out, and their path forward was very narrow since everyone was crowding in.\u201cGood luck Kaleido!!\u201d\u201cJuexia!! How are you this good looking, Juexia!\u201d\u201cXiao Pei, look at Mama\u00a0ba! He Ziyan is such a hot Ge!\u201d\u201cMiaomiao! Captain Miao is the greatest! You\u2019re the best group leader!\u201d\u201cLing Yi! Ling Yi, your blue hair looks so good! Teacher Yuan,\u00a0you\u2019re too hot!\u201dMany fans were very emotional, and the difficulty of this comeback worried them more than anyone else.Fang Juexia, who was being pushed around by the crowd, saw a girl crying noisily in front of him. His heart squeezed, and he pulled out a package of tissues from his coat pocket; he had just drawn one out when he had been wiping away his sweat moments ago. Taking advantage of being pushed to the front, Fang Juexia reached out and handed the tissue packet to the girl. His face, which had been completely expressionless up until now, smiled, and his voice was gentle as he asked, \u201cWhat are you crying for\u00a0ah?\u201cThis move made the fans all around them scream. Pei Tingsong protected him as they walked forward. \u201cAs soon as you gave out those tissues, I knew that if it were me, I would be able to cry all night to get those.\u201d The fans who heard him started to laugh again.\u201cYou are\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia didn\u2019t know what to say about him, so after speaking half a sentence, he stopped talking. When everyone got in the car, Jiang Miao rolled down the window and said to the fans with a smile, \u201cGo back quickly\u00a0ba. Remember to watch our meeting livestream\u00a0oh.\u201dSuddenly, a girl\u2019s voice appeared from the crowd; it was very loud and penetrating. \u201cOur little obscure K is the most powerful!\u201dLing Yi\u2019s head poked out of the window. \u201cWow, you have such a good voice. You should be the lead singer instead of me.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dDue to the sharp contraction in their comeback launch date, the individual member previews that had been shot previously, were all mainly broadcast in the morning, and the MV was posted at 9 p.m. Although the MV was shot in a hurry, with everyone working tirelessly to hurry the work along, the overall effect and expressiveness of the MV were all very strong.Fans forwarded it over and over again and didn\u2019t even sleep. They played the MV repeatedly on CloudTV and several other video platforms to increase the playback counts for their idols. Although this wasn\u2019t enough to let Kaleido parachute onto the Top Songs board, it was still already a big improvement over their past numbers.After Kaleido\u2019s journey of how they were even able to participate in filming the song program was revealed, the heated rampant online debate over K\u2019s comeback running into that of Seven Luminaries\u2019 grew even more heated. Most of the netizens took on the attitude of watching a good show while getting to taunt people at the same time, while the better ones showed a sympathetic attitude towards K who came from such a small company. The uglier sounding ones though, dared to say anything and everything, such as that this group that was selling rot was just getting what they deserved, that they were overstepping their ability, and some even believed that Star Chart and Kaleido had leaked the song themselves to create speculation online in order to improve the popularity of their comeback.If the whole Kaleido was up to the chin in the entire Internet\u2019s violent words, then in the very center of this violence was Fang Juexia. As before, it was still Fang Juexia. There were many anti threads about Fang Juexia in the anonymous forums, and many people, whose eyes had turned red from how Fang Juexia had continuously managed to get and stay onto the Hot Search list, while also getting onto big variety shows, took advantage of this opportunity to trample him to death.[I hope you know that FJX can never really become popular, hyped up genius characters always backfire, okay? There are so many people who are good-looking and talented, and what\u2019s the use? Big popularity depends on fate.][Who says that it was a loss for Astar not to let FJX debut? Fortunately he didn\u2019t debut with 7L, okay? A\u00a0bad luck magnet\u00a0doesn\u2019t deceive me, whoever gets involved in him will have bad luck.][If they like hype so much, maybe the leaked song was also deliberate hype][As long as FJX doesn\u2019t quit the group, obscure K will always be dead hehe]These kinds of comments had been popping up endlessly within the whole fan circle environment, and Fang Juexia had already accepted it. He just disconnected from the Internet and pretended nothing was going on. He took every stage he got to perform on as the last one and tried his very best to successfully complete the performance, while not caring about the rest in the least.It was just that no one thought that Kaleido, who had been trampled to the point that it was left nearly unable to fight back, began to actually rebound when the \u2018Music live house\u2019 was broadcast.When it was broadcast, the cover photo for the MLH push notification on CloudTV\u2019s homepage was still that of the top group Seven Luminaries, and the banner was also theirs, all in order to make them as widely acclaimed as possible. Although this program was a comprehensive network program, its viewership had always been very high, and it also boasted of a considerable audience.There were 16 performances in the whole program, as well as the subsequent awards part and the encore stage. 16 groups or individual singers would have corresponding direct videos, which were linked in the relevant sidebar of the song playing program, and then sorted in real time based on the number of views. For group performances, a camera followed each member around during their performance and recorded the performance of his or her whole song.At the beginning, no one really noticed it, and it was only after the broadcast that Fang Juexia\u2019s performance soundlessly shot to the number one most viewed direct video on that day that the trend of them bottoming out and then rebounding first appeared.At 10 p.m., after the song program was broadcasted, a verified Weibo account who specially commented on livestreams and had millions of followers, actually posted up the direct video of Fang Juexia\u2019s \u201cBreak Through\u201d.[@King MO of watching performances: As you guys know, I usually don\u2019t pay much attention to the direct videos of song programs. I always thought that no one would watch the direct videos of idols except the fans, but Fang Juexia\u2019s direct video has the highest view count for this episode of MLH. It\u2019s eight times ahead of the rest after only five hours, with a view count of more than 150,000, while the second place has just broken 20,000. I was curious, so I went in to have a look, and after I discovered the reason, and it\u2019s not too much of a boast to describe it as an immortal saving the show. I dare say that with this level of appearance, singing skills, stage expression, and adaptability, he\u2019s right up there at the ceiling of all idols. (You can not agree with this, but you can only argue about it after watching the whole direct video) PS this is Kaleido\u2019s \u2018Break Through\u2019]In addition to sharing high-quality music and excellent stage performances from home and abroad, this blogger\u2019s daily activity was to critique and attack local performances. Most of their fans were passers-by in the music circle, and it wasn\u2019t long before this Weibo post was published that it became popular.[@Study hard and make progress every day: Holy crap, King MO actually posted a direct video of an idol, they\u2019re breaking into the real world.][@My San also didn\u2019t make a comeback today: Ah, it\u2019s pretty much great minds think alike! As soon as I finished watching the performance of the junior group on CloudTV, I saw the direct video posted by Lord Mo. Fang Juexia is just too amazing in this performance, his aura is so obvious, so right in front of you, and the dance break\u2019s classical dance is so beautiful. I strongly recommend everyone to take a look at K\u2019s full performance, kneeling here and selling them!][@ Bobbi Doll: Are there any sisters who can tell me, did the mic box drop at the 2:43 timestamp? This way of dealing with that is really awesome, I went back to watch it several times. I thought that he was actually tossing some kind of weapon around x it\u2019s really the first time anyone has saved a show so beautifully.][@Sleiyoujh: Have I seen this person on the Hot Search list before? His voice is very special\u00a0ah. It\u2019s plainly a cold voice, but because it resonates well, and is both full and special, I can\u2019t really describe it, how annoying! And this singing skill, if it\u2019s all live singing, it\u2019s too strong. It\u2019s such a high-energy choreography, but he\u2019s not out of breath at all, and his high pitch is very stable.][@Beautiful Fine Jewelike Xeriscape replying to @Sleiyoujh: It was live singing\u00a0oh,\u00a0and by the way, his name is Fang Juexia, Kaleido\u2019s ace. This song was also created by the whole Kaleido group; it\u2019s their own original work, including the choreography\u00a0oh.][@To be a person means to have a dog: The tune of this song is a little familiar\u00a0ah, is it the song that got leaked a few days ago? The demo totally can\u2019t compare with the completed song at all\u00a0ah, looking at this version, the post production is too strong.][@No one wants to see your nonsense: Cold popular knowledge: Fang Juexia was a very popular trainee before he even debuted, and he was known as an overkill pick. However, he changed companies, and there was also some talk about hidden rules. People talked, but anyway, I don\u2019t believe it. With this ability, if there really was some owner in the background, wouldn\u2019t he be blazingly popular\u00a0ah? He certainly offended someone to have been so miserable this whole time. Although I\u2019m not a fan of idols, I really like this Ge\u2019s direct video.][@Small Blueberry Cheesecake: I\u2019m a classical Chinese dancer, and with one look at his solo part, I can tell he has a foundation\u00a0ah. He saved the show with barely a trace, and no matter whether the main camera was on him or not, his expression and state never relaxed, and he didn\u2019t make even a single superfluous little action. His hair was stuck all over him because of sweat, but he didn\u2019t even raise his hand to draw it back. He\u2019s very professional. Great stage attitude.][@Just telling the truth: I really want to work hard to try to analyze how excellent this performance is just like the other sisters, but I\u2019m too superficial. I\u2019m just staring at this little Gege\u2019s face the entire time, it\u2019s so beautiful\u2026]This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgSoon, the forwards on this direct video Weibo post broke through 30,000, and the entries of #Fang Juexia\u2019s direct video# and #Fang Juexia saved the show# climbed up the Hot Search list bit by bit, all under just the spontaneous power of the masses. With this sort of network effect, more and more people went to CloudTV to watch Fang Juexia\u2019s direct video and the whole group\u2019s performance video.Many entertainment bloggers and marketing accounts seized on this hot topic, creating cuts of the highlights of Fang Juexia\u2019s performance\u2014such as him saving the show, him and Pei Tingsong colliding together as part of the choreography, and the killing segment, where he gestured a gun with his hand, which was just before the movie segment, and then the final ending segment. All of these were turned into gifs and then posted on Weibo. More and more people saw and discussed them, and even many passers-by who never watched idol singing programs were attracted by these gifs.Under this joint effect, the full version of Kaleido\u2019s performance also climbed onto the Hot Search list, and even got itself reposted on major social platforms. A Chinese classical music performance mixed with electronic dance music was something unprecedented in boybands, and unexpectedly became the most popular performance that had come out of the idol circle through MLH in recent years. By the next day, all of the group\u2019s six members\u2019 direct videos had reached the top of the CloudTV\u2019s direct video list. Fang Juexia was still the highest, leading by leaps and bounds, while second place was Pei Tingsong.If they said it was Fang Juexia\u2019s attitude of being a new force that made him capable of changing the situation that led them on a counterattack out of the circle, then Pei Tingsong was the bomb that continued the counterattack\u2019s momentum and made their popularity explode.Observant people had already noticed that his rap part was different from the lyrics of the main song that had first been officially released, so they made a comparison video. Most netizens liked sharp, incisive, and conflicting things, and marvelously, Pei Tingsong was just such a person, especially when it came to his lyrics.[@Homeless Tortoise: I\u2019m inclined to think that the lyrics of this live version was a rap freshly written by Pei Tingsong after the leaked song incident. Pretty much every word is cutting\u2014\u201dHeart festering with a jealousy flare, there\u2019s still no medicine for this evil affair. The original lone forces cut a wound with due care, and drink the hot blood to live immortal and fair.\u201d You guys judge, it\u2019s starkly mocking and damning the malicious behavior caused by the leaked song. Only when I went to listen to the song did I discover that the lyrics of all the songs were basically written by him alone. I sincerely suggest everyone listen to it, but that part is only in the live performance.][@User 1234567: I almost started yelling out in front of my mom when I watched the program! He\u2019s so haughty! That last line of \u201cto lift up your heads and break the heavens bare\u201d really shocked me. The whole song is full of murderous spirit, everyone must listen to it!][@Words fail to convey meaning: Finally someone said something about the lyrics of this new song! I saw the push notification yesterday and listened to it casually, but it\u2019s really excellent\u00a0ah, they\u2019re just too much of a dark horse. My favorite was the ending, it has a very soothing melody with the words, \u201cAll my ways forward have been blown, all that is left is to wait for your ambush to be thrown.\u201d It gives off the feeling that after slaughtering everywhere, just calmly putting your sword back in its sheath.][@The beautiful Fine Jewelike Xeriscape of Putuo Temple Site: The lyrics and the music in the final part of the main song were Fang Juexia\u2019s\u00a0oh, and the middle part was Xiao Pei\u2019s. In fact, both of their two styles are very different; Pei Tingsong is very straightforward and bloodthirsty, very much with a rapper\u2019s boldness, while Juexia\u2019s lyric is very similar to his Buddhist style. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ve been forced with no ways to go, so you guys can ambush me casually\u00a0ba. I\u2019m not afraid at all.\u201d][@Crying for nearly cancelled K today again: Let\u2019s have a look at the whole stage\u00a0ba. In addition to the two beautiful aces who saved the show and created the lyrics, there\u2019s also the super lead singer Ling Yi at the beginning with the Beijing opera, group leader Jiang Miao playing the guzheng, rapper, musical arranger, and DJ He Ziyan, and the choreographer of the whole song, our main dancer, Lu Yuan. Our K may not be popular, but they are really treasure boys\u00a0ah. This song has been created with painstaking effort from each of them. It\u2019s really worth it to listen to it every three minutes!][@Severe procrastination critical patient: Didn\u2019t they say Pei Tingsong grew up abroad? Why is his Chinese ability so strong?][@Has Pinot Tree Supreme grown up today? Replying to @Severe procrastination critical patient: He has been bilingual since he was a child, and he likes Chinese traditional culture very much. They\u2019ve said all this during the livestream.]@Listening to songs makes people intelligent: \u201cJust be a wordless vase, and mess around less with real voices in place. I admit my besieged base, but let\u2019s see you after karma\u2019s grace.\u201d \u2014aren\u2019t these words really fragrant? Mocking professional idols and speaking frankly about the attacks and oppression they have received all this time. The leaked song incident almost drove them into a corner\u00a0ba. No wonder everyone says that Pei Tingsong is especially tiger-like.]With the song becoming more and more popular, several well-known music bloggers pulled out the leaked demo that had spread all over the Internet and compared it with the live completed version of the song.[@Uncle A doesn\u2019t play around with music: Since yesterday, many fans have asked me to listen to Kaleido\u2019s new song, \u201cBreak Through\u201d. I have said before that a leaked song would greatly impact the life of a song, and it can be said to be a heavy blow to the original song. But now I have to say that that\u2019s not so certain with this leaked demo. This song, \u201cBreak Through\u201d is an example of this exception. In fact, when I heard the demo, I was skeptical. The arrangement was very chaotic and the melody was too full. You just managed to create one emotion when suddenly, it changed to another arrangement and atmosphere; it was definitely not a successful work.But I was very surprised at this finished product, which cut off a lot of the melodies, which many producers won\u2019t do because they can\u2019t bear to part with it. The Beijing opera by the lead singer set the tune immediately, and the sense of arrangement is very good. After listening to it, you get the sensation of having witnessed a battle fought to life or death. It is said that this song was made by the members of K themselves. Giving a suggestion to the brokerage company: let them write their own songs in the future\u00a0ba.]The analysis and essays of music bloggers soon attracted a large number of music lovers online. It seemed like a small group, but these people were actually heavy users of online music apps. Star Chart took advantage of this opportunity to talk about promotions on the opening screen of music apps and homepages, attracting passers-by\u2019s eyes. Under this dual effect, by 10 pm the next day, after \u201cBreak Through\u201d was broadcast, it climbed from a rank in the few hundreds range to the second place at the speed of light, directly pushing Seven Luminaries\u2019 song to third place.And seeing which way the wind was blowing online, CloudTV changed the cover of their MLH program to Kaleido\u2019s \u201cBreak Through\u201d, and also changed the banner: \u201cKaleido\u2019s strong comeback and word-of-mouth counterattack.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s direct video also broke MLH\u2019s direct video record by reaching beyond one million views the fastest ever, achieving fame with victory within a single battle.This matter of bucking the trend came on too fast. Just like how Kaleido had been forced to make their comeback early in the beginning, this backlash of popularity came on just as quickly, and all because of that first action of saving the show. The small mic box, like a butterfly flapping its wings, triggered a subversive tsunami within the whole network in just two days.The contribution of each member in this song \u201cBreak Through\u201d, from its melody, arrangement, choreography, stage design, and to everyone\u2019s stage expression, won them the praise of most netizens.Plainly this had been the worst of the worst start, but in the end, it was a very successful counter-attack. The reality of the situation and the lyrics coincided perfectly, and it really became a fight against the trend.The electronic sales volume of Kaleido\u2019s new album soon caught up with that of Seven Luminaries, which possessed a huge fan base, and most of these sales were attributed to passers-by. Many people predicted that with such an increase, it would soon surpass Seven Luminaries.In order to control the public opinion, Cheng Qiang observed the way the wind was blowing online the entire time. During the process, he only screenshotted one comment and saved it in his photo album.[After watching the whole process, going from the leaked song to this instance of bucking against the trend, I learned that no matter what happens, the strength and enthusiasm of creation will never be buried. What I\u2019m very moved by is that, from these boys who were not favored by anyone, I can see what is called \u201coriginality never dies\u201d.]At this time, Fang Juexia, who was at the center of the storm, was urged by Ling Yi to login into his Weibo. He had just come back from having finished recording the third song and was resting in the dorms. Because of his fear of having his phone get stuck under the deluge of Weibo notifications every time after he logged into Weibo after a long while,, he simply let Xiao Wen login into his account every day now. This way, if one day he used Weibo himself, it wouldn\u2019t collapse as soon as he opened it.He received a lot of comments, most of which were from fans\u2019, who were calling him an immortal and using other\u00a0 such flowery words. Sliding his fingers and scrolling through, he saw a fan with a special ID.[@Has Pinot Tree Supreme been bent today: Juexia Gege, how can you sing so well\u00a0ah! Today is my birthday, and I want to hear you sing a Cantonese song. Really, really want to, no matter, now I\u2019m going to make a wish here, although I know you definitely won\u2019t see this\u2026.]Cantonese songs.Fang Juexia thought about it. Since his debut, he had never sung any Cantonese songs, whether it had been on a variety show or on a livestream. Plainly it was his own dialect, but he hadn\u2019t even sung a song in it once.Anyway, there would be solo performances by each member at the face-to-face meeting tomorrow. He had originally chosen an English song, but it would be better to change it to a Cantonese one. When he thought of it, he sent a WeChat message to Cheng Qiang. The company had always been flexible and had said beforehand that if he wanted to change it, it could be changed.So Fang Juexia sat down on the bed and opened his Cantonese songs list, ready to find a familiar song to practice for a bit.All of a sudden, he heard the sound of the guitar, playing a very familiar melody.Fang Juexia was given a start; wasn\u2019t this the song he had written?His fingers accidentally clicked on a song randomly, and a Cantonese ballad automatically started playing. Fang Juexia took off his earphones and went to the balcony. Sure enough, the sound of the guitar came from next door. Fang Juexia turned around, ready to go to the room on the opposite side. He wanted to ask Pei Tingsong why he was playing his song in the dormitory, when he suddenly stopped in his steps, realising that he didn\u2019t want Ling Yi and He Ziyan to get involved in this. He then spent two seconds calming down and opened up WeChat.[Just a pretty face and also pretty: Are you playing the song I wrote?]After a while, he received a reply.[Guide Dog: Ah, I forgot you were at home too. I wrote the lyrics, so I played a section to try it out. Do you want to see my lyrics?]This was a bit beyond Fang Juexia\u2019s expectations. Before he could reply, the other party sent another message.[Even if it\u2019s a one in ten thousand chanceYou have to tryThe spark of a flint before fallingIs enough for me to be happy until death]He didn\u2019t know why, but even though there were only four short lines, it made Fang Juexia\u2019s heart seize, and he felt as if he could see all the pores on his body shudder for an instant.The lyrics of the Cantonese song playing randomly in his earphones flowed out, and they realistically and straightforwardly beat on Fang Juexia\u2019s heart, telling him to stay where he was, and that there was no way for him to escape.His phone vibrated again, but this time it was Cheng Qiang.[Qiang Ge: By the way, I just forgot to ask you, did you choose a song? I\u2019ll go report it.]Fang Juexia sat back on his bed, clicked on the lyrics of the song currently playing using the music app\u2019s interface, and looked at them very carefully while listening to it again, despite the fact that it was a Cantonese song he was clearly very familiar with.Finally, he input the name of this ballad into the chat box and clicked send.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 62Chapter 62 \u2013 Idol SpiritTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksPlease recognize Kaleido\u2019s identity as that of idol singers.Those four lines of lyrics persistently lingered in his heart throughout that night, embracing Fang Juexia into a dream.He dreamt that he was a tree growing in a spot squeezed between cliffs and rocks. The growth process was painful, with the stones grinding against him and the cracks squeezing him, but for half a age, he was soaked in the clouds, until he was left paralyzed and nearly insensible.In his daze, a dazzling bolt of lightning struck his trunk, so he became shaky and unstable, and he just wanted to go along with the flow and fall down.But what was there after falling? There was an abyss underneath. How could the lightning, that was making its getaway, accompany the dead branches and leaves trapped at the bottom of the valley? Perhaps he could still hold onto the phantom that this silver flash left behind and continue to dream of clouds and fog coiling around him, before burning himself up in a flash of fire against dry wood, inevitably turning into ashes for the rest of his life.For some reason, Fang Juexia suddenly opened his eyes. He looked at the endless darkness in front of him and inhaled deep breaths. After waking up, he sat up in his bed, lost in a daze, for nearly half an hour. His mind slowly started to become clear, with every detail of his dream reappearing vividly, and the sensation of being completely engulfed in fire, burning, still didn\u2019t completely disappear.Fang Juexia knew that this dream was a metaphor for what was going on in his heart. He was afraid that the lightning was just playing around in life, casually causing a disaster. The tree on the cliff had no feet and had no place to hide.Kaleido continued to record programs as before once the early hours of the morning dawned. In addition to CloudTV\u2019s MLH, there were two other appearances on singing and variety shows on different platforms.It was also very realistic. Since they had gotten famous out of the entertainment circle because of their live performance, they were given a lot of preferential treatment when they took part in filming. Another platform directly shifted Kaleido into a bigger rest area, and also made a special trip to record a highlights reel for them, which was then uploaded on their video website so as to attract fans to watch the show.Kaleido\u2019s six members were still as modest as ever, bowing to every staff member on every set.After the direct videos broke out of the entertainment circle, a well-known uploader on a video website made a special reaction video while watching the first performance of \u201cBreak Through\u201d, and this reaction video\u2019s title was\u2014 [Leaked song means abandon the song? Idols have no real ability? Let\u2019s all watch the immortal live show that slapped the entire Internet\u2019s face!]This video soon appeared on the website\u2019s home page because of its super high view count and favorites. Kaleido\u2019s wonderful performance and the uploader\u2019s witty and magical reactions were all very eye-catching, and it parachuted directly into the first place in its category. The popularity of this video also set off a wave of reaction\u00a0 videos of Kaleido live stage performance on the platform, with many uploaders following suit. In addition to the performances of this comeback, there were many buried treasure performances from the past that hadn\u2019t been discovered before, and digging these up allowed more and more people to discover the true strength of this boyband.Not only that, but \u201cBreak Through\u201d also quietly grew popular in the music area, becoming a popular cover track for many cover singers. With these derivative works that achieved a win-win popularity, more and more people started to like \u201cBreak Through\u201d, a song that had nearly died due to its leaked version. Some sign of this song couldn\u2019t not appear in the popular searches of the major music sites, and the song\u2019s numbers on these music sites improved by leaps and bounds, tossing Seven Luminaries\u2019 song far behind as it came to rank first.There were great ups and downs taking place online, but Fang Juexia was still that very Fang Juexia, stable and quiet. Only when they were on stage would he shed his hard shell and release his powerful energy.It was already ten o\u2019clock in the morning by the time they got finished with work at the song program, and the fan face-to-face meeting was arranged to start at two o\u2019clock that afternoon, in a small venue that could hold 1000 people. Kaleido hurriedly took the time to change their outfits before rushing from the program\u2019s filming venue to the venue assigned for the fan meeting about the new album.Ling Yi and Lu Yuan were chatting in the car. Fang Juexia looked at Lu Yuan, who was always funny and was looking over at the countless fans gathered around the building they had been filming in. He then said something like this\u2014\u201cSo this is what it\u2019s like to be popular.\u201dAll of a sudden, Fang Juexia felt very sad. Not for himself, but for the whole group. Every one of them did not fit the parameters of a so-called \u2018orthodox idol\u2019. Some of them had missed being the champion of a talent show because of some shady insider plotting, even though they should have become a trainee in the singing department. Some of them had lost everything after they had won the championship. Some of them had a classical music background but had to choose another path to raise their younger sister. Some of them were the kind of music creators who had worked at street bars and nightclubs, but still loved music with all their heart. And some of them were rebellious, thorny birds who had broken free of one cage only to be thrown into another.Fate had gathered them together, and had allowed him, who had been branded with the label of being a failure at birth, to gain the company of such a group of companions, who supported each other in maturing together.Ling Yi\u2019s head leaned against the window. \u201cI also have a slightly unreal feeling, and I\u2019m a little confused. Maybe I\u2019ve already gotten used to our previous state\u00a0ba. From having no one watching us to having so many people supporting us, it\u2019s a bit awkward.\u201dFang Juexia smiled at them and gave a rare speech, \u201cPopularity is just a parabola, rising and then right after, declining, and whether something is popular or not is always a process. But the work and the stage are eternal, right?\u201dLing Yi nodded heavily, the rims of his eyes a little red, and he wiped his eyes and said, \u201cJuexia, you\u2019re like an adult right now.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha, he already was, okay?\u201d\u201cOnly Xiao Pei is not an adult.\u201d\u201cHey, why are you always bringing me up? I\u2019m 20 now!\u201dIn order to reward the fans standing below the stage and those who were waiting on the livestream, the starting performance had all the members in ancient costumes, and their colors were a very unified red. Before the official performance of \u201cBreak Through\u201d, there was also a one and a half minute long dance intro. Everyone\u2019s eyes were covered with two finger-width wide strips of long red gauze, which were tied behind their heads and fluttered with their movements. The music for this performance had been composed by He Ziyan, a traditional style electronic music. The dance had been choreographed by Lu Yuan, and it combined the characteristics of Chinese dance and hip-hop dance, and was both cool and sassy.At the end of the opening, everyone stepped down and changed their clothes. Other non main tracks from their album kept playing on the stage. When they stepped onto the stage again, everyone\u2019s clothes had been changed to K\u2019s support group color, Klein Blue. Pei Tingsong\u2019s white hair was matched with a blue sports hair band, while his blue sweater and white capris carried a refreshing sporty air. Fang Juexia\u2019s hair was tied into a low ponytail, leaving a wisp of hair that trailed down to his jawline. He wore a blue sweater with white trousers and a pair of silver glasses.The fans were more enthusiastic than before, and had been shouting for Kaleido the entire while they had been off-stage, and once they got on stage again, these fans yelled even harder. The host couldn\u2019t even interrupt them.It was still Jiang Miao who spoke first, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let us say something first?\u201dThe fans below the stage were immediately amused into laughing, and the atmosphere changed from the enthusiastic calls to something more relaxed.The host took the opportunity to get to the point. \u201cFirst of all, congratulations to our Kaleido for releasing their new album \u2018Break Through\u2019 and doing a formal comeback. After a year spent developing this album, what are all of your feelings on it?\u201dJiang Miao, the official spokesman, took the question and said, \u201cOf course, we are very excited. In fact, the planning process of the album was quite difficult, and this time, every one of our members participated in the production of this album, especially for the main song. This was actually a very risky thing; our role changed from being the performer who performs the song to the performer who creates the song. This change has brought great pressure on us and the companies that support us.\u201dFang Juexia listened carefully to the captain\u2019s words, and suddenly thought of their first meeting, the one that had taken place after the airport video had come out of the entertainment circle. It was right at that time that he and Pei Tingsong, without any prior consultation, had both brought up the idea of allowing them to participate in the production of the album. Now, when he thought back on it, they, in that situation, really were like\u00a0newborn calves not being afraid of tigers. He didn\u2019t know where they got their self-confidence and determination from, and they hadn\u2019t even thought about the consequences of failure; they had just wanted to try and do it themselves.\u201cThere are really very few idol groups that can create their own works. Maybe it is because of that that this song \u2018Break Through\u2019 can get such a big response.\u201d The host then asked the second question, \u201cThen was there anything interesting that happened in the creation process of this album? Can you share it with your fans?\u201d\u201cInteresting things\u2026\u201d Jiang Miao took a look at Ling Yi, and their tacit understanding made Ling Yi pick up the microphone quickly. \u201cAh, I\u2019ve thought of one. At the beginning of \u2018Break Through\u2019, what I\u2019m singing is a part from the Beijing Opera\u00a0Lady Mu Guiying Takes Command. In fact, this idea was put forward by the team leader at the meeting a year ago, but I hadn\u2019t actually sung an opera before.\u201dThe fans below laughed, and Ling Yi said, \u201cWhat are you laughing at? Do you think I\u2019m especially suitable for opera?\u201d Joking around, he added, \u201cBack then, we found a Beijing Opera teacher for me to study with for a while. Of course, the company paid for it. If you sing opera, you have to sing every day\u00a0ma,\u00a0so I sang in the dorms every day.\u201dAs his bandmate, Fang Juexia picked up the microphone at this time. \u201cLet me say for you\u00a0ba. Ling Yi was singing that day, and after singing two sentences, from the other end of the balcony, far away, an uncle\u2019s voice drifted over, and he was also singing. We were shocked at that time, and then later, we searched for the lyrics the uncle was singing and found that he was singing\u00a0The Generals of the Yang Family.\u201dThe host said with a smile, \u201cSo you guys were singing opera across the air, weren\u2019t you?\u201dLu Yuan complained, \u201cMu Guiying vs. the Yang generals.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgLing Yi added, \u201cBut I hope no one mentions me below the posts of actual Beijing opera artists. I\u2019m just putting on airs, and I can\u2019t be regarded as an opera singer. Mentioning my name will only display some ignorance and will end up causing embarrassment to you guys, so don\u2019t make me feel too ashamed either.\u201dJiang Miao nodded. \u201cYes, we must respect other people\u2019s works, and only in this way can we earn respect.\u201dHe Ziyan also chimed in, \u201cTalking about creation, actually, we were stuck on the main song\u2019s arrangement for a long time. We had made about three or four different versions of the arrangement\u00a0ba, and the composer and I had gone numb from listening to it. Later, Juexia changed the arrangement and wrote the melody for the opening and closing of the main song.\u201d He told the fans below, \u201cThe main point is, we didn\u2019t even know Juexia could compose songs before.\u201d\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cJuexia Gege is awesome!\u201dFang Juexia was originally the kind of person who would get embarrassed when people praised him, so he was already a little embarrassed right now, but then Lu Yuan just had to go ahead and add, \u201cAnd it was Xiao Pei who said that Juexia was good at writing melodies, and it was only then that the rest of us found out.\u201dThere was another uproar from below the stage, and Pei Tingsong could only explain, \u201cI found out by accident.\u201dBy accident? Fang Juexia glanced at him. Clearly, he had known that he had written a song before he had even opened the USB flash drive, so how could he have the face to say it was by accident right now?\u201cBut Juexia Ge really is so talented.\u201d Pei Tingsong looked at him and commented, \u201cHe broke all my prior understanding of talented people.\u201dThis evaluation was so high that Fang Juexia\u2019s cheeks had started to burn red. He even forgot to hold up his microphone and just turned his head towards Pei Tingsong and said, \u201cYou are more talented.\u201dAt this time, Ling Yi interjected and joked, \u201cIt\u2019s started, the segment of fanservice mutual praise.\u201dEveryone laughed again with them. After asking a few more questions, the host announced the sales volume of their new album so far. In just two and a half short days, the sales volume of the digital album had exceeded 400,000, which was completely already like a vertical line for a progress line compared to how the 60,000 of their total sales volume from their debut album and the 100,000 from their mini album.\u201cWhat\u2019s more impressive is, let\u2019s take a look at the trend of the song numbers and sales.\u201d The host gestured at the fans below to look at the line graph on the big screen. \u201cIt was relatively flat at the beginning, and then it suddenly increased at this point to reach terrible heights, and this upward trend has continued this entire time. The turning point was when our K had their first promotional live performance broadcast. \u201cThe host then asked the group members, \u201cYour performance has attracted a lot of passers-by. The song \u2018Break Through\u2019 is now the new popular BGM on short video websites, and it has also received a lot of praise. People generally think that you all have already surpassed the level of idols, and that it\u2019s even a bit of a waste to call you singers idols. What do you think of these voices?\u201dSeveral members said a lot, and in general, said that they were grateful for the praise of netizens and that they would show an even better side to everyone, but they didn\u2019t go too deep into such a topic.Fang Juexia had always been a member who didn\u2019t speak very much. Unless he was cued to, he hardly took the initiative to speak, but this time, he couldn\u2019t help himself from answering\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s an encouragement to us, of course. However, what I want to say is that the word \u2018idol\u2019 was very positive in the beginning, but because of some practical reasons, it has now been colored more negatively. It\u2019s good to be affirmed, but we really are idols\u00a0ah, and based on our performance style, this description is very accurate. Seeing that some people don\u2019t want to use such a word as \u2018idol\u2019 to describe us, my personal response is, please recognize Kaleido\u2019s identity as that of idol singers.\u201dHis eyes were very sincere. \u201cIn fact, the profession of being an idol isn\u2019t some kind of disgrace, and its existence must be valuable. I really enjoy being an idol and expressing myself on-stage. Rather than being excluded from the idol category, our dream is more that when everyone sees the word \u2018idol\u2019, they will think of us.\u201dThe applause below the stage grew more and more enthusiastic, and it was not just out of everyone in the audience loving Fang Juexia. These girls had also suffered from prejudice, and just because their idol was an idol, they were usually thrust into the bottom layer of the online social hierarchy. Even if there were many excellent people in their group, it was useless, and\u00a0 such prejudice would last forever.Upon hearing Fang Juexia\u2019s words, Pei Tingsong felt ashamed. He was proud, but not arrogant, and was brave enough to admit his initial mistakes.In the beginning, when he had just arrived at this company, he had an attitude of passive resistance when it came to engaging with this profession. Like many people with blinkers on, he had a prejudice against idols, believing that idols weren\u2019t as good as singers or hip-hop artists.He thought that these people were just singing empty songs given to them by others and dancing like beautiful puppets. He disdained to put his dream into such an empty and superficial form.But the facts had proved him wrong, and the Fang Juexia in front of him was the most vivid counterattack against this prejudice.From him, Pei Tingsong had gradually discovered the real form of an idol, which was a nearly perfect external form wrapped around a tenacious core.Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t pursuing a dream, and he had had no smooth road or a bright vision. All he had from the beginning to the end was the label of \u201ca mistake\u201d, and had faced attack, slander, darkness and loneliness. Even so, he still approached the stage step by step, feeling his way forward, crawling forward, and then running forward.Everyone had explored all kinds of spirit, with there being the hip-hop spirit, rock and roll spirit\u2026 But no one had thought that maybe idols also had a spirit.And Fang Juexia was the very projection of that idol spirit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I hope every comment you send out comes from the appreciation of the music itself. Please respect the work itself. Thank you.\u2014Under Fang Juexia\u2019s influence, Pei Tingsong had really started to love this idol identity, and had really integrated into the Kaleido group. He no longer felt the strain of his different identities clashing together, and he no longer thought that being a hip-hop artist was the only possible manifestation of his dream.He remembered what Fang Juexia had said to him when they were still clashing against each other like water and fire.[Dreams are the sort of things that can\u2019t be divided into high or low, but only realized or unrealized.]Its forms were diverse, but the unchanging core was the truth.He also had to admit that it was really wonderful to express himself on stage, especially with such a group of loving bandmates standing beside him.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Pei Tingsong raised his microphone. \u201cNow I can proudly declare to myself and to everyone else that I am a member of an idol group and am an idol.\u201dThe host gave them a look of approval. He nodded and smiled, and then told the fans, \u201cI have to reveal a little something to everyone. In fact, I am also a person they got to come at the last minute to save the show. You guys know that stars have schedules, but hosts do so as well. Originally, this meetup was going to be held in early April, and the schedule had been decided very early on. Then, suddenly, a staff member from Star Chart called me several times and asked if I could come in early, which was actually very difficult, because I was already scheduled to be at another activity tonight, but after I heard the ins and outs of the situation, I immediately agreed.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for everyone to imagine how these boys have spent these past few days. They don\u2019t even have time to eat or sleep, and they had to try their utmost to present this completed album to you and everyone.\u201d The host said with a smile, \u201cSo let\u2019s give Kaleido a little applause, OK?\u201dThe fans below the stage used their greatest enthusiasm to give back to them, and many girls even cried. He Ziyan and Lu Yuan once again came to the rescue by joking around, thereby dragging the atmosphere back up. The six people performed the album\u2019s second main hit song for everyone, which was a very light style dance music.They also showed a highlight and gag reel taken of them when they were filming their MV. This video started with Jiang Miao playing the guzheng. The cameraman asked him if the ebony guzheng was expensive, and Jiang Miao raised his head and laughed, replying that it was a bit expensive.Jiang Miao, sitting on the stage, watched and looked at the video, then picked up the microphone. \u201cThis was the first guzheng that I saved money to buy after my debut. It took me a long time to save enough money to buy it.\u201dThe fans below yelled his name, and Lu Yuan said with a smile, \u201cMiao Ge takes care to maintain this guzheng every morning, it\u2019s like his treasured baby.\u201dSoon, the image on the screen changed, and they came to the desert park. He Ziyan pointed at the big screen with a smile and asked, \u201cDoes this look very much like a desert?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s actually a desert park,\u201d Ling Yi pretended to be angry, complaining, \u201cHmph, we didn\u2019t get to go to Xinjiang like we planned.\u201dThe highlight reel showed He Ziyan and Lu Yuan fighting each other with two fake swords in the middle of the desert. Originally, their handsomeness was enough to prompt the fans into screaming, but suddenly, when Ling Yi was heard shouting madly from outside the picture, everyone couldn\u2019t help but start laughing.\u201cLing Yi,\u201d He Ziyan pressed his head. \u201cTime-out warning.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dWhile laughing, Pei Tingsong\u2019s highlight reel appeared on the big screen, the one showing him doing the promotional photo shoot for the album, which immediately triggered screams from below.\u201cAh, Xiao Pei! Xiao Pei is so hot!\u201d\u201cOh, my God, how is Pinot Tree Supreme this hot?\u201dPei Tingsong shamelessly accepted the praise, then turned around halfway while stretching out a hand to make a gesture for them to quiet down, \u201cAlright, alright, I know I\u2019m very hot.\u201dWho knew that suddenly the screams would grow louder, nearly overturning the roof of the hall. Only then did Pei Tingsong turn his head to look at the scene currently on the screen, which was him half-embracing Fang Juexia while performing archery on the horse. There was also a line printed below \u2014 this picture was taken by a staff member\u2019s cellphone.Fang Juexia, who was shocked by the screams, turned around to see the scene of Pei Tingsong teaching him archery from another perspective. He fell into a trance after seeing that, uneasily licked his lips, then turned his head away, just to exactly collide with Pei Tingsong\u2019s gaze.He saw the light and shadows on Pei Tingsong\u2019s face, and the corner of his mouth that was quirked up.The tide boiling around them were actually unaware of the truth. As he fell into this frothy whirlpool, Fang Juexia became more and more aware that he could only be a performer on the stage; he wasn\u2019t a good actor. Clearly, this was a play being staged for everyone, and both sides were standing beside each other either for their own or the group\u2019s interests, and even if they were standing shoulder to shoulder, their hearts were so very far away. Thus, they had to camouflage themselves, had to appear to be hand in glove with each other, and at worst, had to look like a pair of bros who had never been estranged.However, by the end of performing this play, who had actually entered this play.Fang Juexia was really confused.When the highlight reel on the screen ended, the host told the fans who were still excited, \u201cKaleido recorded a lot of wonderful highlight clips and gags in the process of preparing the album. This was only a small part, and the rest of it can be seen by everyone on the ensemble show.\u201dLu Yuan couldn\u2019t help but give him a thumb\u2019s up. \u201cThe host is too on track.\u201dThe host laughed. \u201cOkay, so next is the performance time. For this meetup for the new album that they have been working on for a year, each of the six members of Kaleido have specially prepared solo performances for you all. Taking the lead, the first one to bring us a performance is Captain Jiang Miao, who will play \u2018Spring on Snow Mountain\u2019 for everyone.\u201dEveryone exited the stage together, and the closer they got to the backstage, the darker the area became. Pei Tingsong was originally walking behind Fang Juexia, but he deliberately quickened his pace to come to position in front of him, with his back very close to him. In this way, he could help Fang Juexia by leading the way.Only when they had completely left the stage and couldn\u2019t see anything below it anymore did Pei Tingsong grab his arm. He had changed. Originally, he could recklessly act out intimate scenes in front of the audience, but now that he knew he really liked Fang Juexia, he felt guilty about this dazzling fanservice play. He would rather hide it from public view than treat it more carefully and sincerely.\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Fang Juexia said in a low voice, \u201cYou\u2019re being a little obvious like this.\u201d\u201cObvious about what?\u201d Pei Tingsong leaned close to his ear. \u201cObvious that I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll fall, or obvious that I like you?\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s heart beat so fast it felt like it was flying, but he still stared straight right back at him, looking a little surprised and also a little angry. Pei Tingsong thought he looked cute like this, but he didn\u2019t dare to engage with him anymore. He could only just adjust the proper limits of his speech and say, \u201cI\u2019m kidding.\u201dBut Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t angry, and he didn\u2019t feel angry. Listening to the song being played on the stage, he felt like he was some kind of hibernating and dormant creature living in the snow, his rigid body wrapped in cold scales. This was the norm for him, and it conformed with the rules. Yet now, before the snow could melt away, he had changed first.He couldn\u2019t change, he had to be that cold-blooded animal, otherwise, how could he continue living?Spring was short-lived.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgHe was afraid that spring was short-lived.The sounds of the guzheng were like melting snow, and the strings vibrated slightly as they were teased. Pei Tingsong quietly changed the topic. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be on stage soon? I heard you changed your song.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes drifted down, and he looked at the floor, at the boundary of shadows between the stage and the backstage.\u201cWhat song did you switch to?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked.Fang Juexia lowered his head and only upon seeing that several staff members had moved a white piano to the corner of the stage did he say, \u201cYou\u2019ll hear it soon.\u201dThe strings of the guzheng fell on the last note, and amidst the cheers, the host called out Fang Juexia\u2019s name.\u201cThen I\u2026 will pretend that you\u2019re singing it for me.\u201d Right before Fang Juexia stepped onto the stage, Pei Tingsong whispered such a sentence to him.Fang Juexia inhaled deeply, then walked towards the stage without looking back. He sat in front of the piano, adjusted the microphone, looked at the fans, and his voice was gentle as he spoke, \u201cI heard you guys really wanted to hear me sing a Cantonese song.\u201d\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201d\u201cA Cantonese song!! It\u2019s really a Cantonese song!\u201dListening to the cries of the fans, Fang Juexia smiled, placed his slender fingers on top of the piano keys, and drew in a deep breath.\u201cThis song, \u2018Bewitchment\u2019, is for you all.\u201dThe sound of the piano was as gentle as water, and Fang Juexia lowered his head slightly, getting close to the microphone. \u201cDon\u2019t call me too grateful to you, the color of this medicine is exquisite beyond compare.\u201d His voice was still special, but had been infected with more emotions than usual, and now, he no longer was someone who broke away to tell someone else\u2019s story. \u201cDon\u2019t let me taste this fare, numb with pleasure through.\u201dFang Juexia was an established skilled singer, but this was the first time everyone had heard him sing a Cantonese song. It was just that it wasn\u2019t clear to everyone that he wasn\u2019t using any skills to sing this song, for this wasn\u2019t him singing a song, it was practically his own inner monologue.Last night\u2019s coincidence had allowed this song to pop up, and every word beat against his heart.\u201cWhy move me? It\u2019s hard for me to get used to, and waiting for me is minimal pain.\u201d The ending note, held for a long moment, trembled a bit, carrying within it a fragility that Fang Juexia had never had before. Every time he sang a line, it was like he was asking him.\u201cFear what? Fearing loving someone. Holding on to my emotions, always sensitive when I receive a gift.\u201cFear what? Fearing getting used to risking everything to love someone. But I don\u2019t know how to go on, so that after this vacation it\u2019ll become true.\u201dHearing this, Pei Tingsong, who was standing at the side of the stage, was stunned.The accompaniment music started to play on the stage, and Fang Juexia took the microphone off the stand, stood up, left the piano, and walked to the center of the stage, closer to the fans. His voice was shaking a bit, which was very abnormal for him, a professional idol who had been training for many years.Fang Juexia adjusted his breath, then opened his mouth and began to sing the song again.Pei Tingsong had heard this song before. He liked to study\u00a0 lyrics, and he had listened to many famous Chinese works, among which \u2018Bewitchment\u2019 was also one. When he heard Fang Juexia sing, \u201cAfraid of getting used to risking everything to love someone,\u201d his first reaction was heartache.He knew how hard it was for Fang Juexia to accept a relationship. Fang Juexia lived by rules, and refusing love was one of the rules he abided by.What a struggle it was to overthrow the rules established by oneself.\u201cFear what? Fearing being bewitched. Holding on to my emotions, have to be careful, afraid of losing my heart.\u201dStanding in the center of the stage, Fang Juexia really peeled off his shell for the first time, and it was not the shell that resisted the outside world, but the one that was wrapped around all his emotions.\u201cLove what?\u201dHe pierced himself, letting his emotions flow out into the song, \u201cLove makes me dare to repay too many people.\u201cBut I don\u2019t know how to escape with my life.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Pei Tingsong was the only exception. Fang Juexia knew that he should respond, but he was also afraid of responding. At least by singing this song out loud, it could count as being a kind of answer.He was just like a bee that had fallen into a honeypot and was now completely wrapped up in sweet honey, and was now both happy and frightened. Emotionally, he had sampled and tasted an unprecedented delicacy, but his intellect warned him about the possibility of drowning.Pei Tingsong and He Ziyan\u2019s performance followed his, so after he finished singing his song, they didn\u2019t even have time for a hug. This was just their job. Fang Juexia even felt guilty; this was the first time that he had indulged in his own selfish motives while working and had expressed his private emotions in front of so many people. He shouldn\u2019t have done it, but he had inevitably fallen into doing so.He had fallen into a spring day, one that he had never seen before, and he tried to get it to keep him. But it seemed very likely that he wouldn\u2019t even be able to keep his own pool of snow.Ling Yi half lay on his shoulder. \u201cI feel like Xiao Pei isn\u2019t quite in the right state\u00a0ah.\u201dStrictly speaking, this performance didn\u2019t count as being a solo performance, but He Ziyan and Pei Tingsong had combined their acts, one acting as the DJ, and the other as the rapper.Lu Yuan also chimed in, \u201cI too think so, he\u2019s usually more explosive. I can\u2019t say what\u2019s wrong today, but other people can\u2019t tell, so it\u2019s fine.\u201dJiang Miao took a look at Fang Juexia, then at the people on the stage.\u201cEveryone has been tired recently, it\u2019s impossible to be in a good state all the time.\u201d Jiang Miao patted Fang Juexia on the shoulder. \u201cAfter we get through the promotional performances, we\u2019ll be good.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s eyes drifted towards the people on stage just like that. He was a little confused, and kept wondering if Pei Tingsong had understood the meaning of his song, and if that was why he was feeling a bit frustrated on-stage right now. However, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t want him to be like that. He liked Pei Tingsong\u2019s confidence and magnanimity, and he wanted Pei Tingsong to be like that forever.\u201cThank you, He Ziyan and Pei Tingsong. Everyone, please give them the warmest applause! Who\u2019s next?\u201dAmidst the voice of the host, Pei Tingsong stepped down from the stage and approached Fang Juexia step by step. To be honest, Fang Juexia was very uneasy, and he had even imagined many embarrassing scenarios for this situation in his mind. However, Pei Tingsong just came to a stand beside him, standing with him side by side, maintaining only a distance of about 15 cm between them. Only after Ling Yi went on-stage did he speak in a low voice.\u201cI\u2019m a little tired, and I don\u2019t even have anything to lean on here.\u201dFang Juexia was puzzled by his sudden statement and turned his face to look at him. Pei Tingsong also turned his head. \u201cCan I hold you for a bit?\u201dIt was like this every time; clearly, the person who needed to be held was himself, but Pei Tingsong would come up with a good excuse and regain the initiative, efficiently taking charge. He looked fiercely aggressive, but after his confession, even physical contact between them had been reduced as much as possible, unless Fang Juexia\u2019s consent was sought beforehand. Pei Tingsong had expressed himself straight-forwardly and actively, but his actions gave Fang Juexia enough respect.Only after realising that things were just like this did Fang Juexia understand that he had no way to hide.The silence between them allowed time to stretch as if in slow-motion, prolonging everything, and making every minute miserable. From the first time that he had confirmed that he liked Fang Juexia, Pei Tingsong had already anticipated the difficulty of the pursuit. Wasn\u2019t it just like his risky escapades in \u2018Escape For Your Life,\u2019 didn\u2019t he already know that he would probably fail? Of course he knew that, but there was always a slight chance of success.Without waiting for Fang Juexia\u2019s answer, he wanted to go ahead and say \u2018forget it\u2019. He hung his head down and prepared to give him some room while he went to find someone else to talk to, but at the next moment, Fang Juexia turned to face him.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia was a little embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m too thin. It shouldn\u2019t feel very comfortable holding me.\u201dPei Tingsong suddenly came back to life. He saw the uneasy expression on Fang Juexia\u2019s face and his arms that were stuck somewhere between stretching out and not stretching out, and he felt that he was the happiest person in the whole world at this moment.Having gained Fang Juexia\u2019s permission, he immediately hugged him and put his chin on his shoulder, acting completely like a satisfied large dog. Fang Juexia liked the feeling of Pei Tingsong pressing his weight onto himself; it sort of exuded the feeling of being depended on and trusted.\u201cWho says it\u2019s uncomfortable? You were deceiving me.\u201dPei Tingsong buried his head and tightened his arms. \u201cClearly, it\u2019s very comfortable.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t know what to say. He turned his head to see He Ziyan laughing at this.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Xiao Pei? He\u2019s so weak after singing only one whole song\u00a0ah,\u201d He Ziyan continued joking, \u201c20 years old, and he\u2019s still a big spoiled child who wants a cuddle.\u201dPei Tingsong didn\u2019t look up, simply raising up a hand in He Ziyan\u2019s direction and sticking out a middle finger.Fang Juexia raised his hand and rubbed his back. They communicated with each other in silence and completed their conversation with a simple hug. It had taken him too much courage to sing that song, and it had made him directly face the uneasiness and disquiet that existed in his heart, but right now, his heart seemed to have calmed down and restored its equilibrium in Pei Tingsong\u2019s arms.As the ending of this meetup neared, the six members went on-stage together and sang a non-main song from their debut album, which was a very happy song. They were also forced to start providing cute fanservice. Each one of them was wearing a hairband with plush ears on top. Fang Juexia\u2019s ears were rabbit ears while Pei Tingsong\u2019s were gray wolf ears. They carried a small basket containing some small gifts in their hands. These were some little doll versions of the Kaleido members, some snacks, and official printed song lyrics cards.While singing, everyone scattered the gifts in the small basket into the crowd. The scene suddenly became noisy, and all the fans in the front row grew very excited. Lu Yuan and Ling Yi, in particular, skipped around the whole place, shaking hands with the fans in the front row nearest to the stage.After he finished singing his part, Fang Juexia adjusted his earpiece and looked at the fans in the back row. He then picked out the soft dolls from his small basket and went as far to the edge of the stage as possible, trying hard to throw the small dolls further away so that the fans in the back row could get them.\u201cAhhhhhhhh! Juexia Gege!\u201d\u201cJuexia Gege, look at me! Here!\u201dA lot of hands stretched out towards the edge of the stage, and Fang Juexia instinctually took a step back. After throwing all the dolls out, he crouched down and sprinkled the candy gently to the front rows.\u201cJuexia Gege!!\u201d\u201cI also want some!\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t leave Fang Juexia. While rapping out his part, he walked over to Fang Juexia. Coincidentally, with the end of this rap came the harmony part between them, with one high and one low. Fang Juexia\u2019s basket had already been emptied out by this time, but the fans were like a flock of hungry little birds. Even if he turned the basket upside down, they still kept calling out his name. Fang Juexia looked back and saw Pei Tingsong behind him, so he wanted to take some things from his basket.Looking at the way Fang Juexia was crouched near the edge and stretching out his hands, Pei Tingsong thought that he was so cute that he was about to die from it. However, just at this time, he saw a pair of hands grab Fang Juexia\u2019s arm and violently drag him down, catching him completely off guard.Those didn\u2019t look like a girl\u2019s hands.Fang Juexia was shocked and started to fall back. Pei Tingsong hurried up and pulled Fang Juexia back towards the stage. However, at that same moment, those surprise-attacking hands released Fang Juexia to go and grasp at Pei Tingsong\u2019s elbow. Pei Tingsong\u2019s center of gravity was already tilting forward when he rushed over, and so, with this, he directly fell off the stage.\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cPei Tingsong fell down!\u201d\u201cMy God!\u201dThe scene below the stage burst into an uproar, and Fang Juexia, who had already been shocked, upon seeing Pei Tingsong fall down, felt as if his brain had exploded with a buzzing sound.How could this happen\u2026Without thinking about it, Fang Juexia directly jumped off the stage. \u201cYou guys get out of the way a bit! Don\u2019t step on him.\u201d He used his own body to protect Pei Tingsong, and was pushed into half-kneeling on the ground. The backs of his hands, which were on the ground, were stepped on several times in the confusion, but he couldn\u2019t feel it at all.His mind was just full of Pei Tingsong.The security guards came from both ends of the stage to separate the fans from them. Although the height of this stage wasn\u2019t that high, Pei Tingsong had fallen down due to an external force and had landed pretty hard. The other members also immediately rushed over, but were stopped by the security and staff members. A big incident had already occured, and the other artists couldn\u2019t encounter any more accidents.The ringing in Fang Juexia\u2019s ears continued; he couldn\u2019t hear anything at all, as if he had fallen into the deep sea. He couldn\u2019t control his eyes, and they burned and felt sore. He whispered Pei Tingsong\u2019s name in the noisy stadium, over and over again.The one who should have fallen was clearly himself, not Pei Tingsong.Pei Tingsong hadn\u2019t lost consciousness, and he also put his head on Fang Juexia\u2019s leg, as if to stop him from worrying anymore. The event was suspended after this accident took place, and Pei Tingsong was rushed to the hospital, with all of the group members going with him.Fang Juexia\u2019s hands kept trembling the entire time he spent sitting in the car. He had seen that Pei Tingsong\u2019s forehead and cheekbones were bruised from the fall, his wound had been bleeding, his eyebrows had been furrowed tight, and his forehead had been sweating. Just thinking about it made Fang Juexia feel pained, and his heart was currently hanging in midair, bumping and colliding against his chest back and forth.If only he hadn\u2019t gotten close to the edge of the stage, if only Pei Tingsong hadn\u2019t reached out and pulled him back.If he had been the one to fall, Fang Juexia actually wouldn\u2019t be this upset.As if seeing his worry, Pei Tingsong stretched out a hand, shook Fang Juexia\u2019s hand, and put up a smiling face.Seeing his weak smile made Fang Juexia feel even worse. His nose stung, and his eyes were sore.His self-protection mechanisms had, early on, made him learn that he should not look at any external evaluations of him, nor take any of it to heart. But now, Fang Juexia actually thought back to those anonymous people cursing him out, commenting that he was a disaster magnet, and that anyone who came near him would become unlucky.Logically thinking, these kinds of words, which were full of flaws and had no scientific basis, were worthless of being analyzed by him. However, after seeing Pei Tingsong get injured on his behalf, Fang Juexia, for the very first time, truly grew afraid that the other people\u2019s cursing words had really come true.When they got to the hospital, Cheng Qiang answered the phone, and his face grew grim. After hanging up, he told them, \u201cThis situation isn\u2019t quite right. Originally, we thought it was a stage accident caused because of the fans\u2019 excitement, but now it doesn\u2019t look like that. The security guard who had been closest to the two of them reported to their venue director that he saw that the person who dragged Xiao Pei down wasn\u2019t a fan.\u201dFang Juexia immediately added, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a girl. They were very strong, and they were very violent when taking action; it should be a man.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re going to check the surveillance now, and with a little effort, they will definitely find them.\u201d Cheng Qiang was very angry and cursed several times. \u201cWe must send this grandson to prison, he intended to harm him, I\u2019m not even going to sue him!\u201d\u201cWas it an anti-fan?\u201d Ling Yi guessed.He Ziyan had some doubts. \u201cThe tickets for the meetup weren\u2019t given out casually; all the people there bought the album and then got the ticket through a lottery, so the chances of that happening aren\u2019t high.\u201dPei Tingsong was sent in to get examined, and they had to wait outside for the results.Ling Yi was a little bit afraid. \u201cI was also on the edge of the stage just now\u2026\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t understand; there had been so many people and the other members had also been at the edge of the stage at the time, but only his hand was grabbed, and it seemed premeditated. If Pei Tingsong hadn\u2019t appeared at that time, he would have been the one who had fallen down just now. If that person had taken any other further actions after that, he might have even gotten seriously injured.It couldn\u2019t still be Astar?\u201cI feel like they came for me.\u201d Fang Juexia explained the situation to Cheng Qiang. After hearing this, Cheng Qiang pondered for a while. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible it was vicious competition. The means within this circle are very dirty; a little actor I used to know had just gotten popular when, while filming a movie, someone did something and broke his leg and hand. The golden time for signing a contract on the film was gone just like that, and then he faded away quietly after that.\u201dJiang Miao sighed. \u201cI actually thought it was a stalker fan.\u201d\u201cAll of it will happen.\u201d Cheng Qiang gave them a shot of reality. \u201cBefore, you weren\u2019t popular enough, and many things were still very simple. Now that you are popular, the people and things you meet will all become more complicated. Stalker fans, antis, all kinds of slanders, traps, and even fanatical fans won\u2019t be absent from your lives. The company will do its best to protect you guys, and you guys should also protect yourselves. Learn to keep your distance.\u201dCheng Qiang kept getting calls one after another. Due to the livestream, the news about the stage accident quickly fermented online, and the entry titled \u2018Pei Tingsong falls from the stage\u2019 soon appeared on the Hot Search list. He had to immediately arrange for people to keep an eye on public opinion to avoid anyone from seizing a pretext to distort the situation. The Internet was so absurd; even if you were the victim, after going through the sewage online, you could end up becoming the target of public criticism, and there would be no way left to talk your way out of it at that point.\u201cThe company has just already transferred some personnel over. Security isn\u2019t a trivial matter, and we will arrange more than six bodyguards in the future, with each person having at least one security personnel to protect them.\u201dThe doctor who did the examination opened the door and came out to communicate with Cheng Qiang. \u201cThe patient has contusions on his forehead, cheekbones, elbows, and knees. He has sustained a mild concussion from the impact and needs rest. More troublesome is the patient\u2019s carpal bone fracture on his left wrist; it may have occurred when he was trying to support himself with his wrists when he fell, and it\u2019s more serious, so\u00a0 we need to do a minor operation.\u201dAn operation.Fang Juexia was not as calm as usual after hearing this. \u201cThen how long will it take to get better? Will it affect the use of his hands in the future?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d the doctor repeated, \u201cIt\u2019s a minor operation. It will just take about three to four weeks to recover from it.\u201dAfter a quick explanation, the doctor began to prepare for the operation. There were very few people in the private hospital, and all of them waited in the waiting room. The accident had happened so suddenly, and Cheng Qiang\u2019s workload had also increased suddenly. After repeatedly checking the official Weibo announcement, he arranged for someone to post it. After receiving a phone call, he stood up and said to the members, \u201cXiao Wen has come with the newly arranged security personnel, and they\u2019re just downstairs. For today, let\u2019s all go back and have a good rest. I\u2019ll coordinate with CloudTV about tomorrow morning\u2019s performance, and we\u2019ll push it back by a day.\u201dEveryone stood up, but Fang Juexia didn\u2019t move. He raised his head. \u201cQiang Ge, I\u2019ll stay\u00a0ba. You have so many things to deal with, you go back to the company first.\u201dCheng Qiang was not at ease. \u201cThat won\u2019t work, you have to go back to rest now.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t rest well now.\u201d Fang Juexia looked at him and said, \u201cXiao Pei was dragged down because he came to save me.\u201dCheng Qiang knew Fang Juexia\u2019s character very well, and was clearly aware that he was a child who liked to take all responsibilities onto his shoulders. \u201cI can let you stay, but I will arrange for several staff members to wait for you guys outside. Let them know if you need help, but don\u2019t blame yourself.\u201dLing Yi also couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cYes\u00a0ah, Juexia, it\u2019s not like this is something you did.\u201dThe other members came to comfort him, and Fang Juexia smiled. \u201cI know. You guys go back quickly\u00a0ba, and rest early. If anything happens, I\u2019ll call you as soon as I can.\u201dNo one could out-stubborn him, so Cheng Qiang had to arrange for a few people to come over and stand guard outside the waiting room. After they all left, the room was quiet.Fang Juexia sat on the sofa in silence, waiting for the operation to end. The hands of the clock in his heart turned around and around, ticking away, allowing him to gradually recover his calm. But no matter how calm he got, as long as he closed his eyes, that moment of Pei Tingsong falling off the stage, with the bustling crowd and the scattered candy all over the ground, would always appear.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgObjectively the operation didn\u2019t take a very long time, but in Fang Juexia\u2019s mind, it seemed that a long, long time had passed by before the door of the waiting room was finally opened and a nurse came to inform him, \u201cThe patient\u2019s operation has been completed, and he has now been transferred to a single ward.\u201d\u201cIs he all right?\u201d Fang Juexia stood up.\u201cHe\u2019s fine, but he has a cast on his hand, so it may not be very easy to move around.\u201dFang Juexia let out a breath and followed the nurse to the single room located in the VIP suite. Pei Tingsong lay quietly in a bed with his eyes closed.\u201cIs he in a stupor?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d The nurse replied, \u201cThe operation was performed under only local anesthesia, but he seemed very tired and fell asleep.\u201dFang Juexia nodded and sat beside the bed.\u201cThe patient may have a headache and tinnitus after waking up, and these are all after-effects of a minor concussion. If there are any other symptoms, please call us.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you.\u201dThe nurse closed the door, and the room immediately grew quiet. Fang Juexia looked at Pei Tingsong, who was asleep. The wound on his face was wrapped in gauze and his left wrist was in a cast.He was already this old, but this was the first time his heart had ached for someone like this. Fang Juexia even started to suspect whether he and Pei Tingsong were fated to always live in conflict; almost all injuries that Pei Tingsong had suffered, be it big and small, were caused by him. He thought of how after his solo performance, Pei Tingsong had even acted coquettish and he had let him hold him, and now Pei Tingsong was suddenly injured and lying in bed.How painful a fracture must be\u00a0ah.Contemplating all this made Fang Juexia\u2019s nose sting. He stretched out his hand and rubbed the plaster on Pei Tingsong\u2019s wrist. His fingertips slowly moved forward along the plaster and touched the back half of his hand that was exposed under the plaster. The raised joints of his fingers gently covered Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand.His fingertips rubbed against the warm skin, and unconsciously, their fingers intertwined together.His heart was aching and tightening all over.It turned out that he likes this person so much.His intertwined fingers started to retract from the grasp, but before they could, they were caught by the clenched hand, retaining and buckling down on the ten fingers that had almost escaped.He was awake?Fang Juexia got up and looked at Pei Tingsong. He saw that Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes were still closed, but the corners of his mouth had quirked up. He was pretending to be asleep, but he wasn\u2019t succeeding at it at all.\u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dFang Juexia was not in the mood to joke with him. \u201cAre you okay? Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere? Does your head really hurt? Do you want me to call the doctor?\u201d\u201cYou are being so frantic that people who didn\u2019t know what was going on would think that I\u2019ve been seriously injured.\u201d Pei Tingsong opened his eyes and laughed at him. \u201cI\u2019m okay, just a little dizzy. I want to sit up.\u201dFang Juexia hurried to help him adjust the bed so that he could lean against the pillows. He clearly had a lot to say, but when he saw Pei Tingsong really awake, he couldn\u2019t utter a word. Pei Tingsong just looked at him being like this, and being watched by him like this made Fang Juexia lower his eyes. His throat was blocked for a long time before he said with difficulty, \u201cTomorrow\u2026. we don\u2019t have to go singing tomorrow morning. It\u2019s been delayed by a day.\u201dAs soon as he said that, he regretted it. There were clearly so many other things he could have said, why did he have to just choose this particular sentence? Even at this time, he was actually still talking about work, just like a fool.Suddenly he heard a soft laugh. Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice was very gentle when he asked, \u201cDid this really scare you?\u201dFang Juexia raised his eyes. As soon as he met his gaze, he looked away again, curled his lips, and didn\u2019t say anything again.Pei Tingsong spoke up, looking out for himself, \u201cGuess what? When I had just fallen asleep now, I dreamt that you sang for me again. It was that song you sang during the day. I heard it again, it\u2019s really nice.\u201dSaying that, he then looked at Fang Juexia and asked, \u201cYou sang that song for me, right?\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t deny it, tacitly agreeing with him.Maybe, he didn\u2019t sing it just for Pei Tingsong, but also for himself.\u201cDid I scare you?\u201d He asked the question again, but this time, he added himself as a subject to it.Fang Juexia was not a person who was used to scrutinizing other people\u2019s words, but with Pei Tingsong, he could quickly realize the emotions conveyed through subtle details.\u201cNo.\u201dPei Tingsong smiled. \u201cAt first, I thought that love was the same as many other things. As long as I want it, I would definitely be able to obtain it. To tell you the truth, I\u2019m also afraid that my pursuit will cause trouble for you. Whenever I say a single word, I\u2019ll also repeatedly struggle to control myself to stay within the bounds of propriety.\u201dHe looked at Fang Juexia. \u201cI can\u2019t help it, this is also the first time I\u2019ve ever liked someone.\u201dFang Juexia suddenly felt uncomfortable. Sometimes, because of Pei Tingsong\u2019s boldness and bravery, he would forget that this person was actually a boy younger than himself. This boy had carelessly dug his heart out and had shown it to him, but he didn\u2019t even have the courage to look at it. He just hid inside his shell and calculated the probability of failure.\u201cI know,\u201d Pei Tingsong continued, \u201cI don\u2019t seem to be a person who can give off a sense of safety. But I hope you understand that I am pursuing you this way because I am just such a person, not because it\u2019s some frivolous quick decision on my part.\u201d\u201cI have never questioned your sincerity.\u201d Fang Juexia looked down. \u201cNever.\u201d\u201cThen raise your head and look at me.\u201dFang Juexia raised his head and looked at him.Pei Tingsong\u2019s face was pale, but his pupils were very bright. \u201cFang Juexia, the world is really rotten. Disaster, war, disease, unrest, verbal violence, and endless harm and suffering keep plaguing people. Everything around us is absurd and fragile. I\u2019m an out-and-out rebel against this philosophy, and I despise trying to integrate with this society. Yes, the rules of life in this society force us to converge, and only by keeping the same values and behavior as most people can we live a better life. But I hate this kind of life.\u201cI only believe in myself, and I want to break away from all the rules to find my \u2018self\u2019. So I\u2019m arrogant, I\u2019m overbearing, and I only have myself and the so-called freedom I want to pursue in my eyes.\u201cBut now, I find that it turns out that I also have something that I want to draw close to and converge with.\u201d He looked at Fang Juexia. \u201cIt\u2019s you. I want to be close to you, to understand your values, your outlook on life, and to be a gentle and powerful person like you.\u201dFang Juexia was a little dazed. He could only look into Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes and see the light trembling within them.\u201cBut I\u2019m not as good as you think.\u201d\u201cYou are.\u201d Pei Tingsong retorted without any scruples, \u201cYou just don\u2019t know how good you are. As long as you smile at me, I can refute myself, and in fact, will believe that this world can be saved. You\u2019re so good that you made a rebel give up on his resistance.\u201dHe took Fang Juexia\u2019s hand in his right hand and said, \u201cYou are the first person who has ever moved my heart. If you don\u2019t have any feelings for me at all, I can be like most of the other useless people in this world, liking someone without uttering a word. I can also hide from and avoid you and be an ordinary bandmate with you just like Ling Yi and them. But you obviously also like me, and I can\u2019t just let you go like that.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s tone was so firm, firm to the point that Fang Juexia had no strength left at all to refute him. He had to admit that Pei Tingsong was right. He was afraid; he was afraid that he would plunge head-first into it, but then in the end, he would be the only one left. He was afraid that he really was a hopeless romantic, just like his mother, and would become a withered grass who would spend his whole life awaiting that one short spring.He issued a final resistance on his part. \u201cWe might not have a good ending.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want an ending, I want right now.\u201d Pei Tingsong held his hand tightly. \u201cPeople who are born will all die, and all of our endings are death. But because it is just like that, do you give up on life? I don\u2019t want to lose my long cherished goal simply because of some value of calculated probability of failure, I want to live every heart-stopping moment of it.\u201cYou just need to tell me, do you like me or do you not like me?\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s reason once again activated his protection mechanisms. He should refuse and keep silent; he had countless plans to protect himself and provide the tiniest bit of space for the two of them to turn back.He really did have all these.But Fang Juexia raised his head and looked straight into Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes, his whole being like a withered branch that was about to be broken.\u201cI like you.\u201dOnly upon breaking the moment did he find the last bit of his vigor.\u201cPei Tingsong, I like you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Yet, he was saved by this. For so many days, the push and pull of infatuation and shrinking away had almost torn him apart. He had immersed himself in a glacier of logic, but his heart had just wanted to jump into the boiling molten lava that was Pei Tingsong\u2019s crazy love.Everything will eventually come to an end, and it was still the heart that gets the final say.Pei Tingsong almost thought that he had heard wrong; he had thought that no matter how long he waited, he wouldn\u2019t get an answer. The heap of nonsense he had just blurted out even made him feel ashamed; it had been complete nonsense with no order at all, but then he had actually gotten an answer.Doubt followed the second after the initial ecstasy. He was afraid that Fang Juexia would follow this up with a \u201cbut\u201d, as if this was just another form of rejection. So he couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cYou\u2026are you telling the truth?\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t expect suspicion. \u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t make a mistake? It\u2019s not because I got hurt, and you feel bad for me and want to coax me, or because you just have friendly feelings towards me\u2026\u201d\u201cPei Tingsong.\u201d Fang Juexia once again called out his whole name, and in a tone both sincere and serious stated, \u201cAlthough I have no experience, I am an adult capable of independent thought. Sympathy, goodwill, curiosity, friendship, gratitude, and the like; these emotions are not so difficult for me to classify. I have separated them very clearly, and when it comes to you\u2026\u201dI just like you.These remaining four words were swallowed back at the critical moment. Fang Juexia suddenly felt that he had also been affected by this person, since he seemed to have also become so direct.\u201cSumming it all up, what I just said is true,\u201d Fang Juexia added in a low voice, dropping his eyes downwards, \u201cAnd I even said it twice.\u201dSaying that he liked him twice, confessing and then confirming again.Hearing this, Pei Tingsong nearly lost his head from the ecstasy that erupted within him. He hated that he couldn\u2019t just directly jump onto Fang Juexia, for as soon as he moved a little bit, Fang Juexia pushed him back down onto the bed. \u201cDon\u2019t move around.\u201dPei Tingsong was a little aggrieved. \u201cYou even admitted that you like me, so can\u2019t you hold me?\u201dThis question being asked immediately pinpointed a blind area in Fang Juexia\u2019s knowledge. It had already cost him all his courage to utter the affections that he had been hiding, and now it became even more difficult for him to just face Pei Tingsong. \u201cThen\u2014 then do I need to hug you right after saying it? And you are injured, you have to be careful.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of injury is this?\u201d Pei Tingsong, in order to show off how sturdy he was, raised his hand and began to shake it back and forth. \u201cYou see, it\u2019s completely fine. I\u2019m really good,\u00a0hiss\u2026\u201dIt really hurt after the anesthetic wore off.Seeing him like this, Fang Juexia grew distressed again. \u201cI already said that you shouldn\u2019t move around.\u201d He didn\u2019t\u00a0 dare to touch his hand, just gingerly holding the part of his hand peeking out of the cast. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d\u201cNot bad.\u201d Upon seeing how Fang Juexia\u2019s eyebrows had completely twisted, Pei Tingsong stretched out his other hand and smoothed his brow. \u201cIt was just a little bit just now, it doesn\u2019t hurt anymore.\u201d\u201cThe doctor said it would take four weeks for you to recover.\u201d Fang Juexia sighed.Listening to his sigh, Pei Tingsong sighed as well. \u201cI regret it.\u201dWhat did he regret? Fang Juexia looked up at him, a little uneasy. Seeing that he had turned his body around, and seemed to be looking everywhere for something on the bed, he felt that the situation had turned strange again. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s my cell phone? Just now, I should have recorded it when you said you liked me, so you can\u2019t deny it later.\u201dSo it turned out he regretted that. Fang Juexia was relieved and grumbled in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m not drunk right now.\u201dEvery move of Fang Juexia\u2019s under Pei Tingsong\u2019s gaze became awfully adorable to him.The phone in his pants pocket suddenly vibrated, and Fang Juexia took it out in a hurry to pick up the incoming call. When he saw the words \u201cCheng Qiang\u201d, he grew even more flustered. His behavior right now was exactly like that of a high school student who had been caught by his parents while on a puppy love date.\u201cHello\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia glanced at a corner of the room and said, \u201cEn, he\u2019s good.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, let the staff go back first. The hospital is quite safe.\u201cI\u2019ll take care of Xiao Pei in the hospital\u00a0ba, even if I went back, I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep.\u201d He dropped his eyes. \u201cEn, bye bye.\u201dWhen he hung up, Fang Juexia\u2019s heartbeat still hadn\u2019t recovered. He pressed the lock screen, took a deep breath, and looked up just to see Pei Tingsong say, \u201cI\u2019m not Xiao Pei.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t understand, so he just kept looking at him.Pei Tingsong once again stressed, \u201cI\u2019m not Xiao Pei now, I\u2019m your boyfriend.\u201dThis word fell into Fang Juexia\u2019s ears and burned his ears until they felt hot. \u201cBoy\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t even say it.\u201cYes\u00a0ah.\u201d Pei Tingsong, as if afraid of him running away, grabbed his hand and declared, \u201cI like you, pursued you, and you also like me back. We should go out, just like all the other people who love each other do.\u201d His thumb rubbed against the back of Fang Juexia\u2019s hand as he continued, \u201cIt can\u2019t be that you don\u2019t want to associate with me?\u201dPei Tingsong was really the most straightforward person he had ever met. Clearly, this love would be unspeakable in many people\u2019s eyes, but with him, there wasn\u2019t even a shadow of an obstacle. His enthusiasm was so rampant that Fang Juexia had no room to parry him.\u201cI\u2014\u201d Fang Juexia no longer wanted to be\u00a0overcautious and indecisive, and compared to Pei Tingsong, he seemed to be the most entangled person in the world, but his voice was much smaller because of his lack of confidence. \u201c\u2026.I\u2019m willing.\u201dPei Tingsong, who had achieved his goal, moved forward and asked, \u201cYou\u2019re actually still afraid of me, aren\u2019t you?\u201dFang Juexia looked at him and shook his head.\u201cReally?\u201d Pei Tingsong came closer. His eyes, that looked very childish when smiling, stared at him silently. He shifted his hand, which was holding Fang Juexia\u2019s hand, upwards, stopping when he came to hold his arm instead. \u201cHow about this?\u201dFang Juexia unconsciously held his breath. It seemed as if a cup of sour and sweet lemon soda had been overturned in the air, and its sweet bubbles floated between them.He shook his head again.As the distance between them shrunk further, Pei Tingsong moved forward again, and the position of his hand changed once again, going from Fang Juexia\u2019s arm to the side of his waist.The sweet bubbles in the air couldn\u2019t help Fang Juexia resist at all, they were scattered everywhere by Pei Tingsong\u2019s\u00a0insatiable\u00a0advance. Fang Juexia was trying very hard to maintain his last barrier of calmness. He was already a rational adult, and Pei Tingsong wasn\u2019t some dreadful monster; there was nothing to be afraid of. He couldn\u2019t lose his composure just because of such a small thing.\u201cNot afraid.\u201dThe corner of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth hooked up. \u201cReally?\u201d He put some force into his right hand, his palm pressing into the back of Fang Juexia\u2019s waist, and drew Fang Juexia\u2019s upper body into his own direction. The gap between them was compressed to the shortest possible distance.He rubbed the tip of his nose against Fang Juexia\u2019s and asked in a low voice, \u201cHow about this?\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s heart was about to leap out. He found that his reason had already been stripped out of his body, and he was unable to control his breath and his body, for everything was being led by Pei Tingsong. Clearly, this wasn\u2019t the first time he had been so close to him; there had been occasions where he had been even closer.His brain failed, and Fang Juexia subconsciously closed his eyes.Seeing that he had consciously closed his eyes, Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart was about to melt. He held back his smile and teased, \u201cYou can only get this far\u00a0ah?\u201dUpon being teased by him, Fang Juexia opened his eyes in a hurry. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d Then he asked, \u201cIf I close my eyes, that means I\u2019m scared?\u201dThe tip of his nose brushed against that of the other\u2019s nose. \u201cOtherwise what then?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked softly, \u201cIt can\u2019t be that you closed your eyes because you want me to kiss you?\u201dFang Juexia was left speechless. On the surface, he still looked like that beautiful little ice floe, but the wavering water within his eyes gave him away. Pei Tingsong knew that he was wavering and melting.\u201cJuexia, can I kiss you?\u201dHis breathing was completely disordered, and his whole being was only one step away from a complete breakdown. As long as Pei Tingsong leaned down and kissed him, maybe in the next second, he would fall apart and become a pile of scrap metal.Fang Juexia closed his eyes again in the midst of this suffocation, and squeezed them shut tight.But this last fatal blow didn\u2019t fall on the lips as he had imagined it would, but rather on the corner of his eye. Pei Tingsong\u2019s lips gently pressed against his red birthmark, the mark that distinguished him from anyone and everyone else in the world.Now, it was finally branded with Pei Tingsong\u2019s warmth.It was just a light kiss, and Fang Juexia didn\u2019t actually fall apart, melting into Pei Tingsong\u2019s arms. That hand that had pulled them both close patted his back, then gently rubbed his hair on the back of his head.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of me.\u201d Pei Tingsong held him tightly with one hand and promised, \u201cI will cherish you.\u201dHearing these words, Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes, for some reason, started to sting. He raised his hand and hugged Pei Tingsong, embracing him as he would a lover.Pei Tingsong let out a quiet laugh. \u201cDid you know? I fantasized for a long time that if I could win you, and you were willing to be with me, of where I would kiss you for the first time. I thought for a long time and found that when that time really came, I still wanted to kiss your birthmark.\u201dThis was a mark unique to only him in the whole world, and Pei Tingsong treasured the sense of having it all for his own.Fang Juexia wondered, \u201cWhy did you want this?\u201d\u201cThis is our first kiss\u00a0ah.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s character caused him to only pay attention to the facts. \u201cBut previously you were also\u2026\u201d Thinking of the muddleheaded things he had done when he was drunk, Fang Juexia felt a little too embarrassed to go on.As expected though, as soon as Pei Tingsong heard that, he released Fang Juexia from his hold and started up his taunting mode. \u201cYou still remember\u00a0ah, I thought you had forgotten all of that. You\u2019d better remember this for me for a lifetime: that I, Pei Tingsong, had my first kiss forcibly taken away by you, Fang Juexia, after you got drunk. That was my first kiss, you know?\u00a0First kiss! That was a boy\u2019s first kiss since the period he had grown up from a baby to someone with a clear sense of self!\u201dThe more he said, the more energetic he became, and his words were nearly an indictment. Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help fighting back. \u201cYou\u2019re not much better. You got drunk and also forcibly kissed me before, and\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd what?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked intentionally.Fang Juexia licked the corners of his mouth and swallowed the words \u201cfrench-kissed\u201d before continuing, \u201cAnyway, no one owes anyone now, and it\u2019s very fair.\u201d\u201cFang Juexia, you\u2019d better maintain this standard of fairness and justice forever. As long as I kiss you, you must return it. You can\u2019t let a single debt fall behind.\u201dThen he raised his right hand and started calculating, \u201cLook, you kissed me when you were drunk, and I kissed you when I was drunk, so that\u2019s even. But don\u2019t forget, I also kissed you from across the candy wrapper when I passed it to you, and then I kissed you once from across the piece of paper when I was drunk\u2026\u201d\u201cYou remember it all!\u201d Fang Juexia realized with a start that he had been deceived. He pointed his index finger at Pei Tingsong, who just grabbed it and pulled it over, kissing his fingertips then. \u201cShh, I\u2019m counting.\u201d Pei Tingsong continued, \u201cI just also kissed your birthmark. Oh, right,\u201d he shook Fang Juexia\u2019s fingertips and added, \u201cAnd this one. Calculating it all out, I\u2019ve kissed you four extra times, so quickly return them.\u201dFang Juexia, a mathematics student who was extremely sensitive to numbers, was actually defeated in the calculation of such units. The account of one kiss after another that leaped out of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth made him feel very flustered.He thought of what Pei Tingsong had said when he had hugged him just now, and it was as if he had grasped a life-saving straw. \u201cYou just said you would cherish me.\u201dWhen this sentence was said by him, it inexplicably gained a kind of coquettish feel to it. Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart softened into a complete muddle, but he still had the cheek to say, \u201cYes\u00a0ah. I\u2019m going to cherish you, but don\u2019t you have to cherish me as well\u00a0ah?\u201dHe gently kneaded Fang Juexia\u2019s hand. \u201cYou should count every penny and pay me back for all the times I bullied you.\u201dCurrently, Fang Juexia looked like a frozen small animal, not moving at all, simply staring at him with bright eyes. Pei Tingsong thought he was cute no matter how he looked at him, and his thesaurus of adjectives collapsed, with only the word \u201ccute\u201d rolling and echoing around in his brain.\u201cAlright.\u201d He didn\u2019t intend to continue to tease him, for fear that Fang Juexia would be teased into never answering him again. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201dAs soon as he said these few words, Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand was pulled up by Fang Juexia, with his index finger being held by him as it was pulled towards his mouth. Fang Juexia gave it a small peck and released it.\u201cI returned one.\u201d Fang Juexia was always very serious when he spoke, and this time was the same, carrying out a very sincere retaliation.Pei Tingsong froze; he hadn\u2019t expected his jokes to be taken seriously. While he was still in a daze, Fang Juexia drew closer again. His face carried a heroically righteous expression on it, as if he had prepared himself ideologically enough, and finally, he gently kissed his eyes.\u201cI\u2019ve also returned this one.\u201d Fang Juexia backed away a great deal. \u201cThat\u2019ll be all for now.\u201dPei Tingsong caught his hand. \u201cWhy did you kiss my eye, didn\u2019t I kiss the corner of your eye?\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgThe corners of Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth raised raised, and he pointed at the area under his eye as he said, \u201cYou have a very small mole there.\u201dAnd he had discovered it a long time ago.As soon as the answer was given, Pei Tingsong leaned back on the bed and pulled up the quilt to cover his face. His whole person leaned to one side, and his feet even kept pedaling around inside the quilt.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d The injury on his hand was constantly on Fang Juexia\u2019s mind. \u201cBe careful, don\u2019t bump your hand.\u201d After he finished saying that, he tried to drag Pei Tingsong\u2019s quilt down. \u201cWhy are you covering your head? Lie down quickly and have a good rest.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m hopeless.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s hopeless?\u201d Fang Juexia said hastily, \u201cYou just have a small injury.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really hopeless, I\u2019m finished,\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice came out from the quilt, sounding all stuffy, \u201cFang Juexia, how can I like you so much\u00a0ah?\u201dOnly after 20 years of being the devil incarnate did he now come to understand the saying that \u2018everything has its vanquisher.\u2019God must have known that Pei Tingsong wasn\u2019t easy to push around; he couldn\u2019t go with him, and even worse, he couldn\u2019t go against him, so he pinched and formed a little person precisely according to his preferences and breathed into him a bit of an ethereal air. This little person then knocked Pei Tingsong down, and after entrancing him until he was thoroughly confused, then he obediently subdued him.Ever since he had confessed to Pei Tingsong, Fang Juexia had found that all the social rules he had followed over the course of so many years had failed. He didn\u2019t even know how to talk to Pei Tingsong anymore. Looking at him hiding in the quilt like this, Fang Juexia could only rub his back and try to think of a way to coax him out, \u201cYou mind your hand, come out first.\u201d Saying that, he also tried the solution of threatening, \u201cOtherwise I\u2019ll leave and go back to the dormitory.\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201d Pei Tingsong immediately lifted up the quilt. \u201cHow could there be anyone like this, throwing their boyfriend in the hospital ward alone on the very first day they start to date? Fang Juexia, you\u2019re still heartless.\u201d\u201cThen lie down, and I\u2019ll keep you company.\u201d Fang Juexia tucked in the quilt for him. \u201cYou even fell asleep while they were doing the operation, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019re very tired. Get some rest early. You\u2019ll be able to leave the hospital tomorrow once they have finished examining you.\u201d\u201cThen what about you?\u201dFang Juexia looked out the door. \u201cThere is a sofa in the waiting area outside the suite, and I will go out of the room when you fall asleep. Making do with it for one night will be fine, I\u2019ve even slept on the floor of the practice room.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not okay, you can\u2019t leave.\u201d Pei Tingsong moved to one side of the bed and offered, \u201cYou come up and sleep with me.\u201dFang Juexia immediately started blushing. \u201cHow is that okay?\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked, \u201cDo you need me to count the number of times we\u2019ve slept together in the same bed?\u201d He raised his left hand. \u201cIf you refuse me, I\u2019ll hit the wall.\u201dFang Juexia was helpless. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d\u201c20 years and a month, not at the legal age for marriage, but definitely an adult.\u201d Pei Tingsong raised his eyebrows, and with an arrogant expression, questioned, \u201cDo you have any doubts?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t talk him out of it, and he was also worried that the little devil would really do something like that, with complete disregard for his own safety, so Fang Juexia had to give up his resistance and lower his bed down. He thought he\u2019d just deal with him first, and then when Pei Tingsong fell asleep, he would go out quietly and have the best of both worlds.Fortunately, the bed didn\u2019t count as being small and was big enough for two people to squeeze into. However, as soon as he got in, Pei Tingsong said, \u201cI\u2019m going to fall down. As expected, this bed can only contain one person.\u201d\u201cWhat to do? Should I just get out\u00a0ba?\u201d\u201cLike this.\u201d Pei Tingsong hugged him tightly to his chest. Their chests were pressed together, their hearts crashing together. He heard Pei Tingsong\u2019s deep voice resounding through their intimately close bodies. \u201cYou sleep in my arms, and I sleep in the bed, so that way, it only counts as one person sleeping here.\u201dWhat kind of a weird calculation was this?Worried about him putting pressure on his hand, Fang Juexia asked him to lie on his back, while he lay on his side. However, Pei Tingsong kept wanting to stretch out his right hand and hug him. Seeing no other way out, Fang Juexia just had to let him hug him. And upon seeing his injured wrist, Fang Juexia still felt frightened, and he knew he couldn\u2019t experience such a thing again.\u201cIn the future, you can\u2019t come running over to save me so recklessly.\u201dAfter hearing what he said, Pei Tingsong only laughed. \u201cDo you think I can control myself?\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t want to hear this. \u201cPromise me first.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay, okay, I promise you.\u201d Pei Tingsong kissed his forehead. \u201cI won\u2019t be like this in the future, okay?\u201dHe\u2019d been kissed again.He didn\u2019t know what was going on, maybe Pei Tingsong\u2019s arithmetic had brainwashed him too well, for Fang Juexia had subconsciously formed the habit of counting his kisses.\u201cEn.\u201d He pretended to be very sleepy, closed his eyes, and shrank into Pei Tingsong\u2019s arms. Clearly, he had said he was just going to deal with his request, then go away, but after really being embraced by him, Fang Juexia had long forgotten his original intention.He already couldn\u2019t remember when this boy, three years younger than him, had captured his heart. Thinking back through everything, in a backwards process like image correction, his mind brought up every single moment he had interacted with Pei Tingsong, but even so, this system that had never failed before still could not trace back to the root of the mistake.There were only innumerable moving moments.The two people lying in the same hospital bed were isolated from the world. They didn\u2019t know that this meetup had caused a tsunami in the online world again. First of all, during the livestream, Kaleido\u2019s interview had gone viral. In particular, Fang Juexia\u2019s answer to the question on whether they should be called idols had aroused a heated discussion online. The word \u201cidol\u201d itself was full of controversy, and in addition to the controversy over Fang Juexia himself, it was debated for a long time.[@Bolognese sauce noodles with ice: Suddenly moved by FJX.][@Baozi who likes to eat meat: It\u2019s still only because he has the strength that he has the courage to say this\u00a0ba. When I randomly saw his magazine interview, back then he had said that idols were the embodiment of dreams. Although I don\u2019t know much about his experiences, I feel that he is really a person with his own ideas.][@Beautiful appearance, good hearted, small public official: He really possesses a face such as to represent all idols, what kind of\u00a0great, glorious, and correct\u00a0image are you trying to create, you\u2019re not afraid of your own persona collapsing?]Just as their popularity kept rising, the sudden stage accident pushed this contradiction to its highest level.After the accident, the livestream was suddenly stopped, but many people had still witnessed part of the situation at that time through the livestream. In the beginning, the rumor that spread was that fans had pulled Pei Tingsong off the stage, causing him to be injured. Many netizens, including fans who didn\u2019t show up, started to voice blame. The topic of #Pei Tingsong has been injured# exploded directly.Not long after the incident, the venue issued an official notice, saying that the accident was not caused by any design defects on the stage itself or the negligence of the security personnel on scene, but rather by human beings. It would fully cooperate with the investigation to find the perpetrators.As for the Star Chart, after Pei Tingsong\u2019s physical condition diagnosis was complete, they also issued an announcement to clear up the situation, and finally also said they would hold the perpetrators accountable.These two announcements clearly defined the accident as a malicious and deliberate attack. Conspiracy theories were the most popular thing online, and everyone \u201cmade suggestions\u201d in order to explore the truth under the surface. Some people guessed it was the same malicious competitors as those who had been responsible for the leaked song before, while others said it was anti-fans taking action, and everyone had their own opinions.However, this incident also propelled Kaleido into becoming a member of the \u201cBeautiful, strong, and miserable\u201d league. As soon as they became popular, one tragedy after another occurred, and there were who knows how many people behind all of these incidents. Most netizens expressed their heartache after learning about Pei Tingsong\u2019s injury and hoped that he could recover as soon as possible.As luck would have it, the premiere for the second season of \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019 was scheduled for that night. It was 10 p.m. by the time the broadcast ended, and the topic of #TingJue CP Escape# shot up on the Hot Search list at the speed of a rocket. Scanning the Hot Search list, half of the top ten searches were all related to Kaleido.Those netizens who didn\u2019t listen to music, didn\u2019t watch performances, and didn\u2019t care about the previous incident with the leaked song, finally came to know the two of them because of \u2018Escape\u2019. The scene one chanced upon when clicking into #TingJue CP Escape# was basically witnessing a large scale transfer of fans.[@Wolves001: WTFWTFWTF, this is the first time in Escape history that the killer won\u00a0ba!?

At the very least, Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong, with their wonderful performance in the program, had managed to successfully enter into the mainstream audiences\u2019 field of vision, coming out of the relatively small idol circle. With the endless stream of clips circulating on the major video sites, together with the consistent essays, analysis, and shilling from Escape fans, more and more people kept discovering how strong these two new guests were.A major verified account published a long article analyzing all the experiences of Kaleido\u2019s major accidents and the ways they had saved the day in their comeback performances, and ended with stating the key points to their popularity as a positive example. The most popular comment to the post was below it\u2014[@Eating\u00a0tang yuan\u00a0for Chinese New Year: If StarChart can play the TingJue CP card, they\u2019re already halfway there to winning. As soon as the airport video showed up, it started planning for fanservice and paved the way with various resources for the CP. They comprehensively developed fluff to draw in fans, then they got on the magazine, and after that, also got into Escape; and even though none of these steps looked conspicuous, it was all ready in anticipation. The two people also strived hard, and are attractive, and strong. When they\u2019re apart from each other, they may be able to balance each other out, but when they\u2019re combined, they\u2019re just too good at this. They belong to the typical and super standard \u201cleading man\u201d trope in their group, responsible for being eye-catching. If the other members are also awesome enough, then the whole group can retain their fans. It is obvious that the strength of the whole Kaleido group is there, so it is inevitable that their comeback would explode through word of mouth. I can responsibly say that once this group is popular, it will be popular for a long time.]All kinds of accidents happened to this small group in just one week, and it was nearly like a roller coaster, making people feel frightened when they went to sort it all out. However, it is precisely because of this too bumpy experience of Kaleido\u2019s that their comeback had taken on a life as being some kind of tragic legend. More and more people paid attention to this album for various reasons, and on music platforms, \u201cBreak Through\u201d ranked first in streams for 30 continuous days, with the sales of their digital album also seeing a rise.Fang Juexia, the dark horse of the direct videos, who took the lead by a landslide, became the fastest idol to gain one million views through three comeback performances in a row. Pei Tingsong\u2019s rap clips also garnered amazing viewer counts and barrage comments on another video website, ranking first in the entertainment area. Within a few days, the number of Weibo fans these two people had nearly doubled, with more than 100 fan stations being created, and countless more CP stations. Discussions about their CP were ranked at a distant first, being widely discussed everywhere. Each member\u2019s popularity was rising like a rocket, and a countless number of fans were being drawn in.Kaleido had become a fandom possessing thousands of fans, and it was being discussed everywhere; with fans discussing their albums, their strengths, and the silly things the group members did. Digging up Kaleido\u2019s history had already become a large spontaneous activity. After a period of research, it was found that each member\u2019s history contained a completely different tragic aspect, and \u2018The most pitiful boy-band\u2019 soon became a synonym for Kaleido.Strong groups may not be able to draw in fans continuously, but when it came to a strong and pitiful group, their rate of drawing in fans doubled.But these exaggerated figures were unknown to both of the main parties involved. Before light even dawned in the sky, Fang Juexia woke up; he hadn\u2019t slept well all night. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t feel comfortable, but that he was very uneasy and often woke up. Then, whenever he saw Pei Tingsong lying beside him, he would feel more at ease and would put his head against his shoulder and fall asleep again. This happened quite a few times before he finally got up at six o\u2019clock in the morning, getting off the bed with very light movements. After washing up, he sat down on the bed, at Pei Tingsong\u2019s side.Supporting his chin on the palm of his hand, Fang Juexia lay on his stomach, looking at Pei Tingsong in front of him without moving. He thought it was inconceivable; the word \u201clover\u201d was a word he would almost never even think about in the past, but such a person suddenly appeared, and it was even the person Fang Juexia thought was the most unlikely one to occupy such a position.Pei Tingsong\u2019s appearance while sleeping was very well-behaved, and he didn\u2019t look grumpy at all. Looking at the wound on his face, Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help but feel distressed. He reached out and touched his cheek gently, then pushed aside the drooping bangs on his forehead.How was the bridge of his nose so high?He couldn\u2019t help but tap his finger on the bridge of his nose, then sliding his finger down the line of it, up to the place where it sank in, and then right to the edge of the peak of his lips, which he rubbed against lightly.All of a sudden, Pei Tingsong, who had clearly still been soundly asleep, stretched out his right hand, grabbed Fang Juexia\u2019s hand, pulled it over and kissed it all over, from the palm to the tips of his fingers.\u201cYou woke up?\u201d Fang Juexia hurriedly withdrew his hand. \u201cYou even pretended to be asleep.\u201dPei Tingsong rubbed his eyes and said, \u201cAs soon as you got up, I woke up, I don\u2019t know why.\u201d He turned over to face Fang Juexia. \u201cI had a dream that lasted all night.\u201dFang Juexia gave him the warm water on the table while asking, \u201cWhat dream?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong gulped down a big mouthful of water, handed the cup back to him, and then raised Fang Juexia\u2019s chin a bit. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll scare you, so I won\u2019t say anything.\u201d After that, he got down from the bed and walked to the bathroom while supporting his left hand.Fang Juexia was left stunned for a few seconds, and then, when he suddenly realized what had been said, he felt that he had been teased again. \u201cPei Tingsong!\u201dPei Tingsong, standing in the bathroom, stuck his head out with a toothbrush in his mouth. His hair was a mess, and he was smiling at Fang Juexia like a child.He just couldn\u2019t be angry with him or even refuse him.Fang Juexia buried his head into the quilt on the hospital bed.When the doctor on-duty came, they checked and confirmed that there were no problems left from the operation. After that, they went through the discharge procedures. The company\u2019s car was arranged to wait at the side door of the private hospital, and the two of them were armed to the teeth in clothing to avoid the flow of people. Once they were in the car, Xiao Wen happily told them the ratings of the first episode of Escape and the latest numbers for the new album. Fang Juexia was very happy; compared to his own rising popularity, the thing that was most worth being proud of was that their songs would be heard by so many people.\u201cBy the way, there will be an autograph session tomorrow afternoon,\u201d said Xiao Wen, turning the steering wheel. \u201cThe boss said Xiao Pei does not need to attend and that he can keep resting in the dormitory.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s right hand supported his left. \u201cWhy should I not go? It\u2019s not the hand that I write with that I hurt.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re afraid you\u2019ll get tired\u00a0ya. At that time, it will be very tiring to keep signing, and there will also be many people. What should we do if you keep bumping against things?\u201dPei Tingsong took a look at Fang Juexia. Fang Juexia also glanced at him, and then quickly looked away.\u201cNo, I\u2019m going. I\u2019m not some kind of fragile person who will break as soon as I get bumped into.\u201d Pei Tingsong was very obstinate. \u201cI have to go to school in the afternoon today to give a presentation. I have to arrive at two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, so Xiao Wen, if you don\u2019t have anything else to do then, just send me there.\u201dFang Juexia thought this was unbelievable. \u201cYou\u2019re giving a presentation? Are you ready for it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already read all the literature. A few days ago, I would read a little every time we returned to the dorms.\u201d Pei Tingsong shrugged and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a presentation\u00a0ma, I\u2019ll just improvise, and it\u2019ll be fine.\u201dHe really did embody the style of a rapper.As soon as they arrived at the company, they were called into the office by Cheng Qiang. Cheng Qiang had also been very busy these past few days, to the point that he slept directly in the company itself. His office was a complete mess, and Fang Juexia just wanted to clean it up for him upon seeing it.\u201cThe response to this episode of Escape was much better than what we expected, and because we also didn\u2019t expect for so many incidents to break out at the same time, we are a bit overwhelmed for the moment. But you two have really given me so much face.\u201dPei Tingsong listened and lightly tapped the plaster of his left hand with his uninjured right hand in a kind of beat. Fang Juexia, however, just stared focusedly at the crooked papers on the desk, not listening to any word of Cheng Qiang\u2019s at all.\u201cAnyway, after Escape\u2019s premiere, a heap of brands, program groups, and platforms have come to find you guys; they all want to cooperate with us.\u201d Cheng Qiang took out an electronic file as he explained the details, \u201cThe hip-hop program that Xiao Pei mentioned before has also approached us, but because they are still in the planning stages for their program, they\u2019ve just sent over a greeting first. By the way, there is also a variety show with the highest national popularity, which has invited the whole group to their stage. It fits perfectly into the album promotion period, so we\u2019ve made room for it in our schedule and are getting ready to record this variety show as soon as possible.\u201cJuexia, you\u2019ve been invited to several music and dance programs, as well as for roles in some dramas. I\u2019ll send them over to you when I get back, and you guys can check them out for yourselves.\u201dActing\u2026.Fang Juexia automatically asked, \u201cCan I act like this?\u201d Then he pointed to his birthmark.Cheng Qiang was about to open his mouth when he heard Pei Tingsong vent with a bad tone, \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?!\u201d\u201cHey, Xiao Pei, don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Cheng Qiang hurriedly intervened, to keep the peace.\u201cDon\u2019t you know you look so good? And you\u2019re still like \u2018can I act like this\u2019? You\u2019re much better looking than all those actors added together. Your self-awareness is too fuzzy, you say something irritating every day.\u201dFacing such rapid bombardment from Pei Tingsong, Fang Juexia was completely overwhelmed. However, Cheng Qiang couldn\u2019t help laughing as he teased, \u201cYou\u2019re still not apologizing to our maknae, look, he\u2019s angry.\u201dFang Juexia could only reach out and rub Pei Tingsong\u2019s shoulder, consoling, \u201cDon\u2019t be angry, don\u2019t be angry.\u201d He then explained, \u201cI meant that I have a birthmark, and so can\u2019t act in a drama.\u201dPei Tingsong grew irritated again and said, \u201cYou\u2019re just good-looking. Your entire body, from your head to your toes and to your birthmark, everything is all good-looking.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright, alright, good-looking, good-looking.\u201dWho dared to fight against this little devil?\u201cOh, right. I almost forgot about the big thing because of you guys tossing me around,\u201d Cheng Qiang suddenly remembered and told them, \u201cThe person who pulled at you guys was caught. Originally, according to the normal legal proceedings, this person would have run around for a while, and after we caught them, you guys would have to go to the police station to give your side of things and have the injury identified. The whole process is very complicated, and maybe he would have to be detained for more than ten days and pay for the meals.\u201dThat\u2019s right. Even if the person he injured was a celebrity, the legal treatment was almost the same. Fang Juexia had thought that maybe the person who had been hired by whoever was behind the scene was someone who didn\u2019t fear going to the police station; they had been given a lot of money, and as long as he could hurt them, it would count as a victory.\u201cBut where do you guys think we caught him?\u201dHearing him talk like this, Pei Tingsong immediately understood that things weren\u2019t so simple. \u201cIt can\u2019t be at the company building\u00a0ba?\u201d\u201cHow did you know?!\u201d Cheng Qiang was surprised, but he quickly stuck his index finger in the air again and pointed. \u201cWorthy of having a blood relation, you guys really have your methods.\u201dFang Juexia was a little confused. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI told Xiao Wen to go pick you guys up with my car this morning. Yet, as a result, Xiao Wen was given a scare.\u201d Cheng Qiang explained, \u201cIsn\u2019t my car parked in the underground garage below the company? When he went there, he found a man lying on the ground near the car door and so he immediately called me. I went to take a look, and good god, that person had been beaten so heavily that I couldn\u2019t recognize his battered up face. He had been tied with his hands behind his back and had been thrown next to my car.\u201d\u201cBeaten up by someone\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia subconsciously looked at Pei Tingsong, but who knew that Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t even need to think about it before guessing directly, \u201cMy Jie, right?\u201dCheng Qiang nodded and said, \u201cShe\u2019s really vicious when she takes action. I had to find four big guys to carry him away. He also had a recorder on him, and inside it was his confession.\u201d He pushed the recorder forward and pressed play. \u201cYou guys listen.\u201dHe confessed to all of it, and it was pretty much like what Fang Juexia had thought. The mastermind behind this was exactly that Astar official surnamed Jin, and he had captured this ruined gambler, paying him\u00a050,000 yuan\u00a0to find a chance to cripple Fang Juexia.The interrogator in the recording was a calm man who repeated the other person\u2019s words, \u201cCripple?\u201dThat man\u2019s voice trembled. \u201cYes, they said it would be best to blind him or break his legs, so that he couldn\u2019t sing or dance for the rest of his life. I just wanted to get him to fall off the stage, but who would have known that I wouldn\u2019t succeed? There were too many people at that time, and when I tried again, I found that I had pulled the wrong person.\u201dPei Tingsong laughed scornfully. Coincidentally, another scornful laugh also sounded out from the recording at the same time, and it was a woman\u2019s voice. She spoke in English and told someone to take the man down.Cheng Qiang put the recording pen away. \u201cOur Star Chart is a small company, and this kind of recording can only be used as a means of insurance, but we can\u2019t place it online. To tell you the truth, if Juexia had really gotten injured this time, this kind of thing would probably happen again many times again in the future, because Juexia really has nothing and no one backing him. As long as others have the will, it\u2019s really hard to defend against\u00a0covert attacks.\u201dHe started to smile as kept talking, \u201cBut who would have known that this bastard actually ended up pulling the wrong person? No matter how much Astar swaggers around, it\u2019s still just an entertainment company, and now, it has kicked a big plutocrat\u2019s iron plate. Tch, retribution always comes. Ms. Pei called Boss early in the morning and talked with him for an hour. She probably won\u2019t just let Jin Xiangcheng go this time, you guys wait\u00a0ba. Tomorrow, AS\u2019s stock will fall.\u201dHe also showed Pei Tingsong the photos he had taken on his cellphone. \u201cLook at how much he was beaten up, it\u2019s very satisfying.\u201dPei Tingsong glanced at it with a frown. \u201cTch, protecting me now, what took her so long?\u201dThe corners of Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth drew up. \u201cYou talk about your own Jie that way\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the truth\u00a0ah.\u201d Saying that, Pei Tingsong raised his eyebrows. \u201cIs she really scary?\u201dFang Juexia also started laughing. \u201cYou siblings are both scary, the big devil and the little devil.\u201dPei Tingsong thought about it, but he didn\u2019t refute it. \u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019d do the same thing if this matter was left to me.\u201d\u201cBy the way, Ms. Pei has hired a nurse for you, and they\u2019ll arrive soon. She has asked you to go back to the apartment for this period of time and to stop working. The nurse will take care of you 24 hours a day.\u201dRest was a must. However, Fang Juexia thought that in that case, he wouldn\u2019t be able to see Pei Tingsong.\u201cNope,\u201d Pei Tingsong said with an expression that indicated he would do whatever he wanted, and leaned against the back of a chair as he stated, \u201cI\u2019m going to work, and I\u2019m going to school. I\u2019m a young man who loves his job and works hard.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t control a big Buddha like you. You go back and tell Ms. Pei that.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Strong Ge,\u201d Pei Tingsong raised his right hand and stretched it out, leaning it against Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHow many times have I listened to her since I was born? She doesn\u2019t believe that I\u2019ll just obediently stay there, she\u2019s just saying that. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201dWhen they came out of Cheng Qiang\u2019s office, they met the other members, who were in the practice room. Since Pei Tingsong thought that they would have to perform on-stage soon, he adjusted his movements to fit the current situation.\u201cIf it\u2019s not okay, you can just sit down\u00a0ba; it\u2019ll be fine if you just sing your part while standing on the side.\u201d Jiang Miao looked at him and felt a strange heartache. \u201cYour body is the most important thing, and if a serious collision takes place on-stage, what are we going to do?\u201d\u201cIt looks so ugly with one person missing.\u201d Pei Tingsong vetoed his proposal. \u201cI\u2019ll get used to it after practicing for a bit. It\u2019s actually easier for me to do it when missing a hand.\u201d\u201cTch, tch, tch.\u201d Ling Yi couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cIs this still our little devil paddling along? He\u2019s working harder and harder; people who didn\u2019t know what was going on would think that you and Juexia had exchanged souls.\u201dFang Juexia, who was sitting on the floor changing his shoes, was already in a good mood, and upon being amused by this, he simply leaned against Ling Yi and asked, \u201cThen should I start to slack off now?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAs soon as Pei Tingsong saw Fang Juexia leaning against Ling Yi, he started to get angry. \u201cWhat yes?\u201d He took a few steps forward and pulled Fang Juexia over, after which he forced himself into the middle of the two men, relying on the fact that since he was hurt, no one would dare to touch him.\u201cYou little bastard, you just know how to steal Juexia from me!\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cDo I need to steal him from you?\u201d Pei Tingsong said, \u201cI\u2019m the official partner, understand? It\u2019s the kind of official partner where they held a meeting for several hours just for our CP.\u201dLing Yi wiped his face since he couldn\u2019t win an argument against him, then he pulled someone else into it. \u201cLu Yuan, he has spit all over me.\u201dLu Yuan was wise enough to protect himself and pushed He Ziyan out. \u201cIf you quarrel with a rapper, you should ask another rapper for help.\u201dHe Ziyan shrugged. \u201cWho\u2019s a rapper? Excuse me, I\u2019m a bar DJ. What record would\u00a0you\u00a0like me to spin today?\u201d\u201cNo one is helping me!\u201d\u201cGive up\u00a0ba, M-dash.\u201dFang Juexia was relieved to see everyone making a lot of noise together. Although he was a quiet bystander most of the time, as long as the six of them were together, it was as if they didn\u2019t need to be afraid of anything.After all, back during the times they couldn\u2019t touch the sun, they could at least touch each other\u2019s hands.In the afternoon, Pei Tingsong went to school to give his presentation, and the other five spent the afternoon in the practice room. Jiang Miao, He Ziyan, and Ling Yi had another event scheduled in the evening, so that left only Lu Yuan and Fang Juexia behind. The two of them found another song to practice dancing to during that time, and coincidentally, Xiao Wen, who thought their performance was really handsome, was also there. He recorded it on his cellphone.Fang Juexia stopped and sent a WeChat message to Pei Tingsong.[Just a pretty face and also pretty: Is it over? I\u2019ll pick you up in my car\u00a0ba.]Lu Yuan watched the video and liked it very much. \u201cIt\u2019s very hot, Xiao Wen is pretty good at filming. Juexia, I\u2019m going to post it to Weibo\u00a0ah.\u201dFang Juexia had been waiting for a message on his phone the entire time, and he didn\u2019t even really register what Lu Yuan had said before he replied, \u201cEn.\u201d[@Kaleido Lu Yuan: The main dance line\u2019s everyday [cool] [cool]]In the video, two people were dancing in urban style, one of whom had super control over all his movements, while the other moved like flowing water. They had two completely different performance styles, but both of them were equally eye-catching. The fans excitedly liked the two main dancers, and the forwards and comments on this post grew quickly.[@Domino #1: AHHHHHHHH FJX IS THRUSTING HIS HIPS I\u2019M DYIIIING! PLEASE TAKE MY LIFE AWAY!][@This is my cancelled K: I\u2019ll praise Teacher Yuan\u2019s control ten thousand times! Jxgg is really too beautiful. Dancing along with long legs, he\u2019s both cold and sexy.][@domino 111: AHHHHHHH WHAT DID I SCROLL TO?! Grandpa, the dance blogger you follow has forwarded your post!]Lu Yuan scrolled through Weibo with great interest, and said, \u201cThey\u2019re asking if we can dance this again at the autograph event tomorrow?\u201dFang Juexia nodded. \u201cWe can\u00a0ah.\u201dXiao Wen sat cross-legged on the ground, and was holding his feet as he agreed, \u201cIt\u2019s so great\u00a0ah, the autograph event is a fan benefit event. I need to choose a good-looking mask, or I will be embarrassed upon being photographed tomorrow.\u201dAfter Fang Juexia suffered through a long wait, his cellphone finally vibrated.[Injured Guide Dog: It just finished, I\u2019m so tired\u2026When I saw your message, I had already booked a cab. I finally managed to see you attain such a high awareness, knowing that you should pick up your boyfriend, but I missed the opportunity. When I get back, we must make up for it.]Make up for it\u2026. How were they going to make that up?His phone vibrated again.[Injured Guide Dog: Miss me?]Upon seeing this question, Fang Juexia felt a little embarrassed even though he was just reading these words from across the screen, and he gripped his cellphone to type a line of words, which he ended up deleting once, and before he could type anything else, a new message had already jumped into the chatbox.[Injured Guide Dog: Let me say it first, I miss you so much.]Fang Juexia\u2019s fingers stopped.He couldn\u2019t beat him at all.\u201cJuexia? What are you up to?\u201dFang Juexia had just typed out a heart, and ended up accidentally sending it when Xiao Wen asked him this question. \u201cAh? Nothing, it\u2019s getting late, I want to go back to the dorm.\u201d\u201cYou go back first\u00a0ba. Just now, Beizi asked me to help pull him around later,\u201d Lu Yuan said.So Fang Juexia, escorted by security personnel, went back to the dormitory. Before he left the company, he ordered Pei Tingsong\u2019s favorite food, pizza, which was delivered right when he got home. Pei Tingsong was writing something in his bedroom with his headphones on, so he didn\u2019t notice Fang Juexia\u2019s return until the person appeared behind him and touched his shoulder.As soon as he turned his head and saw Fang Juexia, Pei Tingsong, who was sitting in a swivel chair, spun around and threw his arms around his waist, exclaiming, \u201cYou\u2019ve finally come back.\u201dFang Juexia wasn\u2019t used to his intimate gestures, but he was also afraid of bumping into his injured hand when pushing him away, so he simply let him do what he wanted. \u201cBe careful with your wrist.\u201dObviously, Pei Tingsong had already regarded his injury as some kind of gold medal. His face rubbed against Fang Juexia\u2019s stomach, and his teeth bit into the upper and lower hem of his shirt. He raised his eyes towards Fang Juexia, as if to show off to him on purpose.\u201cHey, what are you doing?\u201d Fang Juexia reached out and pushed his forehead, but Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t let go. He even separated his legs, dragging Fang Juexia between them, and then caught his legs with his thighs, making it impossible for him to escape.He relaxed his mouth, looked at Fang Juexia, and raised his eyebrows.\u201dLower your head, I have something to say to you.\u201dFang Juexia thought about it and followed his words. He didn\u2019t expect Pei Tingsong to stretch up to him, kiss him on the mouth, and then lean back contentedly to say, \u201cYou\u2019re so easy to trick.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you who go too far.\u201d Fang Juexia was angry and wanted to leave, but Pei Tingsong grabbed his arm pitifully. \u201cI\u2019m kidding, I really have something to say to you.\u201dFang Juexia stopped to look down at him, with an expression of \u2018I\u2019m waiting to see what you have to say.\u2019Pei Tingsong looked at him and said, \u201cI\u2019m so tired, I want to take a bath.\u201d\u201cGo\u00a0ah. I\u2019ve ordered pizza for you, and you can take a bath when you\u2019re done eating.\u201dAfter listening to him, Pei Tingsong pretended to be weak and carefully raised his left hand, which was in a cast, using his right hand. He didn\u2019t say another word, he just looked at Fang Juexia pitifully.Oh right\u00a0ah.Fang Juexia had just been concerned about earning face and had forgotten all about Pei Tingsong\u2019s injury. Forget about taking a bath, it would be very difficult for him to just wash his hair.\u201cThen what should you do? How about you just don\u2019t take a bath today?\u201d\u201cNo, I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d Pei Tingsong was too lazy to continue hinting at things, and\u00a0came straight to the point. \u201cHelp me wash up\u00a0ba.\u201dFang Juexia suddenly thought of the scene when Pei Tingsong had been drunk and had run off to take a bath. He suddenly felt a little embarrassed. \u201cHelp? How can I help\u00a0ah\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong grew very irritated when he heard that. \u201cAren\u2019t you very good at taking care of people? Why is it as soon as it comes to your boyfriend, you don\u2019t know how\u00a0ah?\u201dFang Juexia was still not used to the word \u2018boyfriend\u2019. He thought of what he had heard in the office last afternoon. \u201cYou should have agreed to your Jie and gone to live in your apartment; the 24-hour nurse could be dispatched whenever, and they\u2019d do whatever you wanted.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want a nurse, I just want you. You can just help me wash my hair\u00a0ba, I don\u2019t need your help in taking a bath. I\u2019ll give you a small bench to sit on, and you definitely won\u2019t be tired.\u201d\u201cGe,\u201d Pei Tingsong tugged his hand around and pleaded, \u201cJuexia Gege, take pity on me\u00a0ba.\u201d\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 67Chapter 67 \u2013 Immoral CompetitionTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksDid I winClearly, Pei Tingsong had still been an arrogant and grumpy young master before this, but for some reason, now, he was more obedient than anyone. He looked just like a big dog, just missing a wagging tail.Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t convince himself to refuse Pei Tingsong no matter what, so he could only be cajoled by him into the bathroom.Pei Tingsong said that he would set out a small stool, and he really did set out one. He put it next to the bathtub, and then also gave him a thick cushion to place on the seat, out of fear that he\u2019d be uncomfortable. \u201cSee, isn\u2019t this perfect?\u201dWhat perfect\u00a0ah? Fang Juexia started filling the bathtub with hot water without saying a word. He caught a glimpse of a box of bath bombs on the shelf, so he took one out and threw it into the water. The small bath bomb melted, and milky-white bubbles, tinged with a little light blue, quickly started floating in the bathtub. A soft vanilla nutmeg fragrance mixed with a very light sea salt scent also made itself known.\u201cSo many bubbles?\u201d Pei Tingsong teased him deliberately, \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be that you\u2019re afraid of seeing something, so you just filled it up with bubbles? Out of sight, out of mind\u00a0ba.\u201dFang Juexia hadn\u2019t thought of that when he threw it in, he had just thought it would feel nice. He hadn\u2019t thought that Pei Tingsong would misinterpret it so much, so he naturally explained, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t think that far.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, you\u2019ve seen pretty much everything already.\u201dPei Tingsong wanted to continue speaking, but Fang Juexia quickly covered his mouth. \u201cAre you going to take a bath or not?\u201d\u201cWu,\u201d Pei Tingsong nodded, and then he kissed Fang Juexia\u2019s palm. Fang Juexia removed his hand from his mouth and gave him a look. \u201cThen hurry up.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t convenient to move around with a cast. Before he was discharged from hospital, he had been wearing a very loose sweater with wide cuffs, so his left hand was propped up and then his sleeves were rolled up. Putting it on had already been very hard work, and taking it off now would also be a difficult task. Fang Juexia stood behind him, untied the sling for him first, and then carefully took off his sweater. Initially, Fang Juexia had felt awkward, but now, his heart just remained suspended in mid-air, for he was afraid of bumping Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand into something, so he didn\u2019t have the time to feel embarrassed.\u201cIt\u2019s too hard.\u201d Upon finally getting his top off, Pei Tingsong let out a long sigh of. As soon as he leaned over, he wanted to use Fang Juexia as his support. \u201cMy situation is too difficult.\u201dFang Juexia used his hand to hold him steady. \u201cDon\u2019t move around randomly.\u201d\u201cMy pants are still left\u00a0ah.\u201d Pei Tingsong grabbed his hand and put it on his waist. \u201cI can\u2019t just take a bath in jeans\u00a0ba.\u201dHe was right. Fang Juexia had no way out, and when he put his fingers on the metal buttons there, everything felt hot. The temperature in the bathroom was very high, hot and humid, making people unable to take any breaths.It was clearly still spring, but it seemed as if he had fallen into a hot and humid summer.Fang Juexia turned his head and looked at the bubbles on the edge of the bathtub. They dangled there, and as each small bubble burst, each tooth of the tight metal zipper loosened, opening with the slow sound of it being pulled down.The light of the bathroom was shining on Fang Juexia, covering him with a clean halo. His long hair was pulled behind his ears, and his exposed ears had turned a hot red, along with all of his neck that was exposed at his collar.How could he blush so easily, how was he going to survive later?The corners of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth rose slightly, and he tilted his head to see Fang Juexia\u2019s turned away face. \u201cGege, lift up your head and look at me\u00a0bei.\u201dFang Juexia held his breath and looked straight up at him, and for no reason, seemed to carry a kind of heroic air about him as he did this.Pei Tingsong finally couldn\u2019t help laughing and knocked his own forehead against this person\u2019s. \u201cI want to eat ice cream.\u201d\u201cNow?\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes and brow were full of doubts.\u201cYes\u00a0ah.\u201d Pei Tingsong supported his arm with his right hand and turned him around. \u201cHelp me get it.\u201d\u201cIs there ice cream in the dorm?\u201d\u201cI just bought it.\u201d Pei Tingsong said, \u201cGo quickly.\u201dHaving been ordered out of the bathroom rather inexplicably, Fang Juexia opened the freezer, took out a tub of vanilla Haagen Dazs ice cream from the inside, found a spoon, and walked back, only to encounter a burst of hot steam enveloping him when he opened the bathroom door. Fang Juexia entered and locked the bathroom door, only to realise that Pei Tingsong had already gotten into the bathtub by himself, with his injured hand hanging on the edge of the bathtub against the wall. When Pei Tingsong heard movement, he lazily tilted his head and looked at him.As soon as he saw Fang Juexia, he smiled. He looked especially attractive when he smiled.\u201cI randomly picked a flavor.\u201d Fang Juexia walked over and sat on the small stool arranged by Pei Tingsong. \u201cWhy did you buy so much?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201dFang Juexia had to use a bit of effort to pry off the lid of the ice cream tub. When he heard this, he was a little surprised, and cold air suddenly blew onto his face.\u201cHow did you know?\u201d The ice cream had frozen solid. Fang Juexia held the spoon and tried to dig into it, but he couldn\u2019t get into it at all. \u201cI don\u2019t seem to have said anything about that before.\u201d\u201cWhen I was giving the presentation this afternoon, the girls in the back row of the auditorium were talking about you. As soon as they took a break, they\u2019d start chatting about you.\u201d Pei Tingsong was afraid that Fang Juexia\u2019s hands would become cold, so he took the ice cream tub from his hands, put it on the bathtub shelf attached to the wall, and then held his fingertips in his hands. \u201cThey started with discussing your astrological sign, then ended up talking about your hobbies and interests. They also dug up a post taken when you were your college\u2019s campus idol, and said that because you love having ice cream in the summer, a girl had bought a whole trunk of ice cream cones for you, in order to chase you, but you just split them later with your class.\u201dAs he recounted all this, Pei Tingsong grew unhappy. \u201cTch, wanting to entice you away with just a trunk of ice cream cones\u00a0ah, dream on. Someone actually thought up of such a stupid way to pursue their crush.\u201dFang Juexia was so amused by him that he started laughing. \u201cThen with you buying this much Haagen Dazs, does that make you more powerful than her?\u201dPei Tingsong drew closer. \u201cIf Haagen Dazs isn\u2019t powerful enough, I\u2019m powerful\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cWhere do you get your confidence from\u00a0ah?\u201d Fang Juexia looked both helpless and doting as he smiled.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you like confident people?\u201d Pei Tingsong stated it as a matter of course, \u201cI was forced to be confident.\u201dHe was so full of false reasoning. Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t withstand all this, so handed the spoon to him. \u201cWait for the ice cream to melt a bit before eating it.\u201dPei Tingsong took the spoon with a smile in his eyes. \u201cI know, that is just what I will do.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know if it was due to his subtle influence, but Fang Juexia, who had always had straightforward thoughts before, could now actually understand the double meaning contained in Pei Tingsong\u2019s words instantly.Eat after it melts a bit.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t know what he would melt into. After he had met Pei Tingsong, he had started to realise that he didn\u2019t really know anything about himself. This was very frightening, and it really wasn\u2019t in line with the logic of his once adjustable and controllable behavior.But the unknown was really too fascinating.Fear and attraction to the unknown was probably a bug naturally added when human beings were created\u00a0ba.\u201cWhat happened here?\u201dFang Juexia returned to his senses and saw Pei Tingsong holding the back of his hand, with his brow all wrinkled. \u201cHow are there so many bruises here?\u201dThe bony joints on the back of his hand were a little blue and purple, and it wasn\u2019t that obvious. Fang Juexia explained, \u201cWhen you fell down, I also jumped down. There were too many people, and it was a mess, so my hand got stepped on a few times.\u201dPei Tingsong was extremely distressed. He gently kissed the little bruises, especially lightly.\u201cWhen there are many people in the future, protect yourself first.\u201d He raised his head and looked at Fang Juexia.However many more times such a thing happened, Fang Juexia would still jump down to get to him. But if he said that, Pei Tingsong wouldn\u2019t let the matter drop. In order to coax him first, Fang Juexia could only nod and agree, \u201cUnderstood. I\u2019ll wash your hair.\u201dHe moved the stool to the side of the bathtub, where Pei Tingsong\u2019s head was, and poured warm water on it carefully. \u201cToo hot?\u201d\u201cNot too hot.\u201dAfter squeezing some shampoo into his hands and rubbing his hands together, Fang Juexia placed his hands on Pei Tingsong\u2019s head and rubbed it gently. Looking at his silvery white hair, Fang Juexia laughed. \u201cYou had this on top of your head while doing your presentation today, didn\u2019t the teacher say anything to you?\u201d\u201cI was wearing a hat.\u201d Pei Tingsong said, \u201cThe teacher did say something to me\u00a0ah, they said that I presented especially well. And there were a lot of girls taking pictures of me, I saw them all.\u201d\u201cBecause you are very handsome.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s tone was calm and direct, as if he was making a factual statement. \u201cThis hair color also looks very good, it\u2019s like that of a cartoon character I liked before.\u201dPei Tingsong tilted his head back and looked up at him. \u201cSo do I look better or does he look better?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes drifted up, and it seemed as if he was seriously contemplating this matter. Pei Tingsong wasn\u2019t satisfied, feeling that he should have blurted out the answer \u2018you\u2019, so he scooped up a little water in his hand from the bathtub and splashed it on Fang Juexia. Fang Juexia smiled while ducking, teasing him, \u201cYou, you look better.\u201dPerfunctory.Pei Tingsong suddenly started squinting with one of his eyes. \u201cAh, I got it in my eyes, it really hurts.\u201d\u201cYou reap what you sow.\u201d Fang Juexia pulled his own clean face-towel towards himself and then pushed away the hand that Pei Tingsong wanted to use to rub his eye. \u201cI\u2019ll wipe it for you, don\u2019t move.\u201dHe leaned his upper body forward and drew close to Pei Tingsong. His fingers gently pressed against his upper eyelid while the index finger of his other hand poked gently through the towel, asking, \u201cIs it better?\u201dSuddenly, a hand gripped the back of his neck tight, after which, Pei Tingsong raised his head, kissed him on the forehead and then released him while saying, \u201cIt\u2019s good now.\u201dFang Juexia straightened up and covered his forehead without knowing why he did so. \u201cYou tricked me again?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Pei Tingsong looked up at him and said with a smile, \u201cI really just got something into my eyes.\u201dThe always-so-passive Fang Juexia complained a little in his heart before warning him, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to move, I\u2019m going to rinse you off now.\u201d\u201cCan you count all of them now? How many do I owe you now, little math genius?\u201dHe was talking about the number of kisses, and Fang Juexia certainly knew it clearly, but he acted as if he couldn\u2019t hear him. The little clock in his heart had now turned into a small account book, and the number jumped out on its own.\u201cWho says I am keeping count?\u201dHot water flowed between his fingertips and Pei Tingsong\u2019s hair, and the bubbles couldn\u2019t remain forever. Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t help but peek over. Pei Tingsong had closed his eyes, and both sets of his eyelashes were very long and dense, with the lines of his face that were both sharp yet still carried a youthful feel being a very rare feature. As his eyes kept drifting lower, what entered his view were the very muscular lines of Pei Tingsong\u2019s body that were half-submerged in foam.\u201cDone rinsing.\u201d Fang Juexia wiped his face with the towel and said, \u201cI\u2019m leaving, and you shouldn\u2019t soak for too long.\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201d Pei Tingsong sat up all of a sudden. When he flipped his wet hair back, he splashed Fang Juexia thoroughly with water. \u201cDon\u2019t go\u00a0ah.\u201d Then he picked up the tub of ice cream and said, \u201cThis can be eaten now. You just sit here, have some ice cream, and stay with me for a while longer.\u201dFang Juexia couldn\u2019t out-stubborn him. \u201cIn a moment, everyone else will be back.\u201d\u201cThey won\u2019t be that fast,\u201d Pei Tingsong said, holding the ice cream tub. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, what are you afraid of with them coming back, we aren\u2019t doing anything.\u201d The hot steam in the bathroom wafted around, and when the spoon dug into the ice cream, it had already gone soft, so it went in easy. He scooped up a little, ate some himself first, then scooped up a bigger spoonful and offered it to the side, in Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth\u2019s direction.They really hadn\u2019t done anything.He had just helped Pei Tingsong take a bath, listened to him talk, and stayed for ice cream.Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t used to being fed, especially by the youngest person in the group. This feeling of being taken care of was subtle. The ice cream had already reached his mouth, so he could just open his lips and eat it. Milky white ice cream sprinkled on his lips, softly sticking there.When Pei Tingsong looked at him, a fever started burning in his heart, and he put the ice cream aside and said, \u201cYou still have some on your mouth.\u201dFang Juexia reflexively reached out to touch it. \u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cHere.\u201d Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t point out where with his hand, instead drawing forward the moment his voice fell and licking the melted cream off his lips.Stunned, Fang Juexia watched him withdraw away from him with his own eyes, then saw him toss his wet hair with his hand and smile at him.\u201cSo sweet.\u201dHis body ignited in a flash, and his blood boiled up under the dazzling light of the bathroom. The scene from just now replayed repeatedly in Fang Juexia\u2019s mind, and his heart beat so fast that it was really close to jumping out of his chest.He couldn\u2019t stand this sudden attack of Pei Tingsong\u2019s. Every single time, it would mercilessly strike his heart, without leaving any time to apply first aid.\u201cEat it yourself\u00a0ba.\u201d Fang Juexia was ready to get up, but Pei Tingsong pulled at his wrist and said, \u201cYou want to run away just like that? I haven\u2019t even done anything yet.\u201dIt seemed that running away was also very humiliating, making it seem as though he was the kind of person who couldn\u2019t bear to be teased. Fang Juexia thought to there, and the stubbornness in his bones reasserted itself a bit, so he looked at Pei Tingsong and said in as confident a tone as he could muster, \u201cThen what else do you want to do?\u201d\u201cThere are so many things I want to do, and they\u2019ll have to be ticked off one by one.\u201d Pei Tingsong rubbed his wrist, feeling Fang Juexia\u2019s protruding bones that were covered with a thin layer of skin. Rubbing his thumb against it gave a special feel, which was accompanied by a kind of thin, rich youthful kind of sexiness.\u201cYou also know, this is the first time I\u2019ve ever dated anyone. Both parties are novices, so we have to start everything from the beginning and learn slowly.\u201d Pei Tingsong raised his eyebrows and approached him under the sound of rushing water. His injured hand was on the edge of the bathtub, and his body was covered in beads of water that glittered under the warm light of the bathroom. \u201cAren\u2019t you very good at practicing? Why don\u2019t we practice kissing?\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgPractice kissing?Fang Juexia\u2019s whole body was thrown into turmoil, and his brain exploded with a buzz. He didn\u2019t know how Pei Tingsong had the face to utter these words so naturally. He was too different from himself, and he couldn\u2019t explain the logic of his behavior at all.The other side continued his victorious pursuit. \u201cIf you don\u2019t say anything, I\u2019ll take it as you agreeing.\u201d\u201cPei Tingsong.\u201d Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t say anything harsh, so he could only call out his full name.\u201cHere.\u201d Pei Tingsong smiled for a bit, then continued with his proposal; it was justified, well founded, and naturally unfolded. \u201cSee, you are three years older than me. You\u2019re a Gege, and naturally you understand more than me. So, will you teach me how to kiss?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Fang Juexia had a lump in his throat. He also had no experience in this area. Could this kind of thing really also be classified based on age?\u201c\u2026\u2026 I haven\u2019t kissed before, I don\u2019t know how,\u201d Fang Juexia pursed his lips and answered.\u201cThat\u2019s true, you are also a novice. Then what should we do?\u201d Pei Tingsong purposefully sighed. Suddenly, he seemed to think of something. \u201cHey, how about we compete\u00a0ba? One person at a time, and we\u2019ll see who is better. Whoever is better will be the one to teach the other.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s ears were completely red. \u201cHow can this be compared?\u201dKissing competition, just hearing about it made it sound ridiculous.Pei Tingsong was actually very serious, and his whole being was filled with energy. \u201cSince there is no third person, we can only judge each other. How\u2019s this, we\u2019ll each go once, and you go first.\u201d With that, he drew close to Fang Juexia, coming to a stop right in front of him, and seemed to be waiting for something.\u201cI won\u2019t compete,\u201d Fang Juexia retained the last bit of his clear-headedness and refused. \u201cThere\u2019s no use in winning anyway.\u201d\u201cWhoever said that?\u201d Pei Tingsong tempted him, \u201cIf you win, I\u2019ll listen to whatever you say. Okay, Gege?\u201dThis obviously wasn\u2019t some kind of worthy chip to play, no matter how he calculated it. Fang Juexia, a person who only relied on rational judgment and strategic decision-making for everything, had grown dizzy ever since he had met Pei Tingsong, and his logic and whatever else had all long been cast to the winds. Especially when hearing him call out \u201cGege\u201d, he would become someone barely hanging on for his life.\u201c\u2026just one round,\u201d Fang Juexia replied as his eyes drifted down.\u201cAlright, just one round.\u201d Pei Tingsong laughed contentedly. \u201cOne round to decide the outcome. You first.\u201dAfter hesitating for a few seconds, Fang Juexia felt that his breathing had grown even more ragged, but since he was several years older than Pei Tingsong, he shouldn\u2019t be\u00a0completely helpless\u00a0like this. Thinking in this way, he put his hand over Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes and summoned up the courage to draw their faces close together and stick his lips against his.He knew this was nothing and wouldn\u2019t rank in the kissing hierarchy at all. So he tried his best to search for relevant pictures in his brain, but his knowledge in this area was really too poor, so even if he had tried his best, he just\u00a0barely tasted\u00a0Pei Tingsong. A gentle bite was already his limit.This bite was Fang Juexia\u2019s limit, but in Pei Tingsong\u2019s perception, it was totally a seduction, a simple and clumsy seduction.\u201cThat\u2019s it, I\u2019m done.\u201d Fang Juexia left him with hot cheeks and pulled back his hand.\u201cAlright.\u201d Pei Tingsong cracked his neck and said, \u201cPlayer No. 2, Pei Tingsong is ready.\u201dFang Juexia was far, far away from him, and like a small animal hearing the footsteps of a hunter, was completely on guard. Pei Tingsong wanted to laugh. \u201cHey, for the sake of injured Player No. 2, can you get closer and make things more convenient?\u201dOnly after listening to him say this did Fang Juexia draw a bit closer. \u201cI forgot.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Saying that, Pei Tingsong stretched out his right hand to hold the back of his neck, and his whole person leaned up against Fang Juexia, kissing him while carrying the damp and hot water on his body, respecting his opponent\u2019s offensive posture. The carefully set trap turned slippery and soft at this moment. Prying into the depths, reaching into depths that he had never breached before, cleaning up all the oxygen there that could be plundered, leaving the other person with no chance for resistance.They didn\u2019t know whether it was a coincidence or some kind of punishment from God for their immorality, but a sound came from the outside. It was the sound of the dormitory door closing. His hearing had become extremely sensitive at this moment, and Fang Juexia could hear these sounds clearly through the bathroom door. He heard the sound of Lu Yuan placing the key on the porch cabinet at the door, and then the sounds of him changing his shoes and walking in.Not good. He tried to push Pei Tingsong away and interrupt this absurd and unfair competition.However, it was of no use at all. He was just a prey jumping into a trap.\u201cNo one here?\u201dThrough the door and the wall, Lu Yuan\u2019s voice grew clearer and clearer. \u201cAre you in your room, Xiao Pei?\u201dThe person in question was hiding in the bathroom and was totally incapable of responding.The voice outside the door changed into an uncertain monologue, \u201cIt can\u2019t be that he\u2019s wearing headphones again\u00a0ba\u2026Weird, where\u2019d my cellphone charger go\u2026\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s hands were powerless against Pei Tingsong\u2019s chest. Originally, he had wanted to push him away, but in the end, it turned into a hesitant embrace. He had been softly hooked and then stirred, and now like a whirlpool, he was being pulled down. The more he struggled, the deeper he sank.As their hearts beat together, the remaining aroma of the ice cream drifted through their wet exchange.Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand gently rubbed the soft tendon on the back of Fang Juexia\u2019s neck. He also didn\u2019t know why, but it seemed as if that was the only muscle still propping him up, so when Pei Tingsong kneaded it, Fang Juexia felt his whole person soften.The ice cream melted on his lips, and he melted into Pei Tingsong\u2019s arms.His sensitive nerves relaxed, then became paralyzed in the process of their entanglement, and they were about to reach the critical point, where he would end up losing all his wits. Yet, all of a sudden, Lu Yuan\u2019s voice came near again, this time sounding out from very close, almost as if it was right outside the door.\u201cIt\u2019s really hot.\u201dWhen the door lock on the bathroom turned, Fang Juexia woke up suddenly. The fear of being caught made him struggle ceaselessly, and he desperately wanted to push Pei Tingsong\u2019s shoulder away, but such an action was completely futile. This devil incarnate, who was impervious to reason or advice, feared no one.\u201cStrange\u00a0ah, is there anyone inside?\u201d\u201cXiao Pei?\u201dThis sound was magnified by the humidity, magnified by atmosphere, and lingered in his ears, creating a double-layered attack with the tactile sensations. This attack grew more and more intense, and Fang Juexia felt just like a character in a game. His health bar went down, shortening, and shortening again, and was at the moment right before it would go zero.He was saved.Pei Tingsong let go, with his hand on the back of his neck falling on his back. He turned towards the door and spoke to the voice outside as if nothing had happened, \u201cYuan Ge, I\u2019m in the bath.\u201d\u201cI was just talking about how I couldn\u2019t find you anywhere.\u201d Lu Yuan, who was outside, said, \u201cIs your hand okay?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good, call me if you need something\u00a0ah. I\u2019ll go play a game.\u201dWhen the last sentence in this exchange finished, Lu Yuan\u2019s footsteps also grew further and further away. It was really too dangerous to be separated by only one door. Fang Juexia\u2019s hand slid down, holding the wet edge of the bathtub as he gasped for breath. His mind was dizzy, and the oxygen in the bathroom was thin. This kind of feeling, where his heart continued to beat crazily, didn\u2019t fade away.Pei Tingsong embraced Fang Juexia, smiling at him, and rubbed the corner of his mouth with his thumb.\u201cDid I win, Gege?\u201dIn his eyes was a fire that had not yet been extinguished, burning wild in the wet rainy season.Fang Juexia tried very hard to restore his breathing to its usual speed. His forehead was damp and hot, and he couldn\u2019t tell whether it was from sweat or water vapor. He directly skipped the topic of winning or losing because this was an unfair competition in the first place.\u201cScared?\u201d Pei Tingsong lowered his head and pulled away the hair sticking to the side of his face.\u201cWe were nearly discovered,\u201d Fang Juexia let out a breath and whispered.\u201cIt\u2019s only exciting like that.\u201d Pei Tingsong raised his eyebrows. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s like we\u2019re having a clandestine love affair?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d He replied with the opposite answer, then tried to wriggle out of this embarrassing description by pretending to find fault with him, so he asked him, \u201cAre you really in love for the first time?\u201dPei Tingsong liked seeing Fang Juexia interrogate him like this, with his voice carrying a little bit of willful temper. Normally Fang Juexia had none of this, and no one had ever seen it.\u201cWhy do you ask like that? You don\u2019t believe me?\u201dFang Juexia looked up at him. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t seem like a novice at all.\u201d He deliberately grasped his neck and said, \u201cTalk, where did you learn that?\u201d\u201cDo I even have to learn that?\u201d The corners of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth rose, and he put his arms around Fang Juexia\u2019s waist to draw him in closer.\u201cI graduated the moment I saw you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He wasn\u2019t afraid of anything, and he was a naturally talented kind of competitor.\u201cReally amazing.\u201d Fang Juexia pushed him away, pulled the towel over, and threw it on his face. He turned his back and then whispered, \u201cDo you want me to give you a diploma?\u201dPei Tingsong wiped his hair. \u201cOh right.\u201d He came out of the bathtub, wrapped himself in a bath towel, and hugged Fang Juexia from behind. \u201cForget it, I\u2019m going to apply for the master\u2019s and doctoral studies.\u201dThe more he talked, the higher his spirits became. Fang Juexia elbowed him once, then remembered that Lu Yuan was right outside. \u201cHow can I get out later? Every time he plays games, he does so in the living room.\u201dPei Tingsong, holding his ice cream, went to the drying section of the bathroom, turned on the hair dryer, and started to blow-dry his hair. At the same time, he cracked open the bathroom door a bit, glanced over, then turned his head back and told Fang Juexia, \u201cHe\u2019s really in the living room.\u201dSure enough, Fang Juexia knew them all too well.\u201cI know what to do.\u201d Pei Tingsong drew close to his ear and whispered his idea to him. Fang Juexia felt that currently, he really was like a high schooler who was dating and was trying not to get caught in the act by their guardian, but he had no choice but to do so.Pei Tingsong turned off the hair dryer, cleared his throat, opened the bathroom door, and called out, \u201cYuan Ge.\u201d\u201cHey!\u201d Lu Yuan stretched his neck over, but his eyes were still pinned on the screen as he asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cUm, help me get a bathrobe, I forgot to bring one in. After soaking for a long time, I came out and found it was cold outside.\u201d Pei Tingsong poked half of his body out the bathroom door. \u201cIt\u2019s in my closet, on the far right, the dark gray one.\u201d\u201cOne minute\u00a0ah, just one minute, will go immediately.\u201d Lu Yuan had already stood up, but his head was still hanging as he concentrated on the final melee, all the way until the game ended. \u201cGot it.\u201d He ran down the bedroom corridor without even putting on his slippers.Fang Juexia, hiding behind Pei Tingsong, seized the opportunity to go out.\u201cHey, wait!\u201dUpon seeing Lu Yuan come back, Pei Tingsong quickly and agilely blocked Fang Juexia. \u201cWhat?\u201dLu Yuan scratched his head and asked, \u201cWhat did you just say? Get what?\u201dPei Tingsong was in a good mood, and so found this amusing. People who were playing games were really no different from deaf people. \u201cBathrobe, a dark gray bathrobe, it\u2019s right there in my closet.\u201d\u201cOh, right, right, right, ugh, my brain.\u201d Lu Yuan turned around and said, \u201cWait there, don\u2019t come out\u00a0ah. Otherwise you\u2019ll catch a cold in a bit.\u201dHearing his voice fade away, Fang Juexia hurried out of the bathroom and sneaked into the living room like a thief. As soon as he got to the entranceway, he heard Lu Yuan\u2019s voice. He was so scared that his shoulders trembled, and he quickly stuck himself against the wall.\u201cWhy can\u2019t I find it\u00a0ah?\u201dPei Tingsong broke out in a cold sweat and said, \u201cYou can just grab any one\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cAh, found it.\u201dAfter he heard this, Fang Juexia immediately ran to the main entrance, opened the door, and slipped out. With his back against the door, Fang Juexia breathed a long sigh of relief.He had finally managed to escape; this was even more exciting than when they were filming \u2018Escape For Your Life.\u2019Fang Juexia looked down and saw the slippers he was wearing. He didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry; he really was too miserable. Originally, he was going to take a few moments to calm his heart down outside, but he didn\u2019t expect to see the up symbol on the display screen of the entrance elevator not far away.Someone was coming back?A pincer attack was converging, and Fang Juexia didn\u2019t dare to stay at that spot any longer. He quickly opened the door using the facial recognition lock, pushing it open and entering as if nothing had happened.Fortunately, Lu Yuan wasn\u2019t at the main entrance, otherwise it would have been awkward to catch sight of Fang Juexia in his slippers.\u201cWho\u2019s back?\u201dHearing Lu Yuan\u2019s voice, Fang Juexia answered, \u201cMe.\u201d His heart felt weak as he walked into the living room, and he just happened to see Lu Yuan come out of the bedroom with a white bathrobe in his hand. \u201cJuexia, didn\u2019t you go home earlier than me? How come you\u2019re only back now?\u201dWatching him carry the bathrobe to the main bathroom, Fang Juexia explained, \u201cI\u2026 I went out again later.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Lu Yuan, who had accomplished his mission, went around and returned to his position, soon flopping back onto the sofa. But then, for some reason he flipped over again, just like a carp jumping out of the river, and stared at Fang Juexia. \u201cWhy are you so damp, is it raining outside?\u201dOnly at this time did Fang Juexia discover that his top was already completely stuck to his body, and his hair was dripping with water and sticking to his face. He wasn\u2019t a person who lied very often, so when he opened his mouth, he started to stammer, \u201cAh, because, I just\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re sweating like this after you run, and you\u2019re still not going to take a bath\u00a0ah.\u201d Pei Tingsong put on his bathrobe and came out of the bathroom. He glanced at Fang Juexia and then threw the tie of the bathrobe in his hand over onto Lu Yuan. \u201cYuan Ge, help me tie it up.\u201dSeeing Pei Tingsong break his siege, Fang Juexia hurriedly went down the ladder he had brought and escaped the situation. \u201cRight, I have to take a bath, I\u2019m sweating all over.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so awesome\u00a0ah, Xiao Pei. You\u2019re all hurt, but you can still undo and take off all your clothes on your own?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, otherwise how could I get on \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019?\u201dCoincidentally, it was then that the rest of the people came back, and the dormitory grew noisy. Fang Juexia stood alone in the bathroom and helped Pei Tingsong by putting all of his changed clothes into the washing machine. He also took off his half wet shirt and threw it in.He didn\u2019t know why, but just seeing their clothes fall in the same place made Fang Juexia\u2019s imagination run wild, with his face going red and his heart leaping.So it turned out that love was this kind of feeling.After taking a bath, Fang Juexia was pulled by Ling Yi into playing a game. Although he seldom played games on weekdays, he was actually a very good player at this type of game and often carried his teammates. After all, he had good technique, excellent psychological quality, and high concentration, which was a kind of playing method that aimed very few cruel words towards one\u2019s own teammates.Ling Yi kicked his legs excitedly. \u201cJuexia, we\u2019re going to\u00a0eat chicken\u00a0in this match again!\u201dFang Juexia, who was wearing earphones, didn\u2019t speak, let alone relax his vigilance.He Ziyan opened up a beverage can and sat down beside Ling Yi. \u201cAgain? How many matches have you guys won?\u201dLing Yi proudly twisted around a bit. \u201cTwo, isn\u2019t it awesome?\u201d\u201cJuexia really is 6, last time when we said that we\u2019d livestream it for the fans, he wouldn\u2019t even let us.\u201d Lu Yuan said, \u201cHow nice it would be to have a livestream for fans to enjoy\u00a0ah.\u201dWhen Fang Juexia was gaming, he would be too focused and didn\u2019t really listen to what they were saying, nor did he respond. He felt that there seemed to be footsteps approaching him. Just as he was turning to check, he suddenly heard Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice.\u201cReally? So strong? Let me also have a look.\u201dAs soon as he got close, Fang Juexia smelled the same shampoo aroma on him as the one he had. Pei Tingsong sat next to him, placing his chin on his shoulder.Fang Juexia\u2019s heart suddenly grew chaotic for a few seconds. Because of this, he was surprise-attacked and shot at by the only remaining group of enemies. Upon seeing the green liquid splashing on the screen, Fang Juexia immediately reacted and hid behind a tree. After finding the right position, he counter-attacked and killed one of the enemies quickly.\u201cWow, really great.\u201dThe heat of his breath as he spoke sprayed onto Fang Juexia\u2019s ear, making his heart feel flustered. He dodged a bit from the proximity and said, \u201cGo over there a bit, don\u2019t let your hand bump into me.\u201dBecause of you, I almost ended up dying.When the last person showed themselves, Fang Juexia directly knocked them down, then finally let Ling Yi make a few shots to earn a kill.\u201cYay!\u201d Ling Yi was so happy that he threw his cellphone away, hugged Juexia, and then peppered him with a lot of kisses on his head as he exclaimed, \u201cJuexia, you are my God!\u201dUpon suddenly receiving so many kisses, Fang Juexia\u2019s first reaction was to actually look at Pei Tingsong while wearing an expression of complete confusion.Pei Tingsong felt that his head had turned a\u00a0glowing green, as green as that box lying in the grass that the enemy player had turned into after dying in the game. He pulled Ling Yi away with one hand. \u201cStep aside, why are you kissing and hugging every single day?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You\u2019re not happy\u00a0ah! You\u2019re homophobic\u00a0ah!\u201dWith such a big\u00a0pot\u00a0getting smashed onto his head, Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWho\u2019s homophobic\u00a0ah! Who are you saying is homophobic?!\u201dThe two little children started to attack each other, and besides Fang Juexia, who was still stuck between them and trying to awkwardly mediate, the other guys who had already gotten used to this a long time, had already formed a team to play a new match.\u201cHey, my Yuan, you go over there a bit further.\u201d\u201cThree Water, hand me those chips.\u201d\u201cThis flavor? Or this one?\u201dPei Tingsong pressed Ling Yi\u2019s head, but his mouth was still blaring, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, being homophobic is like being deeply closeted!\u201d\u201cYou can say I\u2019m deeply closeted, you can\u2019t say I\u2019m homophobic.\u201dAs soon as these words were uttered, the rest of the members all stopped moving their hands around and turned their heads towards Pei Tingsong in unison.Fang Juexia just wanted to quit this group conversation at that very moment.The next morning, they went to MLH to record a new promotional performance. This time, they were dressed in a set of white\u00a0Tang jackets, which gave the feel of being martial arts practitioners in the Republic of China\u00a0era. Pei Tingsong\u2019s sling matched along with\u00a0 the style unexpectedly well, and also because of him performing with his injury, the fans on scene were also more enthusiastic.Originally, when he was singing \u201cTen steps and a person will be dead and maimed\u201d, Pei Tingsong\u2019s dance move was to grab Fang Juexia\u2019s collar, and then the two of them would suddenly draw close together, but because he was injured now, Fang Juexia changed from being passive in this killing action\u2019s part, instead now moving forward to take the initiative. He held the folding fan as he moved forward, swept Pei Tingsong\u2019s arm with the back end of the fan, and then finally used it to lift up his chin.This new move caused the supporting fans below to grow excited and start screaming, and the tension between the two of them was magnified as it collided heavily on the stage. Chasing Kaleido would produce more little surprises than when chasing other boy-bands. You would just never know how many adaptations and improvisations this group would incorporate when singing live. Just like the implied meaning behind the word Kaleido when it was being founded, this boy-band was indeed like a kaleidoscope, always shifting and changing.Kaleido\u2019s experience in just one week could be described as being the stuff of an Internet legend. Before, almost all the first places of the major song playing programs had been completely dominated by Seven Luminaries, which had already become a normal situation for this \u201cheavenly group\u201d. Yet, just a week later, these six boys, who weren\u2019t even worthy of counting as being Seven Luminaries\u2019 opponent in everyone\u2019s eyes, were now prime candidates for the award, with millions of people waiting anxiously for the host to announce the result.From the corner of his eye, Fang Juexia could see Liang Ruo standing not far away. He stood at the corner with his group and looked over at him once before looking away.He couldn\u2019t describe what kind of feeling this was, and Fang Juexia\u2019s feelings at this moment were complicated. Finally, he could also compete openly with his friends, those who had once practiced and struggled together with him, without having to bear any of the prejudice or burdens imposed by the aura of the past.He had really waited for this day for too long.\u201cThis season\u2019s first place, for Music Live Hall, will either be Seven Luminaries or Kaleido! Now I\u2019d like to announce the achievements of these two groups!\u201dThis was the first time they\u2019d been in the running to win. Ling Yi was too nervous to look, but Lu Yuan read all of it seriously. \u201cWow, our numbers are that strong?\u201dThere wasn\u2019t much of a difference between the two sides in terms of the sales volume for their albums. Because Kaleido had more passers-by who bought their album, in terms of sales, they had a big advantage. The playback numbers for \u201cBreak Through\u201d was twice that of Seven Luminaries\u2019 new album. Combining the total score of these two items put Kaleido far ahead.\u201cFinally, let\u2019s take a look at the voting section!\u201d This section depended on die-hard fans. The number of fans Seven Luminaries possessed was always their strong point, and that was also why they would almost always win first place in these music playing programs. With this vote, they still had room to stage a comeback.As the host\u2019s voice dropped, two numbers appeared on the big screen \u2014 89,987 votes for Seven Luminaries and 87,092 votes for Kaleido.\u201cCongratulations Kaleido!\u201dEveryone had guessed that the result might be in favor of Kaleido, but no one had thought that K would attain so many votes, to the point where they could actually nearly reach the same number of votes as Seven Luminaries, who had debuted as a first tier group.Even Fang Juexia didn\u2019t think that they actually turned out to have gained so many fans with this comeback.Seeing that the six members of K were a little stunned, the host quickly handed the trophy and microphone to Jiang Miao. \u201cCongratulations to all of you!\u201dCompared with many big prizes, this small, little trophy didn\u2019t count as anything at all. Some singers and groups could get seven or eight or even ten of these during their album\u2019s promotional period. However, this was a very hard-fought win for Kaleido, who had never won first place for anything before. It also meant a new start.Jiang Miao\u2019s eyes stung a bit, and he didn\u2019t know what was happening to him, but it felt like all their experiences from the past two years were playing back in reverse order in front of his eyes. However, he still maintained the attitude that a group leader should have. \u201cThank you very much to every Domino who supports us, and thank you President Chen and our agent, Qiang Ge, for never giving up on us. Thank you to all the staff who have devoted themselves to this album. Thank you.\u201dStanding in a corner backstage, Cheng Qiang\u2019s nose also started stinging while listening to this. It wasn\u2019t so much that they hadn\u2019t given up on these six children as much as they had never given up on themselves.Jiang Miao finished talking and handed the microphone to Fang Juexia, who seldom spoke. When he got the microphone, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t know what to say for a moment. After thinking about it, he said, \u201cThank you everyone, you\u2019ve all worked hard during this period of time.\u201d He saw all the fans below start crying, and not only thought that they were cute, but also felt a bit distressed for them. \u201cDon\u2019t cry\u00a0ah.\u201dThe fans below cried and shouted, \u201cEven Ling Yi is crying!\u201dAs soon as Fang Juexia turned his head back, he saw Ling Yi sniffling his cries, even as he tried to hide behind He Ziyan. Lu Yuan dragged him out again and said, \u201cAren\u2019t you losing face?\u201dThe microphone was transferred from Fang Juexia\u2019s hand to Pei Tingsong. \u201cI\u2019m not fit to speak on official occasions.\u201dThese opening words made everyone laugh, and he continued, \u201cWe\u2019re very happy to get this award. It\u2019s the first time that the six of us have won an award, and it\u2019s a much happier event than I imagined. Thank you all for letting us continue standing on the stage. Maybe we are not the most perfect idols in everyone\u2019s hearts, but we will try our best to better ourselves.\u201d Saying that, he deliberately pretended to be angry and teased, \u201cLing Yi, stop crying, you\u2019re being so loud that I can\u2019t even stir up any emotions.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dFinally, Ling Yi was caught by the others. Lu Yuan put the microphone to his mouth as a public punishment. He was crying so hard he was sniffling and hiccupping, and his speech was completely muffled, \u201cTha-thank you\u2026hic, everyone.\u201dHe Ziyan joked, \u201cSorry guys, Ling Yi is too full from breakfast.\u201d As soon as he released his hand, Ling Yi quickly moved away from the microphone and fell into Fang Juexia\u2019s arms, and Fang Juexia then rubbed his hair.Winning for the first time in a promotional performance made these several people cry and laugh. Other singers and groups present on the stage came to congratulate them one after another, including Seven Luminaries. Liang Ruo walked towards Fang Juexia and held out a hand. \u201cCongratulations.\u201dHe is much thinner than before; perhaps their comeback had also been very tiring.Fang Juexia gave a friendly smile, briefly held his hand, and then released it. \u201cThank you.\u201dThe accompaniment for \u201cBreak Through\u201d was played again on the stage, and then it was encore time. Only the six K members were left on the stage, and they played a rock-paper-scissors game while singing in a carefree fashion. Whoever lost in the game had to do a plank on the ground. The injured Pei Tingsong squatted beside them, keeping time and rapping, and the scene was very funny.After the filming, the six people immediately changed their clothes to a different style and rushed to the autograph event.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgAutograph events were almost one of the most desired activities for fans. They could get close to their favorite idols, line up in turn, and everyone had the opportunity to shake hands and chat with their idol, or even have more interaction than that. After the autograph session, there would be a long period of chatting and playing some games, which were all benefits that were usually unavailable.Star Chart sorted out the album purchasers from those who bought the most to the least, and then the top 1000 were selected to draw lots. The 500 lucky winners would then be able to participate in the autograph event.Kaleido\u2019s autograph events originally had always seen very sparse attendance. Not many fans had come when they had debuted, and later, when they had released their second mini album, they hadn\u2019t held an autograph event at all. So this comeback\u2019s autograph event was something their fans had been waiting a whole two years for.With the increase in fans, Star Chart was afraid of accidents, so it had changed the autograph venue from a semi outdoors venue to an interior one, and they had also added more security personnel, especially around Pei Tingsong.When the six of them appeared in the stadium, the screams were mixed with the clicking sound of camera shutters, and looking out across the venue, one could see that it was all\u00a0station\u00a0Jies holding SLR cameras.Jiang Miao looked around and said, \u201cLet\u2019s greet everyone first. One, two, three\u2026\u201d\u201cHello everyone, we\u2019re Kaleido!\u201d The six people bowed together, then straightened up and waved to everyone.The style for the autograph event was more comfortable and casual. Pei Tingsong was looking very American, with a black hair band, a wide white T-shirt, a blue jersey on top of that, and baggy pants with limited-edition\u00a0AJs to finish it off. Fang Juexia\u2019s long hair was tied behind his head in a low pony-tail. His upper body was wrapped in a white shirt with a lead gray sweater on top, and his lower body was covered with light blue jeans that had holes in them.Based on their official positions, the six people sat from left to right in front of a long signing table, and wearing a particularly cool mask made of shiny\u00a0laser fabric, Xiao Wen gave them a heap of signature pens, dividing them up between the six people like he was dividing up snacks for kindergarten children.\u201cHey, Xiao Pei, you have just one hand, what are you doing taking so many?\u201dLing Yi sarcastically taunted, \u201cHahahaha, that\u2019s right\u00a0ah. One hand and still taking so much.\u201dPei Tingsong leaned over Fang Juexia and threw a small paper ball at Ling Yi. \u201cShut up.\u201d\u201cEnough, are you guys children?\u201d Fang Juexia pressed on Pei Tingsong\u2019s shoulder, and really seemed a bit like a teacher.The songs from the \u201cBreak Through\u201d album were playing in the stadium, and Cheng Qiang picked up the microphone to announce, \u201cThank you everyone, for coming to Kaleido\u2019s autograph event. Next, please come to the stage in the order arranged by the staff.\u201dThe first one who came up was a male fan, with red hair, and two strands of glittering lady earrings. When he came up to He Ziyan, his two small feet came together, and he jumped up and down excitedly.\u201cZiyan Ge, I\u2019m your super diehard fan!\u201dHe Ziyan had just gulped a mouthful of a drink and almost spat it out because he saw the big T-shirt on the boy\u2019s body, which bore a photoshopped \u201cgroup picture\u201d of him and the boy.\u201cHoly crap,\u201d He Ziyan couldn\u2019t help saying to Lu Yuan beside him, \u201cI actually have a male fan!\u201dLu Yuan was already nearly dying from laughter. He autographed things for his fans while saying, \u201cIsn\u2019t it\u00a0ma, and you guys even have the same hair color.\u201d\u201cI dyed it for Ziyan Ge.\u201d The male fan\u2019s whole face was completely red. \u201cI really especially like you! This is my gift to you, Ziyan Ge! And a letter I wrote to you!\u201d\u201cWow, thank you, I\u2019ll have a good look at it.\u201d\u201cCongratulations to you guys for getting first place! Finally, our little obscure K ranked!\u201d\u201cYou guys already know that so soon\u00a0ah.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t a unique event, and everything had its counterpart. A rare male fan appeared over on He Ziyan\u2019s side, sandwiched in the middle of a large group of girls, who were all burning with ardor and confessing. On Fang Juexia\u2019s side, another one appeared, one who went straight up to him.Fang Juexia, who had signed autographs for several girls in succession, now was already using a much gentler voice. \u201cHello, would you like to\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish talking, a bunch of roses were proffered over to him. Fang Juexia looked up in surprise and saw a tall boy. He sort of didn\u2019t know what was going on. \u201cThis is?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s for you, I really like\u00a0you\u00a0very much!\u201dPei Tingsong saw this, and the pen in his hand fell on the table. The fan in front of him shyly pushed the album over and requested, \u201cXiao Pei, please sign here for me.\u201d\u201cThank you\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia also seldom saw any male fans, so he felt a bit at loss. He reached for his bouquet and put it to one side. \u201cIt\u2019s very beautiful, thank you.\u201d He kept the smile on his face. \u201cDo you have any special requirements for the autograph?\u201dThis male fan, who looked like a very upright young man, declared, \u201cYes, my name is Youwei, the Youwei in \u2018young and promising\u2019, and I also want Juexia to write a sentence\u2014\u2018Happy 20th birthday Youwei, love you.\u2019 Um, and it would be perfect if\u00a0you\u00a0would also draw me a heart after that.\u201dLove you???When Pei Tingsong heard this sentence, his pen directly slipped from his hand to draw out a straight line on the album. Looking up at the female fan in front of him awkwardly, Pei Tingsong explained, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u00a0ah, I only have one hand, and it\u2019s a bit unstable. It\u2019s alright, watch, I\u2019ll draw you an arrow through the heart.\u201dSaying that, he really did draw it. The line was changed into an arrow and a big heart was drawn in the middle.Pei Tingsong turned the album over to his fan and said, \u201cLook, this arrow piercing the heart that I drew, doesn\u2019t it look up to standard?\u201dThe cute little fan immediately started to clap like a seal. \u201cStandard! Looks nice!\u201dFang Juexia, who was seated right next to him, still felt it a bit strange after signing it. \u201cDo you want to add a surname? Will it seem a bit strange just to write Youwei?\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d The male fan\u2019s face was wreathed in smiles, his whole being brimming with happiness as he said, \u201cThis way seems more intimate.\u201dIntimate\u2026Pei Tingsong handed the album back to his fan with a genial smile stuck to his face. She didn\u2019t know why, but the fan kept feeling that he was off, and she felt a bit numb when he smiled. \u201cThank you, Xiao Pei. Xiao Pei, you need to keep fighting\u00a0oh.\u00a0Get better soon.\u201dPei Tingsong raised his uninjured hand and waved at her. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m very good\u2026\u201dThe male fan took the album from Fang Juexia\u2019s hand, not even being able to hide the smile on his face. Once he shook hands with Fang Juexia, he wouldn\u2019t even let go. Pei Tingsong leaned against the back of his chair and coughed.Ling Yi leaned over and glanced at Pei Tingsong.\u201cMy throat feels really bad. This weather is really too dry.\u201d Pei Tingsong insincerely explained, then took the opportunity to grab the Wangzai milk in front of Fang Juexia, unwrapped the straw with one hand, and poked it into the box.The male fan, who had just loosened his hand, spoke up, \u201cThank you Juexia, Juexia, you\u2019re so good!\u201dOf course he\u2019s good, what do we need you to say that for?He couldn\u2019t poke the straw into the hole of the box at his first try, so he aligned it again.\u201cJuexia, I love you!\u201dSquelch, the straw once again slipped to the side. Pei Tingsong angrily threw the straw to the side.No, were all male fans so flippant now?!Fang Juexia kept nodding his thanks and watched the boy reluctantly move away from his seat towards Pei Tingsong\u2019s seat.Forget it, forget it. Pei Tingsong straightened up and took up his pen to sign. Whatever the case, he was also an idol, so how can he be angry with his fans? Even if you were angry, you still needed to keep autographing smoothly for fans. He was, after all, the good-tempered gentleman, Xiao Pei. Keeping it real was one thing, but for fans, they should still obediently perform fanservice.As a result, Pei Tingsong, who had managed to sort out his mental state, raised his face and gave a fake smile to the die-hard male fan who had just come from Fang Juexia\u2019s seat. \u201cHello, what do you want me to sign?\u201dWho would have known that that male fan would turn cool in a second. \u201cOh no need, I just wanted Juexia\u2019s autograph.\u201d\u2014The author has something to say:[The number of votes is right. If you look at the original text carefully, the award is from the total score of the three parts (playbacks, album sales, and fan vote). Kaleido and Seven Luminaries had close album sales, close vote counts, but K had more playbacks. ]Describing the autograph event is just for fun, and stopping here is just to be funny. Next chapter will still be the autograph session. Don\u2019t take it seriously, don\u2019t take it seriously, don\u2019t take it seriously, and don\u2019t bring up stuff in real life, let\u2019s count it as me begging you guys.Kaleido autograph session is also known as \u201cMajor CP fancily giving out fluff &amp; Kaleido cross talk conference\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-The following is a furtive conversation between TingJue CP station sisters:\u201cJuexia really looks so good. Wuwuwu, today I also shed tears for Juexia\u2019s beauty.\u201d\u201cAhhhhhhhh, quickly look, is Xiao Pei mad, look at his terrifying smile!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really breaking the rules to give red roses at an autograph event. Xiao Pei, learn from others!\u201d\u201cThat Wangzai milk is too innocent\u00a0ba. Some\u00a0vinegar\u00a0kings really take these little things to get angry\u00a0oh,\u00a0tchtchtch\u2026\u201d\u201cReally jealous over there, so, so sour.\u201d\u201cAh, that male fan skipped Xiao Pei! Hahahaha what kind of scene of bloody slaughter is this?\u201d\u201cMy eyes turn red when I see my love rival!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re making up such a long story, talking as if it was real.\u201d\u201cYes, hahaha, fake, fake, it\u2019s all fake.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Please autograph for me, troubling\u00a0you.\u201d He also bowed.He just knew it.Pei Tingsong pulled at the hair band on his forehead. \u201cAlright\u00a0ba. Seeing as we\u2019re both 20 now, I\u2019ll write \u2018Forever twenty\u2019\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cThank you, thank you,\u201d The male fan quickly added, \u201cBut Juexia said in an interview before that his ideal type was a more mature person, so I think I still need to grow up more quickly.\u201dPei Tingsong had just written out an \u201cF\u201d, and he nearly ended up turning it into \u201cFuck.\u201dAs soon as he heard this, Fang Juexia roused himself and raised his head. First, he looked at that upright young man who was wearing a completely sunny expression. Then he glanced at Pei Tingsong, who was on the verge of losing control of his facial expression. Finally, he quickly turned his head to Ling Yi, who was watching the show, and asked in a low voice, \u201cWhen did I say that?\u201dLing Yi also whispered, \u201cHow do I know when you made such a thing up\u2026\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d The smile on Pei Tingsong\u2019s face grew more and more kind. \u201cThen I\u2019ll wish you an early maturity.\u201d When he signed the album, the strength he used was extraordinary. The sound of his pen scratching against the album sounded scary, but Pei Tingsong still presented the signed album back with a smile. \u201cHere you go.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d The male fan took hold of the album and put it in his bag, then he held onto Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand with both hands with an expression that showed complete earnestness.Heh, he still knows to be distressed for a wounded member ah. It seemed that this fan still had a conscience.Pei Tingsong took the lead and said, \u201cNo need to wish me better soon\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease take good care of our Juexia!\u201d The male fan held Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand tightly and cut off his speech with this request.No? Wait a minute\u2026.Whose?Our Juexia???Fang Juexia, watching all this from the side, felt both awkward and amused, so he could only bury his head in autographing things for his little fans. Ling Yi was pulling the fans in front of him to watch the show together, laughing joyfully.The veins in Pei Tingsong\u2019s forehead were about to pop out, but fortunately, his hair band covered him up. \u201cWhat are you talking about\u2026\u201d\u201cAlthough I know you guys are just doing fanservice!\u201d The male fan continued, \u201cBut\u00a0please\u00a0take more care of our Juexia! Our Juexia really has a difficult time!\u201d With that, he released his hand and bowed again to Pei Tingsong, who hadn\u2019t yet pulled his hand back.Pei Tingsong\u2019s head started aching while listening to this. \u201cWait\u2026\u201dFanservice???Laozi is real! The absolute real thing!\u201cThis is a physical rehabilitation tool I bought for\u00a0you, as well as some nutritional supplements for calcium.\u201d The male fan took each of these items out of his bag, marketing them just like a pyramid-scheme salesman. \u201cI heard that boys over 190m tall actually have weaker constitutions, so you need to supplement your nutrition.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not weak at all!\u201dThis was totally questioning his physical strength! This was basically a personal insult!Looking at how close his family\u2019s little wolf dog was to jumping over the wall, Fang Juexia immediately came out to clean up the scene. \u201cThank you for your gift, I will urge Xiao Pei to take it.\u201dAs soon as the male fan saw Fang Juexia talking, his face once again showed a shy smile as he replied, \u201cThank you Juexia, I will find another chance to see you!\u201dFang Juexia humbly bowed his head and smiled. \u201cOkay, thank you very much for your support.\u201dAfter great effort, they managed to send this die-hard male fan off, and then Ling Yi opened his mouth, activating his gossip mode again. \u201cTall but weak, he\u2019s talking about the group bully who usually fights against both the heavens and the earth. I\u2019ll sing a song for you today called, \u2018You also have such a day.\u2019\u201dPei Tingsong picked up one of the\u00a0plushie bolas\u00a0on the table and pointed it at Ling Yi. \u201cShut up! I\u2019m not weak at all.\u201dLu Yuan handed the album in his hands to his fans using both his hands and said, \u201cYes, Xiao Pei has a great body, it\u2019s really delicious.\u201d\u201cRespect, Yuan Ge,\u201d Pei Tingsong saluted him.Lu Yuan returned the salute and continued, \u201cIt\u2019s just really a bit weak. He even needs someone to get him a bathrobe after he takes a bath.\u201dAll the fans standing at the side laughed.\u201cHahahahaha!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to do this job anymore.\u201dFang Juexia patted him on the back, looked at him, and smiled. From the fans\u2019 point of view below the stage, this smile was just like that of a Gege\u2019s doting smile towards the maknae. Then, he noticed that Pei Tingsong wanted to drink Wangzai milk that was in front of him, so he inserted the straw for him, and pushed it over to him. \u201cDrink\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cSure enough, the fans are like their idol.\u201dFang Juexia frowned suspiciously.\u201cYou\u2019re all heartless.\u201d Pei Tingsong picked up the straw and took a sip, and felt as if he had gone back to the terrible period when he had drunk Wangzai milk every day a year and a half ago.\u201cToo sweet.\u201d He frowned and put the milk down.In a natural manner, Fang Juexia picked up the box of Wangzai milk and took a sip of it. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dThe CP fans below saw the two people drinking from the same box of milk together, and it was so sweet that they just wanted to faint right then and there.Another new fan came up, wearing a T-shirt that looked like something a fan station had created. There were two small cartoon figures on it, one with blue hair, the other with long black and styled hair, and there were three big letters above the little people\u2014Nap.\u201cLing Yi! Do you remember me, Yiyi?!\u201dThis little girl was very enthusiastic. \u201cI\u2019m the stationmaster for the Nap CP station!\u201d She said this, then looked at Fang Juexia who was at Ling Yi\u2019s side and asked, \u201cJuexia, do you still remember me?\u201dTo be honest, Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t remember faces very well, so he thought about it carefully. However, since she had mentioned the Nap CP station, Fang Juexia guessed that she should be a big CP fan of his and Ling Yi\u2019s ship, so he nodded. \u201cHello.\u201dThe Nap stationmaster grew excited. \u201cAhhhhhhh, I\u2019m so happy!\u201dLing Yi also imitated her appearance to cry out, \u201cAhhhhhhh, I\u2019m so happy!\u201d Then he reached out and high-fived the girl.\u201cI\u2019ve brought you guys some of the things made by our CP station, there are dolls! And our photobook!\u201d The stationmaster worked hard to rummage through her Minion backpack.Ling Yi stared at her backpack. \u201cYour bag there looks really good!\u201d\u201cRight\u00a0ba, I\u2019ve got one for you, too!\u201d She found the dolls and photobooks, as well as the Minion backpack and Minion Polaroid camera she bought for Ling Yi, and offered them up. \u201cThese are all for you.\u201d\u201cThank you! I really like it!\u201dLing Yi wrote her requested words for the CP station on her album, and the station master put it away contentedly before shifting over to Fang Juexia\u2019s side. \u201cJuexia Gege, I bought you a new type of game console. It has Sudoku games and many difficult number puzzle games, which you can play before you go to bed.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Fang Juexia liked his present very much and took a few more glances at the box as he took it over.\u201cAnd there\u2019s also this, one photobook each for you and Ling Yi.\u201dFang Juexia accepted all the gifts she gave him one by one. He kept thanking her, and then signed everything based on her requirements.\u201cAh, I have one last little request.\u201dFang Juexia put the cap of his pen back on. \u201cAlright, tell us.\u201dMs. Stationmaster grabbed her backpack strap. \u201cCan Juexia and Ling Yi raise their hands together to make a heart?\u201dLing Yi put down his signature pen. \u201cOf course we can\u00a0la!\u201d Saying that, he raised his left hand and bent it into the shape of half a heart, obediently leaning his body against Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder.In the past, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t have any mental burdens when doing CP fanservice, but now, as long as he was doing fanservice for other CPs, he kept getting this chilly feeling emanating from behind him.Sure enough, as soon as he turned his head, he saw Pei Tingsong, who had finished autographing something, throw a genial smile in his direction.Fang Juexia pretended that he didn\u2019t see him. He quickly made a heart with Ling Yi and waved at the exiting cute Nap stationmaster.Turning his head and seeing Ling Yi show off the CP dolls everywhere, Pei Tingsong felt that it really wasn\u2019t to his taste.What about the TingJue CP station? Didn\u2019t they say that their CP was trending? That it was the number one most talked about CP?Fake, it was all fake!Just as he was cursing out his own family\u2019s disappointing CP fans, unexpectedly, a loli with short hair came up, and there were several big words written on her coat \u2014\u2018TingJue girl\u2019\u2014 on a background of blue skies overhead.Pei Tingsong, who had just wilted away, immediately grew energized.\u201cHello, Juexia!\u201d The loli with short hair had a little cartoon TingJue sticker stuck on her face. Fang Juexia looked up, thought it was very cute, and praised, \u201cThis sticker is very cute.\u201d\u201cReally?!\u201d The loli with short hair was so excited that she took out all the remaining stickers from her pocket. \u201cHere, mama,\u00a0pei,\u201d the little girl immediately corrected her words and said, \u201cI-I\u2019ll give all this to you!\u201dFang Juexia put the stickers away with a smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cAnd mine?\u201d Pei Tingsong inserted his tilted head and demanded, \u201cI want some too.\u201d\u201cGo back and share with Juexia\u00a0ba.\u201d The girl also deliberately added a sentence, \u201cJuexia gets first pick.\u201dBased on what?Pei Tingsong was perplexed; were his CP fans not even partial towards him?!\u201cI\u2019m the stationmaster of the \u2018Snow Imprisoned In Spring\u2019 CP station. We\u2019ve prepared too many gifts for you, so we\u2019ve delivered them all over to Star Chart by car. We wanted to give these few to you guys personally.\u201d The little head of the station first handed Fang Juexia the bouquet in her hand. Inside it were baby\u2019s breath, white eustoma, peonies, and white roses. They were all tied up with pearlescent paper and tied with light gray ribbons.\u201cWow, that is so pretty,\u201d Ling Yi added. \u201cIt\u2019s like a wedding bouquet.\u201dIt really was a bit like that. Fang Juexia really liked the color combination of the flowers. He thanked her twice and put the flowers on the table.The stationmaster took out a spectacle box, opened it, and handed a pair of special glasses, with gold chains on them, to Juexia. What was special was that there was a very delicate white flower on the left lens of the glasses.\u201cIt\u2019s a white eustoma made from resin, and we specially made it for you,\u201d she specifically explained.Pei Tingsong thought that that flower was beautiful and suited Fang Juexia very well. \u201cIt\u2019s really beautiful. Can you wear it to show it to them?\u201dFang Juexia nodded and put on the glasses. His left eye was covered by the eustoma, leaving only one eye on display. Immediately after, the rapid-fire clicking sound of shutters came from below the stage.\u201cToo beautiful!\u201d The stationmaster excitedly began to dig into her bag again. Seeing the beautiful glasses Fang Juexia got, Pei Tingsong naturally had higher expectations for his gift.\u201cThis is what we\u2019re giving Xiao Pei!\u201dAs soon as she took it out, Pei Tingsong\u2019s little expectant face collapsed. What he saw was a long string of Hawaiian style ornaments, with each ornament being a fist-sized cactus doll. The expression of each cactus was different; some were angry to the point that their eyebrows were nearly vertical, while some were cool and had sunglasses on.The stationmaster eagerly hung it on Pei Tingsong\u2019s neck. \u201cWe specially made this, and the cactuses there can be taken off\u00a0oh.\u201dPei Tingsong pinched the small green cactus, then pulled a bit on their soft thorns.Fang Juexia glanced at these little dolls, and his originally cold face suddenly filled with life, with his eyes brimming with affection. \u201cI\u2019m also raising a cactus, but it\u2019s the long, thin kind.\u201dOn hearing this, the loli with short hair suddenly burst out with a crowing sound, and turned her head to her sisters standing below, making an exaggerated expression excitedly, and even stamping her feet. This startled Fang Juexia to the point that he thought he had said something wrong, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dThe stationmaster\u2019s voice floated up, \u201cNothing, nothing, just feel that the cactus Juexia Gege is raising is very cute.\u201dAlright\u00a0ba. Pei Tingsong thought of the cactus that Fang Juexia was raising on the balcony, and he pinched the cactus doll a few more times. The more he looked at it, the more pleasing it actually seemed to the eye. \u201cIt\u2019s very cute, thank you\u00a0la.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome! And there\u2019s this one.\u201d The stationmaster took out a hairband and wanted to force Pei Tingsong to wear it. The security personnel standing next to Pei Tingsong moved to stop her, but Pei Tingsong held out his hand and stopped him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can let her help me put it on\u00a0ba. It\u2019s not convenient for me with one hand.\u201d\u201cThank you, Xiao Pei!\u201d The stationmaster put the hairband on him. On one side was a small soft cotton eustoma flower, and on the other side was a little cactus doll.\u201cDoes it look good?\u201d Pei Tingsong turned to Fang Juexia after wearing it.Fang Juexia stretched his hand and adjusted his bangs for him. \u201cVery cute.\u201dPei Tingsong was very satisfied, and even modeled a lot of cool poses for the station Jies carrying their SLR cameras below.The CP station Jie told them what she wanted them to sign, and then painstakingly exhorted them, \u201cJuexia Gege and Xiao Pei must take good care of their bodies, and must not get hurt again. We are all worried about your guys\u2019 health.\u201dPei Tingsong signed naturally and unrestrainedly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, look, doesn\u2019t it look quite handsome even though I\u2019m signing with one hand.\u201dFang Juexia also laughed and added, \u201cYou guys must also take care of yourselves.\u201d\u201cThank you, Juexia Gege, then I\u2019ll go\u00a0la.\u201d\u201cHey, wait a minute\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong thought\u2014How come their CP fans just don\u2019t try much, not even knowing to have the two of them make a heart gesture?He winked at the small stationmaster, and the small stationmaster who failed to understand his thought process also winked back at him.Tch.\u00a0Pei Tingsong made a heart gesture at her to remind her.\u201cXiao Pei, I love you, too!\u201d The stationmaster then gestured back with a heart too.Really\u2026Pei Tingsong gave up, \u201cUm, the two of us, let\u2019s make a heart\u00a0ba.\u201dHe elbowed Fang Juexia a few times and forcefully pulled him in to do fanservice. Of course, Fang Juexia wouldn\u2019t refuse. He was just worried about Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand, so even while they were making a heart, his empty right hand was supporting Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand in a sling.Only after listening to the clicks of the shutter and the excited screams of the fans did Pei Tingsong finally feel at ease.In the middle of the autograph session, they took a break, and the staff gave them some snacks and drinks, and also prepared some snacks for the fans below the stage.He Ziyan opened a bag of potato chips, took the microphone, and said to the fans below, \u201cOK, it\u2019s time for the elementary school sports meeting.\u201dLing Yi quickly got his point. \u201cWhen I was a child, every sports meeting was a snack meeting. Everyone brought a small bag of snacks to those events, and everyone traded and ate.\u201dJiang Miao joked, \u201cThat must be Yiyi\u2019s favorite school activity.\u201d\u201cHahahaha!\u201dLu Yuan tore open a bag of\u00a0Mimi prawn crackers. \u201cNow I want to eat\u00a0big spicy slices. But I can\u2019t, with so many cameras pointed at us, I can\u2019t lose the dignity of the beautiful main dancer.\u201dLing Yi clicked his tongue. \u201cReally shameless enough.\u201dThese four people chatted enthusiastically, while Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong were on the far right of the long table, living in another dimension.\u201cI\u2019ll stick a sticker on for you\u00a0ba.\u201d Fang Juexia poked Pei Tingsong\u2019s plaster with the tip of his finger and suggested, \u201cI\u2019ll stick it here.\u201d\u201cThen you choose a good-looking sticker.\u201dThe two of them buried their heads into the task and picked for a long time. Fang Juexia stuck the stickers they picked out one by one onto his fingers. Then, based on Pei Tingsong\u2019s request, he carefully stuck them on the plaster, forming a big letter P.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgPei Tingsong, now wearing a satisfied expression, showed off the stickers on his plaster to the people below the stage, with the little doll on his head swinging back and forth.On the other side, Ling Yi, who was tired from doing crosstalk with Lu Yuan, looked back, and saw that Juexia\u2019s chair had traveled to who knows where. Clearly, when they had arrived on stage, the staff members had spaced the chairs apart evenly, but now, there was enough space between him and Juexia to even insert another chair there.Just like the heart of its master.Ling Yi joked into the microphone, \u201cSo it turns out that Kaleido has a seventh member?\u201d Then he stretched his hand and sketched out a figure in the gigantic space between him and Fang Juexia. \u201cSee, friends, here he is.\u201dThe fans below the stage laughed, \u201cHahahahahaha!\u201dJiang Miao added, \u201cThis is the emperor member.\u201dHe Ziyan also joined in, \u201cWhat kind of supernatural event is happening at the Kaleido autograph event?\u201dLu Yuan tilted his stool and looked to the right. \u201cNot as handsome as I am, the appraisal is over.\u201dOnly then did Fang Juexia realize that he was the one being complained about, so he tried to shift his seat back to the right a bit, while explaining, \u201cI was just putting stickers on him.\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t move over. It won\u2019t be good if you squash the legs of our hidden member.\u201d Ling Yi made a show of being sad and kept talking, \u201cDon\u2019t explain, explanation is a cover-up. In this situation, I can\u2019t help but sing a song for this scene.\u201dSaying this, he really started singing, \u201cI\u2019m sitting on your left today, it\u2019s just like we\u2019re separated by the Milky Way~\u201d\u201cHahahahahaha drama queen Ling Yi!\u201d\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dFang Juexia could only helplessly smile and move the chair when Ling Yi wasn\u2019t paying attention. He also didn\u2019t know what was going on, but he couldn\u2019t help but keep getting closer to Pei Tingsong.The fans below the stage yelled his name, \u201cJuexia Gege! Can Juexia wear those glasses?! We want to take a picture of you!\u201dFang Juexia responded to every request. Once again, he put on the eustoma glasses that his fans had given him. With his scholarly style and long softly-black hair, he looked beautiful and refined.The station Jies went crazy to capture his beauty with their cameras, and then he heard some fans from the other side shouting, \u201cJuexia Gege! Can you hold the bouquet\u00a0ah?!\u201d\u201cYes! The bouquet is pretty!\u201dPei Tingsong laughed while complaining, \u201cLike a model.\u201d\u201cIs this okay?\u201d Fang Juexia picked up the bouquet based on their requests and smiled at the cameras below. He wasn\u2019t a person who would really fawn on his fans, or it could be said, who would really try to curry favor with fans.Compared to the many celebrities who interacted with fans by treating them like \u201cgirlfriends\u201d, Fang Juexia seemed to maintain more of a sense of distance. His Weibo pretty much didn\u2019t do any fanservice, and he usually wouldn\u2019t say things like \u2018love you guys\u2019 and so on. Adding on his naturally cold face, many people had misunderstandings about him, and there were even a lot of anti-fans who slandered him by saying that he had a cold face, never looked happy, and was very cold towards his fans.But only his real fans knew that while Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t good at expressing himself, he would sincerely express his thanks over and over again. He\u2019d help up fans who fell over at the airport and would hand tissues to the crying fans. He would truly care about them and act as if they were all in an equal friendship.After the photos were taken, Fang Juexia lowered his head to neaten up the flowers in the bouquet. He then heard Pei Tingsong at his side complaining in a low voice, saying that clearly, even though these were their CP fans, they hadn\u2019t given him a bouquet.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t look up and started laughing. \u201cDo you like flowers?\u201dPei Tingsong said honestly, \u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201dThe table blocked Fang Juexia\u2019s movements from the fans\u2019 view. Pei Tingsong continued to interact with the fans below, but if the fans said East, he\u2019d go West. The fans asked him to pick up the toy gun on the table to pose with for pictures, but he picked up the toy katana.Just when he was fighting with his fans happily, suddenly Pei Tingsong felt his elbow being touched. He turned his head and saw a bunch of small flowers entangled with ribbons in front of him.\u201cFor you,\u201d Fang Juexia said in a low voice.He had picked out every single eustoma from the bouquet, creating a snow white bunch of flowers, and was offering it to Pei Tingsong.Veiled love was hidden in every single eustoma, and only they knew about it, or else the whole world would know.Pei Tingsong blankly took the bunch of flowers and looked at Fang Juexia. One of his eyes was blocked by the eustoma blossom on his glasses, while the other was bright, reflecting his face.How could there be such a well-behaved, such a lovely person in this world?He really wanted to kiss him.Really\u00a0wanted to.\u201cThank you.\u201dPei Tingsong picked up his own bouquet and did all kinds of poses with it for fans to take pictures of.At this time, the staff came to them and handed them microphones. Fang Juexia took it and turned on the switch. As soon as he turned it on, Ling Yi brought him a sandwich. \u201cDo you want to eat, Juexia?\u201dFang Juexia nodded, put the microphone on the table, and turned to unpack the sandwich.The people on his right were still performing group crosstalk, and Pei Tingsong only cared about showing off the bouquet of eustoma that Fang Juexia had tied for him, not building on the tone of his bandmates at all.Fang Juexia hadn\u2019t eaten much this whole morning, and he hadn\u2019t had much time to eat at noon either. He was really a little hungry, but as soon as he took a bite of the sandwich, he felt that there was something in it. After a careful inspection, it turned out that it was pickles again. Whether it was fresh cucumbers or pickles, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t like them very much. He put the sandwich that he had taken a bite of back into the box, as he didn\u2019t want to eat it any more.Pei Tingsong seized on this little action again. He picked up the sandwich, picked out the pickles, and ate them by himself. He also complained, \u201cPickles are so good\u00a0ah, and yet you don\u2019t eat them.\u201dUnexpectedly, this sentence was amplified and broadcast directly through the microphone in front of them, and the whole venue heard it.Fang Juexia\u2019s whole body was petrified, not moving a muscle at all, and only his eyes were left spinning.His bandmates to the left all showed embarrassed expressions of having to close the closet door. He Ziyan let out a \u201cwow\u201d again, and then group leader Jiang Miao directly and subconsciously saved the show by intervening, \u201cAh, is Juexia being picky again? That\u2019s why our Juexia is so thin, the whole group knows he\u2019s picky.\u201dListening to the embarrassed laugh of their leader, Ling Yi, who hadn\u2019t recovered his senses, questioned, \u201cHow could I not have known this?\u201dLu Yuan leaned across Jiang Miao and attacked him, \u201cBecause you only know how to eat.\u201dPei Tingsong hadn\u2019t thought that the microphone was on, but turning it off now would make things look even more suspicious. He picked up the microphone and was ready to say something, but unexpectedly, a fan below suddenly yelled, being even louder than his voice.\u201cPei Tingsong, didn\u2019t you say you don\u2019t like pickles?\u201d\u201cYour voice is really loud\u00a0ah\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong took the microphone and inquired, \u201cWhen did I say that?\u201dThe fan who was talking to him continued to shout, \u201cDuring the interview for the pair cover for the magazine! The rapid-fire Q&amp;A session! You said that you like eating cheeseburgers best, with no pickles!\u201dThe following fans below all let out a, \u201cWow\u2026\u201d There was also a small group of CP fans covering their mouths and screaming within their midst.He Ziyan\u2019s expression was as if he was watching a good show. \u201cThis Meimei is really capable, with a loud voice and also a good memory.\u201dLing Yi looked at the pickles in his own sandwich and sighed, \u201cAlas, after so many years of pickiness and disgust, all for naught.\u201dOnly after hearing what the fan said did Fang Juexia remember. He carefully recalled the interview from back then, and Pei Tingsong truly did seem to have answered in this way at that time.So, in fact, he also didn\u2019t like pickles\u2026But every time, Pei Tingsong would pick out the pickles he didn\u2019t like to eat while lecturing him on how being picky was a bad habit.\u201cSo, I\u2019m not allowed to like them now?\u201d Pei Tingsong continued to argue for himself through the microphone, \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was delicious at the time of the interview. Later, after I ate them several times, I thought they tasted really good now, is that not okay\u00a0ah?\u201dAnother girl from below the stage yelled, \u201cReally flip-flopping!!\u201d\u2014The author has something to say :Nap CP doesn\u2019t imply an order, in Juexia and Ling Yi\u2019s CP, he\u2019s the gong (why am I explaining this??)In fact, Juexia has always been in the gong group! 180cm cold beauty gong!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014After the on-the-spot TingJue CP fans posted the photo previews and video clips to Weibo:@Snow Imprisoned in Spring CP station: [picture] [picture] [picture][Ahhhhhh, our Juexia\u2019s fairy beauty is being properly put on display today too 555][My God, this photo with glasses is so beautiful!

That\u2019s why no one can escape\u00a0flip-flopping\u00a0sometimes.\u201dAfter hearing him say that, the fans below the stage found that they actually couldn\u2019t refute it.They didn\u2019t know if he was flip-flopping for Fang Juexia, but everyone knew about his pickiness problem.It was a little cold in the venue, and a staff member brought Pei Tingsong a sweater to drape over himself. Unexpectedly, just then, the background music for the autograph event started to play their debut song \u2018Kaleido\u2019, and it was even the live recorded version. Just when the staff were ready to cut the song, all the fans below the stage began to sing along with the chorus. Ling Yi also picked up the microphone and said, \u201cDon\u2019t cut it, don\u2019t cut it.\u201dLu Yuan was in high spirits and moved his body with everyone\u2019s voice. \u201cThe war song of our early days has come.\u201d\u201cYou guys sing too well\u00a0ba.\u201d Jiang Miao gave the audience below a thumbs-up.The fans even sang He Ziyan\u2019s rap accurately, which surprised all six of them. Fang Juexia, who was a bit surprised, even began to clap after a while to help them keep their rhythm. Unlike Ling Yi, who could sing funny songs anytime and anywhere, he seldom sang during informal occasions. However, being in this kind of environment also infected him.Ling Yi held a microphone and sang the chorus along with everyone, \u201cFight! Fight! Fight! Enjoy falling in the wild wind. Fight! Fight! Fight! You will remember me after the storm\u2014\u201dAt the moment Pei Tingsong\u2019s famous impromptu rap was about to commence, Fang Juexia, who was concealed in this warm atmosphere, kept following, going from singing the chorus to rapping.Seeing Fang Juexia shake his head and sing his part, Pei Tingsong felt it was especially cute, so he put the microphone in his hand close to Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth, and thus the cool lead singer\u2019s rap debut was exposed to everyone.\u201cFrom this competitive auction show, haters aren\u2019t qualified to raise their hands, yo\u2026\u201dAs soon as Fang Juexia\u2019s voice reverberated throughout the venue, he was startled, and then retreated to just sitting and blinking like a frightened small animal.\u201cWoo!\u201d He Ziyan was the first to egg him on, \u201cContinue!\u201dPei Tingsong raised his eyebrows at him, and all of the fans below were also screaming. The lead singer Fang Juexia could only follow the rhythm and force himself to rap, \u201c\u2026.all my money rising tall. I am rich, oh I am fresh. Your little\u2026\u2026\u201d When getting to the \u2018bitches\u2019 part, Fang Juexia automatically switched it to, \u201cangels love me so.\u201dWhen he heard the word \u2018angels\u2019, Pei Tingsong smiled and shook his head.Lu Yuan started to laugh. \u201cHahahaha, even bringing in your own clean-up!\u201dJiang Miao said, \u201cImprovisation is Kaleido\u2019s family tradition.\u201dFang Juexia grew more energetic as he kept singing. He pulled the microphone directly out of Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand and finished the last few sentences with a very rare\u00a0speed. \u201cFakers have all been kicked away by me. Please, when picking opponents your standards are too carefree.Next stop is my universe, you have one second to escape and curse.\u201d\u201cWow, so strong!\u201d\u201cJuexia is super good!\u201dLing Yi maintained the dignity of a lead singer and didn\u2019t miss a single word of his own part. When the song arrived at Fang Juexia\u2019s part, he went for \u2018an eye for an eye\u2019 action and put the microphone in front of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth, who was completely unprepared for such a thing. So Pei Tingsong, a rapper, then began to sing passively while wearing a very complicated expression, \u201cThe soul has been burning, scorching with desire, and at this moment, it bursts into flames roaring.\u201dAfter he sang this bit, Fang Juexia immediately took back the microphone and carried on rapping Pei Tingsong\u2019s part. He also raised his eyebrows at him for a moment. \u201cSay hello to my ego.\u201dThis manner, together with this sentence, was quite provocative. However, Pei Tingsong liked it very much. He liked the lively Fang Juexia who could be both shy and childish, and who would also do things he had never done before under everyone\u2019s encouragement.Ling Yi didn\u2019t even stand up when he sang the last three high notes, just sitting there and laughing as he finished singing. This unexpected live debut song had been sung into a mess by them for its whole duration, but their fans were super satisfied.He Ziyan joked, \u201cNext time when Juexia solos, he can just rap\u00a0ba.\u00a0That would be a real ace.\u201dFang Juexia was consistent in only realizing things after the fact. He had been very happy while singing, but he felt a little embarrassed afterwards, so he kept waving his hands. Jiang Miao also started teasing, \u201cWhich lead singer doesn\u2019t dream of rapping?\u201dLing Yi put both hands on his own face. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201dJiang Miao broke in that moment. \u201cYiyi, are you just in charge of cutting out the ground from under my feet?\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dPei Tingsong leaned against his chair and quietly looked at Fang Juexia. His cool shell had suddenly been taken off, and in fact, he was a boy who would feel at a loss when he was being joked about. When he got excited, he would sing the part that didn\u2019t belong to him, and because he was too embarrassed to curse people out, he would change the lyrics from \u201cbitch\u201d to \u201cangel.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t notice Pei Tingsong\u2019s gaze, but occasionally, when he turned his head, he saw something. Jiang Miao then suddenly cued him, so he turned back to continue talking with them, but as soon as that conversation finished, Fang Juexia turned around again, just like a dedicated little robot, and confirmed to himself that he had an unfinished task on his mind. So, he reached out and grabbed the drawstrings hanging on the hood of Pei Tingsong\u2019s sweater with both hands. One was long while the other was short, and it was extremely asymmetric.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Pei Tingsong looked at him. However, Fang Juexia, who had obsessive-compulsive disorder, didn\u2019t have time to reply to him at all. Instead, he stared at the two little strings and pulled at them again and again, trying to get them to the same length.Yet, the more the cords were pulled on, the longer they got, and Pei Tingsong could even feel the hoodie behind him start to close tightly. However, he couldn\u2019t help it; if he didn\u2019t satisfy Fang Juexia\u2019s obsessive-compulsive disorder, there\u2019d be more trouble.So he indulged him until Fang Juexia pinched the two cords together and compared them accurately. He didn\u2019t give up until they were about the same length. \u201cDone.\u201dSeeing that he was satisfied, Pei Tingsong thanked him. He then turned his head to see his hood all shrunken up behind him.It didn\u2019t seem to have had much of a beautification effect in the end.Many of Fang Juexia\u2019s small details and actions may not be regarded as bright points by others. To put it bluntly, they were just trivial actions driven by human character and emotions. However, Pei Tingsong thought these were cute.In the past, he was used to standing in the position of having nothing in his heart, and so he idealized cutting out and judging other people\u2019s desires, while believing that people who couldn\u2019t balance the scales within their heart were just making a fuss over nothing.However, once he placed a person in his heart, Pei Tingsong finally realized that the perfect impartiality that people imagined was actually really difficult, very difficult, because now he had a preference for Fang Juexia all the time.In the middle of the break, everyone ate, drank, and played some games. The relationship between Kaleido and their fans had always been very much like that between friends. They joked with each other and fought a bit with each other. These six people were all very principled people. Even if they had always been very obscure since their debut, they seldom held events where they had in-depth communication with a few fans. After all, they just wanted to make music.At the end of their half-time break, Kaleido once again resumed signing autographs for the remaining half. The fans were all varied, which was quite eye-opening for them. The atmosphere remained happy all the way until the end, when Fang Juexia welcomed a somewhat special fan, who was also the last one in the line in front of him.This was a girl in plain clothes, around 16 or 17 years old. She hadn\u2019t brought anything, and she wasn\u2019t as emotional or enthusiastic as the other fans. On the contrary, she seemed very reserved, even a little timid.\u201cJuexia Gege, troubling you to autograph this for me\u00a0ba.\u201d Her voice was also very low, very light, and it was immediately drowned out by the noisy venue. Fang Juexia excused himself, then drew closer and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, and what would you like me to sign?\u201dThe girl lowered her head and replied, \u201cXiao Qi, the Qi with a\u00a0wang\u00a0radical\u00a0beside it. Could you sign\u2026 \u2018Good luck\u2019, that\u2019s enough.\u201dHer request was also very simple, but Fang Juexia saw that her mood wasn\u2019t right, so he wrote a \u2018Xiao Qi\u2019 before he stopped writing. He wasn\u2019t a person who often showed concern, but since she had appeared in front of him, Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t just ignore her.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cIf you\u2019re not in a hurry, can you chat with me a bit?\u201d Fang Juexia smiled. \u201cI feel like you\u2019re a little down.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know what was going on with that girl, but suddenly, after hearing this, she burst into tears. One by one, transparent tears fell on the back of her hand on the table. Fang Juexia immediately drew out some tissues and handed them to her. He heard her say \u2018thank you\u2019, and then she said to him, \u201cJuexia Gege, I\u2019m so tired.\u201d She sniffled. \u201cBefore I came here, I had a quarrel with my parents. They said\u2026 said I\u2019m a freak, that I wear earphones every day and don\u2019t say a word. They said that I\u2019m like a mute, and not like other people\u2019s children, who are cheerful and likeable. They always say this to me every day.\u201dFang Juexia listened in silence and patted her on the arm. Pei Tingsong and Ling Yi, who had finished giving their autographs, also noticed this. Ling Yi gave her a box of milk that hadn\u2019t been drunk yet and comforted her. Pei Tingsong wasn\u2019t very good at comforting people, so he just asked, \u201cEvery day?\u201dThe girl nodded. \u201cEn, because I\u2019m introverted, and I don\u2019t know how to get along with other people. Sometimes I also really want to talk as much as a cheerful child, but I can\u2019t. Mama always disdains me and thinks I\u2019m very shameful. Especially when there are many adults around us, they will scold me by saying that if they had given birth to a mute, at least that would be more likeable than me.\u201dShe raised her hand to wipe at her tears. \u201cI know I\u2019m very unlikeable and very boring, but I\u2019m just such a person\u00a0ah. Aren\u2019t they my closest people? Why are they still like this to me\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong immediately thought of Fang Juexia. His father was disabled and drunk when he was in middle school, and he would also let off steam like this and totally disparage Fang Juexia\u2019s entire being. What Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t know was that there were many such parents, and it was too easy for them to disparage a child.Fang Juexia was as calm as he ever was. He drew out another tissue and handed it to the girl. \u201cDid you know? I also have a very quiet personality, so I\u2019ve experienced pretty much what you experienced, with many people telling me that I\u2019m unsociable and solitary. The stereotype in our society is that being cheerful is better than being introverted, so every child should be taught to have a lively personality.\u201d He said softly, \u201cBut it\u2019s not actually true. Many times, being an introvert is just what someone\u2019s natural personality is, and they were born that way. For example, with you, listening to music gives you more comfort and security than communicating with others, right?\u201dThe girl nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Having a quiet personality is like a chip that solidified in your body when you were born, and it\u2019s very hard to change. Since it\u2019s very hard, then don\u2019t try to change, just be an introvert. Don\u2019t pay attention to other people\u2019s disapproval, let alone disavow yourself because of others. There are all kinds of people in the world; no character should be completely denied, and being an introvert doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re boring.\u201dPei Tingsong listened silently from the side and didn\u2019t speak. It was undeniable that he had also once held such prejudices against Fang Juexia, who was too quiet. He had complained that he was like wood, never reacting to anything. It turned out that Fang Juexia thought this way; he was not forced to lose his voice, in fact, he was being himself.The girl didn\u2019t continue to bow her head any more, but looked at Fang Juexia with tears in her eyes. There was still a trace of timidity in her eyes.Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t very good at encouraging others. He could only give logical examples from his familiar fields to the best of his ability. \u201cLet me give you an example\u00a0ba. Some mathematicians have tried to divide all natural numbers into interesting numbers and uninteresting numbers. Of course, the definition of \u2018interesting\u2019 is very subjective. For example, prime numbers are very interesting, and numbers with repeating digits are very interesting. In a word, as long as a number has a distinguishing trait, then it will be included in the set of interesting numbers. But later, the problem turned into a loose paradox \u2014 all natural numbers are interesting.\u201dThe girl sank into this explanation, and asked a bit doubtfully, \u201cWhy\u00a0ah?\u201dLing Yi also felt curious. \u201cYeah, why? There must be some numbers that have no distinguishing characteristics\u00a0ba.\u201dFang Juexia laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s use the counter argument here for a bit. If there is a set of uninteresting natural numbers, then there must be a minimum uninteresting number within this set?\u201dPei Tingsong immediately understood and laughed. \u201c\u2018The smallest uninteresting number\u2019, this already counts as being a special characteristic.\u201dFang Juexia was a bit surprised. \u201cYes.\u201d He looked at the girl again and said, \u201cThis leads to a contradiction: the smallest uninteresting number actually does have something interesting about it. So,\u201d he continued, bowing his head and autographing next to the girl\u2019s name, \u201cdon\u2019t doubt whether you\u2019re boring or likeable. You just need to be yourself.\u201dAfter he finished signing, Fang Juexia handed the album to her. \u201cYou have to maintain self-confidence, you understand?\u201dThe girl was greatly encouraged. She nodded and revealed a smile. \u201cThank you, Juexia Gege, thank you.\u201dFang Juexia shook his head and watched her leave.Cheng Qiang picked up the microphone and said, \u201cWe\u2019re very happy that everyone could come to Kaleido\u2019s autograph event. It will be over soon, so please everyone, gather your things, make sure not to lose them.\u201dEveryone felt regretful about the ending, and the other group members were saying goodbye to their fans and making as much noise as possible. Only Fang Juexia waved to the fans standing below in silence, with a smile on his face.Pei Tingsong found that his prejudices were constantly being reversed by Fang Juexia, which was a very interesting process. He had thought that he already understood this person well enough, but he didn\u2019t. Fang Juexia seemed unsociable and reticent, but in fact, he was a person with a strong heart. Living with the disparagement of others since childhood, but still always continuing to believe in himself.It was really cool.\u201cWhat did you sign for her?\u201d Finally, Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help asking.Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes were clear, and he laughed.\u201cBe like me, and be an interesting minimum uninteresting number\u00a0ba.\u201d\u2014The author has something to say:I hope everyone can get rid of self doubt~(Some friends have questioned and said, would someone really talk like that to an idol during an autograph event? Yes, and many do. In fact, idols have strong moral encouragement for fans, and it\u2019s normal for fans when seeing them to be cared for and for them to pour out their woes to them. If you guys go check, you will know that such things often happen. It\u2019s not the so-called \u201cunreasonable and deliberate\u201d, there are many similar incidents.Looking at the comments for this chapter, we can see that there are a lot of 'stereotypes\u201d about introverted personalities, so everyone all thinks that it\u2019s okay to pour\u00a0chicken soup\u00a0on them or preach at them, because as long as we encourage people who need encouragement, nothing else matters. In addition, please don\u2019t always pull my other book out for comparison. There is no comparability between different ideas.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The expression on his face was a little cocky but also a little childish. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be the second smallest uninteresting natural number\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cThen you\u2019ll be a little more uninteresting than me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t care, anyway, I\u2019ll be right after you.\u201dPei Tingsong had, with much care, chosen this specific point on the infinite number axis, but what he hadn\u2019t expected was how beautiful this point truly was.After the autograph event ended, the six people from Kaleido got into the van and prepared to return to the company. Xiao Wen sat in the driver\u2019s seat and closed the car door, thereby shutting out the clamoring sound of the fans. \u201cOriginally, there should have been a special chauffeur today, but his child is sick, and he asked for leave, so I\u2019ll drive for one last trip today!\u201d\u201cAh, is our chauffeur Xiao Wen going to be laid off~\u201d Ling Yi hugged his neck from behind.\u201cThen, we\u2019ll have to switch to a big car\u00a0ya,\u201d He Ziyan said.Xiao Wen was a little surprised. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201dLu Yuan laughed at his cute dazed look. \u201cThere\u2019s one more driver, and then, if Strong Ge squeezes in as well, there won\u2019t be enough room\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cOh, yes, yes.\u201d Xiao Wen got rid of Ling Yi\u2019s clutch around his neck and started the car when Cheng Qiang entered the car.Ever since Pei Tingsong had gotten injured, Fang Juexia was always on tenterhooks, afraid of Pei Tingsong\u2019s arm getting bumped around. They waved goodbye to their fans, drove out a little, and then got on the road. Fang Juexia kept paying attention to the road conditions and occasionally observed Xiao Wen.He noticed that Xiao Wen kept glancing in the rearview mirror rather frequently.\u201cXiao Wen, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m seeing it wrong.\u201d Xiao Wen frowned and said, \u201cI always feel that there is a car following us.\u201dCheng Qiang became alert, opened the window, and looked back. \u201cThe black Volkswagen?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Wen felt strange. \u201cWhen I came out on the road, from the beginning, it was behind me. And we\u2019ve passed several intersections now, but it\u2019s actually still there.\u201dFang Juexia instinctively felt that there was something wrong with this situation. After he ruled out the few possibilities that were too far from the mark, he tried to guess, \u201cIs it a stalker fan?\u201dStalker fans were a very special group. Although they were called \u2018fans\u2019, their actions actually went beyond the scope of what fans should do. They would go to the extent of obtaining stars\u2019 private numbers through improper means, crazily making harassing phone calls, or even indulging in terrible acts such as chasing and following cars, tracking them all the way to their hotels, or even installing pinhole cameras in places.Cheng Qiang closed the car window. \u201cShould be. Let\u2019s take another route back to the company\u00a0ba. If they\u2019re still following, then most likely, they are stalker fans.\u201dThe good atmosphere in the car suddenly cooled down, and Ling Yi sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s a stalker fan again\u2026\u201dJiang Miao rubbed his head in an attempt to comfort him.Last year, Ling Yi had to change his phone number several times due to a stalker fan\u2019s harassment. They would call him every day, and if he didn\u2019t answer the phone, he would receive innumerable abusive messages, and even if he blacklisted them, they\u2019d just get a new number and start the cycle again. At that time, Ling Yi was under great pressure, but he couldn\u2019t come up with any good solutions to deal with it, so he just had to hide.Clearly, they kept yelling out \u201cGege, Gege\u201d, but they still did things that ordinary people couldn\u2019t bear.Xiao Wen slowed down the car. At this time, they couldn\u2019t try to get rid of these people by speeding up, that would only make things more dangerous.\u201cFortunately, we don\u2019t have another event to rush to today.\u201d He detoured from their usual route further, but the black Volkswagen still remained behind them, seeming just like a spirit that couldn\u2019t be shaken off.Pei Tingsong thought of something. \u201cLast time I went back to school to go to class, someone followed me, but I didn\u2019t worry about it.\u201dCheng Qiang was a little agitated and wanted to smoke, but he couldn\u2019t do it now. \u201cIt must have been a stalker fan. When you go to school in the future, we will arrange for people to protect you on the way.\u201dHe Ziyan shook his head and said, \u201cThe security personnel can\u2019t follow you in when you have class, it\u2019s very troublesome.\u201dAfter detouring by a big circle to get back to the company, they quickly got out of the car. Unsurprisingly, the people in the car who had been following them before also got out. They were also young girls, and they ran to them and tried to attract their attention.\u201cJuexia! Can you autograph some things for us?!\u201d\u201cZiyan! Miaomiao!\u201d\u201cPei Tingsong! Wait a minute! Don\u2019t go in yet\u00a0ah!\u201dCheng Qiang had already contacted the company\u2019s staff long ago, and as soon as they got out of the car, the staff came out to surround Kaleido, separating the stalker fans from them and protecting them as they entered the company.Even as he entered the doors of the company, Fang Juexia could still hear the voices from outside. They hadn\u2019t succeeded, so they had already changed from their previous flattering mindset to loud abusive curses, filled with all kinds of ugly words.Humans were really complicated.After entering the company, they held a simple meeting in Cheng Qiang\u2019s office, mainly talking about some of their recent events and the new resources that had come their way.\u201cRecently, our reality show situation is the same as before. Xiao Pei and Juexia\u2019s \u2018Escape\u2019 will continue to be filmed, and everyone else\u2019s permanent guest spots are the same. Right, Yuanyuan, that supervisor for that hip-hop dance competition has already settled on you. The first episode will be recorded next Friday, so adjust your state now.\u201dLu Yuan made an \u201cokay\u201d gesture. \u201cLuckyyy.\u201d\u201cDoes Miaomiao want to try acting?\u201d Cheng Qiang sat down and said, \u201cThere is a cutting-edge director, and although he is not well-known, the quality of his films are good. Recently, he wants to make a film related to music, in which the main character plays the guzheng. We arranged for you to audition.\u201dLing Yi was more excited than Jiang Miao at this. \u201cWow! A movie. Oooh.\u201dJiang Miao nodded. In fact, it was only because his younger sister was a big fan of movies that Jiang Miao wanted to try acting.\u201cAnd then, this Wednesday, we\u2019ve inserted an event into your schedules, which is to take part in the filming of \u2018Happy Friday\u2019. The whole group will take part in it to promote the new album.\u201d\u201cScared me,\u201d Pei Tingsong complained, \u201cI thought we were really going to be doing \u2018Happy Comedian\u2019 for a second.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dFang Juexia also couldn\u2019t help laughing as he imagined the scene in his heart\u2014 Six people standing in front of a red curtain, wearing Chinese style long frocks and pants. If they really went to that kind of event to perform cross talk, the other members would probably gabble away, but all he could probably do was just stand aside and play out the beat with bamboo clappers.But his beat would definitely be very accurate, because his small clock was very punctual, and he was also a little master with clappers.\u201cEven if you guys wanted to go, we can\u2019t get such resources. \u2018Happy Friday\u2019 is one of the most popular variety shows in the country, and I would like to remind you all that the special guests this time are just the six of you. All of you perform well and don\u2019t be wallflowers.\u201dEveryone looked at Fang Juexia, and Fang Juexia helplessly said, \u201cWith all of you there, I will talk more.\u201d\u201cWhen it\u2019s time for the show to air, you guys will probably gain another wave of fans.\u201d Cheng Qiang sighed and continued, \u201cGetting more fans is a good thing, but there are also many problems that come with it. Today\u2019s stalker fans still count as being moderate, but the more popular you guys get, the more troublesome things will get in the future, and the more people will target you. The company will do its best to protect its artists, but you guys can\u2019t take it lightly either, understand?\u201dThe six people nodded as if they were children who had been lectured.\u201cAlright, you guys go do what you need to do\u00a0ba, I\u2019ll go have a cigarette.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgAfter the meeting, Ling Yi was called out for a get-together by his best friend from college. Jiang Miao also went to accompany his younger sister, who he hadn\u2019t seen for a long time, to go shopping. Fang Juexia was originally going to stay in the company to practice, but He Ziyan and Lu Yuan pulled him to go play basketball with them. Since Pei Tingsong was injured and couldn\u2019t play, Fang Juexia wanted to refuse, but he didn\u2019t expect Pei Tingsong to speak in the same tone as the other two people and was determined to take part in outdoor sports. Unable to out-stubborn them, Fang Juexia could only set aside his practice plans and accompany them to play ball.Fortunately, by the time they left the company, that group of stalker fans were already no longer there. They went back to the dormitory by car, where there was an open-air basketball court. However, since the occupancy rate of this community was very low, there were few residents staying there, and even fewer people playing basketball. After putting on some loose clothes, these big boys went down to play ball in high spirits. There weren\u2019t enough people to have a match, so they just played around.Pei Tingsong had a talent for all kinds of sports, and basketball was no exception. Even if he had hurt one of his hands right now, he still dribbled and shot smoothly with one hand.Fang Juexia had been a member of the school basketball team since he had entered middle school, and he had also been on the basketball team when he was a university student. Every game back then had drawn in a lot of onlookers. After receiving the ball from Pei Tingsong, Fang Juexiaa raised his hands from behind the three-point line, and the ball entered the basket.\u201cJuexia\u2019s hands are so steady\u00a0ah.\u201d Lu Yuan sighed, \u201cSo extremely accurate.\u201d\u201cHe has a good psychological quality.\u201d He Ziyan bent over to tie his shoelaces with a smile. \u201cYou try making a free throw when everyone in an entire gym is calling out your name, that pressure is so great.\u201dPei Tingsong was standing in the same place, dribbling with one hand. When he heard this, he was puzzled. \u201cWhat do you mean the entire gym is calling out whose name?\u201dHe Ziyan stood up, beckoned to Pei Tingsong, who then passed the ball to him. \u201cYou don\u2019t know\u00a0ah, Juexia was the campus idol when he was in college, and he was a member of the school\u2019s basketball team. There was a video of him playing a match in school when he was 20. That entire place was crying out\u00a0ah, all for Fang Juexia.\u201dLu Yuan began to imitate the scene, pitching his voice up and making all kinds of shouts.Fang Juexia had just unscrewed a bottle of water and taken a sip. He nearly spat it out, saying, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so exaggerated.\u201dSaying that, he made a shot, and when the ball fell through the basket, Lu Yuan took it. \u201cYou\u2019ve even got the guts to say it wasn\u2019t that exaggerated, I watched it, okay? They yelled out even more exaggeratedly than I just did. I\u2019m amazed Xiao Pei actually still hasn\u2019t seen it.\u201dHe Ziyan joked, \u201cMakes sense, how could the him from before have gone online to watch Juexia\u2019s videos?\u201dUpon getting his sore spot stabbed, Pei Tingsong, who was broken in body, was ready in spirit to fight with He Ziyan. He Ziyan was afraid of causing problems with his injured hand, so he could only put on an act of not having the guts to provoke him. The two of them kicked up a fuss, and then after a while, they separated again. Lu Yuan went up to go play with He Ziyan while Pei Tingsong stepped out and sat next to Fang Juexia, who was sitting outside the court.\u201cDrink some water?\u201d Fang Juexia looked up at him and handed him some water.Pei Tingsong took the bottle of water but didn\u2019t open it. He was silent for a moment, looking at the two players not far away.\u201cDoes your hand hurt?\u201d Fang Juexia asked.\u201cNo, it\u2019s pretty good.\u201dFang Juexia nodded with satisfaction and turned his head. He continued to watch the people on the court playing, and seemed very immersed in it. Suddenly, he heard Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice by his ear.\u201cI think it\u2019s a pity.\u201dAs he turned his head, the colors of the fading dusk fell on Fang Juexia\u2019s gentle face. \u201cWhat\u2019s a pity?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a pity for me.\u201d Pei Tingsong straightened his long legs and said, \u201cPlainly speaking, I already met you two years ago, but because of my own prejudices, I always kept a distance. I feel that I have missed a lot.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s youthful spirit was most obvious whenever he showed his weaknesses. At this time, Fang Juexia could clearly see that Pei Tingsong was indeed a few years younger than him, and a peculiar feeling of wanting to dote on this boy in front of him welled up inside him.\u201cIf we have to define it, we both missed each other\u00a0ba. However, if there are two people, we can\u2019t count it as missing out on each other. If we have the same ideas and the same mentality, we can always find those lost memories together.\u201dFang Juexia thought of himself from before, and he also thought it was very interesting. \u201cYou were haughty towards me, and I was more like the person who held some prejudices against you. At that time, I thought, was this a spoiled young master who had come here? I especially didn\u2019t want to acknowledge you at that time, I thought it was a waste of time to do so.\u201dAs he talked, he started to laugh, \u201cAnd you were also an airborne member at that time. You came in like it was nothing, but it had taken me so long to even have a difficult debut. No matter how I thought about it, I would feel a little emotional. Only later did I discover that you are much better than I expected, though still a little bit odious.\u201dHe made a gesture to show how little, then looked at Pei Tingsong, reaching out and adjusting his slightly crooked hair band. \u201cBut genius has a special license.\u201dSeeing him like this, Pei Tingsong thought of his own childhood. Because it was so lonely, he had really envied his peers who had elder brothers. They had someone to accompany them to play games, play ball, and swim with them.He became even greedier. He didn\u2019t think of the missed past two years any longer, instead thinking that it would have been better if he had known Fang Juexia since his childhood. He was such an angular stone, but maybe if he had been wrapped in tenderness, he could have become a real pearl.Suddenly, he thought of that small detail from the autograph event, and Pei Tingsong asked, \u201cHey, do you really like mature people?\u201d Just having said that, he specially added two words, \u201cBefore now.\u201dFang Juexia bent his leg and placed it on the steps they were sitting on, winding his arms around his knees and leaning his head against them. Upon hearing Pei Tingsong\u2019s sudden question, he was stunned at first, then looked at him sideways. A soft smile appeared on this usually cold face. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dPei Tingsong went by the facts and said, \u201cI hope it\u2019s false. But if it\u2019s true, I\u2019ll work hard to become more mature.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s eyebrows and eyes gently bent, and then he shook his head. \u201cNo need.\u201dHe Ziyan called out to Fang Juexia from a distance. He raised his head and caught the ball the other person had thrown over so rashly. \u201cBe careful\u00a0ah, there\u2019s a wounded person here.\u201d Saying that, he stood up and prepared to walk towards Lu Yuan and He Ziyan. However, before he left, he stood under the disappearing light from the sky and said to Pei Tingsong, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what kind of person I liked before. In order to deal with the question, I very casually stated some conditions. In fact, they were all false propositions. But now\u2026\u201dFang Juexia glanced at Pei Tingsong and very slightly raised his eyebrows.\u201cYou are the proposition itself. If you really want to know the conditions, use yourself to derive them\u00a0ba.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Each syllable was disassembled, fluttering around in his chest like a butterfly revolving around his heart.He had never liked a person so much before.Pei Tingsong, who had been immersed in the reveries of humanities since childhood, always had a big ego because he was good at playing with words. Only after meeting Fang Juexia did he really see a new world. A world totally different from that seen through a cage.Because only after the proposition appeared did the conditions for \u201cliking someone\u201d appear.Fang Juexia was actually the one who was a romantic\u00a0at heart, a born poet.He satisfied all of one\u2019s fantasies about first love.He Ziyan and Lu Yuan hadn\u2019t played enough even by the time they got back to the dormitory, so they occupied the gaming console in the living room and put on VR glasses to play duo. Fang Juexia helped Pei Tingsong remove his sling; his hand was much better, and it wasn\u2019t as inconvenient as before.\u201cI\u2019ll just casually take a shower myself.\u201dFang Juexia was actually a little surprised. \u201cYou don\u2019t need me to help you?\u201dHe had just finished playing basketball, and his pale face was flushed red after all the exercise. Under the light of the bathroom, it looked like a ripe, juicy peach, with every tiny hair becoming translucent. When he spoke, his red lips opened slightly and moved vividly, and Pei Tingsong could vaguely see the tip of his tongue hidden inside.\u201cIf you really helped me,\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s gaze unconsciously fixed on his lips, and he lowered his head slightly to draw closer to Fang Juexia, \u201cit might not be something that can be resolved just by casually taking a shower.\u201dMaybe it was because he had spoken a lot during the day, but Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice sounded a little hoarse.What did that mean?Fang Juexia was already used to pondering on the implications behind Pei Tingsong\u2019s words. Before, it was okay, but if he did it again now, it seemed that he would very easily fall into R-rated territory. He licked his lips subconsciously, then curled in his lower lip and puckered it a few times. This was his habitual little action that happened whenever he was embarrassed, but it made Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart even more itchy.Outside the bathroom, a fierce battle situation was being waged, where their bandmates were playing games, and kept talking back and forth, with their in-game situation seeming urgent. Just beyond a door, the situation inside seemed to be somewhat similar.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you talking now?\u201d Pei Tingsong moved a step closer, and Fang Juexia subconsciously stepped back, backing up just like that into the cold tiles of the bathroom wall.He had been coerced into falling into a tango with no escape.\u201cIf you don\u2019t need any help, I\u2019ll leave first.\u201dSeeing him forced this far, Pei Tingsong let out a light laugh, which pulled Fang Juexia\u2019s heart, that was preparing to escape, back. Not long ago, his emotions towards this boy were closer to tender affection, but once he started taking the initiative again, he seemed to return to the Fang Juexia who couldn\u2019t resist him.Pei Tingsong encircled him between the wall and his body, bracing up the small space and asking, \u201cAre you thinking right now that this proposition is established, but you don\u2019t like all the conditions?\u201dPei Tingsong sort of said this as a joke, but these were really his inner thoughts. He sometimes worried that his too-straightforward heart would frighten Fang Juexia away. Fang Juexia was so gentle, so introverted, maybe he wouldn\u2019t be able to accept such overly frank desire.Which is why most of the time he would choose to hide.Fang Juexia, who had originally still been hesitating over whether to take the initiative or not, raised his head when he heard this sentence. His eyes were open and decisive. \u201cNo, it\u2019s all the conditions.\u201dPei Tingsong stiffened for a moment.Fang Juexia was even more honest than he had imagined he would be. \u201cI may not be fully prepared, but I like them all.\u201dLooking at him being so honest, Pei Tingsong\u2019s face showed an expression of surrender. How could there be someone who grasped his soul so well, on one hand confessing that he wasn\u2019t ready yet, and on the other hand, saying that he liked all of him, that too with such pure and clean expression?While arousing your desire to destroy, it also aroused your desire to protect.\u201cOkay\u00a0ba, then I\u2019ll just give you one kiss in advance.\u201dWith that, Pei Tingsong pressed onto Fang Juexia\u2019s lips and stretched out a hand to draw him into his chest, pressing him tight. The compressed air seemed to have turned into some kind of glue, causing them to stick to each other. All of their love hovered on the edge of the cliff, and after they jumped down, all they would see was an abyss of lust and desire.Fang Juexia raised his head slightly and didn\u2019t resist. He even indulged himself in it a little more than before, raising his hand and gently hugging Pei Tingsong\u2019s waist. At this moment, Pei Tingsong pried open his soft lips and delved deep into them.His hand crept up under Fang Juexia\u2019s shirt, going inside to press against the back of his waist, thereby tightening the embrace. The tip of his tongue was soft, and so was his waist. Fang Juexia\u2019s skin was now covered in a thin layer of sweat, which made Pei Tingsong\u2019s palm heat up. As a result, he grew even more feverish, every vein pumping blood starting to burn, heating up uncontrollably as these fuzzy boundaries blended into each other.Not quite melted ice cream was the sweetest, being both moist and soft, and then melting with just a tiny sip, permeating in every corner of one\u2019s mouth. It flowed down the throat with one\u2019s saliva and buried itself in the body.One kiss could fill an entire outer shell.Pei Tingsong had a clear perception of himself and knew his willpower\u2019s bottom line, so he didn\u2019t continue with this and let go of Fang Juexia.Spring retreated from the cold winter, dragging with it just a trace of melted snow.At last, Pei Tingsong pressed a long kiss to Fang Juexia\u2019s lips, and then he reluctantly lowered his head and placed his forehead against the hollow of Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder. He really liked Fang Juexia, he liked him so much that he didn\u2019t want to leave him with any speck of regret towards his first experience with love. The best thing was that everything went smoothly in stages, and the two of them were deeply attracted and attached to each other. The best thing would be that no matter how he thought back on this much later on in his life, everything would still look just as wonderful.It was because he had already missed so much and had started so badly that he was desperate to do well in every step afterwards.But his deep-rooted bad habits were clamoring once again, egging him on to possess, to ravage, to wreck Fang Juexia under his body.Love just made people contradictory.\u201cI\u2019ll inoculate you first.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice was still a little hoarse, and his tone was childish as he whispered, \u201cSome of the implied conditions may be more exciting than you imagined; they\u2019re very frightening, very bad.\u201dFang Juexia had not completely pulled away from the lingering kiss just now. His chest was slightly undulating, and his legs were soft, but when he heard Pei Tingsong\u2019s half-menacing words, he couldn\u2019t help laughing.\u201cI\u2019m not as fragile as you think.\u201d Saying that, he turned his head, kissed the top of Pei Tingsong\u2019s hair, and said in a low voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s more, I\u2019ve been seeing your bad side for a long time.\u201dJust then, the sound of a door closing came from outside, followed up by Ling Yi\u2019s voice. Fang Juexia grew a bit alert, and Pei Tingsong also stopped leaning against him, half-pushing him out. \u201cYou go to the next room to take a bath\u00a0ba.\u201dFang Juexia was about to leave from this push, but before leaving the bathroom, he quickly turned around and kissed Pei Tingsong\u2019s chin.Then he left briskly, flying away like a little skylark.Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart also left with him. He himself went back into the bathroom, where he poured over the Neo Confucianism of the Song and Ming Dynasties and then Kantian moral philosophies in turn, and accompanied by the cold water from the shower, he finally managed to extinguish the fire that Fang Juexia had lit.The theory of eliminating human desire couldn\u2019t actually eliminate human desire. Being a 20-year-old male was really suffering.The days sped by due to their busy schedule, and in the blink of an eye, it was time for the whole group to record a variety show.This variety show was already an old satellite TV variety show that boasted of high national popularity, with there being many families who spent their Fridays watching it on TV. One could imagine how difficult it was to obtain this job, and one should also remember that before, Seven Luminaries variety show debut happened with \u201cHappy Friday\u201d. After being broadcasted on this show, they gained countless fans and smoothly and easily became popular. But for the Kaleido from before, they hadn\u2019t even dared to imagine attaining such resources.The filming location wasn\u2019t in Beijing, so they flew one night in advance and stayed in the hotel arranged by the program team. In view of Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand injury, they went directly through the VIP terminal at the airport. Cheng Qiang worried that things would be hard for him, so he took special care of him when he divided up the rooms. \u201cJiang Miao and Lu Yuan, Ziyan and Ling Yi, take your room cards, and Fang Juexia will live alone.\u201dLing Yi flipped the room card around in his hand. \u201cYi? Juexia\u2019s staying by himself? Very refreshing\u00a0ah.\u201dFang Juexia also didn\u2019t expect something like this. He took hold of the room card and asked Cheng Qiang, \u201cThen what about Xiao Pei?\u201d\u201cXiao Pei will stay with me,\u201d said Cheng Qiang, patting Pei Tingsong on the shoulder with a big-hearted, kind expression on his face. \u201cIf anything comes up, I can take care of you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want that.\u201d Pei Tingsong grumbled, \u201cYou can\u2019t even take care of yourself, and you want to take care of me.\u201dCheng Qiang rolled his eyes. \u201cThen who do you want to go with, your guys\u2019 group leader should be fine at least\u00a0ba? He\u2019s basically become the group mother.\u201dJiang Miao laughed awkwardly and refused, \u201cI can\u2019t. My arms have been a little sore from practicing the guzheng recently, so how about\u2026\u201d He pushed Fang Juexia over to Pei Tingsong, suggesting, \u201cIt should still be Fang Juexia\u00a0ba.\u201dOf course, Fang Juexia was willing to take care of Pei Tingsong, and it wasn\u2019t the first time they had stayed in a hotel together, so it should be fine. Also, it would be a very nice feeling to have the first person you see in the morning be the person you like.But Pei Tingsong refused, \u201cForget it, I\u2019ll just go with Qiang Ge\u00a0ba. I was just kidding around just now.\u201d\u201cYou little brat, no one can clean you up.\u201dFang Juexia was a little confused; he didn\u2019t expect his little fantasy to be extinguished just like that. They went to the elevator, and Pei Tingsong was beside him. His right arm rubbed against Fang Juexia\u2019s left arm, swinging back and forth, and the backs of their hands rubbed against one another from time to time.\u201cSleep on your own\u00a0ba,\u201d Pei Tingsong said in a low voice. \u201cSleeping by yourself will be more comfortable for you.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Fang Juexia nodded and went to the very back of the elevator with him. Cheng Qiang and Jiang Miao exhorted them about the filming process for the show, and blocked them from the front. As the elevator rose up, Fang Juexia lowered his eyes and caught a glimpse of Pei Tingsong\u2019s right half-folded cuff, so he reached over, unfolded the cuff, and pulled it down.The feeling of Fang Juexia\u2019s fingers touching his wrist was very strange, like something scratching at his heart. Pei Tingsong drew in a breath silently, holding back the thought of taking the opportunity to hold hands.In order to be in better shape for the filming session, they didn\u2019t stay up too late and went ahead and rested. Fang Juexia had almost never stayed alone in a hotel before. Most of the time, he would room with Ling Yi, and occasionally, he would also switch and stay with someone else. To be honest, him being alone suited his personality more. Quiet and lonely spaces were actually a kind of comfort zone for him.He opened his suitcase, took out the clothes he\u2019d change into after washing up, washed up, then blow-dried his hair, and finally sat on the bed to reply to his unanswered messages. He called his mother, and all these tasks were carried out in an orderly fashion. One by one they were finished, and then it was time to rest.It was very strange; plainly, this was a rare occasion where he got time to be alone, but Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t really fall asleep. He lay in bed, tossing and turning, and looked out of the hotel window at the moonlight.He didn\u2019t say it in the lobby of the hotel, nor did he say it when they were in the elevator. Yet, at this moment, Fang Juexia had to admit that he had kind of wanted to share the same room with Pei Tingsong.He was very smart and had guessed why Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t choose to stay in the same room as him. But this reason, on the contrary, made him more perturbed, and also made him experience some kind of ambiguous reverie in the middle of the night.Fang Juexia sat up, took the laptop he had brought with him, and went back to bed with his quilt neatly covering him. His fingers lingered indecisively on the keyboard, and his eyes rested on the blank search bar.He was a good student and had received a good physiological education, but boys with boys had never appeared in his scope of studies. So, he thought that maybe he should learn a bit.In another room right across the hall, Cheng Qiang helped Pei Tingsong remove the sling from his body, and then helped him take off his coat.\u201cWhen will the cast on my hand be removed?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked.Cheng Qiang used great effort to help a guy taller than him take off his shirt. He recalled what the doctor had said before and rehashed, \u201cLast time, the doctor said that for a hand or wrist fracture, the cast can be removed in about two weeks. But to understand the particulars, we still need to go to the hospital and get an X-Ray taken to see how much it has healed up. When we go back to Beijing, I\u2019ll take you again for a follow-up visit\u00a0ba.\u201dPei Tingsong nodded, sat back on the bed, stared at the heavy cast on his hand, and sighed. In the beginning, he had thought it was good to be injured, since he could use it to coerce Fang Juexia into taking care of him, but now, he felt that it had become increasingly cumbersome and was affecting his performance.\u201cHey right, have you received Miss Pei\u2019s email?\u201dPei Tingsong found that even more funny. \u201cI never read emails. If President Pei still has her Didi in mind, she can call me.\u201dThis brother-sister pair was really too much. Cheng Qiang sat down and said, \u201cYou really are blood related siblings, both of you more stubborn than the one before, trapping me in the middle and pressing me until I\u2019m not worthy of being called a human. Every time you ignore her, she sends me an email. Every time I see her English name, I start trembling with fear.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care about that, and she can\u2019t control me,\u201d said Pei Tingsong and lay down on his back.Cheng Qiang shook his head. \u201cI find that it\u2019s that way too, who can control you?\u201d\u201cWho\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong looked at the snow-white ceiling, his head full of Fang Juexia\u2019s face.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgWhen he was a child, he had thought it absurd when his grandfather had read \u2018Journey to the West\u2019 to him. In the beginning of the story, it had described the Monkey King as such a fierce character that he was omnipotent in both the heavens and the earth; if he didn\u2019t want to die, then he wouldn\u2019t die, and in the spheres of the heavens, if he wanted to fight, then he would fight. But later on, he was actually held down by\u00a0one hand\u00a0for an entire 500 years.Pei Tingsong thought about it now, and he didn\u2019t find it absurd anymore. It was written very realistically.He was also being held down with one hand, one that wrapped around him very gently, incapable of turning over under its influence, and also incapable of escaping it no matter what.The night passed the same as it usually did, but everyone\u2019s sleep was not the same. He Ziyan got up early in the morning and complained that Ling Yi kept waking him up at night with his constant sleep-talking. He even pulled Fang Juexia into the conversation by asking him how he usually put up with it.Ling Yi defended himself, \u201cIt was just last night! I was too tired from the flight!\u201dHearing the two words \u201clast night\u201d, Fang Juexia thought of his own \u201cresearch and study\u201d and said a little guiltily, \u201cYes\u00a0ah\u2026. Usually, Ling Yi doesn\u2019t talk in his sleep.\u201dThese few people kept the car noisy while Fang Juexia looked out of the window. The weather here was more like that of the South, and the slightly cool air was moist.In many cities, spring was the same as it was here, composed of endless rain, but spring in Beijing was filled with clouds of white drifting about the sky. Once the flying and dancing\u00a0poplar seed pods\u00a0stopped roaming about, spring would also soon be over.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t like poplar seed pods in the past; they\u00a0 would make his nose uncomfortable and even affect his vocal cords, which wasn\u2019t good for stage performances. However, after falling in love with spring, these soft white things also seemed to be lovely, the love that he had for spring\u00a0extending\u00a0towards them. He didn\u2019t find them annoying any more, and he was even willing to wear masks to stay around them for a while longer.Let Spring stay a little longer.As they approached the satellite TV station building where the filming would take place, Fang Juexia suddenly received a message from Pei Tingsong\u2014[Injured Guide Dog: I missed you last night.]Just these five words stirred Fang Juexia\u2019s heart into a mess. Clearly speaking, Pei Tingsong was sitting next to him, and maybe he was even watching him open and read the message, but he was so quiet that Fang Juexia\u2019s heart beat wildly.He decided not to reply.Watching as Fang Juexia put his cellphone back in his pocket, and everyone got ready to get out of the car, Pei Tingsong felt a little disappointed. He had thought that Fang Juexia would take the opportunity to reply to him.\u201cXiao Wen already called them and informed them of our arrival.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dPei Tingsong also got ready to get up. At this moment, Fang Juexia held his hand and drew close to his ear, to whisper amidst the confines of the noisy car\u2014\u201cI didn\u2019t miss you.\u201dAfter holding on for just a short while, he let go again. The six boys jumped out of the car one by one like\u00a0boiling tangyuan. Pei Tingsong followed behind Fang Juexia, his heart also stuck to this person.The public\u2019s acceptance of long hair wasn\u2019t high, so Star Chart\u2019s stylist had specially cut off all the hair Fang Juexia had grown out before the show, and had then styled it to make for a more refreshing look.When filming for the variety show, they switched to using the program group\u2019s stylist, who styled them in a fashion more in line with the public. The style of the six people this time went the big boy route, and there would be no problems with that.Pei Tingsong wore a dark blue suede baseball cap on his head, showing off his fine and well-defined features. He was also wearing a loose avocado green jacket, with his sling still draped around it. Fang Juexia was wearing a simple black t-shirt slightly tucked into his waist and loose camouflage jeans underneath it. The hairstylist blow-dried his bangs so that they had a curve, revealing his smooth forehead and superior features.Ling Yi went with the consistent cute Didi route, wearing a purple tracksuit and with his hair permed into teddy bear curls. Jiang Miao, the group leader, wore a loose striped shirt with dark gray jeans and a long black ribbon around his neck. He Ziyan was given a perm by the stylist, getting a\u00a0slag man\u2019s tin-foil perm, and wore a lake blue coat with long black sports pants. Lu Yuan was styled into giving off a rare calm look, coupled with a white t-shirt and brown trousers. When the lead dancer pair stood together, they just looked like yin and yang.Before the show officially started filming this episode, the boys met the host team and bowed in greeting. Chen Mo, the lead host, was the most famous entertainment host in the circle. He had a high status but was friendly. Because of the previous live audio incident, he had always carried a very good impression of Kaleido.\u201cYou guys have really gotten especially popular recently. The satellite TV building has been encircled by all your fans from the outside, and they\u2019re all waiting below my Weibo as well, everyone begging me to please take care of you guys.\u201dCheng Qiang said with a smile, \u201cWe really do need to be taken care of by Mr. Chen.\u201dOnly when the director informed them that filming was about to begin did they wrap up their conversation. The several hosts went on stage first, and after a little warm up intro, Kaleido, who were standing backstage, heard the host\u2019s voice\u2014\u201cLet\u2019s give our warmest applause to welcome today\u2019s special guests, the super popular boyband\u2014Kaleido!\u201dThe fans\u2019 cheers surged like a wave. The six Kaleido members went onto the stage as per the staff\u2019s instructions, and then began their opening performance, which was joined into the intro part of \u2018Break Through.\u2019 Kaleido\u2019s performance was as explosive as ever, and soon gave the stage performance a concert-like atmosphere. The fans under the stage held up their support banners, and the chorus being sung by the entire venue was a very spectacular view.At the end of the song, the six of them got up from their ending poses and gathered at the center of the stage. Chen Mo brought the other hosts onto the stage, while making sure Kaleido stood in the middle.\u201cWow, I finally saw the performance of \u2018Break Through.\u2019\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s more shocking than I thought. No wonder it has managed to sweep up all the major music websites until now.\u201dChen Mo leaned forward, looked at Jiang Miao, and asked, \u201cThen let\u2019s ask Kaleido to greet our long-awaited audience below?\u201dJiang Miao nodded, looked left and right at the other members, and then whispered, \u201cOne, two, three.\u201dThe six people raised their hands together, their right hands making a \u2018K.\u2019 \u201cHello everyone, we are Kaleido!\u201dAnother burst of cheers came from below the stage. Their fans hadn\u2019t had such an opportunity in a long time, and their expectations and thoughts all turned into shouts. From the screams in the beginning, they all turned into a chant of \u201cKaleido, Kaleido\u2026\u201d This was the real embodiment of popularity.Chen Mo took the microphone and said, \u201cToday we are very happy to invite Kaleido to take part in the recording of this episode of \u2018Happy Friday.\u2019 I heard that they made a special trip for our program group, thank you guys very much.\u201dJiang Miao shook his head. \u201cNo, no.\u201dLing Yi also shook his head. \u201cNo, no, we are not very busy.\u201dBelow the stage, a fan yelled, \u201cThey really were very idle before!\u201dHe Ziyan picked up the microphone and said, \u201cI can immediately tell that that\u2019s an old fan.\u201dThe fans all laughed. The hostess thought it was particularly interesting and commented, \u201cI find that your group isn\u2019t shy with strangers at all.\u201dChen Mo also asked, \u201cYes\u00a0ah, how come if they say you were idle before, they just have to be an old fan?\u201dPei Tingsong took over. \u201cThis kind of loving each other and stabbing each other is all done by old fans; new fans all go\u2014whatever Gege does is good.\u201dThere was another burst of laughter from below.\u201cWe really did used to be pretty idle, we didn\u2019t have a lot of activities.\u201d As soon as Lu Yuan\u2019s turn came up, he took the lead in selling out his bandmates. He pointed to Fang Juexia beside him and said, \u201cFor example, Juexia, he was so idle that he went to test for a teacher\u2019s qualification certificate.\u201d\u201cHahahahahahaha!\u201dChen Mo was a little surprised. \u201cReally? What subject did you test for? Was it for junior high or senior high?\u201dHaving been cued so animatedly, and on top of that, even on such a topic, Fang Juexia was a bit embarrassed. \u201c\u2026.High school mathematics. I studied mathematics in University. At that time, we really didn\u2019t have many activities, and everyone was taking the exam, so I also went along and got a certificate.\u201dLing Yi added, \u201cHe was at Beijing Normal University.\u201dAnother host joked, \u201cSo what Juexia was thinking was that if they couldn\u2019t get popular, he would go back to teach, right?\u201d\u201cHahahaha!\u201d\u201cGege, go back and coach me on the\u00a0five-three study method!\u201dPei Tingsong saw that his ears had turned red, and teased with the microphone in his hand, \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to be taught by Teacher Fang?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even Cheng Qiang, who was backstage, felt that it was frightening when he heard it; he was afraid that Kaleido\u2019s fans were mostly made up of TingJue CP fans.\u201cDo online classes, Teacher Fang!\u201d\u201cAhhahahaha, livestream math lessons\u00a0ba, Teacher Fang!\u201dSeeing everyone coax him in this manner, Fang Juexia became even more embarrassed. Because he wasn\u2019t good at expressing himself in variety shows, when he went on one by himself, he tended to be silent, but whenever he had his bandmates with him, he would subconsciously rely on them. So he held the microphone in his hand and began to glance left and right, pleading for help from his bandmates.His eyes met Pei Tingsong\u2019s, who then quickly picked up the microphone. \u201cBut if Juexia Ge really went to teach now, maybe the students in his class wouldn\u2019t do very well.\u201dHost Chen Mo said with a smile, \u201cYes, they probably all attend class just to admire the beauty of the teacher.\u201dThe hostess then asked, \u201cIn other words, Juexia is the face of the group?\u201dFinally, the topic of discussion was pulled back to the group. Fang Juexia held the microphone in both hands and nodded.Jiang Miao then introduced him, \u201cNot just that, Juexia is the face, one of our lead singers, and a lead dancer of the group as well.\u201d\u201cWow, really an all-rounder.\u201d This gave the host the cue to start with the introduction segment. \u201cThen let\u2019s introduce the other members of our K\u00a0ba.\u201d His hand stretched in He Ziyan\u2019s direction, suggesting, \u201cZiyan, start us off?\u201dHe Ziyan nodded and freely introduced his name and age. \u201cI\u2019m the secondary rapper who can arrange music and play electronic music in the group, while also being #2 of the number group.\u201d\u201cNumber group?\u201d The host asked.Ling Yi immediately jumped out and explained, \u201cI\u2019m Ling\u00a0Yi, Ziyan is Two Fire, Miao Ge is Three Water, so the fans grouped the three of us into a name\u2014 \u2018the number group\u2019! I\u2019m #1 of the number group.\u201dChen Mo smoothed things out with, \u201cThis group really is a little too much.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dLu Yuan then introduced himself, going in order after He Ziyan, \u201cHello, everyone, I\u2019m Lu Yuan. Thanks to Teacher Fang, everyone calls me Teacher Yuan. I\u2019m also a lead dancer for the group.\u201dThe hostess interjected, \u201cThey say that Teacher Yuan basically put together the entire choreography for \u2018Break Through\u2019?\u201dThe members nodded one after another, while Lu Yuan put on a modest look while on the stage. \u201cNo, no, we all put forward suggestions. Juexia\u2019s solo part was created by him and a classical dance teacher.\u201dThe host praised, \u201cThat\u2019s excellent, too.\u201dJiang Miao also briefly introduced himself, \u201cI\u2019m a secondary lead singer, secondary lead dancer, and the group leader. Before joining K, I spent my entire time learning to play the guzheng.\u201dThe host said to the audience, \u201cIn a bit, let\u2019s ask Jiang Miao to play a guzheng section for us, okay?\u201d\u201cOkay!!\u201dIt now came to Ling Yi. \u201cHello everyone, I\u2019m Ling Yi, the group\u2019s lead singer and tenor, also everyone\u2019s class clown and doted on group favorite!\u201dPei Tingsong deliberately put on a cold face. \u201cWho dotes on you?\u201d\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dHe Ziyan also deliberately teased him, \u201cHe\u2019s the doted on group favorite in his dreams.\u201dSuddenly, Fang Juexia\u2019s face also seemed to carry an expression of sudden realization. \u201cNo wonder he talks in his sleep\u00a0ah.\u201dThe fans laughed as a group. \u201cHahahahaha, what\u2019s with the gong bunch of this group?\u201dLing Yi gave Fang Juexia a wronged look, and Fang Juexia rubbed his head. \u201cYou\u2019re the doted on group favorite, you\u2019re the doted on group favorite.\u201dSeeing Fang Juexia dote on Ling Yi, Pei Tingsong felt uncomfortable, but was unable to say anything presently. He took half a step back unconsciously.A\u00a0hawk-eyed\u00a0female fan near the stage laughed loudly and shouted, \u201cHahaha, look at Pinot Tree Supreme\u2019s tactical retreat!\u201dIt was now Fang Juexia\u2019s turn to introduce himself. \u201cJust now, actually the captain has already said it all for me. My name is Fang Juexia, en.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Pei Tingsong looked at him, sighed, then began his introduction. \u201cHello, everyone, I\u2019m Pei Tingsong, the lyricist and rapper of the group. I\u2019m also the youngest member in the group, the group\u2019s maknae.\u201d\u201cPei Tingsong is only 20 years old, right?\u201dPei Tingsong nodded to the host. \u201cBut I\u2019m the tallest. I\u2019m announcing my latest height to everyone right now: I am now a full 1.9 meters.\u201d With that, he flashed up the three numbers for 190 with his hands.Once he said that, besides the neutral smile that was on Fang Juexia\u2019s face, all the other members of the group began to hiss.\u201cHere comes the beat-box group again!\u201dKaleido possessed a strong sense for comedy, and the members were also very close to each other, so there was no need to create any program effects deliberately, and even the hosts were much more relaxed.After everyone introduced themselves, the host invited the members to perform their talents one by one. Jiang Miao played the guzheng, He Ziyan had brought a whole set of equipment to play electronic music on-site, Ling Yi showed off a short high pitch to display his virtuosity, and Pei Tingsong rapped out a very difficult English rap song, doing it astonishingly fast.Lu Yuan and Fang Juexia performed the duet that they hadn\u2019t gotten to at the autograph event on this stage, and Pei Tingsong saw this dance for the first time. At present, their group was still inclined to dancing in a strong style, especially when it came to the choreography, where the movements were fast and had large-scale cooperation. Besides Fang Juexia\u2019s classical dance, he seldom saw Fang Juexia dance sexy-style dances.The beat of this song was strong, but the rhythm wasn\u2019t fast, and mixed into this was the sound of a match being struck and then blown out.The waist of his loose jeans was a little big. When dancing, it would slide down, and the edge of his shirt wouldn\u2019t cover the exposed part, thereby revealing a pale, thin waist. The shape of his muscles as they rippled and tightened could faintly be seen.His eyes fell on Fang Juexia\u2019s face. His expression didn\u2019t show the slightest trace of seduction, it was as cold as usual. He just licked the corners of his lips unconsciously when he changed his movements, the tip of his tongue showing for a moment, then hiding away.Pei Tingsong\u2019s attention was drawn to the lyrics.[Lips meet teeth and tongue, my heart skips eight beats at\u00a0once.]Following the music, Fang Juexia executed two slow and continuous waves. His black T-shirt was wrapped around his narrow waist, and this move made it look like an endless undulating tide in the night.Right then, this line came out of the song just then:[We all been found guilty in the court of aorta.]In the court of inflated desire, you and I have both been found guilty.Those faintly jittering arteries and the boiling blood in their bodies was the evidence.Finally, as soon as the hip-thrust action appeared, all of the fans below screamed. When dancing, Fang Juexia was completely open and free, not afraid of expressing himself or being constrained by his introverted personality. But once the music stopped, he changed back into his shy personality.\u201cWow! Let\u2019s give Lu Yuan and Juexia a little applause, alright?\u201dFang Juexia was sweating. He went back to Pei Tingsong\u2019s side and took the microphone from him. Pei Tingsong lowered his head and drew close to his ear to whisper, \u201cGege, your waist is so flexible.\u201dThat low voice, full of magnetic bass, burst by his ear, and it was like Fang Juexia\u2019s whole body had been shocked with electricity, causing him to restlessly lick his lower lip.After getting along for a long time, he had almost forgotten what a terrible unstable factor Pei Tingsong was.This program conducted mainly indoor games, and after the brief self introduction and talent show, the host announced, \u201cThen let\u2019s start our game segment next!\u201dThe staff brought up a mat that pretty much covered about half of the stage. The host introduced the rules of the game, \u201cThe first game is a blindfolded match. Just now, Kaleido drew lots and divided themselves into groups. Ziyan, Juexia and Ling Yi are the blue team, while the remaining Xiao Pei, Miaomiao, and Xiao Yuan are the red team. Next, our red and blue teams will send out one person each.\u201dChen Mo took out a small balloon as he continued explaining, \u201cWe will tie balloons to your waist, with a balloon on each side, front and back. If they both pop, you will be eliminated, and someone else from your team will switch with you to keep competing; any contestant on your team who hasn\u2019t been eliminated during the round can play the next round as well. However, please note that you guys will be blindfolded the entire time.\u201dHe Ziyan squatted on the ground and pressed the mat in front of him. \u201cNo wonder you brought this big and thick mat. I\u2019m afraid that we\u2019ll play and play and end up wrestling each other.\u201d\u201cProbably even scarier than wrestling.\u201dLu Yuan raised his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair\u00a0ah, our strongest player is injured.\u201dThe host said, \u201cXiao Pei can choose not to play and give his chance to his other teammates.\u201dFang Juexia was most worried about Pei Tingsong. Even though he had checked and made sure that Pei Tingsong\u2019s fracture was actually a minor injury, and he was also young, so his healing speed was fast, Fang Juexia still felt afraid that he would get hurt or that he would feel uncomfortable, even if the person himself always said it didn\u2019t hurt at all.\u201cYou\u2019d better not go up\u00a0ba.\u201d Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help but dissuade him.Pei Tingsong smiled. \u201cBut I want to go up\u00a0ah.\u201dLu Yuan suggested, \u201cThen what if he\u2019s not blindfolded?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, after getting my hand put in a cast, I\u2019m not afraid of it getting bumped. It\u2019s hard to hurt my hand when it\u2019s covered with the cast.\u201d Pei Tingsong explained, \u201cThis is actually a pretty minor injury, and the cast is going to be taken off soon. I can be blindfolded, and also, there are so many cushions in here.\u201dThe program team had known about one of their members being injured before, so they had specially invited a medical team. Now, this team went on stage to reinforce Pei Tingsong, wrapping his left arm in a crash pad and fixing it to the front of his chest.\u201cThen, since Xiao Pei is down one arm, he can also have one less balloon.\u201d\u201cEvery master just has one arm.\u201d Ling Yi patted him on the shoulder.Lu Yuan laughed and remarked, \u201cYou\u2019re implying he\u2019s\u00a0Yang Guo, I have proof.\u201dLing Yi immediately turned to Pei Tingsong and said, \u201cGuo\u2019er, Guoer, you need to fight on!\u201dAfter the preparatory work was done, Chen Mo looked at the teams on both sides and asked, \u201cOkay, now the red and blue teams can send out their first contestant. Who wants to take the lead?\u201dFang Juexia, who had been silent the entire time before, suddenly took the initiative and told He Ziyan and Ling Yi, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I go\u00a0ba?\u201dPei Tingsong knew the game\u2019s ending as soon as he read the rules. As the only person on the field who knew that only Fang Juexia with his night blindness could be his opponent, this maknae was very excited.Upon seeing Fang Juexia show this much initiative, his two teammates were naturally happy. \u201cOkay\u00a0ah, then our group\u2019s Juexia will be the first to go up!\u201dPei Tingsong didn\u2019t plan on being the first one. He wanted Fang Juexia to have a good time for a bit, so he poured oil on fire and let Lu Yuan be the first one. The staff fixed the balloons on their waists, after which Fang Juexia and Lu Yuan put on black goggles, took off their shoes, and were helped to two far corners by their teammates.After they got on the mat, they walked forward carefully.The other members and hosts sat cross-legged on the ground to watch the battle, and sometimes used their voices to interfere with the contestants\u2019 sense of direction and actions.Ling Yi waved at the blindfolded Lu Yuan. \u201cLu Yuan, I\u2019m here!\u201d\u201cHahahaha!\u201dSuddenly falling into darkness would make people lose their sense of direction, but for Fang Juexia, memorizing his location had already become his routine, and the dark was even more familiar to him than the light. After hearing Ling Yi\u2019s voice, he soon had a basic prediction in his heart.Logically, the rest of their teams and the hosts should be roughly located in front of the blindfolded people, and there shouldn\u2019t have been any big changes in that since the game started. A huge blank mat appeared in front of Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes, with four corners, and his bandmates seated on the long edge. His sense of distance and direction provided by his hearing had already let him roughly realize his position on this mat.Ling Yi continued to tease Lu Yuan, \u201cLu Yuan Gege, you\u2019re the hottest, you are my little loser!\u201dLu Yuan was also amused by him into laughing and saying, \u201cYou shut up\u00a0ba.\u201dJust as Lu Yuan made a sound, Fang Juexia instantly reacted and changed his position. He turned his head, shifted the direction of his body, extended out, and was perfectly able to point in the exact direction where Lu Yuan was.Jiang Miao whispered, \u201cJuexia is so powerful.\u201dPei Tingsong bent his knees and kept his eyes pinned on Fang Juexia\u2019s every move.Blindfolded, he was so smart he seemed like a beautiful cheetah, and easily found the trail of his prey.Lu Yuan hadn\u2019t completely entered into his game state, and only cared about quipping with the interfering factor, Ling Yi. He totally hadn\u2019t discovered that his opponent had already quietly approached his vicinity. The fans below the stage kept as quiet as possible as they could, following the hints given by the hosts, and many fans also covered their small mouths.They watched as Fang Juexia moved forward step by step, seeming to have a clear picture of the whole scene in his heart, and each stride forward had the exact same distance.Soon, there was only half a meter of distance left between them. Fang Juexia stopped, wanting to judge his position a bit. He Ziyan saw his intention, so he deliberately teased Lu Yuan into talking.\u201cYuanzi, Yuan\u2019er~\u201dSeeing that his teammate didn\u2019t know his opponent was right in front of him, Jiang Miao immediately reminded him, \u201cCheer up\u00a0ah, Lu Yuan. Quickly, get ready to fight.\u201d\u201cFight what\u00a0ah, I don\u2019t even know where Juexia is?\u201dAs soon as he finished saying that, a hand had already reached out and touched his chest. Lu Yuan was startled and reflexively stepped back. Fang Juexia had guessed that he would step back, so he simply slammed into him and knocked him down. The small balloon behind Lu Yuan popped as he was crushed into the ground, and in the dark, Fang Juexia felt for the balloon in front of him and squeezed it energetically.The balloon attached to Lu Yuan\u2019s front also exploded.In just a short period of time, Fang Juexia had taken first blood while keeping himself completely undamaged.\u201cWow!!!\u201d\u201cJuexia Gege is so explosively hot!\u201dThe host exclaimed, \u201cJuexia is really strong, and in this round, blue team wins!\u201d The staff helped him up, and instead of removing his blindfold, they directly took him to a corner of the mat, this one different from where he was at the beginning of the game.\u201cWe won\u2019t directly say the name of the next red team contestant. In a bit, the audience and the other members\u00a0 shouldn\u2019t call out their names to disturb Juexia.\u201dThis was a real obstacle for Fang Juexia.Because in his mind, his opponents were only divided into two categories \u2013 Pei Tingsong and the others.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgAs long as it wasn\u2019t Pei Tingsong, he could attack with all his strength and fight a quick battle to force a quick outcome. But if it was Pei Tingsong, he would worry about his injured hand and would be much more restrained.He could only first try to classify it all out.Fang Juexia stood in the same place, listening as everyone started to kick up a new round of fuss.\u201cHe\u2019s up, he\u2019s up, red team is up.\u201dHe listened to the sounds and found his position in the same way he had just done before. After that battle, his next opponent must be clear that if he made any noise, he would be found, so Fang Juexia also changed his tactics and prepared to head directly to the center of the mat and listen for any sounds from his opponent.He fumbled forward boldly, holding out his hands to keep his balance. Walking on a cushion gave the feeling of walking on froth, and it was very easy to fall down.Ling Yi was still persistent in provoking the enemy. \u201cRed team, are you scared?\u201dFang Juexia had already followed the sound to come to the center of the mat at this time, and he focused entirely on listening for sounds.\u201cHe won\u2019t make any noise, don\u2019t worry\u00a0ba.\u201d Lu Yuan, who had already failed once, talked with his previously gained experience.Ling Yi scorned him, \u201cWho said that? If he loves me, he\u2019ll make a noise!\u201dSuddenly, in the midst of this noisy quarrel, Fang Juexia heard a laugh. It couldn\u2019t be more familiar to him, and it was very brief, coming from very near him, just behind him, not too far away.\u201cPei Tingsong?\u201d Fang Juexia tried to turn around.Everyone in the audience was shocked. Many people waved their hands at Fang Juexia, because in their eyes, the blindfolded Fang Juexia not only correctly identified his opponent\u2019s position, but also called out his name directly.Pei Tingsong was just behind him, only one meter away from him.The host was also surprised and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cIs Juexia\u2019s eye mask fake?\u201d\u201cDid he just casually guess Xiao Pei?\u201dJiang Miao sent a message to his teammate. \u201cDon\u2019t talk\u00a0ah, he\u2019s already close to you.\u201dHe just wanted to let him get close.The corners of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth rose, and he stood in the same spot, calling out Fang Juexia\u2019s name in a deep voice. These three words let Fang Juexia confirm that his previous judgment was correct.The identification was finished, but what was his next step going to be?Was he really going to take action against Pei Tingsong?Shrouded in darkness, Pei Tingsong\u2019s hearing and sensitivity weren\u2019t as good as Fang Juexia\u2019s, but he could still judge whether someone was near him from the sensation of the mat collapsing and rising. So he crouched down and put his palm on the mat.For every step Fang Juexia took, the cushion would collapse a bit and then recover, but the closer he got, the degree of collapse could be felt by his palm more obviously. Plus, there was also the rustling sound of Fang Juexia\u2019s pants.Pei Tingsong had the pleasure of paying back someone with their own coin.One step.He was still one step away.Fang Juexia stretched his arm and felt it was a bit strange. According to his calculations just now, he should have already arrived at that spot, but he couldn\u2019t touch Pei Tingsong. It couldn\u2019t be that he had changed his position without making a sound already.If that was the case, there still should have been a sound though.The collapsing of the floor mat was very obvious to the palm of his hand. Just then, Pei Tingsong resolutely stretched out his right hand and accurately grasped Fang Juexia\u2019s ankle.Oh, no.\u00a0Fang Juexia knew that he had missed a step.The strength of this surprise attack pulled him to the ground. Fang Juexia tried to resist and keep the balloon behind him from popping. However, he couldn\u2019t retrieve enough of his strength to do that, and before he knew it, his entangled legs were already being pressed down.He could feel Pei Tingsong sitting on his leg, his weight pressing on him, his right hand touching his body and fumbling upwards, just like how Fang Juexia fumbled around for a direction in the dark, passing his knee, thigh, hip bone, and lean waist.The audience below the stage couldn\u2019t help screaming, with everything on-stage having reached the white hot stage.The blindfolded Pei Tingsong felt Fang Juexia\u2019s hand pushing and struggling against him. The blue balloon fixed to the front of his waist trembled pitifully in the lingering sensations of the violent impact.Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand had already touched his waist. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t know whether he was doing it on purpose or not, but he could even feel the touch of his fingertips rubbing against his skin, which made his pores shiver in the middle of this duel of victory or defeat.He still had a chance to fight back. Fang Juexia tried to keep his upper body turned somewhat sideways to make room for the balloon behind him. He tried to reach out to find the balloon at the front of Pei Tingsong\u2019s waist. He touched it at his first try, but he soon realized that Pei Tingsong had found the balloon tied to his front, so he quickly withdrew his hand to protect his own balloon.Pei Tingsong\u2019s back exuded sweat, and he didn\u2019t know why he was feeling so hot. The balloon that he had nearly grasped was covered by Fang Juexia\u2019s slender fingers again. Pei Tingsong had no patience to keep inching forward like this; his palm covered the back of Fang Juexia\u2019s hand, wrapped around his hand and squeezed the balloon until it burst.After a perfect assault, Pei Tingsong was in a happy mood and imitated the sound of the pop to Fang Juexia, \u201cBoom.\u201dFully provocative. Only the shreds of the balloon were left in Fang Juexia\u2019s hands. He was incited and struggled away from Pei Tingsong\u2019s hands, ready to grab the balloon on Pei Tingsong\u2019s waist.Pei Tingsong guessed his next step, and went from sitting on him to straddling on him, kneeling on the outside of his thighs. He used one left hand to check Fang Juexia, so he grabbed one of Fang Juexia\u2019s wrists, lifted his arm to the mat, and pressed it with his kneeling leg. He also fumbled around and quickly found Fang Juexia\u2019s other hand, lifting it up and using his hand to press it down.\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201dFang Juexia, who had just lost a balloon, was nailed by him to the ground.\u201cYou are too cunning.\u201d Fang Juexia gritted his teeth. His voice came out a bit strenuous, but it sounded sexy to Pei Tingsong.\u201cAm I cunning?\u201d Pei Tingsong pressed his wrist hard and said, \u201cI have one life, and you also have one life left, but you have two hands, while I only have one.\u201dHis body was hot and dry, and his low voice was panting because of the intense exercise.\u201cGege, go easy on me.\u201dHaving both his arms pulled apart by Pei Tingsong, Fang Juexia\u2019s whole body was lifted from half-lying there to just laying flat. The balloon behind him was in danger, and the smooth rubber and soft foam air cushion rubbed against each other to make a dangerous sound.This was his last balloon.Pei Tingsong\u2019s strength was great, and since Fang Juexia also couldn\u2019t go all out as he did in the face of other opponents, he could only seek ways to protect himself first.So he arched his waist as much as possible to make room for the balloon, thus presenting a beautiful arced waist line.Fang Juexia, who had lost his head with ideas of victory and defeat, naturally did not know how attractive this action of his was.In the dark, Pei Tingsong seemed to have already seen through Fang Juexia\u2019s presence; his state, his posture, his blindfolded face, and as he breathed hard, his slightly opened lips\u2014 everything was in front of his eyes.His hearing had become more sensitive, and he could even hear Fang Juexia\u2019s gasps as they wormed into his ears and made them itch.He finally understood how Fang Juexia could simulate having sight in the dark. He felt exactly the same as him now.Screams and cheers sounded from below the stage, and it was very noisy. Pei Tingsong was reluctant to keep pressing down Fang Juexia\u2019s hand the entire time and got ready to initiate a quick battle to force a decision.At the moment he released Fang Juexia\u2019s wrist, Pei Tingsong\u2019s arm rubbed against the floor mat, passed under the arched waist carrying some heat from the recent friction, and grabbed the innocent balloon and looped around Fang Juexia\u2019s waist.The arm tightened, the palm exerted force, and in this half embrace that had appeared in a flash, Fang Juexia heard the sound of something bursting.The air filled sphere on his back disappeared in an instant. There was now no barrier between his hand and Fang Juexia\u2019s waist, and they stuck close together. Pei Tingsong\u2019s last attack had fulfilled his mission, and the weight of the whole person also hit Fang Juexia\u2019s body.Winning or losing was meaningless at that moment. Fang Juexia\u2019s heart beat wildly as he was being held tightly.Game over. Huge cheers broke out from the audience, and Pei Tingsong rose up from his embrace.He should have known long ago what Pei Tingsong was like when playing games. He is so good at laying things out and would make use of everything that could be used. Utilizing Fang Juexia\u2019s own sensitive hearing against him, he deliberately lured him to fall into the trap step by step, and then attacked.The host spoke a lot, but Fang Juexia didn\u2019t hear it very clearly. He pushed the blindfold up a bit to look in front of him, and the first thing he saw was Pei Tingsong\u2019s face. Pei Tingsong pulled off his blindfold with one hand, threw it to the ground, and then extended his hand towards Fang Juexia.Fang Juexia gasped for breath and raised his hand feebly, letting him hold it to let himself be pulled up from the ground by him. Although Pei Tingsong\u2019s face seemed to be as usual, Fang Juexia was still a little worried. He raised his hand and touched Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand. Pei Tingsong very quickly understood, shook his head, and rubbed Juexia\u2019s arm for a bit.\u201cAre you alright, Xiao Pei?\u201d The host came forward and asked attentively.Pei Tingsong shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m okay, but I can only play one round. Let\u2019s change the players for the next round\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cI was even stressfully sweating for them.\u201d\u201cXiao Pei is so powerful. This match was really wonderful.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s hair was so sweaty that it stuck to his face. He wiped at it, and modestly said, \u201cNot really,\u201d a statement that didn\u2019t even come close to his nature. He looked at Fang Juexia, the corners of his mouth hooking up. \u201cIt was Juexia Ge going easy on me.\u201dWith that, he grabbed Fang Juexia\u2019s hand and pressed it on the red balloon at the front of his waist. He held his hand and crushed the balloon without any hesitation.Fang Juexia was stunned. It had all happened too fast, and he didn\u2019t even get any time to react. He just saw Pei Tingsong look at him, and with a childish smile on his face, speak in a low voice\u2014\u201cMy last life, I give it to you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After that, Fang Juexia sat down and looked at his hand. His palm was still red from the impact left after Pei Tingsong\u2019s balloon burst. He turned it over and looked at the back of his hand, which was also a little red.It was a trace left from Pei Tingsong\u2019s hold.The residual trembling-like sensation still hadn\u2019t completely disappeared from his pores, just like the shrieking sounds that were coming from below the stage. Clearly, even though the two of them had been blindfolded, it was almost as though Fang Juexia could actually see it. He could even describe Pei Tingsong\u2019s appearance, including the way he had pressed into him to stop his struggles.He didn\u2019t have the heart to watch the later rounds, although they seemed very interesting, for everyone was laughing. Only when the host announced that the game was over and that the blue team had won did Fang Juexia come to know that Ling Yi had actually burst the captain\u2019s balloons first. He stood up with everyone, and Ling Yi, who had removed his blindfold, ran like the wind to hug him and He Ziyan.\u201cWe won\u00a0la!\u201d\u201cReally powerful, I didn\u2019t even go up.\u201dFang Juexia also hugged Ling Yi back, patting him on the back. \u201cReally good, really good.\u201dThe losing side needed to be punished, and even Pei Tingsong, who had recouped a round, was no exception to this. Previous experience had taught everyone that Pei Tingsong\u2019s luck was very poor. His teammates were afraid that he would draw some novel punishment, so they took the lead in blindly drawing their punishment. This result could count as being normal: they had to do push-ups while singing their part in \u2018Break Through\u2019 for one and a half minutes.Push-ups\u2026Fang Juexia glanced to his left. Pei Tingsong still had a plaster cast, and it definitely wouldn\u2019t be easy for him to do push-ups.\u201cHow about Xiao Pei just doesn\u2019t do it?\u201d The host was still very worried about his hand injury.Pei Tingsong followed his teammates. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019ve been working out this whole time.\u201dHe Ziyan suggested, \u201cWe\u2019re afraid you won\u2019t be able to hold up when pressing to the ground, so how about doing sit-ups? It\u2019s also a bit easier.\u201dThe punishment was soon changed, and Pei Tingsong now needed a partner who would hold his feet down. All the fans below the stage were shouting out Fang Juexia\u2019s name, and the host also couldn\u2019t refuse them. \u201cThen Juexia will help?\u201dFang Juexia nodded and went to Pei Tingsong, who had already laid flat on the mat and bent his legs, held his ankles, looked at Pei Tingsong\u2019s left hand, and said in a soft voice, \u201cBe careful.\u201dThis sentence once again triggered revelry from the countless fans below. Clearly, it was just a common concern, but they associated too much meaning to it.Pei Tingsong made an \u201cokay\u201d gesture, then put his uninjured hand around the back of his neck. After the host called out, \u201cPunishment begins\u201d, he began to do sit-ups.He maintained the habit of exercising all year long, so Pei Tingsong was very relaxed while doing this. Before, in order to play the game on the stage, he had taken off his big avocado green jacket and only wore a white T-shirt now. Every time he sat up, his clothes would pull up a little. From Fang Juexia\u2019s perspective, Pei Tingsong\u2019s abdominal muscles were completely visible.This was different from the other ordinary times. Pei Tingsong\u2019s abs, under the effect of the sit-ups, looked fresh and alive as they became covered with a thin layer of sweat, and as they contracted and then relaxed, they seemed to be carrying a certain unspeakable frequency, and his sunken mermaid line embedded at the edge of the waist of his jeans, continued to extend down\u2026.Fang Juexia tried to look away. He didn\u2019t know what he was feeling guilty about, the hot and dry heat remaining behind from the blindfolded game was too stubborn, and it lasted for a long time.As a rapper, Pei Tingsong\u2019s breath had always been very stable. Even while doing sit-ups, his breathing flowed outstandingly, he was just gasping a bit more than usual this time. Those gasps, mixed with the sound of his breathing, were inexplicably sexy.\u201cOkay! Time\u2019s up!\u201dAt last it was done. Fang Juexia had never felt that a minute and a half could be so long; a blunt knife like that rubbing against his heart was really hard to bear. He loosened the grip his hands had and stood up in front of Pei Tingsong, who also got up soon and leaned on him while saying, \u201cSo tired\u00a0ah.\u201dThis guy took the opportunity to blow into his ear, and Fang Juexia trembled all over.He was doing it on purpose.After the game segment ended, the host chatted with them about the concept of the new album, its creation process, and the difficulties encountered during the process. During this segment, they also played a video clip of the members hurrying to shoot the MV without taking breaks for eating or sleeping.In the first second, the boys were showing a strong expression in front of the camera. In the next second, the six boys were so sleepy that they fell asleep leaning against the wall, head to head. When a cameraman asked Fang Juexia about how many hours it had been since they had slept, he said 24 vaguely, then shook his head, saying that that wasn\u2019t right, it was actually 25. He was still dressed in a classical dance costume, and had a high ponytail, but his eyes were half-closed. He then showed an embarrassed smile because he had remembered the wrong number.The fans below the stage saw this scene and felt incomparable tender love for these K boys. At the end of the video, they were shown riding six horses in the desert park.In the background was Jiang Miao\u2019s voice as he said, \u201cWe\u2019re about to make a comeback, quickly make a wish, Ling Yi.\u201dLing Yi yelled, \u201cI wish that this album can recover its investment! Don\u2019t let our boss lose money any longer!\u201dLaughter from several other members appeared.\u201cHahahaha, that\u2019s too simple\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s make a little more money and let the boss take us to the Maldives!\u201d\u201cTch, no taste.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one with no taste, stupid Xiao Pei!\u201dIn the video, they were urging their horses forward. It was originally meant to be a very cool picture, however, unexpectedly, Lu Yuan\u2019s horse turned its head and started to trot in the opposite direction, everyone started laughing. That was the end of the video.All of K\u2019s little gags and videos exuded a very happy atmosphere, and this one was no exception. It seemed that they had never once shown a slumped mood in front of the camera. For example, Fang Juexia was even very embarrassed when his weary appearance was caught on camera.Being an idol was a profession where the person had to deliver light and warmth, and these six had always followed this principle.The fans standing under the stage couldn\u2019t help but shed a few tears when they saw the scene of the six people sleeping against the wall, as well as during Ling Yi\u2019s last simple wish.When the video ended, Chen Mo also sighed and spoke, \u201cOur little K faced a lot of difficulties during their comeback this time, but fortunately, they got past it all. I always think that the great thing about boy-bands is that although there are many troubles and difficulties we encounter in this life, and that we always have to grit their teeth to get through it all, and most of the time we are all alone, but no matter how hard it is, you all at least have each other, which is the most precious thing.\u201dAnother host adjusted the atmosphere by remarking, \u201cIt\u2019s suddenly gotten quite sentimental, I even find myself welling up in tears.\u201dLu Yuan immediately nodded. \u201cMe too, I was just thinking, what to do, how do I quietly wipe away my tears and not look shameful?\u201dLing Yi immediately unmasked him. \u201cTch, you were sniffling just now.\u201dThe fans below broke down again and laughed.Fang Juexia was still immersed in the end of the video, and suddenly asked, \u201cSo have we made enough money to go to the Maldives this time yet?\u201d\u201cHahahahaha what\u2019s with this Ge?!\u201d\u201cHahahaha, what a persistent group.\u201dAfter filming half of the program, the host led everyone to start a new game segment. \u201cThe following game is a very classic one.\u201dKaleido was arranged in front of the long table according to their official positions. There were six screens on the side of the table facing the audience. There was nothing on the screen for the time being, but the audience had already pretty much guessed what the game was.Chen Mo said with a smile, \u201cThat\u2019s right, next is our \u2018Guess Which One of Us in Undercover\u2019 segment! First of all, let\u2019s talk about the rules of the game. At the start of the game, each member of our small K will draw a card, in which there will be one undercover and one blank slate card. The undercover card will be different from that of everyone else\u2019s, while the blank slate card is blank and has nothing written on it. Everyone will speak in order and describe their cards. At the end of each round, you have to vote for who you think has the blank slate card or is the undercover person. As long as you manage to pick out all the blank slates and undercover people, you\u2019ll win the game.\u201dPei Tingsong asked, \u201cIs there an undercover person and a blank slate in every round?\u201d\u201cNot necessarily\u00a0oh.\u201d The host said, \u201cIf there is one, there will only be one of each; there may also be a situation where there is no undercover person, and only a blank slate in that round, or one where there is no blank slate card, only an undercover person.\u201dThe members all nodded, and the game began.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cOkay, you guys can check your cards, and be careful not to let others see it\u00a0oh.\u201d The host told the audience below, \u201cEveryone must remain quiet, don\u2019t disturb our small K.\u201dThe six members carefully picked up the cards on the table, their movements cautious. The screens facing the audience in front of each of their tables had already displayed their cards at the same time.He Ziyan: Watching a horror filmLu Yuan: Watching a horror filmJiang Miao: Watching a horror filmLing Yi: Haunted House AdventureFang Juexia: Watching a horror filmPei Tingsong: Blank slateThe members began to clamor once they confirmed their cards.\u201cWow~\u201d\u201cExciting.\u201d\u201cVery exciting.\u201dFang Juexia saw the card in his hand and very soon began to search for descriptors in his mind. Only Pei Tingsong, who had gotten the blank slate, upon hearing all his Geges say it was exciting, could pretend as if he was seeing something and make a meaningful expression.The fans below the stage covered their small mouths and laughed secretly. After seeing the members finish confirming their cards, the host pointed to He Ziyan. \u201cLet\u2019s start from Ziyan\u00a0ba.\u201dHe Ziyan leaned half of his body against the table before describing, \u201cHmm\u2026 This is an activity that is very psychologically taxing.\u201dNext was Lu Yuan. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s not something suitable for children to do.\u201dThe fans below the stage started laughing.Jiang Miao went on to describe, \u201cThe ones from Japan are more famous.\u201dThe host inserted a few words here, \u201cWhy do I feel like this is developing more and more in the wrong direction?\u201d\u201cHahahahaha adult development!\u201dJapanese? Ling Yi was a little confused, but he thought that the Japanese haunted houses were really famous, so he confidently and boldly described his part, \u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t like them, and I feel like I can\u2019t do them.\u201d\u201cHahaha, you can\u2019t do them!\u201dFang Juexia was also amused by him. He put aside all of the descriptions he had thought of originally and glanced at Pei Tingsong as he said, \u201cXiao Pei may also not be able to\u2026\u201d\u201cHahahahahahaha!\u201dPei Tingsong couldn\u2019t make heads or tails out of these words, he wondered what they were all really talking about. One second, it\u2019s not suitable for children, the next second it\u2019s that Japanese ones are famous, and then the next second, saying he can\u2019t do it.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to describe it, just describe it, don\u2019t imply things about your bandmates.\u201dHe had no clue, so he could only start deriving things from the very person who went first. He thought of\u00a0He Ziyan\u00a0talking about psychological quality, which linked his thoughts to Fang Juexia, who had the best psychological quality among all of them, and so he threw it back.Pei Tingsong forced himself to be calm, coughed, and gambled, \u201cIt\u2019s easier for Juexia Ge to do this.\u201dIn fact, he completely didn\u2019t know what he was doing, there was just a lot of smutty garbage in his head right now.\u201cOh ~\u201d the host nodded and declared, \u201cThen you guys can start voting now.\u201dHe Ziyan and Lu Yuan both pointed at Jiang Miao, while Ling Yi pointed at Pei Tingsong. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t know who to point to for a moment, then thought of how Pei Tingsonng had brought him up. He felt it was a little suspicious, so he pointed at Pei Tingsong.As a blank slate, in order to protect himself, Pei Tingsong pointed at Jiang Miao.The captain argued for himself, \u201cThe Japanese ones are just very famous\u00a0ah.\u201dLu Yuan took the microphone and added, \u201cEuropean and American ones are also quite\u2026\u201d\u201cHahahahahaha!\u201dHe Ziyan shrugged. \u201cCan\u2019t make them domestically anyway.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s face showed a mysterious smile.Pei Tingsong suspected that they were talking about porn, but he had no evidence.\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Could this even be broadcast then?\u201cVote again.\u201dHe Ziyan, Lu Yuan, and Pei Tingsong still voted for the group leader. Even the\u00a0fence-sitter\u00a0Ling Yi changed his vote, and Jiang Miao was voted out of the game with four votes.\u201cThen Miaomiao will be eliminated. Miaomiao, come here.\u201d The host pulled on Jiang Miao\u2019s arm and warned, \u201cDon\u2019t expose everything\u00a0oh.\u201dAs soon as Jiang Miao saw everyone\u2019s cards, he laughed. \u201cAlright\u00a0ba, good luck everyone.\u201d\u201cOkay, the game goes on. It\u2019s still He Ziyan who will start.\u201dHowever, He Ziyan said with a smile, \u201cThis time, the last person should talk first\u00a0ba.\u201dFang Juexia also took a look at Pei Tingsong. Pei Tingsong knew that if he refused at this time, he would attract more suspicion.\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll talk first.\u201dNo matter whether they were watching porn or not, since all of their descriptions were so close to that topic, there should be some similarities. Pei Tingsong gambled and said, \u201cThis is an activity that needs to be completed with the eyes.\u201dHis other four bandmates nodded meaningfully and then turned to Fang Juexia.He passed?Fang Juexia described, \u201cEn\u2026. This activity can be done by one person or with multiple people, and if there are more people, the kind of popular atmosphere generated will be different.\u201dAfter hearing Fang Juexia\u2019s words, Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart ended up with even more question marks.It couldn\u2019t really be about doing something smutty?Pei Tingsong was perplexed. How could he not do it, and to top it all, it was even Fang Juexia saying that he couldn\u2019t do it!From their prior descriptions, Ling Yi faintly felt that the people beside him didn\u2019t quite have the same thing as him. What European, American, Japanese, what was the difference between haunted houses from different countries? However, thankfully he at least had a card with something on it; in this kind of game, the undercover card should be similar to the normal cards.\u201cEn\u2026\u201d Ling Yi thought for a moment before speaking, \u201cI feel like\u00a0ah,\u00a0this kind of activity may-may make people kind of nervous.\u201dWhen it came to Lu Yuan, he was concise and clear with his words, \u201cIt makes people cry out.\u201d\u201cHahahahahaha!\u201d\u201cThis group is poisonous!\u201dBy now, Pei Tingsong\u2019s head was already filled with some strange images he couldn\u2019t get rid of.He Ziyan cleared his throat and added, \u201cIt has a better feel when it is done in the dead of the night.\u201dHost Chen Mo couldn\u2019t hold back, \u201cI used to watch this game and sweat for the people with the undercover and blank slate cards, but now I\u2019m sweating for our program.\u201dAnother host also tried hard to suppress their smile. \u201cIt\u2019s really curious what route this game has taken\u00a0oh.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dThe hostess said, \u201cThen you guys vote now\u00a0ba.\u201dHe Ziyan voted for Ling Yi. \u201cLing Yi seems to just be keeping his head above the water\u00a0ah. He said that doing this activity would make you nervous, but I said in the first round that it would require a good psychological quality. It feels like Ling Yi is guessing.\u201dHowever, Fang Juexia voted for Lu Yuan. \u201cI feel like for the last two rounds, Yuanyuan has been a bit, how to put it, his descriptions tend to be a little\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d Lu Yuan asked.He Ziyan said with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s not suitable for children, and then you said that people will cry out.\u201d After that, he also felt it was a little strange. \u201cNo, the more I think about it, the wronger it seems\u2026\u201dFang Juexia, who had succeeded in finding someone sympathetic to his view, agreed, \u201cRight\u00a0ba, it\u2019s really strange.\u201dHe Ziyan nodded. \u201cI won\u2019t cry out.\u201dFang Juexia followed suit and added, \u201cI won\u2019t either.\u201d\u201cHahahahahahaha!\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Lu Yuan suddenly grew excited and defended himself, \u201cYou guys don\u2019t really think I have\u2026\u201d He paused, and his next first two words were uttered very heavily, \u201cThat kind\u00a0of card\u00a0ba.\u201dHis words immediately caused Pei Tingsong to sober up; the kind of card Lu Yuan was talking about was the one he was thinking of incorrectly, and it was very obvious that the cards He Ziyan and Fang Juexia held weren\u2019t of that kind.Then what was it? Something you watch with your eyes, the Japanese, European, and American ones are very famous, they can\u2019t be made in China, one person can do it, with multiple people you have a different atmosphere, and it can be done in the dead of the night.The main point was, he, Pei Tingsong, couldn\u2019t do it.That was too comical, he hadn\u2019t met anything he couldn\u2019t do before. Alright\u00a0ba, besides the haunted house from last time.Haunted?Pei Tingsong saw the light; so it was horror movies!This group of people really went too far, nearly causing him, this blank slate, to change colors.Pei Tingsong, who was now confident that he had probably guessed the right answer, began to stir up the flames, just like a king who had gone through untold hardships to find the password to his main account for the game, and started making a clear, resonated, and genuine analysis out loud, \u201cThis kind of game is generally difficult in front of the players who have the blank slate card, because that person wouldn\u2019t know how to describe it. I think Yuan Ge may have the undercover card, and he\u2019s just stirring things up.\u201dLing Yi felt that he was in grave danger. He had just escaped from He Ziyan\u2019s tiger mouth, so he quickly conformed to Pei Tingsong\u2019s idea. \u201cI also feel like that, ever since Yuanyuan started speaking, we\u2019ve gone a bit off-track.\u201dTheir captain standing at the side internally thought\u2014didn\u2019t it start going off-track with me?As a result, the remaining five members of K happily and laughingly all voted for Lu Yuan.The host coughed. \u201cThe game continues.\u201dLing Yi made an exaggerated \u201cahhh\u201d sound, complaining, \u201cStill have to continue\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cHe Ziyan, start describing\u00a0ba.\u201dHe Ziyan stood up straight while holding the microphone and spoke, \u201cArriving to this point, it\u2019s hard to describe\u00a0ah, without saying it directly.\u201d He thought about it, then said a keyword, \u201cPlease put\u00a0XX\u00a0on the public screen.\u201d\u201cHahahaha, automatic silencing.\u201dHearing this, Ling Yi felt that He Ziyan\u2019s card was similar to his own. He couldn\u2019t help thinking, it couldn\u2019t be that he wasn\u2019t the undercover person? It couldn\u2019t be that Two Fire had just followed the description on other people\u2019s cards before?He described carefully, \u201cEn\u2026. Because of this, Xiao Pei went on the Hot Search list.\u201dOnce this sentence was said, everyone understood what the undercover card was. Fang Juexia\u2019s face was calm. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t appeared in our ensemble show, but there are similar sections.\u201dPei Tingsong now knew that Ling Yi\u2019s card said \u2018haunted house.\u2019 Then when he heard Fang Juexia\u2019s statement, he became even more sure that the rest of these people had \u2018horror movie\u2019 on their cards, so he said very naturally and grandly, \u201cYou can\u2019t really enter this activity to experience it, although sometimes it is more immersive.\u201d\u201cOkay, let\u2019s start voting!\u201dObviously, everyone voted for Ling Yi, who had exposed himself but didn\u2019t know it. Ling Yi felt very wronged, but he didn\u2019t know how to say it, so he cried, \u201cYou\u2019re all bullying me!\u201dPei Tingsong let out a\u00a0hehe\u00a0inside.\u00a0I fear that the one being bullied is me, not you.There were only three people left on the field, but the game still wasn\u2019t over yet. He Ziyan took the microphone and said, \u201cIt\u2019s very obvious\u00a0ah, it must be Xiao Pei. He also just happens to be the last one to go.\u201dPei Tingsong had already said that the person with the blank slate card wasn\u2019t amongst the people who went first, so now, if he voted for He Ziyan, he would be going against his previous logic. \u201cI\u2019m confused, I don\u2019t know who to vote for now. If you guys think it\u2019s me, that\u2019s fine, but I\u2019ve made it very clear that this activity can\u2019t really be experienced.\u201dHe Ziyan stared him in the eye, a little suspicious. He tried\u00a0 to recall what Fang Juexia had said in the first two rounds; those words had seemed a bit vague. In the first round, he had just gone along with what others were saying. In the second round, he had said one person could do it, but so could multiple people.Fang Juexia actually began to argue for Pei Tingsong at this time, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s Xiao Pei, because when I said he couldn\u2019t do it, he didn\u2019t protest.\u201d\u201cHahahahahaha, no way to protest!\u201d\u201cPei Tingsong can\u2019t do it! Hahahaha!\u201dPei Tingsong could only climb along this ladder. \u201cI just can\u2019t do it\u00a0ah, no problem, and I especially can\u2019t do it.\u201d He looked at Fang Juexia and said, \u201cBelieve me.\u201dFang Juexia carefully smoothed out his thoughts about the two people\u2019s words in his mind again. No matter how he thought about it, He Ziyan couldn\u2019t be the blank slate. As he was the first person to speak, even the probability that he was the undercover person was low. Although Pei Tingsong\u2019s words were also logical, he still chose to believe in the basic rules of the game. \u201cI\u2019ll still vote for Xiao Pei\u00a0ba.\u201dPei Tingsong was stunned. \u201cHey, no, you just said it wasn\u2019t me, how did it still boomerang back?\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s changing of votes made He Ziyan suspicious again. He thought that since he had just helped argue for Xiao Pei in order to get his vote, now he couldn\u2019t vote for the first person to speak, so he simply changed his vote.So He Ziyan also boomeranged around. \u201cI\u2019m voting for Fang Juexia.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s head was filled with question marks. These double boomerangs made his head spin, but he was the blank slate\u00a0ah,\u00a0and if he wanted to win this time, of course he would have to follow suit while voting.What did love count as? Pei Tingsong pointed at Fang Juexia. \u201cI vote Juexia out.\u201dThe audience below the stage had been amused into laughing until their sides were splitting by these members, and especially more so when they were exposed to this last scene of TingJue loving each other and killing each other.\u201cOkay.\u201d The host tried his best to maintain his composure. \u201cWe\u2019re announcing now\u2014\u201dThe background music started up.\u201cThe blank slate wins!\u201dHe Ziyan immediately realized that he had changed his vote to the wrong person.\u201cI just knew it,\u201d Fang Juexia slapped his hand on the table twice. Originally, he didn\u2019t have much desire to win or lose, but clearly, by the end of the game, he had figured out who the blank slate was, and success had only been one step away from him.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgThinking about this, Fang Juexia felt a little annoyed, and so he turned to Pei Tingsong and kicked him a few times. Although his tone didn\u2019t fluctuate greatly, his words were very cute. \u201cLiar, you even voted for me.\u201dPei Tingsong ducked from Fang Juexia and was overjoyed. \u201cI was stunned by you two in the end, okay? You were in-fighting within yourselves.\u201dHe Ziyan raised his hand and admitted, \u201cBlame me, blame me, my fault, I overthought things in the end.\u201dThe other members came back onstage and said, \u201cAre you guys going to be just like that and let the blank slate win? You\u2019re even someone who has been on a famous high IQ escape room game.\u201dFang Juexia insisted on his own view, \u201cIf he had gone with my vote, we would have won.\u201d Saying that, he felt very angry again and wanted to hammer Pei Tingsong. However, then he thought of his injured left hand and held back, clenching his fist in mid-air.\u201cCan\u2019t do anything about it, who let me be too smart?\u201d Pei Tingsong cheekily grabbed Fang Juexia\u2019s wrist, dragged it down, and held his hand under the table.The host couldn\u2019t help but add, \u201cThis was the first time we\u2019ve had so many ups and downs in the history of our program while playing \u2018Who is Undercover\u2019.\u201d\u201cYes, it repeatedly kept jumping too close to the censorship line.\u201dLu Yuan asked Pei Tingsong, \u201cChild Xiao Pei, did you have many question marks around your head at the beginning?\u201dThe captain\u2019s habitual worry rose up. \u201cI\u2019m so worried that after this episode gets broadcast, Xiao Pei will get onto the Hot Search List because he can\u2019t do it.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dThey happily ended the \u2018Who is Undercover\u2019 game, after which K sang a non-main song from the new album, and then played the games of lyrical solitaire and pictionary the program group had prepared. The filming of the show lasted for five hours, from noon to evening, and the fans were very reluctant to leave when it ended.When they got off work, it was just in time for dinner. Chen Mo was a very good person, and he had, early on, asked his assistant to make a reservation at a very famous private cuisine restaurant. Along with the host team, he invited the whole Kaleido group to have dinner and taste the local specialties. People in this city had a more spicy palate, and so Fang Juexia\u2019s light Cantonese palate made him sweat when eating it.It was hard to avoid drinking alcohol when eating at such a gathering. Before Fang Juexia could explain himself, Pei Tingsong took the lead. \u201cJuexia Ge can\u2019t drink alcohol.\u201d\u201cOh, like that, then what about Xiao Pei?\u201d\u201cI also don\u2019t like drinking too much, I\u2019ll just drink plain water.\u201dHe had managed to avoid the problem of alcohol, but now he still had to avoid the problem of all the spicy food. Fang Juexia chose what he could eat from all the dishes on the table. He thought that the chilis in the stir-fried meat wouldn\u2019t be that spicy, but he didn\u2019t expect it to be mid-grade level spiciness.His tongue was burning like it was on fire, and in that moment, he hurriedly took hold of the wrong cup, and drank some of Ling Yi\u2019s baijiu.\u201cWu.\u201dChen Mo looked at him. \u201cJuexia, what\u2019s wrong? Is it really spicy?\u201dPei Tingsong quickly handed water to him. \u201cSlow down.\u201d Then he replied in Fang Juexia\u2019s stead, \u201cHe\u2019s from Guangzhou, he can\u2019t eat spicy food.\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s like that. Then you eat some dim sum\u00a0ba. This one is made of glutinous rice, and it\u2019s very delicious.\u201dPei Tingsong took advantage of the situation and put a piece of dim sum in Fang Juexia\u2019s bowl. He also served him a bowl of milk-white fish soup, which he aired out before putting aside.He didn\u2019t really know how to do such sorts of considerate things, almost burning himself when he was serving him soup, just like a child.But Fang Juexia liked these little things very much.After the meal, Chen Mo spoke a lot with them. Being able to get the advice of an elder from within the circle, one who could be all things to all men, was a very rare opportunity.\u201cYou guys are rookies, and there\u2019s still a long way to go ahead, but you guys have the strength, and you will definitely have a good future.\u201d Chen Mo said, \u201cIt\u2019s just that this circle is also very complicated, and you should be careful with every step you take. I\u2019ve heard a bit about your leaked song issue from before, and it may happen again in the future. You should be ready at all times.\u201dJiang Miao nodded. \u201cThank you, Mr. Chen.\u201dThe weather had changed a bit when they came out after dinner. Fang Juexia was just wearing a thin black short sleeved shirt. As soon as he came outside, he let out a small sneeze. Just as he wrapped his arms around himself, a jacket was placed over his body.It was the green cardigan that Pei Tingsong had originally been wearing.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m not cold.\u201d Fang Juexia wanted to take it off and give it back to him, but Pei Tingsong deliberately pretended to be fierce and stared at him as he insisted, \u201cPut it on.\u201dWhile the others were saying goodbye, he whispered into Fang Juexia\u2019s ear, \u201cBe good.\u201dFang Juexia completely lost the ability to refuse him with that, even though he had never seemed to possess such an ability in the first place.It was already ten o\u2019clock in the evening by the time they returned to the hotel. Cheng Qiang promised them that they could stay in the city for an extra day and use it as a free day. After spending a whole day bustling around and filming, they were all tired, so they retired to their rooms early.Cheng Qiang had been busy running up and down all day, and he had overseen their whole filming process for the program, so he was already half dead with fatigue. After returning to the room, he helped Xiao Pei take a bath and change his clothes. He looked at his watch when it was almost eleven o\u2019clock, so he took a shower casually, climbed into bed, and turned off the light. \u201cGo to bed early.\u201dPei Tingsong, who was lying under the quilt, soon heard their agent snoring away. However, he was in high spirits and couldn\u2019t fall asleep. Like a slideshow, the things that had happened during the day started to scroll across his mind, but in the end, he got stuck on the scene where Fang Juexia was dancing. He had twisted his waist so attractively, looking like water flowing in the night.He liked everything that flowed.Fang Juexia opened the door of his room alone. He was a slight germaphobe, so the first thing he did upon entering the room was take a bath. The hot steam in the bathroom made him dizzy, and the more he washed, the dizzier he became. So, he soon turned off the water, put on clean pajamas and came out from the bathroom with the steam following him, and after walking a few steps, he just fell on the soft white bed.As soon as he turned his head, Fang Juexia remembered the scene where Pei Tingsong had been pressed on top of him during the day. He didn\u2019t know why, but he just couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it.A room with only one person was very quiet. The sound of the clock ticked and skipped, and integrated with the little clock in his heart. As it kept ticking, it made him a little flustered.Fang Juexia tilted his head and looked out the window. Only a full moon was hanging in the dark sky, bright white and glowing.He didn\u2019t know if that one mouthful of alcohol played a role, but as he looked at it, Fang Juexia felt that the black sky was like his black clothes from today, and the slanting moon was like a round hole, exactly the size of a heart.In this way, Fang Juexia regarded himself as a mathematical problem and applied the substitution method once. The equivalent substitution was that his heart had been dug away, and his dark chest was only left with a glowing hole.Sure enough.His outstretched arm touched the green outerwear lying beside the bed. Fang Juexia lifted it up, curled his fingers around it, and covered his face with it. Even though he was clearly addicted to cleanliness, he started fantasizing about this dirty used piece of clothing.This was Pei Tingsong\u2019s clothing, and it smelled of Pei Tingsong.Fang Juexia closed his eyes and sniffed.It seemed to contain the smell of his own heart.This statement was really ridiculous, very illogical, and a totally unrealistic fantasy.He seemed to be becoming more and more like Pei Tingsong.The sound of vibration pulled him back from the edge of his fantasy. Fang Juexia opened his eyes, his heart beating wildly. With a hint of secretive guilt lingering, he set aside the clothing, reached for his cellphone by his pillow, and checked his messages.[A Constant Truth: Are you asleep?]It really was like that\u2014whatever he was thinking of would actually arrive. Fang Juexia adjusted his breathing before replying that he hadn\u2019t slept yet.Holding his cellphone, he suddenly started looking forward to things a bit. Very soon, his phone vibrated again.[A Constant Truth: The moonlight above my bed isn\u2019t good-looking. I want to see the moonlight from your bed.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As he sat in a daze for a long time, a knock sounded on the door.He had come unasked, just like the moon always did.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t overthink it. He put down his cellphone and walked to the entranceway of his room barefoot. He didn\u2019t even have time to turn on the light there, instead, he just felt his way across the wall all the way to the door.\u201cWho is it?\u201dFrom across the door, he heard Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice, with a hint of boyish delight in his low voice, \u201cMe\u00a0ah, who else could it be?\u201dEverything was dark in front of Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes. He fumbled around until he grasped the door knob, but he suddenly hesitated, and his bare toes subconsciously grasped the floor.\u201cIt\u2019s so late, you\u2019re still not sleeping?\u201dAll of a sudden, he heard a thump, the sound of Pei Tingsong pressing his forehead against the door.\u201cI missed you.\u201d He was very quiet, the sound pretty much tunneling through the crack in the door.Fang Juexia was loath to refuse him, so he opened the door.In the dark, his waist was embraced by an arm. When the door closed, he stumbled forward as he was taken along and pressed against the wall of the entryway. Behind him was the cold wall, and in front of him a warm chest.\u201cDidn\u2019t you miss me?\u201d Pei Tingsong lowered his head and closed his lips tightly around Fang Juexia\u2019s earlobe.There seemed to be some particles in his hoarse voice, grinding and scraping at Fang Juexia\u2019s heart. It was so itchy. Fang Juexia turned his head and let out a quiet \u2018en.\u2019Of course he had missed him.He had missed him so much that he had even started fantasizing about Pei Tingsong\u2019s clothes just now. Fang Juexia was a little embarrassed, so he reached out to push him away, felt his way along the wall and walked to a spot with some light. In an unnatural manner, he picked up the cardigan on the bed and put it on the sofa. He then went ahead and sat on the sofa, right under the window, with one leg bent up, and his arm around his knee.\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to see the moon? Look\u00a0ba.\u201dPei Tingsong walked inside the room with a smile, looking at Fang Juexia all the while, who was wearing a set of pure white short-sleeved pajamas, with his two snow-white long legs exposed. His whole body was covered in the moonlight streaming in through the window, like a snow-white flower blooming at night. Perfectly clean and beautiful.He walked over to Fang Juexia and sat cross-legged on the carpet in front of him. He held onto Fang Juexia\u2019s ankle and his pale foot as he asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you cold? Walking barefoot on the ground, are you a kid?\u201dFang Juexia wasn\u2019t quite pleased to be called a kid by a real kid. He tried to pull his leg out of Pei Tingsong\u2019s grasp, but the other person exerted a little effort, not letting him succeed in his attempt. So Fang Juexia\u2019s only other option was to lift his other leg, place its heel on Pei Tingsong\u2019s shoulder, and push him off.Only because he wasn\u2019t wearing a sling around his neck, and his injured hand had been set down, did Fang Juexia dare to use some strength this way.\u201cYour temper is really getting worse and worse.\u201d Although he said so, the tone he used was so gentle. He then turned his head and kissed the foot lying on his shoulder. Under the moonlight, he kissed all the way up from his ankle to his foot, cherishing him deeply.Fang Juexia was a little flustered and wanted to pull his leg back, but Pei Tingsong pulled on his wrist instead, and he fell into his arms, hugged with his arm against his back.\u201cPei Tingsong, what are you doing?\u201d Fang Juexia struggled to get out of his grasp again, but Pei Tingsong pulled his parted legs around his waist, while his arms also wrapped around the back of his neck.\u201cNothing,\u201d said Pei Tingsong as he supported and carried Fang Juexia to the bed. Then he leaned over to put him on the bed, before pressing himself onto him. \u201cLooking at the moonlight.\u201d Then he kissed Fang Juexia on the cheek. \u201cThe moonlight on your body.\u201dThe tip of his nose rubbed against Fang Juexia\u2019s face, and Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice was hoarse as he explained, \u201cYour face is a little hot, it feels very nice to kiss.\u201dEach of his words left Fang Juexia\u00a0 at a loss. He was rubbed until his face started to itch, and he half-narrowed his eyes before scolding, \u201cDon\u2019t talk anymore.\u201d\u201cHow can I do that? I\u2019m a rapper after all.\u201d Pei Tingsong laughed and continued, \u201cKissing me is the only way to shut me up, want to try?\u201dHis invitation was very straightforward. Fang Juexia blinked once, then as if he had made up his mind, kissed him.When their lips touched each other, they seemed to have a magical power. The desire pervading through each of their bodies finally connected together, and just like their entangled breaths, their youthful hormones and lust intertwined. They heated up the cool moonlight, and then wrapped it around their bodies, so they weren\u2019t afraid of the cold.Fang Juexia liked kissing and the feeling of the tip of Pei Tingsong\u2019s tongue prying in, letting in the fragrance of mint as it licked the soft and fragile mucous membrane, and rubbed against the smooth and sharp tip of a tooth. As this part of their bodies entangled, Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand reached into\u00a0 the hem of Fang Juexia\u2019s clothes, pressed his soft back, and went up little by little against the grooves of his spine. His smooth skin was groped by Pei Tingsong\u2019s palm until it grew hot.It was always quiet this late at night, and the wet sounds that overflowed from their intertwined lips echoed in their ears, like a circuitous tide of emotions, and this reprisal aggravated Fang Juexia\u2019s desire.The lack of vision, not enough oxygen, and the little alcohol he had consumed made Fang Juexia hallucinate. The scenes of Pei Tingsong chasing victory during the game earlier, of putting his coat over his face, and of his overwhelming kiss at the moment\u2014\u00a0 all three scenes mixed together, and with each layer, his desire only increased.The tip of Pei Tingsong\u2019s tongue stirred into Fang Juexia\u2019s kiss. He liked to kiss deeply and then separate to look at Fang Juexia. His lover, when lost in the throes of lust, was the most beautiful; his lips were slightly open, panting out hot breaths, and his eyes were covered with a lustrous liquid veneer.Pei Tingsong kissed his birthmark again, rubbed his skin with his fingertips, and asked in a deep voice, \u201cHow can you be this attractive, hm?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help kissing him again, at the freshest and liveliest part of his body.Fang Juexia panted lightly. His hands were on Pe Tingsong\u2019s back as he hugged him, and he didn\u2019t say anything, but he also reached his hands into Pei Tingsong\u2019s cotton pajamas, to stick his palms against Pei Tingsong\u2019s skin. This gesture was too obvious a sign of sentimental attachment.\u201cIf you\u2019re like this, I won\u2019t be able to hold back anymore.\u201d Pei Tingsong kissed his forehead, eyes, and the tip of his nose.Fang Juexia caressed his spine, stuck out the tip of his tongue, and licked the corner of his lip. \u201cWon\u2019t be able to hold back what?\u201dHis voice usually possessed a very strong sense of coolness. However, when he gasped to speak now, it carried instead the taboo flavor of forced ravishment, which made it easier for people to have the desire to wreck him.\u201cWon\u2019t be able to hold back from bullying you.\u201d Pei Tingsong poked the tip of his tongue in again, pried his teeth open, and went back to that moist and warm place. It seemed that he wanted to remember every detail of Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth, for he licked and kissed every place so meticulously, winding his tongue deep inside, and hanging on without letting go. His hand also traveled from the back around to the front, his palm caressing upwards. Fang Juexia was even more sensitive than he had imagined, his body already starting to quiver from just these actions.\u201cWu\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong and Fang Juexia separated, a silver strand of saliva between them, glowing under the moonlight.\u201cAre you afraid?\u201dFang Juexia was left dizzy from his kiss; this was his first time, so he still wasn\u2019t used to the direct impact lust had on him. However, he shouldn\u2019t be afraid, he had clearly already searched for information on this. So he shook his head, his pair of clear eyes looking directly at Pei Tingsong. \u201cI checked online, about stuff related to this\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong was stunned at first, and then laughed, but he soon explained himself, \u201cI\u2019m not laughing at you, I just think you\u2019re too cute.\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t I have checked it?\u201d Fang Juexia thought it was very logical and explained, \u201cYou have to learn the unknown in order for it to become known.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s wise to prepare for these lessons in advance.\u201d Pei Tingsong lowered his head, and the tips of their noses touched intimately. \u201cTeacher Fang, you teach me\u00a0ba.\u201dThis title was too shameful, and Fang Juexia\u2019s face suddenly went red. \u201cI\u2014how can I teach?\u201dPei Tingsong kissed the soft skin under his ears. \u201cYou can teach me however you like. Anyway, I\u2019m a pure virginal boy.\u201dThisreally was being too shamelessly boastful.Fang Juexia\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bobbed up and down, and he licked his lower lip. He didn\u2019t know how to teach something like this; he only knew that right now they were unprepared and couldn\u2019t do it. \u201cWe can\u2019t do it yet\u2026\u201d\u201cDo it?\u201d Pei Tingsong gently kissed the side of his neck while playing dumb. \u201cDo what? Make love?\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t expect him to be so straightforward. He was stunned, and his eyes even widened. Pei Tingsong raised his head and just happened to see his expression. He thought Fang Juexia was too cute and continued to tease him, \u201cSo you want to make love with me\u00a0ah.\u201dThese two words continuously poked at Fang Juexia\u2019s heart. He wanted to deny it, because it was too direct, but to deny it would be a lie.He could only repeat, \u201cWe can\u2019t do it yet\u2026 We haven\u2019t done any preparations, and your hand is still injured.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll go slowly, there\u2019s no need to go all the way at once.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s injured hand was bent at his elbow, and he hadn\u2019t pressed its whole weight onto his body. Instead, he just carefully kissed Fang Juexia\u2019s lips, but didn\u2019t go into a deeper and more thorough kiss. With his other hand, he began to undo the buttons of Fang Juexia\u2019s pajamas, one by one.Not going all the way at once\u2026what did that mean?His kisses had left Fang Juexia so hot and dry, and his reason was in danger of being torn apart by his hormones. His hand feebly held onto Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand, but it could not stop his movements. He felt like a popsicle whose packaging had been torn open, which made him uneasy, and he was worried that his taste was too mediocre, and that Pei Tingsong wouldn\u2019t like this flavor.What he didn\u2019t know was that Pei Tingsong was crazy for him.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org**Smut goes here, buy the raws to see!**That night was a piece of quietly burning metal, with glass windows that blocked out everything. They couldn\u2019t hear the sound of the cars driving on the road or even the slight hum of the neon lights, all they could hear was each other\u2019s voices.Fang Juexia seemed indifferent, but in fact, hidden in his heart were many people and various things he liked. His mother, his strict grandfather, the flowers and greenery growing on the balcony, especially that once neglected cactus, his favorite dance, Little Abacus who pestered and was always unwilling to part from him, his dreams, and finally, his bandmates who went all out with him.One of his bandmates in particular.The darkness and silence were like a magnifying glass, stretching out all the details, so that last ending moment was also stretched out. He was so spent that he had almost no strength to even turn over. Pei Tingsong hugged him from behind, encircling him like a big dog, uttering all kinds of honey-sweet words.As if that wasn\u2019t enough, he was turned over to face him, held in his arms, and then repeatedly kissed, until their brains were numb, until even Pei Tingsong seemed unable to say a word.It seemed that they were able to live just by kissing.One night was fine, one lifetime was also fine.Their diminished physical strength brought about a good night\u2019s sleep. They nestled close to each other, providing each other with the greatest sense of security. Fang Juexia, who had never slept in, woke up for a moment due to his biological clock in the morning. Upon seeing Pei Tingsong\u2019s quiet sleeping face, he felt at ease, so he relaxed and curled back into his arms, kissed his hand and arm gently, and went to sleep again.When he next woke up, it was from being awakened by the sound of a vibration. Pei Tingsong vaguely stretched out his arm to find the source of the vibration, and finally touched his cellphone. He had left it on the bedside table when he had taken off his clothes last night.He worked hard to open his eyes and saw that it was actually Cheng Qiang calling. His head felt faint, and he couldn\u2019t think of an excuse at the moment, so he just hung up.\u201cWho\u00a0ah\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia shrank into the quilt, feeling very lazy, and even his words sounded soft.\u201cQiang Ge.\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, the vibration came again, but this time it was from another place. By now, Pei Tingsong had woken up a lot, so he searched for it\u2019s source for a while before finally finding Fang Juexia\u2019s cellphone under the pillow. It was still Cheng Qiang.Fang Juexia guessed it right when he saw Pei Tingsong\u2019s expression. His sleepiness suddenly disappeared\u00a0 and he carefully took the phone from Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand, then cleared his throat, only picking up after that. \u201cHello?\u201d\u201cJuexia? Where are you\u00a0ah?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia replied honestly, \u201cI\u2019m at the hotel, I haven\u2019t got up yet.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s ten o\u2019clock, and you\u2019re still not up yet?\u201d\u201cUm well, I took a bit of a chill yesterday and had a headache. I didn\u2019t sleep well at night, so I slept a little more in the morning.\u201dCheng Qiang let out an \u201coh\u201d and said, \u201cYou\u2019re alright now\u00a0ba?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, I may have just not gotten enough rest.\u201d\u201cI thought you also went out, and I wanted to ask you if you have seen Xiao Pei. That little brat, as soon as I opened my eyes, he had disappeared, and I don\u2019t know where he has gone.\u201dWith a guilty heart, Fang Juexia looked at Pei Tingsong, who was beside him. When Pei Tingsong saw him looking at himself, he even deliberately drew close and kissed him, then was pushed away by Fang Juexia. \u201cEn\u2026. I haven\u2019t seen him either.\u201dAs soon as he lied, his heart started to beat wildly.\u201cAlright\u00a0ba, I\u2019ll ask some of the others. Yesterday, Ziyan said they were going to climb about, so maybe he\u2019s with them.\u201dFang Juexia was afraid of giving the game away, so he said, \u201cI think maybe Xiao Pei went out to have fun by himself. He already likes to come and go freely, and climbing mountains\u2026. He probably doesn\u2019t like that kind of sport either.\u201d Then he added, \u201cHe\u2019s already 20, don\u2019t worry, Qiang Ge. You\u2019ve also been tired recently, so take a day off\u00a0ba.\u201dThe other side let out an \u201cen\u201d before saying, \u201cAlright\u00a0ba, then if you\u2019re tired, sleep some more, and I\u2019ll call them first.\u201d\u201cOkay, then I\u2019m going to sleep.\u201dFinally having gotten away with it, Fang Juexia fell on the bed, his expression like that of a child who had stolen and eaten the forbidden fruit from his parents. \u201cFortunately\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong drew closer to kiss him. \u201cTeacher Fang, you have even learned to deceive people.\u201dAs soon as he heard this title, he blushed. \u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t deceived anyone?\u201d Pei Tingsong laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s true. I really don\u2019t like sports like climbing mountains, I like\u2026.wu\u2026.\u201dBefore he could say his flirty words, Fang Juexia had covered his mouth.\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep, stop talking. Shut up, shut up.\u201d Fang Juexia was short on breath and curled into the bed like a little loach fish, making it seem that he could be isolated from the world as long as he curled inside. But the more he was like this, the cuter Pei Tingsong thought he was. He got an urge to make some trouble with him, so he tickled and pulled at the quilt, just not letting him rest. He kicked up such a fuss in the bed with him that Fang Juexia started to laugh in a muffled fashion into the quilt.The two people, who were tossing around in bed, suddenly heard a knock on the door. In a flash, they turned into two little hamsters who had been shocked, synchronously stopping, frozen in place.Cheng Qiang\u2019s voice sounded out.\u201cJuexia? It\u2019s me. You haven\u2019t fallen asleep, have you? It\u2019s really such a coincidence, I received an endorsement contract just after I finished talking on the phone with you. The brand merchant is anxious for a reply, so I\u2019ll discuss it quickly with you and go back when we\u2019re done.\u201dSuch a coincidence, too much of a coincidence.Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia looked at each other, then frantically looked around the room.\u201cFuck.\u201dWhere could they hide a 1.9 meter tall boy?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

While his hands were trembling, he swore in his heart that he would never buy pajamas with buttons in the future.There was no big closet in this hotel suite, and the bed was also a solid bed, with no space under it. The sofa also didn\u2019t look like it could hide someone under it.The balcony\u2026.No, no, the balcony was windy, and it was too cold.Fang Juexia\u2019s thoughts went in circles, and he could only push Pei Tingsong to the bathroom.\u201cYou lock the door,\u201d whispered Fang Juexia, and then wanted to run, but Pei Tingsong grabbed him and said, \u201cHey, hey, my clothes.\u201d\u201cOh yes, wait a sec.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s pajamas were all over the place. Fang Juexia quickly picked them up, pulled open the bathroom door, and stuffed them into his hand. The knocking sound continued, and flustered Fang Juexia to the point that he could only exhort Pei Tingsong again, \u201cDon\u2019t make any noise\u00a0ah.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know whether he was too guilty or what, but he kept feeling like there were too many traces of last night\u2019s activities in the room, so he opened all the windows.Although the hotel room itself had its own air purification system, he was still not at ease. He took out a bottle of cologne from his suitcase, sprayed it around several times, then used his hands to wave it around.\u201cJuexia? Have you fallen asleep again?\u201dFang Juexia took a deep breath, put on his slippers, ran to the entrance way, worked hard to brew up a yawn, put on a sleepy look with his eyes half-closed, and only then did he open the door.\u201cMy little ancestor\u00a0oh, you finally opened the door. I thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to wake you up again.\u201d Cheng Qiang walked into the room with his laptop. \u201cHow are you? Do you still feel bad?\u201dFang Juexia shook his head and with a guilty heart, closed the door, after which he glanced at the closed bathroom door. \u201c\u2026.I feel much better.\u201d He walked two steps forward and led Cheng Qiang to the end of the sofa. \u201cGe, would you like to sit down and drink some water?\u201d\u201cNo, no, when I just got up, I downed a big cup of water,\u201d said Cheng Qiang as he put his laptop on the coffee table. He seemed to sense that something was wrong, so he stretched his neck out and frowned. \u201cHow is the smell in your room\u2026\u201dIt couldn\u2019t be that he had figured it out\u00a0ba? Fang Juexia gripped the leg of his pants nervously.\u201c\u2026\u2026so sweet\u00a0ah.\u201d After that, Cheng Qiang sneezed. \u201cDid you spray perfume all around?\u201dFang Juexia was relieved. \u201cAh\u2026. Yes, as soon as I came in yesterday, I felt that the room smelled a little strange. It smelt a bit like cigarettes, so I sprayed some cologne.\u201dCheng Qiang turned his head and looked around. \u201cI feel like you can also be too much; your windows are all open, and your balcony door is open. Weren\u2019t you cold when sleeping at night\u00a0ah?\u201d Saying that, he grew worried and got up to close the window in front of the sofa for him.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, it\u2019s not very cold.\u201d Saying that, Fang Juexia sat down next to him, wanting to quickly resolve the issue with the advertisement endorsement, so that he could get this great Buddha to go away as hastily as possible. \u201cQiang Ge, what endorsement were you talking about?\u201d\u201cOh, right, right, I almost forgot the most urgent business.\u201d Cheng Qiang pushed the laptop screen in front of him and explained, \u201cThis sports brand wants you and Xiao Pei to do an endorsement.\u201d As soon as he said that, he grew angry. \u201cDon\u2019t even know where that guy is, he just did a disappearing act on me so early in the morning. Really, no one can control him.\u201dFang Juexia cleared his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, let\u2019s discuss it first\u00a0ba.\u201dCheng Qiang sighed and continued, \u201cIn fact, this counts as an emergency. They had found a top-line actor first, but didn\u2019t seem to be able to reach an agreement in the end, and at the critical point of their new product\u2019s launch, their partnership collapsed. Now, they are anxious to confirm some spokespersons for their new product. You two have been popular recently, and have been blessed with appearances in several popular variety shows, so you guys are in hot demand. They contacted me early in the morning and sent me several e-mails. Even before I got to see them, they called me again.\u201dFang Juexia always trusted Cheng Qiang and had no habit of criticizing his work. \u201cGe, do you think it\u2019s okay after looking at it? If it\u2019s okay, then I have no objections. You go ahead and confirm with them.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty good. It\u2019s a top-line sports brand and their spokespersons have all grown popular, becoming new generation idols. Although the contract is only to become the spokespersons for one series, it\u2019s still pretty good. They have never found any members from boybands to be their products\u2019 spokespersons before. Moreover, the other side said that if it sells well, they\u2019ll consider letting the whole group be spokespersons for the next season\u2019s new products, which is a series aimed at young people.\u201dHearing about the entire group getting to do an endorsement, Fang Juexia was even more satisfied. \u201cAlright\u00a0ah, I\u2019m okay with it.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Cheng Qiang wanted to say something else, but the computer\u00a0dinged, and it was the sound of an email arriving. \u201cHey, they sent us the electronic version of the contract for us to confirm, let me have a look.\u201dFang Juexia let out an \u201cen\u201d, turned his head to glance at the bathroom, and then turned around again. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to ask Xiao Pei?\u201dCheng Qiang looked at the contract seriously. \u201cWhat do you want to ask him for?\u201d\u201cConfirm the working hours, endorsement fee, and so on.\u201d\u201cCome on, such a small endorsement fee is not enough for the little devil to even buy a good watch.\u201d Cheng Qiang raised his head and started acting out an impromptu imitation show, saying, \u201cXiao Pei, I have this so-and-so job, do you want to do it?\u201d After asking that, he turned to the other side and copied Pei Tingsong\u2019s hangdog expression as he said, \u201cNot going, don\u2019t want to do, don\u2019t care.\u201dThe cellphone in Fang Juexia\u2019s pocket vibrated twice. As soon as he took it out, he found that it was Pei Tingsong.[A Constant Truth: It\u2019s foul play to speak ill of people behind their backs!]Wasn\u2019t this the truth though?Just as he was about to reply, Cheng Qiang turned his head and looked at him. Fang Juexia quickly gripped his cellphone, fearing that the message had been seen, but fortunately, he hadn\u2019t seen anything. Cheng Qiang just shook his head. \u201cIf I ask, he\u2019ll say he doesn\u2019t want to do it, so I\u2019m too lazy to go ask him. I\u2019ll just go and sign the contract at that time, and it\u2019ll be fine. Which other time wasn\u2019t like that?\u201dFang Juexia could already almost imagine Pei Tingsong\u2019s expression of complete refusal, and the corners of his mouth couldn\u2019t help but quirk up.Cheng Qiang glimpsed it and was very proud of himself. \u201cOh, very good\u00a0ah, I can actually amuse you into smiling today.\u201dFang Juexia cleared his throat when he realized that his emotions were becoming more and more obvious. \u201cNo, I was just thinking that you work really hard, managing us.\u201d\u201cI make do\u00a0ba, I\u2019m just enjoying the feeling of being a father of infants ahead of time.\u201d After reading the contract, Cheng Qiang said, \u201cOkay, there\u2019s no problem. Wait to sign it\u00a0ba, I\u2019ll confirm some details later.\u201dFang Juexia nodded smartly. \u201cEn.\u201dThe endorsement had been confirmed, and the contract had been read, so his work should be done\u00a0ba.\u201cAre you still sleepy? If you\u2019re still tired, sleep some more. I also need to go back and catch up on some sleep too, these days have been so tiring, and then I have to go out later to talk with the TV station here.\u201d Cheng Qiang yawned. \u201cBy the way, Ling Yi and the rest went to climb mountains. They said that they may go for a stroll through the streets to eat some stuff tonight. After sleeping enough, if you want to go out, go talk to them; it\u2019ll be better if everyone is together.\u201dFang Juexia agreed and said, \u201cI\u2019ll rest some more, my head still feels a little dizzy.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Cheng Qiang picked up his laptop and stood up, ready to leave. Fang Juexia closely followed behind him, wanting to send him away as soon as possible. Although his visit hadn\u2019t started off well, being very threatening for them, it fortunately hadn\u2019t turned out dangerous.Just as he was about to approach the entranceway, Cheng Qiang stopped, turned around, looked at Fang Juexia, pointed to his mouth, and said, \u201cJuexia, has your body been a bit inflamed recently? Look, your mouth is red and a little swollen. What\u2019s the matter? Do you need some herbal tea to clear away the inflammation and swelling?\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s ears grew hot. He licked his lips and tried to explain awkwardly, \u201cMaybe that\u2019s the case\u00a0ba\u2026 Yes, yesterday\u2019s private cuisine was too spicy. I had a stomach ache after eating it and felt a bit inflamed. It\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll drink more water later. Once I drink some water, it\u2019ll be fine\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, drink more water.\u201d Cheng Qiang turned around, and was just a few steps away from the door when he suddenly turned back. \u201cHey, speaking of that, I drank a little too much water.\u201d He put the laptop in Fang Juexia\u2019s hands and said, \u201cLet me borrow your bathroom\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cHey, hey, Ge! Not possible.\u201d Fang Juexia ran to the bathroom door quickly to block the door, blinking continuously.Cheng Qiang wondered, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia swallowed. \u201c\u2026.It\u2019s broken. The toilet can\u2019t flush, it can\u2019t be used.\u201dHe felt that he was too resourceful, and was becoming increasingly more capable in making up lies.\u201cReally?\u201d Cheng Qiang stopped. \u201cAlright\u00a0ba, then I\u2019m going back\u00a0ba, fortunately, I can still hold it in.\u201d Saying that, he took the laptop from Fang Juexia\u2019s hands and said, \u201cYou remember to call the front desk for repairs\u00a0ah.\u201dAs he walked out, Cheng Qiang complained, \u201cIt\u2019s such an expensive hotel, but the facilities are actually so poor.\u201d\u201cBye bye, Qiang Ge.\u201d Fang Juexia poked his head out through the door frame, staying that way until Cheng Qiang had walked around the corner, and no one was there anymore. Only then was he completely relieved. He quickly closed the door, slipped down it to sit on the ground while still against it, and then took a long breath.He had followed the rules for so many years, but now he was doing all these exciting things with Pei Tingsong.After hearing nothing for a while, Pei Tingsong quietly cracked open the bathroom door a sliver, and glanced around before coming out. He saw Fang Juexia sitting on the floor. \u201cHe\u2019s gone?\u201d\u201cEn, finally he left.\u201d Saying that, Fang Juexia sighed again.Pei Tingsong squatted in front of him and rubbed Fang Juexia\u2019s head just like he was petting a cat, while praising him, \u201cHow can you be so smart? You even managed to deceive him about all this, so amazing.\u201dIt was clearly a compliment, but Fang Juexia felt that he was kind of making fun of him, so he slapped his hand away and went to the bathroom to clean up.He was really becoming more and more like a cat. Pei Tingsong followed right behind him, squeezing in front of him and brushing his teeth with him. Fang Juexia remained silent on the surface, brushing quietly, but his heart was fluttering away.Waking up in the same bed with the person you like and then washing up, shoulder to shoulder\u2014 this kind of scene was so warm that it almost seemed unreal, appearing to be things that only happen in romance movies.However, Pei Tingsong was much noisier than those leading characters in movies. One minute, he was arguing that since he has an injured hand, Fang Juexia should help him wash his face, and then the next minute, he wanted him to help him shave.This continued until Fang Juexia told him with a serious expression, \u201cYou are really childish.\u201d It was only then that Pei Tingsong stopped doing this, stopping fairly quickly, and washing and drying his face by himself obediently.Fang Juexia thought of a question he had seen on\u00a0Zhihu\u00a0\u2014 What was the experience of falling in love with a boy younger than yourself like?At that time, he had only glanced at it in a hurry, and he didn\u2019t know how the front page, which was full of mathematics related problems, could end up generating such a life-oriented problem, and he had slipped away directly.Now that he thought about it, he seemed to be able to reply to that question anonymously.Fang Juexia\u2019s face was pale and pure, and with some drops of water hanging there, he looked like a person made of glutinous rice. After brushing his teeth, his lips had turned redder, probably due to the stimulation brought by mint. Pei Tingsong stared at him for a while, recalled what he had just heard Cheng Qiang say while he was in the bathroom, that his lips were too red, so he couldn\u2019t help teasing him.\u201cYour lips are really red\u00a0ah.\u201dAs soon as he said that, Fang Juexia turned his head and glared at him. Although he didn\u2019t speak, his face was covered in the words \u2018it\u2019s all your fault\u2019. After glaring at him, he headed straight out of the bathroom.Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t hold down the corners of his mouth from curving up. He walked out to pull the curtains open, before throwing Fang Juexia onto the bed again. \u201cI feel like you didn\u2019t study mathematics, instead you studied how to suddenly turn hostile.\u201dFang Juexia took his hand and pushed him. \u201cWhat nonsense are you saying?\u201d\u201cYou were so obedient last night, going along with whatever I said, but as soon as you woke up today, you turned hostile and didn\u2019t recognize me. I really am too pitiful.\u201dCompletely shameless.\u00a0Fang Juexia\u2019s mind was filled with these two words, so he pushed Pei Tingsong even harder, but he still couldn\u2019t push him off. Instead, in fact, he was dragged into bed. As soon as the quilt was lifted up, it fell against their bodies like drifting clouds, covering their heads. The sunlight penetrated through the cloth and fiber, weaving a warm color filter.They were face to face with each other, forehead against forehead. Fang Juexia\u2019s heart was beating wildly. He thought Pei Tingsong was going to do something, and he had almost closed his eyes subconsciously, but then he suddenly heard Pei Tingsong whisper, \u201cI had a dream last night.\u201d\u201cA dream?\u201d Fang Juexia looked at him.Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes and eyebrows were relaxed. Plainly speaking, he had very aggressive features, but his eyes were very gentle. \u201cEn. I dreamt that I took you back home to meet my grandfather. He seemed to know you were coming, so he had even cooked for us himself.\u201d Pei Tingsong grimaced. \u201cHe\u2019s a terrible cook. You know, he\u2019s the kind of person who has never suffered, so his cooking is a disaster.\u201dFang Juexia wanted to laugh and say, \u2018aren\u2019t you the same\u2019, but he thought again, and realized that Pei Tingsong may really have suffered a lot. He was after all a young master who had leapt out of the window, ran away from home, and then was captured and pulled back.\u201cHe made a dish for you that looked very\u2026.messy, a quinoa and smoked salmon salad, and a Wellington steak, something that he has never made successfully, but you actually seemed to relish eating it!\u201dHe had a look of disbelief on his face, letting out a habitual \u2018unbelievable\u2019 from his mouth while frowning, then he laughed again, looking as if he were really describing something that had actually happened. Fang Juexia was so fascinated listening to all this that he drew closer to him, to the point that he was nearly sticking to the tip of his nose. \u201cAnd then?\u201d\u201cAnd then, he liked you very much, and he said over and over again,\u201d Pei Tingsong imitated his grandfather by putting on an old man\u2019s accent, \u201c\u2018You\u2019re so cute.\u2019 When you praised his dishes as tasty, he was so surprised and kept saying, \u2018Really?\u2019. We were laughing so hard, it was a really happy scene\u00a0ah, and he even let go of his cane.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgFang Juexia was engrossed and also started laughing, as if he had really gone to the place where Pei Tingsong had grown up and met the only relative who had once accompanied him, the old man who had taken him to see the world and had given him humanistic nourishment and spiritual support.He laughed and laughed, but his eyes started to sting. He had heard a long time ago that Pei Tingsong\u2019s grandfather had passed away, and that information came from other people.So, in fact, they were already people in two completely separate worlds. He couldn\u2019t see that old man, he couldn\u2019t see him hurrying around and being clumsy in the kitchen with Pei Tingsong, he wouldn\u2019t be able to see his eager-for-praise expression.Only in a dream could they realize this incomplete dream.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Pei Tingsong stared at Fang Juexia\u2019s pupils and asked, \u201cAre you going to cry?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes widened, and his eyes were covered in a layer of liquid, looking as beautiful as glass beads, but he tried to hold them back and not let them fall as he refused, \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201dPei Tingsong laughed. It was really strange, this person was clearly so strong, sometimes even to the point of being hard-hearted, but he would actually be flooded with emotion simply because of a dream.He had once really thought that Fang Juexia was cold and hard, without emotions or expressions, indifferent to everything, which included even his own matters, completely cold and stubborn, and totally unlike a living person. But he was so wrong.Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t ice. He was naive, intelligent, and had the most gentle and romantic soul in the world. It was in order to maintain and preserve such a soft self that he had created such a hard icy outer layer.Pei Tingsong raised his chin and kissed Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes. \u201cHe also told you a story, a story that he had told me before.\u201d\u201cWhat story?\u201d Fang Juexia was curious.\u201cHe showed you a collection of poems he had shown me before. He said that he had written them for a girl who he had secretly been in love with when he was young. He said that he really regretted that he didn\u2019t really pursue her, but just secretly wrote poems. Poems can\u2019t grow feet and run over by themselves to recite themselves to their object, so did he just write them for God to see? So his first love just died in its sleep like that.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s focus was a little strange. \u201cThat poetry collection, can I see it later?\u201dPei Tingsong laughed. \u201cThat is not the main point\u00a0ba, child Fang Juexia.\u201dFang Juexia frowned again when he heard the word \u2018child\u2019, but he thought that he had gotten the point wrong or it might be because of a difference in their thought process, so he sincerely asked, \u201cThen what\u2019s the main point?\u201d\u201cWhen he told me this story before, it was to tell me that we must be brave. Only brave people can get the most precious reward.\u201dSaying that, he kissed Fang Juexia\u2019s birthmark. \u201cThe little old man was right. You are my reward.\u201dFang Juexia just smiled, not saying anything more. At this time, he seemed to have lost his ability to express anything using words, only being able to respond with actions. So he hugged Pei Tingsong and pressed his body against his within the stuffy quilt.\u201cNow I\u2019m a little worried.\u201d Pei Tingsong held him and sighed.\u201cWhat are you worried about?\u201d Fang Juexia was puzzled by the sudden change in his words.\u201cMy grandfather in heaven is expressing that he is very satisfied with the reward I got, and even gave me a dream about it.\u201d After that, he was not sure whether the word he used was right or not. \u201cA dream where a ghost comes to make a request.\u201dFang Juexia nodded, \u201cEn.\u201d No, why did he nod?Without waiting for him to figure it out, Pei Tingsong continued, \u201cBut your grandfather, one look and you can tell he\u2019s not a person easy to deal with. What to do, will he point a gun at me?\u201dFang Juexia let out a long hum then said, \u201cThe possibility is very low. After all, he doesn\u2019t have a gun.\u201d\u201cThat was an exaggeration!\u201d Pei Tingsong sighed again before saying, \u201cHe must think that this reward is very inferior, no, he may think that I am God\u2019s punishment for you.\u201dFang Juexia suddenly laughed and felt it was very appropriate. So he put his arms around Pei Tingsong\u2019s neck and said, \u201cIf it\u2019s a punishment, it\u2019s a punishment\u00a0ba. I like punishment.\u201dPei Tingsong quickly grasped this sentence, being a master of words as he was. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who just said that. So it turns out, you like punishment play, very powerful.\u201d\u201cWhat\u00a0ah\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already seen the moon, but can I also see the sun, Gege?\u201d\u201cShut up, don\u2019t talk anymore, shut up.\u201dThe two people fussed around in bed for a few hours, like any other ordinary lovers in this world, exchanging intimate physical closeness for inner peace, and even this lazily lingering in bed seemed very interesting. When they were hungry, they got the hotel food delivered to their room, and watched Pei Tingsong\u2019s favorite Nordic literary art films while eating.Fang Juexia clearly wasn\u2019t a person who liked to kill time. For his 20 and more years of life up until now, he had been racing against the clock, and every single minute of it had been very tense. But right now, he felt relaxed, and had fallen in love with this feeling of wasting time. As long as Pei Tingsong was by his side, even if he was narrating the stories of various philosophers and their romantic histories, he found it all interesting.When Pei Tingsong was talking about the love and hatred that existed between Schopenhauer and his\u00a0mother, Fang Juexia\u2019s cellphone started vibrating non-stop. Ling Yi was calling, they had come down from the mountain and were getting ready to go strolling around the city to eat local snacks, and he wanted Fang Juexia to come with.\u201cGoing?\u201dPei Tingsong stretched and ate the last cracker. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u00a0ba.\u201dHowever, Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t dare to go back to his own room. He rifled through Fang Juexia\u2019s suitcase and found a loose milk-coffee colored long sleeve shirt and loose black sports pants to put on. \u201cIt actually looks pretty good.\u201dFang Juexia, who had just changed his clothes and was now wearing a black hoodie, turned around to praise him seriously, \u201cLooks good.\u201d\u201cWhat about shoes?\u201d Pei Tingsong stretched out his feet and said, \u201cMy feet are bigger than yours.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s eyes brightened as he clenched his left hand and knocked it against the palm of his right. \u201cI brought a pair of sneakers that are a little big this time. I have started to like to wear big shoes recently.\u201d\u201cYou did it on purpose\u00a0ba, just wanting me to wear your clothes? Schemer.\u201dFang Juexia put on his socks with a completely unfeeling expression. \u201cYou can also go out in hotel slippers.\u201dThey both then put on hats. Fang Juexia was wearing a baseball cap, with the hood of his hoodie covering it, and then put on a mask, so his face was almost entirely covered. As soon as they exited the hotel, they hailed a taxi, got in, and went to the place that Ling Yi had arranged. The roads twisted and turned, and it was a very hard place to find, so it had turned dark by the time they got there.It was a street that was neither too long nor too wide. Both sides were filled with stalls and facades, the people passing by were all talking in the local dialect, the food was steaming hot, and the warm lights made everything look delicious.Meeting up with their bandmates was like meeting up with triad members. Each one was more tightly bundled up than the next one, and they were also flashing each other strange and weird signals.Lu Yuan had his back turned to He Ziyan and said, \u201cNo. 2, No. 2, is No. 2 still there?\u201dHe Ziyan pulled at his own collar. \u201cReporting in, we have found Kaleidoscope No. 4 and Kaleidoscope No. 6,\u00a0over.\u201dPei Tingsong slapped his paw on He Ziyan\u2019s face. \u201cWhat silly scene are you guys making?\u201dLu Yuan immediately showed a frightened expression. \u201cThere\u2019s a mole, terminating the transaction.\u201d\u201cHahahahahaha!\u201dLing Yi, who was a foodie, had utilised an online strategy to find the most authentic food here. Although most of it Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t eat, the milk tea was very good. He tried a little bit from everyone\u2019s order, and all the dishes were actually very good.They wanted to happily snack the entire way, but they hadn\u2019t expected to be recognized by the fans they ran into. After all, it was already rare to see a handsome guy out on the street, let alone six of them; they were just too eye-catching. The fans didn\u2019t dare to disturb them casually, and only after repeated confirmation became sure it was Kaleido.They didn\u2019t dare to go up to ask for autographs, so they only took pictures secretly. At first, they were taking pictures secretly, but then Pei Tingsong just had to crouch on the street at that time as he sucked at the last pearls stuck in his milk tea like a complete youth. Fang Juexia was standing beside him, wearing headphones while eating a slice of watermelon to relieve the spiciness from the previous dishes, and had twisted his head to chat with Ling Yi, who was eating\u00a0roast beef tallow.The fans were standing across the street, across a pedestrian walkway, and some were even hiding behind an electrical pole. Unexpectedly, Pei Tingsong, their target, actually discovered them. He raised his eyes, which were filled with a fiendish spirit, then pointed at them. Just as the fans\u2019 hearts had reached their throats, Pei Tingsong made a cutting motion across his throat with his hand.\u201cGege, we\u2019re wrong!\u201d The fans begged for mercy.Pei Tingsong naturally leaned against Fang Juexia\u2019s leg. \u201c100,000\u00a0per picture, time to collect.\u201dWho knew another fan would say, \u201cGod, you\u2019re so cheap.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Do they look nice?\u201d\u201cVery nice!\u201dSo the six big boys went to the riverside to see the fireworks, but found more people there than they had thought there would be. They were within a shoulder-rubbing distance from everyone else, and wherever they stood, they would find themselves soon besieged by another group of people.\u201cIf we stay here any longer, it\u2019s not going to be us watching fireworks.\u201d Lu Yuan held a lollipop in his mouth. \u201cIt may become everyone watching us.\u201d\u201cIs there no a place with a little less people?\u201d He Ziyan turned his head to search for such a spot.Jiang Miao opened up both hands. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bit risky. We\u2019d better withdraw as soon as possible, since it won\u2019t be good if we attract fans over here, gathering a crowd around us later.\u201dLing Yi was holding onto the captain\u2019s arm and groaning. Pei Tingsong looked at the river in the distance, knocked his shoulder against Fang Juexia\u2019s, and asked in a low voice, \u201cDo you want to see the fireworks?\u201dThe tightly wrapped-up Fang Juexia raised his head, only showing a pair of beautiful eyes. Pei Tingsong immediately understood his intention after just two blinks of his eyes.\u201cOkay.\u201d Pei Tingsong gripped his shoulder and then released it. \u201cWait for me here.\u201dThe others were still wondering what was going on, but unexpectedly, Pei Tingsong returned after not too long.\u201cLet\u2019s go and see the fireworks.\u201d He pulled on the sleeve of Fang Juexia\u2019s sweater.Ling Yi was doubtful. \u201cWhere are we going\u00a0ah?\u201dFinally, they were brought in front of a big ocean liner.Lu Yuan whistled and walked in. He asked casually, \u201cHow many people are in here?\u201d\u201cNo one. I booked the whole thing.\u201d Pei Tingsong pulled on Fang Juexia\u2019s sleeve. \u201cDidn\u2019t you guys want to see the fireworks?\u201dHe Ziyan put his hands behind his back, looking like an old cadre member, and repeatedly shook his head. \u201cLook at this extravagance.\u201dLing Yi asked, \u201cDid you use that 100,000 from just now to book it?\u201d\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dNighttime by the river was very beautiful, but for Fang Juexia, everything in his vision was still very hazy. Pei Tingsong quietly led him forward, step-by-step up the stairs, being both careful and considerate. They boarded the deck of the cruise ship with less than three minutes to go before the fireworks would bloom. The six people leaned shoulder to shoulder on the railing and looked up.\u201cIs it about to start?\u201d\u201cYes\u00a0ba, we\u2019re so close at this angle\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cRight\u00a0ah, we should be right below it when it explodes.\u201dPei Tingsong leaned against Fang Juexia. The backs of their hands rubbed against each other, their skin pressing together before separating again. Secretively, in the dark and right by their bandmates\u2019 side, they were hiding their hearts, which were about to stick close together.They heard the countdown from another boat full of tourists not far away.Fang Juexia subconsciously accompanied them in counting down\u2014 three, two, one.The night sky was originally silent and dark, until a flame shot up into the sky. With a bang, fireworks suddenly appeared and covered all of the originally dim sky; they were a cold white color, short and gorgeous, just like meteors gathered together. Fang Juexia suddenly discovered that when seen from a distance or across a screen, fireworks lost some of their vitality. Only when you were really immersed in the scene and watching it personally could you feel the brilliance that was emitted when the fireworks blossomed.Each piece of scattered shining white flowing fire hung in the air as it drifted down, seeming as if it would flow down into the midst of the audience, and ignite them all in a blaze in this carnival; but it didn\u2019t, and these sparks simply disappeared mid-journey.The fireworks in the air were engulfed by the night, and the fireworks reflected on the river were engulfed by the ripples.The new ones replaced the old ones before they disappeared. The echo of the bursting fireworks\u00a0 penetrated one\u2019s body, and the vibrating sound wave overlapped with one\u2019s heartbeat and pounded against the chest.That was the last sound the fireworks made before their lives ended.\u201cWow! So pretty!\u201d Ling Yi pointed to the sky. \u201cLook at that one, doesn\u2019t it look like the shape of an ear of wheat?\u201cNo, I need to make a wish, make a wish quickly.\u201d\u201cAre you a little girl? You\u2019re even going to make a wish.\u201dLing Yi didn\u2019t care. \u201cI just need to. Bless my parents with good health, and let me never get fat no matter how much I eat.\u201dJiang Miao also said with a smile, \u201cThen bless our Kaleido so things go more smoothly in the future.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Ling Yi said again, \u201cBless us, bless us to make a lot of money to go to the Maldives for a holiday this year!\u201dHis words left Pei Tingsong speechless. \u201cYou are so persistent. How\u2019s this\u00a0ba? This young master will take you there.\u201dHe Ziyan and Lu Yuan began to coax Ling Yi, but he really showed his backbone on this issue. \u201cNo way, I just want the company to pay me to go!\u201d\u201cWhatever you want.\u201dLing Yi showed an appreciative expression again as he suggested, \u201cAlthough, you can take me to Dubai.\u201d\u201cTch, dream on.\u201d\u201cJuexia,\u201d Ling Yi called out his name over the sound of the fireworks, and asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to make a wish?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Fang Jue had been engrossed in watching the show, but after being asked this by Ling Yi, he hesitated.A wish\u2026.When he thought of this word, the first name that appeared in his mind was actually Pei Tingsong.It was too incredible, the fact that he would actually want to make a wish related to him.Fang Juexia said with a smile, \u201cI wish that everyone\u2019s wishes will all come true.\u201d\u201cLook, what kind of human angel is this?\u201dHis bandmates joked around, but Fang Juexia\u2019s hand stretched out from his long sleeve, groped along the length of the railing, and finally found Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand.While everyone was fascinated by the bright fireworks, he quietly grasped Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand.Pei Tingsong, who was still bickering with Ling Yi, was suddenly stunned. He then turned his head to see Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes, which were filled with fireworks as his head was still turned towards the sky.He also gripped Fang Juexia\u2019s hand in return, holding on tightly.Apart from the fireworks, no one else witnessed this secret tryst.More and more fireworks shot into the sky and lit up the whole night. Fang Juexia, who kept looking up the whole while, felt like a child, both excited and thrilled. Maybe it was because he had never seen fireworks this close up before.Or perhaps he had never seen such a resplendent darkness.A fireworks display was composed of innumerable fleeting objects superimposed on top of each other, but even if it was superimposed again and again, the whole thing was short-lived. The night grew calm once again, making it seem as if those magnificent blooms had never happened.Even after it was over, everyone was still a little lost in reverie, and no one wanted to leave, so they just remained on the cruise ship as it sailed along, chatting and watching the night scene together.It had been a long time since they had had such an opportunity. They were all tossed into different activities every day, and they ended their days with all their energy exhausted. When they woke up the next day, they repeated this routine again, so it was very difficult for them to gather together for a chat like this.Jiang Miao told them the plot of the script he had been recently reading over, and Lu Yuan talked about the gossip in the hip-hop dance show he was taking part in. Fang Juexia listened silently, occasionally inserting a word or two in.The river had grown calm again, and it gave him an inexplicable sense of familiarity. When he lived in Guangzhou, he had been on cruise ships several times. He lay on the railing, closed his eyes, and felt the moist wind, and it was as if he had returned to his hometown.\u201cSleepy?\u201dUpon suddenly hearing Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice, Fang Juexia opened his eyes and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2026. a little homesick.\u201dThis was the first time Pei Tingsong had heard Fang Juexia say that he was homesick. He put his hands on the railing and asked, \u201cBecause of the boat?\u201dFang Juexia nodded. \u201cThere are night markets, roadside stalls, and all kinds of snacks here. It\u2019s strange that when I was in Beijing, I wasn\u2019t homesick, but now, when I come to another such lively city, I start missing home.\u201d He turned around and leaned back against the railing as he continued, \u201cThe food in Guangzhou is very delicious. Whenever I was hungry after school, I would go to the roadside stall to buy fried rice noodles and winter-melon tea. It was a very old shop, and the proprietress would pack it all into plastic bags and stick a straw in the tea to drink with.\u201dHe gestured as he talked, looking at Pei Tingsong from time to time. He seemed afraid that Pei Tingsong wouldn\u2019t believe it and stressed again, \u201cThat drink was really good.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Pei Tingsong put on a show of working hard to imagine it as he said to him, \u201cBut I can\u2019t imagine what it tastes like.\u201dFang Juexia was a little discouraged; he felt that his ability to express things wasn\u2019t good enough.Unexpectedly, Pei Tingsong then said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to take me there to drink it in person, seems that it\u2019s only then that I will know how good it is.\u201d He then began to count with his fingers, listing, \u201cAnd there\u2019s also your school, the food stalls you like to eat at, the paths you often walked, I want to go see all of them.\u201dFang Juexia glanced at Ling Yi, who was not far away, and was looking up at the sky, before saying to him, \u201cI didn\u2019t say I would take you back.\u201d\u201cYou will.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s tone was firm, as if it would definitely happen.Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help laughing as he said, \u201cYou speak with such confidence every time, as if you think your judgment will never be wrong.\u201d\u201cNo\u00a0ah, I was born confident, but I\u2019m also clear that my judgment is often wrong.\u201d Then Pei Tingsong explained, \u201cFor example, with you, I have made mistakes again and again.\u201dFang Juexia took off his mask and said, \u201cSuch as with the hidden rules situation?\u201dPei Tingsong openly laughed. \u201cIn fact, since a long time ago, I was skeptical towards that rumor, and to tell you the truth, I didn\u2019t care that much about it.\u201d\u201cBut you still targeted me so much at that time,\u201d Fang Juexia leaned closer to him, his posture declaring that he was bringing him to account, and he continued, \u201cAnd you always held the hidden rules situation against me.\u201dPei Tingsong raised his hands in surrender. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to defend myself.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou may not believe it when I say it, but I was a little angry that you wouldn\u2019t fight back at first. A rumor like that floating around the company, sometimes even getting gossiped about right in front of you, so why didn\u2019t you ever bother to explain? It was like you were cut off from the world and indifferent to everything.\u201dFang Juexia suddenly understood.Sure enough, what Pei Tingsong really cared about weren\u2019t the rumors themselves, but his attitude towards them. This was very in-line with Pei Tingsong\u2019s personality, because he was a person born to rebel. If there was any injustice or anything that did not conform with his point of view, he would overthrow it without any scruple. A hot-blooded person naturally couldn\u2019t stand a cold-blooded and indifferent person.\u201cBut later, after I got to know you more, and then once I learned the truth from Liang Ruo, it was only then I realized that your attitude was because you wanted to help him hide this matter.\u201dPei Tingsong shook his head and sighed. \u201cYou treat outsiders more gently than you treat yourself. Clearly you almost lost your bright future because of him, and yet you still wanted to protect his reputation.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgFang Juexia instead replied, \u201cI wasn\u2019t protecting him, I was protecting myself.\u201dThis statement made Pei Tingsong uncertain. \u201cProtecting yourself?\u201dFang Juexia bowed his head and said with a smile, \u201cThis circle is too complicated. Ever since my trainee days, I knew that talent, on its own, rarely determined anything. I\u2019ve seen all kinds of ways people have gotten to the top, all kinds of deals being made. Many people who weren\u2019t good enough to be singing and dancing artists could still make their debut as long as they were willing to change and exchange part of themselves. In that chaotic environment, the most difficult thing was not how to fight for a good future, nor was it not how to become an artist, but rather, how not to be affected by all this.\u201cI couldn\u2019t for the sake of my own future bring to light and fight about Liang Ruo\u2019s matter, get involved, or clarify my situation, because I knew he was also a victim in this. I couldn\u2019t do such things. So the only thing I could explain was that I didn\u2019t do any of that.\u201dPei Tingsong suddenly felt that he had gone back in time, to when he had first seen Fang Juexia. He was just like a straight, withered branch, stubborn and tough, and would rather break cleanly than be changed.Maybe it was because he had seen his father\u2019s good appearance when he was a child, a dancer who had been prosperous and growing steadily in his career and who had loved his wife and his life. Yet, he had also witnessed him go crazy because of his failure, then become another person, losing his original self entirely. That was why Fang Juexia had formed such laws of life.\u201cFrom childhood to adulthood, we receive all kinds of education. Many people teach us what we should strive for, what we should achieve, and what we should work hard for. However, few will tell us what you should preserve. But what I want to do is to just preserve my own nature, nothing else.\u201dFang Juexia looked at him. \u201cI used to think it was easy, but as I grew up, I found it to be more complicated and difficult than I had thought. Human beings are such a complex polyhedron, and every face or even point are seemingly able to be brought out and represent a person. This is an external evaluation, one-sided and one-dimensional.\u201d Fang Juexia shook his head slightly, refuting this practice. \u201cBut I know that the part of self that I want to preserve is the only thing that can truly represent me.\u201dHe knew that he had said a lot of things that may seem strange in other people\u2019s eyes. All this had been deeply buried in his heart, and he had never said it to anyone before. Seeing Pei Tingsong look at him with a kind of complicated gaze, Fang Juexia frowned, and felt a little strange. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that? Did I say something wrong?\u201dPei Tingsong chuckled and prefaced with, \u201cI know that everyone\u2019s knowledge bank is different, so the person I\u2019m going to talk about next is someone you probably don\u2019t know. He was a philosopher who lived in the 16th century. His name was Spinoza.\u201d\u201cSpinoza\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia said the name again, before expressing that he wasn\u2019t familiar with him.\u201cHis greatest achievement was to reconcile and unify the three categories of opposing ethics.\u201d At this point, Pei Tingsong saw Fang Juexia\u2019s puzzled expression. \u201cGot off topic. To put it simply, he once wrote such a sentence in his book\u00a0Ethics: \u2018Everything, in so far as it is in itself, endeavours to persist in its own being, and the\u00a0self\u00a0that things strive to preserve is exactly the true essence of that thing.\u201dHearing these words in the black of the night left Fang Juexia slightly stunned.\u201cIsn\u2019t it wonderful?\u201d Pei Tingsong looked at him and slightly raised his eyebrows. \u201cSo, when I heard you say what you did just now, suddenly there was a kind of\u2026. Across time and space, it\u2019s very mysterious to see Spinoza\u2019s philosophical pursuit reappear in you, but that really is the case.\u201dThis was one of his favorite philosophers. He had calmly and self sustainably confronted the\u00a0tragic fate\u00a0of his life and never admitted defeat.\u201cJust now, I was very touched. You have never read his books or studied his theoretical systems, but you have naturally lived like this. At that moment, I was thinking that thoughts really can just exist in a kind of mysterious void-like space, ridding themselves of both body and time to achieve some kind of collision and resonance.\u201dFang Juexia was actually also a rebel. Unlike Pei Tingsong, he revolted subconsciously, just to protect himself.After listening to Pei Tingsong\u2019s words, Fang Juexia had an indescribable feeling. On the one hand, he thought that it was intriguing, but on the other hand, he thought that Pei Tingsong was perhaps just being partial to him, and would only say this because of that. He was an ordinary person who wasn\u2019t proficient in philosophy at all, but Pei Tingsong\u2019s description had also made him curious. \u201cThen\u2026 What kind of person was Spinoza?\u201d\u201cHow to describe him?\u201d Pei Tingsong thought seriously before answering, \u201cHe was a man who was proficient in mathematics, so he pretty much used mathematical techniques to study philosophy. He was extremely restrained and advocated rationality. You don\u2019t even know how he lived. He spent most of his time in his room doing research and didn\u2019t see anyone for days.\u201dFang Juexia asked again, \u201cThen did he have any income?\u201d\u201cSpeaking of this, it was even more amazing,\u201d Pei Tingsong said as he grabbed his hand and played with it. \u201cHe was originally a teacher, but later he changed to grinding lenses for work. He was skilled at it, but he didn\u2019t really try to sell them. Every year, he would accurately calculate how many lenses he needed to grind just to meet his basic living and research costs, and he would recalculate it again every quarter, and he lived extremely\u00a0accurately.\u201dSaying that, Pei Tingsong laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re really like him.\u201dFang Juexia thought about it and found it very interesting. Although Pei Tingsong was teasing him, he was still teasing him using a great philosopher, so he was in fact totally exalting Fang Juexia. \u201cYou shut up, I can\u2019t be that.\u201dPei Tingsong spoke from the bottom of his heart, \u201cYou can be anything.\u201d He was very happy, because he had come to understand Fang Juexia a little more, as if he was now a little closer to his soul. Facing such a small, closed off ice-cube, this was a great leap indeed.Ling Yi ran back to show off the dialect he had just learned. \u201cDoes it sound like them, Juexia? Did I learn it right?\u201dFang Juexia was about to nod when Pei Tingsong took the lead and snarked, \u201cHow does it sound like them? Everything you learn sounds like the Chengdu dialect.\u201d\u201cYou! I just speak the Chengdu dialect, so what\u2019s the matter? A\u00a0melon-like\u00a0you can\u2019t even learn it, tch.\u201dWith that, Ling Yi ran away. Pei Tingsong looked at Fang Juexia with a confused expression and said, \u201cHe just cursed me out\u00a0ba? He cursed me, right?\u201dFang Juexia played dumb. \u201cReally? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cIt must be. That little whelp.\u201d Pei Tingsong rolled up his sleeves and was about to chase Ling Yi, but he was stopped by Fang Juexia. \u201cWho told you to tell him that the dialect he learned doesn\u2019t sound right?\u201d\u201cBut it was that way.\u201d The irritable little overlord let out a long sigh. \u201cAlright, I won\u2019t lower myself to the same level as this single loveless dog.\u201dHearing his words, Fang Juexia immediately kicked him. \u201cShh.\u201dPei Tingsong chuckled and acted as if he was begging for mercy, and then soon remembered something. \u201cBy the way, you haven\u2019t talked to me in your dialect. I want to hear you speak in Cantonese.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I sing in it last time?\u201d Fang Juexia pulled at his own hood twice.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t count. Can\u2019t you say a sentence to me?\u201dFang Juexia excused himself, saying that he didn\u2019t know what to say, and he was adamant on not saying anything. Pei Tingsong kept fussing at him, and also playfully threatened him, pretending that he would jump off the rail.\u201cJump then. I can\u2019t see anything, but I\u2019ll at least hear the sound of you falling into the water.\u201d Fang Juexia smiled at him.\u201cToo cruel.\u201dBy the time they had played around enough, the cruise ship had also pulled into the harbor. They disembarked one by one, stepping on the ground, away from the river.Pei Tingsong, like a big boss, pulled everyone in from left to right in a hug. \u201cHad a good time, Geges?\u201d\u201cGreat time, thank you, group bully!\u201d\u201cThen when you guys go back, take turns washing my clothes for me!\u201d\u201cWhat did you say? The wind is too strong, can\u2019t hear a thing.\u201dFang Juexia, who was walking behind everyone, laughed as he stepped into their shadows. It was only when they scattered after the joke that he came up to Pei Tingsong, who was about to catch up with him. \u201cWait.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Pei Tingsong obeyed him and stopped.Fang Juexia put his hands in his pockets and drew close to his ear. An unfamiliar language, in a voice softer than the dim light of the night, sounded\u2014\u201cbb, I fancy you\u00a0as all get out.\u201d\u2014The author has something to say :Translation: \u201cBaby, I like you so much\u00a0ah.\u201dbb has that kind of feeling, of coaxing children and coaxing one\u2019s love object, and it\u2019s a very intimate kind of address. You can search Guangdong boys saying it, and it\u2019s very\u00a0Sue-ish.Talking a bit more about Spinoza. If you are interested, you can listen to it as a story. Why does Pei Tingsong say that he revolted against his miserable life? Because Spinoza was a Jew, and he came from a merchant family, he was a child of a wealthy family. He studied religion and history with great talent and gradually headed down the road of philosophical studies. Because of his religious background, he considered many issues related to religion and philosophy, and also questioned some religious teachings at that time.When he was 23 years old, he was arraigned by the Jewish church. It was said that he spread heresy. He was not willing to pretend to\u00a0cater\u00a0to them, so he was excommunicated and accepted expulsion. His father\u00a0drove him away, and his older sister tried to cheat him out of his inheritance. He was almost assassinated with a dagger by a devout theological student when he was walking on the road, because he had violated their religious doctrine. Later, he rented an attic outside Amsterdam, going from his original comfortable existence to becoming fatigued and isolated.However, many people admired him, and some even wanted to give him all their inheritance, which Spinoza refused.At that time, Spinoza\u2019s research was very dangerous. How dangerous was it? He had to finish his writing quietly and not publish it, otherwise his life would be in danger. He gave the landlord a key and asked them to help publish his\u00a0 books after he died.His life is also very legendary.

By the time he returned to his senses, Fang Juexia had already rejoined everyone else, leaving him behind.What did that sentence mean?He felt as if he had been hit dizzy by a piece of candy, but before he could even peel it open and taste it carefully, the candy disappeared.He hurried to catch up, and the entire way back to the hotel, Pei Tingsong kept asking Fang Juexia about that sentence\u2019s meaning. However, Fang Juexia was being purposefully mysterious, for he just kept smiling without talking.Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t give up the entire way back to the hotel. He sent out one WeChat message after another, and Fang Juexia\u2019s cellphone sounded like a broken alarm clock, ringing nonstop.Under this repeated bombardment, Fang Juexia surrendered and sent him a message.[Moonlight: It just means \u2018I like you.\u2019]He said it again.Pretty much only a second passed before the other side replied.[A Constant Truth: Really?! [CoveringMyChest.JPG]][A Constant Truth: [LaunchingHearts.JPG]\u00a0 [LaunchingHearts.JPG] [LaunchingHearts.JPG]][A Constant Truth: Then what did the thing at the start, that sounded like \u2018b\u2019 mean?][A Constant Truth: Begging you Ge, tell me quickly\u00a0ba]Seeing this, Fang Juexia wanted to laugh. In Cantonese context, the word \u2018bb\u2019 was too intimate. He didn\u2019t want to just touch on it lightly when explaining it to him, so he found a popular video of a Guangdong girl coaxing her two-year-old little brother online and forwarded it to Pei Tingsong.After sending the video, Fang Juexia fell on the bed, his head suddenly filled with thoughts of that famous poet Pei Tingsong had talked about before, who had said that\u2014\u2019love and happiness make me lose my mind and focus.\u2019 He felt that he deeply felt the true meaning of this sentence; love had not only sapped his focus, but had also pretty much changed his person.In the past, he had been so emotionally withered that he was like a dehydrated vegetable. Even if he was immersed in an environment full of friendship and love, he couldn\u2019t be filled with a fresh and lively appearance. He was just a damp, swollen but lifeless, instant vegetable.But Pei Tingsong had completely brought him back to life, and had made him willing to express himself, express his love for another person.So it turned out that in love, there were no matters that were hard to speak of.His cellphone vibrated again.[A Constant Truth: bb means little baby?!][A Constant Truth:\u00a0Baby? babe\uff1f\uff1f]Seeing his question marks, Fang Juexia could almost imagine Pei Tingsong\u2019s current expression. He added fuel to the fire and replied with\u2014[Moonlight: It could be understood that way.]There was no reply from the other party after that. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t think much about it at the beginning. During his bath though, he suddenly wondered whether a boy would feel frustrated at being called bb, and whether that made it seem like he was treating him too much like a child.His cellphone vibrated again just as he stepped out of the bathroom.[A Constant Truth: Since you called me bb, then Gege should care more deeply for me in the future.]\u201cReally shameless,\u201d Fang Juexia whispered to himself as he faced the screen.He had taken advantage this one time, and Pei Tingsong actually just wrestled that advantage back.Staring at this line of words, and especially at the second half of the sentence, Fang Juexia\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but beat faster. He just couldn\u2019t think too deeply into Pei Tingsong\u2019s words, they were just so thinly veiled that they weren\u2019t even really thinly veiled implications anymore.His heart felt itchy, and it was as if a bud was breaking through the ground.Spring made people restless.It was raining when they flew back to Beijing. A damp Beijing was very rare, and since spring was almost over, it had finally rained. Driving back to the Third Ring Road from the airport, they were again chased by stalker fans. There were many cars on the road, it was raining, and the big van was ferrying eight people, which was very dangerous in itself. The stalker fans had also bribed the taxi-driver to drive right behind their van, which resulted in them nearly running into them several times.In the end, Cheng Qiang couldn\u2019t bear it anymore. After entering the city, he found a suitable spot on the side of the road and got the driver to park the car, and the stalker fans chasing after them also stopped the car behind theirs.He knew that stalker fans weren\u2019t easy to provoke, and there was no lack of people inflamed with passion among them. If he was careless, this incident could even be published with a false account of the true facts, so he just stood on the side of the road and gave them good advice.\u201cYou guys are all very young, and you\u2019re also young girls, so don\u2019t do such dangerous things. You even dare to follow the van on the airport expressway, aren\u2019t you afraid of causing an accident?\u201dHowever, the stalker fans inside the taxi completely ignored his words. \u201cWe just want to see them!\u201d\u201cYou already saw them\u00a0ah, they didn\u2019t take the VIP route. Didn\u2019t you already see them at the airport meetup? Let\u2019s not talk about anything else, but it\u2019s really dangerous to chase a car. We have a car full of people, and so do you guys, and it\u2019s raining. Do you really want to have a traffic accident?\u201dThen Cheng Qiang patted on the driver\u2019s window as he requested, \u201cPlease roll down the window.\u201dThe driver didn\u2019t move at all.Cheng Qiang lowered his head and used his cellphone to record the taxi\u2019s information. \u201cI\u2019ve already noted down your license plate number. If you continue to chase this car, we can only call the police.\u201dEven after saying all that, as soon as Cheng Qiang turned his head, he heard the several girls in the car curse behind him, which was quite ugly. He didn\u2019t care about it and simply went back to the passenger seat, telling the driver to drive.Being popular was troublesome, all sorts of evil spirits would appear.Ling Yi looked in the rearview mirror, and saw that that car was still in the same place. As they pulled farther and farther away, he felt a little relieved, and then he thought of something else and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cDid you guys know? Recently, Seven Luminaries\u2019 third oldest member found that he had a tracker installed on him.\u201d\u201cHoly crap, really?\u201d Lu Yuan heard it, and his hair stood on end.Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhere did they hide it?\u201d He thought about the things that people can carry. The cellphone wasn\u2019t likely, so it had to be\u2026 \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be his watch?\u201d\u201cYou really guessed it.\u201d Ling Yi sighed. \u201cHe received gifts from fans for his birthday before, and there was a watch in them, and it had actually been modified.\u201dCheng Qiang shook his head. \u201cWe can\u2019t accept any more presents; we won\u2019t accept any more presents from the fan stations anymore. The company has discussed this matter several times in the past two days, and more and more people are also waiting to chase after your car, so if it keeps going on like this, we won\u2019t be able to manage it anymore.\u201d\u201cUgh, what is all this\u00a0ah?\u201d\u201cWhen you get popular, it\u2019s just like this, nothing we can do.\u201dAs soon as they got back, the members started their own work. Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong signed a brand contract, agreed on a time to shoot the advertisement, and then went to record \u201cEscape For Your Life\u201d.Apart from their staggered-out events, Kaleido\u2019s promotional singing performances lasted only two weeks. Singing shows could certainly make songs more popular, but they really consumed too much of the artists\u2019 energy. They had to get up at three or four o\u2019clock in the morning every day, line up to get their makeup and hair done, rush to the filming site, wait for the filming to start, and once they were done with the hectic filming, half the day would have already passed. Adding on their other events to all this, they didn\u2019t even have time to sleep.Star Chart wasn\u2019t a company that pressured its artists, so it didn\u2019t extend the promotional performance time because of the popularity of \u2018Break Through\u2019. As Boss Chen Zhengyun said, as long as every performance was wonderful enough, the numbers weren\u2019t so important.It was a massively great thing for the six Kaleido members when the promotional performances ended. During their last performance, their happiness was written on their faces, and they were also teased by the fans, who said, \u201cWhatever you do, you shirk, but you\u2019re number one when it comes to getting out of work.\u201d What was better than ending their promotional performances was that since \u2018Break Through\u2019 had won first place at MLH, they had gone on to win nine consecutive titles in one fell swoop, having already broken their own record. What\u2019s more, this result was obtained after clashing with Seven Luminaries\u2019 comeback.In this competition, which was unfair from the beginning, Kaleido had still turned the tables using their own abilities, while also loudly slapping those super anti-fans who had mocked them before. The upsurge in their new album\u2019s popularity not only made K go from being a small, obscure group to a famous boy-band, but also doubled the popularity of Kaleido\u2019s ensemble show. The number of hits on each episode was constantly rising, and the numbers themselves were making actual records.Beauty was just a stepping stone; ability was the only thing that would make people confident enough to become their fans.On the day of Pei Tingsong\u2019s follow-up visit with the doctor, Cheng Qiang came to the dormitory early in the morning and ran into Fang Juexia, who had just finished his jog, in the elevator.\u201cThere are no events today, what are you planning to do?\u201dHearing Cheng Qiang\u2019s question, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t think much about it. \u201cGoing to the company to practice. I haven\u2019t danced for a long time. Then I\u2019ll have another vocal class\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cYou work too hard. Young people also need to relax occasionally. When artists are under such great pressure, they often meet up with their friends when they have nothing to do, making plans to go sing and go shopping.\u201d Cheng Qiang advised, but he also knew that Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t the kind of character who would integrate into a group. \u201cAt least, you can sleep at home and watch some movies. Don\u2019t be so tense, how tiring is that\u00a0ah.\u201dFang Juexia smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Qiang Ge. I\u2019ll come back to have a rest after practicing for a while.\u201dCheng Qiang just nodded. He didn\u2019t know if it was his delusion, but he felt that Fang Juexia\u2019s expressions had been more abundant recently. \u201cAlright. Hey, by the way, Xiao Pei hasn\u2019t got up yet\u00a0ba?\u201dFang Juexia shook his head. \u201cNo, he fell asleep late last night.\u201dHearing this, Cheng Qiang didn\u2019t think anything of it at first, but when he looked back and reviewed the sentence again, it felt a bit strange.\u00a0No ah, it\u2019s not like they were roommates.\u201cHow did you know he fell asleep late last night?\u201dFang Juexia was immediately stumped by this question. Of course, he couldn\u2019t say that Pei Tingsong was still sending him messages at 1 a.m. last night.The elevator doors opened, and Fang Juexia pulled out an excuse, \u201cI guessed it, he said he would stay up late studying, it\u2019s almost midterms.\u201dOnly then did Cheng Qiang let out an \u201coh\u201d, following with, \u201cYou don\u2019t say. Although Xiao Pei has a bad temper, a strange personality, and comes with a heap of small problems, like liking to be arrogant, or saying he won\u2019t do this or that everyday, he actually studies very seriously.\u201dFang Juexia thought that there were too many things after the \u201calthough.\u201dSure enough, when Cheng Qiang burst in, Pei Tingsong still had his head buried in the pillows as he slept. Fang Juexia made them each a cup of coffee and put them on the table, listening to Cheng Qiang\u2019s voice from inside the room urging Pei Tingsong to get up.Pei Tingsong came out with his head full of resentment. After washing up, he spiritlessly sat down at the table and was about to drink the coffee Fang Juexia had poured. However, Fang Juexia, who was standing by the table, kicked his stool, and told him with his eyes to eat the bread first.\u201cEat quickly, we\u2019ll go to the hospital after eating. We\u2019ve already made an appointment with the doctor, and if you don\u2019t hurry up and get there, they\u2019ll say you\u2019re playing at being some big-name.\u201dPei Tingsong chewed on the bread as he replied, \u201cSay it\u00a0bei, after removing the cast, I\u2019m not just playing at being a big-name, I\u2019m going to be playing with a\u00a0big knife.\u201dFang Juexia laughed out loud.Just as Cheng Qiang had gotten everything ready and was about to leave, his phone rang. After he picked it up, he listened to the other side for a long time before saying, \u201cOkay, alright, then I\u2019ll see if I can hurry over there.\u201dSeeing his imposing look, Fang Juexia asked what had happened. Cheng Qiang said, \u201cJiang Miao passed his audition, and now the producer wants to make an appointment to talk things over with him.\u201dPei Tingsong slapped the table, exclaiming, \u201cHe passed? That\u2019s so great, we can\u2019t do without an agent at this time\u00a0ah! My Miao Ge can\u2019t be thrown in a pit, go quickly, A-Strong.\u201d Saying that, he hugged Fang Juexia\u2019s waist and said, \u201cJuexia Ge will accompany me to the follow-up visit.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Fang Juexia wanted to push him away, but he couldn\u2019t even budge him. As soon as he raised his eyes, he saw Cheng Qiang\u2019s pleading look. \u201cJuexia, are you\u00a0okay\u00a0with that? I\u2019ll call Xiao Wen later and ask him to drive you, he can do the errand work.\u201d\u201c\u2026alright.\u201dHe actually really wanted to go with Pei Tingsong, but he still had to put on an expression of reluctance right now.Pei Tingsong, whose attitude was full of a refusal to cooperate, changed into joy as soon as he switched people, and he even sent Cheng Qiang away with a smile. Fang changed clothes, came out, and helped Pei Tingsong put on his coat. \u201cI hope the bone inside has fixed itself now.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgPei Tingsong suddenly changed his attitude. \u201cWhy? What are your intentions towards me?\u201d\u201cI have no intentions towards children.\u201d Pulling up his coat\u2019s zipper, Fang Juexia patted his forehead.Although there was Xiao Wen, this\u00a0third wheel, tagging along with them, Pei Tingsong was still in a good mood. They went to the hospital, got an X-Ray taken, and met the attending doctor from before, who did a careful examination.\u201cThe bones are healing well.\u201d The doctor pushed his glasses up. \u201cThere may be a little pain after the removal of the cast, which is normal. There will be some symptoms similar to soft tissue contracture after the muscles being fixated for such a long time. After this, still be careful, don\u2019t overuse your arm or carry heavy objects.\u201dFang Juexia was still worried. He asked a lot of questions and took note of all the dos and don\u2019ts in his mind. When they came out of the hospital, Xiao Wen couldn\u2019t help praising, \u201cJuexia, you\u2019re too attentive. There\u2019s nothing for me to do, you asked and clarified everything so clearly.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Pei Tingsong gripped Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder with his newly freed left hand. \u201cJuexia, care about me more\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cYou be careful.\u201dXiao Wen took the initiative to go to the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cBack to the dormitory?\u201dPei Tingsong immediately said, \u201cNo, make a trip to the school first. I have some forms I need to get stamped, and I have to go myself.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dTheir drive to the school took a while, for the road was jammed for half an hour. Pei Tingsong hadn\u2019t slept enough, so he fell asleep on Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder. Fang Juexia noticed Xiao Wen staring continuously at the rearview mirror, and that made him a little suspicious. After all, there had been too many such similar incidents recently.\u201cXiao Wen, what are you looking at?\u201dXiao Wen frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s me being too paranoid, but I keep feeling that there\u2019s a car following us.\u201d However, he felt that that conjecture was strange again. \u201cBut reasonably speaking, that shouldn\u2019t be the case\u00a0ah. How could they have known the time for Xiao Pei\u2019s follow-up visit? And we came in so early, so how would they know that?\u201dThe sound of the car horn outside almost woke Pei Tingsong up, and he rubbed his head against Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder. While Xiao Wen wasn\u2019t paying attention to the rearview mirror, Fang Juexia quietly pinched his fingertips in a little soothing gesture.He also thought it strange; it couldn\u2019t be that there was a stalker fan squatting at the entrance of their dormitory?The traffic finally turned smooth, and Xiao Wen continued to drive forward. After another intersection, he saw the suspicious vehicle still behind them. \u201cThey must be following us.\u201d\u201cIt may be that there\u2019s a stalker fan squatting outside our dormitory. I heard Ling Yi mention before that some stalker fans can crouch outside the community for a whole night, and that they even install cameras at the door of the dormitory.\u201d\u201cToo scary.\u201d Xiao Wen got goosebumps when he heard that. \u201cWhen we get back, I\u2019ll tell Qiang Ge to check the elevator outside the dormitory. Although it\u2019s the entrance elevator, and the security of the community is tight, it\u2019s not airtight. We can\u2019t ensure that some pervert won\u2019t get in and do something bad.\u201dWhen the car finally stopped at the school gate, Fang Juexia woke Pei Tingsong up and handed him a hat and a mask. Sure enough, just as he was ready to get out of the car, a group of strange stalker fans encircled it, and they kept yelling \u2018Pei Tingsong!\u2019 over and over, as if afraid that people around wouldn\u2019t recognize him.Pei Tingsong frowned and was too lazy to care about them. He took his bag from the car and prepared to leave. Fang Juexia was a little worried and looked out of the car window.\u201cThey\u2019re really so annoying, do they just have nothing else to do all day?\u201d Xiao Wen complained, \u201cOriginally I said to bring bodyguards, but then I thought that it would be a bit exaggerated. I would have called several people over if I had known earlier.\u201d\u201cIf we bring bodyguards into the school, we\u2019ll get scolded.\u201d Fang Juexia saw that they were surrounding Pei Tingsong more and more closely, and he was also getting a bit irritated. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be able to enter\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Based on the previous situation, they can get in. They\u2019ve gotten some documents, and they have already entered several times. Even Xiao Pei\u2019s classmates have been harassed.\u201dLooking at Pei Tingsong surrounded by them, Fang Juexia was a little worried. Pei Tingsong had a straight-forward temper, and it was very hard for him to restrain it. Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t at ease with him by himself.He glanced at Xiao Wen and gave up his little thought. Even Qiang Ge couldn\u2019t hold Pei Tingsong back, let alone Xiao Wen.Without thinking any more, Fang Juexia opened the door, put on his baseball cap, and went out.\u201cHey! Juexia, you\u2026\u201d\u201cWait for me in the car.\u201dFrom across the windshield, Xiao Wen stared at Fang Juexia\u2019s back in surprise. Clearly speaking, if he had encountered stalker fans before, he would avoid them if he could, so how come he was being so bold right now?Pei Tingsong, who was annoyed by this group of stalker fans, was about to start cursing up a storm. Unexpectedly, someone pulled on him. He was about to turn around and start cursing them out when he saw Fang Juexia\u2019s face.\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201dFang Juexia blocked him out from the left. These stalker fans seemed to be chasing only Pei Tingsong, and they were very dissatisfied with Fang Juexia\u2019s sudden appearance. One of them even cursed him out directly, saying that he stuck himself to Pei Tingsong as a publicity stunt and that he was only doing this to cook up some popularity.Fang Juexia said nothing, but his eyes were very cold. Pei Tingsong was so angry that he wanted to flame back, but Fang Juexia stopped him.\u201cDon\u2019t talk.\u201dAfter Fang Juexia pulled Pei Tingsong to quickly walk to the school and showed his ID to the security guard, Pei Tingsong said directly to the security guard, \u201cPlease stop the people behind me. They are not students here, they are people following me. You can check their IDs.\u201dSo the stalker fans behind them were stopped by the security, and without any scruples, they unleashed a torrent of abuse right outside the school gates.Pei Tingsong pulled Fang Juexia to enter while raising his right hand high, his middle finger sticking out to the group of madmen behind him.Fang Juexia pulled his hand down. \u201cI was just afraid that if you were by yourself, you\u2019d get inflamed with emotion while dealing with them, and that\u2019s why I came with you.\u201dPei Tingsong lowered his head, directly unlocked his cellphone, opened up Weibo, and talked with him while typing up a post. Without looking at it again, he directly posted it.[@Kaleido Pei Tingsong: Today Pei Tingsong is also abusing stalker fans. [MiddleFinger.JPG]]After posting it, he felt great. He threw his cellphone into his pocket. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Every time I come to school, I get into a mutual cursing session with them. Whatever, they can follow me in, I\u2019m not weak.\u201d\u201cThen how was it that you so kindly let the security guard stop them this time?\u201dPei Tingsong directed him towards a path with relatively few people. \u201cIt\u2019s fine when it\u2019s just me, but I can\u2019t bear to hear you being cursed out.\u201dFang Juexia laughed.They really were the same people.\u201cWhat does this count as?\u201d Fang Juexia glanced at him and teased him deliberately, \u201cWhen I was getting cursed out the most fiercely, you were still an eternally single person.\u201d\u201cFang Juexia, your mouth is really getting more and more powerful.\u201d Pei Tingsong applauded him. \u201cJust like a debater.\u201d\u201cThank you for the compliment.\u201dAs he followed Pei Tingsong in to finish up his paperwork, Fang Juexia felt a little listless. Regretting that he hadn\u2019t made a cup of coffee for himself in the morning, he then bought himself a cup of American style coffee from the coffee vending machine on the first floor of the office building.The girl in line behind him seemed to recognize him, but she hesitated and didn\u2019t dare to speak. Finally, when Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t locate the dispenser for the cup lid, she bravely stood out and pointed to the side. \u201cJuexia Gege, it\u2019s over there.\u201d\u201cAh, thank you.\u201d Only then did Fang Juexia realize that he had already been recognized. He was a little embarrassed and thanked her again.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome! I just saw Pei Tingsong\u2019s Weibo post, and I was so angry, but now I\u2019m happy seeing you!\u201d\u201cWeibo post?\u201d Fang Juexia didn\u2019t understand. He saw Pei Tingsong heading towards him after finishing up the paperwork.\u201cYes\u00a0ah, he\u2019s on the Hot Search list. Flaming stalker fans, super cool.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He thought the little girl who looked so well-behaved was also a stalker fan, so he asked her, \u201cAre you\u2026you\u2019re not following my Ge around\u00a0ba?\u201dMy Ge!!!The girl, who had just been questioned, totally didn\u2019t hear any other words; for her, only the two words \u2018my Ge\u2019 existed, and she immediately covered her chest as her face turned red.Life had never been so happy before.\u201cNo,\u201d Fang Juexia immediately denied, \u201cShe\u2019s a student who was lined up behind me to buy coffee.\u201d He immediately shifted the topic back to Pei Tingsong as he asked, \u201cDid you post something on Weibo?\u201d Then he thought that he might as well see it with his own eyes, so he logged into his Weibo account, that was about to gather dust while cooped up in a corner, opened his home page, scrolled through it, and found the post that Pei Tingsong had just published.As soon as he looked at it, he saw it for what it really was\u2014 a mass of negativity.\u201cWhat you posted was really too direct.\u201d Fang Juexia shook his head. He had even directly used the word \u2018abuse\u2019 and had stuck his middle finger out. If this hadn\u2019t started trending on the Hot Search List, it would have been strange.With the corners of his lips hooking up disdainfully, Pei Tingsong said, \u201cWhat does that count as? I nearly ended up posting that stalker fans should go die.\u201dThe little girl began to clap loudly, just like a little seal.Fang Juexia sighed. Forget it, how could he expect to control this person\u00a0ah? Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t mind at all. He took the coffee cup from Fang Juexia\u2019s hand, took a sip, and frowned like a connoisseur. \u201cThis coffee is really bad.\u201dThe girl was surprised again.In-indirect kiss!?!Fang Juexia\u2019s cellphone had vibrated several times. They were all messages from Cheng Qiang, and he knew what their content was without even opening them. It was all just a terrible headache.\u201cLet\u2019s go\u00a0ba, let\u2019s go. I\u2019m hungry, let\u2019s go get something to eat.\u201d Pei Tingsong pulled at Fang Juexia, who was quite close to malfunctioning, and got him to leave the small coffee vending machine. The only person left behind was that cute little fan, who had pink bubbles floating all over her, seeing off her favorite CP.Pei Tingsong\u2019s height made him very eye-catching on campus. He didn\u2019t care, but he was worried that Fang Juexia would find it awkward, so he tried his best to take him through paths less traversed by crowds.In fact, he was enjoying this moment very much. He was just like an ordinary student right now, one who was guiding the person he liked around his campus, bringing him along to eat in the school canteen, and then making plans to study and write papers at the school cafe.It was like a campus romance.\u201cI\u2019ll take you to a place that offers simple meals that I often eat at.\u201d Saying that, Pei Tingsong led Fang Juexia to a small coffee shop, the customer clientele of which was mostly overseas students, from all sorts of countries.He picked a booth in the corner, ordered some sandwiches and pasta, and then chatted face to face with Fang Juexia.Fang Juexia felt an inexplicable sense of security here. Maybe it was because everyone around them were students who were either concentrating on their studies or chatting away, and there weren\u2019t that many eyes on them. Or maybe it was because Pei Tingsong was sitting just opposite him, but all in all, his entire person felt very relaxed.\u201cWhen I first came here, I wasn\u2019t very used to how classes were conducted in China. So sometimes, I would head off to a coffee shop alone to study, and then I ended up coming here more often.\u201d Pei Tingsong picked up a sandwich and gave it to Fang Juexia, saying, \u201cI often order this.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Fang Juexia took a bite and thought it was pretty good. \u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201dAt the next table, there were two Korean girls who were studying math. They had used pens to pin up their hair, and when they encountered a hard problem, they would use the pens to scratch their heads. They spoke Chinese and Korean mixed together, like\u2014 \u201cAh, another one. Calculated it wrong, it\u2019s wrong again.\u201dFang Juexia thought they were very cute. Thinking back to when he had still been a student, he turned to Pei Tingsong and said, \u201cI actually came to P University to attend classes once before, but I didn\u2019t have time to eat at that time for I had to leave in a hurry after class, so I never got the chance to explore this place thoroughly.\u201dPei Tingsong was a little surprised. \u201cReally?\u201d He calculated for a bit. \u201cIt would have been two or three years ago?\u201dFang Juexia nodded, turning his fork on the plate and curling up a mass of pasta. \u201cAt that time, I came with some of my classmates, and I even got to know some of the P University professors.\u201dPei Tingsong suddenly felt that it was a pity. If only he had returned to China at that time and had gotten to meet Fang Juexia, how good would that have been\u00a0ah? They could have even been like normal students, and could have made plans to study together in the library.He was a person who usually didn\u2019t look back to the past, who always pressed forward boldly, his steps never faltering. But nowadays, from time to time, he would think about the past.All because he liked him too much, and every time he thought about how he hadn\u2019t participated in some part of Fang Juexia\u2019s life, he would find it regretful.It was pretty silly, and Pei Tingsong knew that.Fang Juexia, who was eating his pasta, suddenly seemed to have thought of something, and then he began to laugh.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Pei Tingsong looked at him from across the table and asked, \u201cYou\u2019re laughing so happily.\u201dFang Juexia shook his head and didn\u2019t really seem to want to say.\u201cTell me\u00a0ah, make me happy, too.\u201dOnly after letting Pei Tingsong kick up a fuss for a bit did Fang Juexia finally begin, \u201cOkay\u00a0ba, I just suddenly thought, if I transmigrated back to the past right now, back to my high school years, I may try my best and work hard, take part in some math competitions or something, all to try and fight my way into P University. Although my grandfather hoped that I would go to Beijing Normal University, if\u2026\u201dHis eyes turned away from Pei Tingsong, shifting away with some embarrassment. \u201cIf I knew at that time that you would come here in the future, I might have changed my plans.\u201dPei Tingsong, who had just given up on this what-if, was hit hard by Fang Juexia\u2019s words at this moment.He knew that imagining what-ifs about the past was the most useless thing in the world, but when the two what-ifs met unexpectedly, they turned into a mutual hunger.It was already the happiest thing in the world to know that the person you like also wanted to have met you earlier.Maybe that\u2019s how they spent their time in a parallel universe. They weren\u2019t shining idols on the stage there, and they got to know one another in the most ordinary of circumstances. Maybe they would also have some pride, and show some prejudice at the beginning, after all, they were two people who were as different from each other as the North and South. But in the end, as before, with every instance they spent communicating with each other, they would gradually become the other\u2019s most intimate person.No matter how many times over, Pei Tingsong would always come to admire Fang Juexia\u2019s strength and transparency, and Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t stay indifferent to the most passionate and romantic person in the world.This was the only constant story in the many different parallel universes.Fang Juexia\u2019s cellphone vibrated, and he looked at it.[A Constant Truth: I really like you so much, to the point that I have no words.]The corners of Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth couldn\u2019t help rising, but he didn\u2019t look at Pei Tingsong on purpose, and just stared down at the menu.Originally, he had thought that Pei Tingsong would return to the company with him after touring around the campus. Unfortunately, halfway through, a professor stuck himself in and called Pei Tingsong over to discuss an issue regarding publishing papers. Pei Tingsong also couldn\u2019t let Xiao Wen wait outside for too long, so he let Fang Juexia go back first, saying that once he finished up, he would return to the company.By the time Fang Juexia left, Pei Tingsong\u2019s stalker fans had also already left.\u201cJuexia, Juexia.\u201d As soon as Xiao Wen saw him come out, he stuck his head out of the car window and waved at him.Fang Juexia got into the passenger seat and handed Xiao Wen the sandwich and coffee he had specifically bought for him. \u201cHave something to eat\u00a0ba. I thought you would have slept for a while.\u201d\u201cIt just so happens I was just starting to get hungry, thank you, Juexia! I originally wanted to get some sleep,\u201d Xiao Wen took a bite of the sandwich as he narrated, \u201cYet in the end, in the end\u2026 Xiao Pei\u00a0ah. He sent me a WeChat message saying that I should take a picture of those stalker fans at the gate and then send it to him.\u201dA picture?Fang Juexia felt that such a request was a little off. \u201cWhat does he want to do?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, I took it for him anyway.\u201d As he said that, Xiao Wen also grew very angry. \u201cThose women were still fighting with the security guard outside. I was so scared, I almost called the police. I really don\u2019t understand, what are they doing following around people every single day\u00a0ah?\u201d He thought of something else. \u201cRight, Juexia, Qiang Ge said that he had already asked someone to install monitoring devices in the elevator, the entrance of the elevator, and outside the door of your dormitory. Then, he put the monitoring screen for these cameras in your guys\u2019 living room, so you guys can check it at any point in time.\u201dHe took a sip of coffee. \u201cQiang Ge said if worst comes to worst, you guys can just move to another dormitory, switching to another place.\u201dFang Juexia sighed. \u201cIf we change places, those stalker fans will grow even more pleased with themselves. They will think we are hiding because we are afraid of them.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Xiao Wen rolled up one of his sleeves to show off his small thin arms. \u201cReally, every time I see them, I want to land a heavy punch on them.\u201dThe more Fang Juexia thought about it, the more he felt that he should discuss with Pei Tingsong whatever he wanted to do when he got back to the company.Xiao Wen drove him back to the company. On the way, Fang Juexia received a message from Ling Yi saying that he had gotten a new TV theme song, and it was even for a TV drama starring an actress he especially liked. Fang Juexia was also happy and congratulated him.After they arrived at the parking lot, Xiao Wen parked the car, and then the two people headed up together. Their underground parking lot was empty, and it was a long walk to the office elevator. Xiao Wen had a lively character, and the entire time, he chatted about his recent work with Fang Juexia. They were all trivial matters, and he usually had no one to talk to about them. However, Fang Juexia was very gentle and could also give him practical suggestions, so he liked chatting with Fang Juexia very much.\u201cSo you\u2019re still training the new people?\u201dXiao Wen sighed. \u201cNo other way\u00a0ah. Qiang Ge said that there would be less manpower available to us in the near future. Who would have thought that I could be a senior one day?\u201dFang Juexia laughed. \u201cYou were already very reliable.\u201d After he said that though, he suddenly felt that something was wrong. He turned his head and looked around, but didn\u2019t see anything. He then turned back once again, and it was still as empty as ever behind him.Xiao Wen was very happy to hear his praise. He didn\u2019t turn around, instead continuing to talk about his little matters. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s alright\u00a0ah. It\u2019s just that there\u2019s a new person who can\u2019t remember what I said and often makes some very low-level mistakes. I know it\u2019s not good to say that about people, but really, you know, Juexia, he almost took the wrong document from my desk last time. I had already told him before, you can\u2019t just randomly move anything off my desk.\u201d\u201cReally\u2026\u201d Internally, Fang Juexia kept feeling that something was off, so he just replied back with a few words, and then couldn\u2019t help looking behind him again.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Xiao Wen finally discovered that something wasn\u2019t quite right with him.Fang Juexia shook his head before entering the elevator with him. The elevator door closed slowly, and only then did he say, \u201cI keep feeling like someone is following me.\u201d\u201cReally? It can\u2019t be paparazzi or stalker fans\u00a0ba?!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Fang Juexia frowned and suggested, \u201cMaybe all the recent stuff with the stalker fans has left my nerves on edge.\u201dAs he said that, Xiao Wen\u2019s scalp also turned a bit numb. \u201cI hope it\u2019s just paparazzi, and not anyone too bad. I really worry about you guys every day.\u201dXiao Wen had followed them ever since their debut. At that time, he had just graduated from university, and because of Kaleido\u2019s lack of popularity, he had suffered a lot when he went out to work, having to watch a lot of people roll their eyes at him. In Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes, Xiao Wen and Cheng Qiang were already almost relatives.He pinched Xiao Wen\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, there will always be a way.\u201dOnce in the company, they saw Cheng Qiang, who was in a mess as he answered calls on three different cellphones. Fang Juexia felt a little distressed watching him, but he also knew that this matter was because of Pei Tingsong\u2019s Weibo post, and finding the situation a little funny, he simply stood in front of him for a while.After finishing his calls, Cheng Qiang shook his head at Fang Juexia, complaining, \u201cHow can he be so fierce? Tell me, how can he be so tiger-like?!\u201d\u201cMaybe he was a little tiger in his last life,\u201d Fang Juexia shrugged and replied, \u201cHe got used to being the king of the mountain, and now looks down upon everyone.\u201d\u201cThe key is that those stalker fans tend to go to the extreme.\u201d Cheng Qiang was still worried.Fang Juexia thought about it. \u201cQiang Ge, we\u2019re not quite thinking the right way. I thought about it today, and in fact, Xiao Pei\u2019s actions are not necessarily impulsive. He is making his own calculations, and as you know, he is not a person who depends on his fans to eat, not to mention the kind of fans that are stalker fans.\u201dCheng Qiang suddenly understood what he was saying. \u201cDo you mean that Xiao Pei wants to sort them all out by himself?\u201d\u201cMaybe\u00a0ba.\u201d Fang Juexia was just guessing. \u201cCountering one evil with another evil can sometimes be a good method.\u201d\u201cWhatever\u2026 Anyway, I\u2019m really tired today. I originally wanted to spend some money to have the topic dropped from the Hot Search list, but that little brat simply wouldn\u2019t hear of it, nor would he delete the Weibo post. As a result, some influencer accounts started creating a whole thread about him in the forums, before we can even get a handle on this situation.\u201d\u201cWhat forum?\u201d Fang Juexia realized the answer to his own question all of a sudden. \u201cOh, Pei Tingsong\u2019s tiger-like incident log.\u201d\u201cYou even know about that!\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgFang Juexia laughed. \u201cWhen Ling Yi was eating melons, he showed it to me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m speechless. They\u2019ve even given him a nickname online now, some \u2018the world\u2019s middle-finger, Pei Tingsong\u2019, and \u2018walking silencer, Pei Tingsong, the evil tiger of the world.\u2019\u201dFang Juexia thought about it. \u201cIt\u2019s all very appropriate.\u201dCheng Qiang was left completely speechless. Sure enough, what brotherhood that only comes out of fanservice, and he had thought they had really become good friends.\u201cAlright\u00a0ba, of the two of you, one\u2019s stubborn while the other is fierce, it\u2019s too hard for me.\u201d Cheng Qiang was about to leave, but then turned back to remind him, \u201cHey, by the way, we need to shoot advertisements during the weekend, so adjust your state accordingly.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dHe practiced in the practice room until the evening, when Ling Yi also came in to dance, who told him as soon as he entered the door, \u201cJuexia, have you seen Xiao Pei\u2019s Weibo post? It\u2019s too powerful.\u201dFang Juexia wiped away his sweat and drank some water. \u201cSaw it, he posted it right when he was in front of me at that time, I didn\u2019t even know at that time.\u201d\u201cYi?\u201d Ling Yi was puzzled at first, and then quickly realized. \u201cNo, he posted another one. You certainly didn\u2019t see the new one.\u201d He knew Fang Juexia never looked at his cellphone when he was practicing.Really?Fang Juexia walked to the wall, picked up his cellphone, sat down, opened Weibo, and only refreshed his homepage once before he came across Pei Tingsong\u2019s Weibo post.[@Kaleido Pei Tingsong: To tell the truth, the way you guys keep cursing out my bandmates and my agent on the Internet every single day, I can treat it as if I haven\u2019t seen it. Whatever you guys curse, we\u2019re still together and will even go to Maldives together. Are you angry yet?But what do you want to do when you chase after our cars like crazy people and even get in front of me, just to curse my bandmates out in front of me? Do you want to tell me, \u201cAh, Pei Tingsong, look at how much I like you\u00a0ah, I can curse people out just like you\u201d? Learn something, okay, I only curse out those who deserve it, such as you guys. I also love reading, so why don\u2019t I see you guys bringing papers in with you and having me help you read the English abstracts\u00a0ah?]\u201cPfft,\u201d\u00a0Fang Juexia directly started laughing.Ling Yi immediately said, \u201cRight, right, Xiao Pei is really awesome. I\u2019ve never seen such an awesome idol in my life. I even want to sign up for his class and learn how to curse people out from him.\u201d\u201cForget it\u00a0ba.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s smile did not subside. \u201cOnce you learn it, you will have no place to display it. He himself isn\u2019t afraid of the heavens or the earth.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, his family is so rich and powerful that no one dares to touch him, so he\u2019s completely emboldened. Right,\u201d Ling Yi pointed at his screen and added,\u201d you see, he also replied to the\u00a0poison fan\u2019s comment.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dSure enough, the first comment below the post was just that.[@Pinot Tree Supreme\u2019s Real Girlfriend: No, what the hell are you talking about?

You\u2019re really good at fucking cooling down your fans\u2019 hearts\u00a0ah. Do you know how many resources and fans you will lose after you say these words? You have to speak and act cautiously in the entertainment industry, do you fucking understand?

You can only dream of being my girlfriend.]He\u2019s too harsh\u2026Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help sighing. He knew that the fans below would take control of the comments, so he specially clicked on the Hot Search List to see it in real time. He thought that there would be a lot of people openly cursing him out, but the situation was actually totally different from what he had imagined.[@Paperheart: Holy shit, PTS is too amazing\u2026][@Low class Appearance Con: Shit, I\u2019m going to become a fan.

Also, just one of his watches is worth millions of yuan, his family lives in Atherton, and the whole family is also very famous.

A fan in high school was very scared because she had a small tumor. She wrote a long article about it, but didn\u2019t even dare @ him, but other fans then tagged him. As a result, he actually forwarded it and secretly went to see the girl. Knowing that she was from a single parent family, he arranged for her to go to the best cancer hospital and paid the full medical expenses for her treatment. In fact, he is very kind-hearted, it\u2019s just that some fans are so terrible and do some weird stalker actions under the banner of love. He\u2019s been saying this ever since he debuted.]Fang Juexia still had an impression of that incident. He Ziyan had said that Pei Tingsong had subsidized a high school student, but he hadn\u2019t thought much of it at that time. He had just felt that the young master was rich and energetic. Only later did he know that he was biased against him. The high school student had been seriously ill and had no money for treatment. He had decided to help without telling anyone about it. If it wasn\u2019t for that child who had later insisted on posting about it on Weibo, no one would know about it.Pei Tingsong, this person, had a sharp contrast in attitudes, all black or white, without any grey areas.It was at that time that Fang Juexia had also changed his attitude towards him, coming to understand that Pei Tingsong\u2019s nature wasn\u2019t bad. However, Fang Juexia\u2019s cognition and positioning of himself at that time were also very accurate. He was a person who had been assigned to the black area, and he would never get any kind looks from him.Now that he thought about it, life really had great ups and downs and then ups and downs again.Who would have expected that the person in his black area would one day become his boyfriend?#Pei Tingsong curses out stalker fans# and #the world\u2019s middle-finger, Pei Tingsong# had exploded on the Hot Search List, reaching the level where the entire Internet was eating melons and watching its development.Seeing this, Fang Juexia thought that \u2018really, they were finished this time.\u2019 The company didn\u2019t have enough money to drag something like this off the Hot Search list, how expensive would doing that be\u00a0ah?There were all kinds of comments in the Hot Search list entries. Most of them were surprised, and many people even became fans because of Pei Tingsong\u2019s straightforwardness.Of course, there were always some\u00a0Li Zhongkes\u00a0or keyboard warriors, who kept pointing at Pei Tingsong\u2019s reckless behavior. They attempted to control him using very traditional Chinese thinking, wanting him to learn patience and teaching him to be cautious.In this way, the Li Zhongkes didn\u2019t care about how they were treated, they just wanted to teach people how to behave. They even swarmed into Pei Tingsong\u2019s Weibo to educate him online. They thought they were the good kind of medicine, one that tasted bitter, and expected Pei Tingsong to listen and change after being scolded. Some people even mocked Pei Tingsong with his experience of growing up abroad, telling him that Chinese was not used to curse people out. To be a star was to learn to shut up, and he deserved it.\u201cThese speeches are so mesmerizing, I feel like they\u2019re also really good at cursing people out in Chinese?\u201d Ling Yi scrolled down, getting more obsessed the further he read, and then became so angry that he returned to Pei Tingsong\u2019s post about not cursing out his bandmates to give him a like.\u201cJuexia, you also go like it. I think Lu Yuan and He Ziyan have already done so.\u201dFang Juexia let out an \u201coh\u201d and then went back to his home page, accidentally refreshing it. Unexpectedly, Pei Tingsong\u2019s latest Weibo post appeared on his screen, which was just a picture with no additional text in the message. The picture consisted of a few lines of his handwritten English.[@Kaleido Pei Tingsong: shared a picture][We\u00a0live in a fucking insane time\uff0cmanwhen you stalked by some shit\uff0cyou must shut the fuck upwhen you tryna say something real\uff0cpeople just blah-blah-blahThey say you gotta watch for what you saying babyOMG\uff0c you are in trouble!guess whatI AM THE REAL TROUBLE ]He didn\u2019t know why, but just looking at this picture made Fang Juexia feel that there was a voice in his head, as if Pei Tingsong was freestyling there.He didn\u2019t expect a translation to pop up in the hot comments after just a short period of time.[@Learn English with Pinot Tree Supreme: We live in a ** crazy age. When you are stalked by some **, you have to ** shut up and bear with it. When you want to say something real\u00a0ba, critics go blablabla then say something about watching what you say. Later, they\u2019ll say god, you\u2019re in trouble! Guess what? Laozi is the real trouble.]Fang Juexia smiled.\u201cIt really is a soulful translation.\u201dLing Yi looked at him in surprise. \u201cGod, Juexia, I actually thought you really wouldn\u2019t support him being this fierce.\u201dFang Juexia looked back at him\u00a0peacefully. \u201cI support him\u00a0ah. Whatever he does, I support him.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His speech, in one breath, had pretty much torn off the mask of calmness the entertainment industry habitually maintained on the surface. Unexpectedly, he also garnered a lot of support with this dispute.With regards to how more and more entertainment stars chose to remain 'silent\u201d, there were many netizens who had already been accumulating a lot of dissatisfaction with it from long ago. In this day and age, because saying something could get you sentenced to death, public figures had gotten into the habit of wearing masks of silence, always only uttering exquisitely decorated words that would contain absolutely no errors. For as long as they lived, they would maintain an act and never express their own views.Pei Tingsong was like a living person who broke this puppet mask. He had no scruples in breaking this tacit rule and expressing himself in a pointed and emotional way.Pei Tingsong\u2019s fans were very good at dealing with people. While some especially fierce words were still making their way onto the Hot Search List, Pei Tingsong\u2019s fans took advantage of this popularity to post a lot of clips of him from the ensemble show, especially those from when he was in the haunted house.[@Under the Pinot Tree Supreme, you and I: We sincerely invite you to watch the great transformation of #The World\u2019s Middle Finger, Pei Tingsong# and #The World\u2019s Silencer# [share video]]Everyone rushed in with their mics open, ready to argue, but after they clicked on it and came face-to-face with the rapper who was scared of ghosts and whose voice kept getting more and more high-pitched, this gap moe made a lot of netizens turn into his fans.[@Pfft pfft pfft, swallowing down saliva: Hahahahaha, you\u2019re telling me that this is the Pei Tingsong who turned on his mic to curse people out???][@Leopard zebra little cutie: The World\u2019s Middle Finger persona is fake!

The two boys are\u00a0\u3001\u3001matched)][@Diiidi: Getting away from the main point, this Ge sounds so nice talking in English\u00a0ah,\u00a0his accent is great]With Pei Tingsong reaching this degree of popularity, a small company like Star Chart knew that they couldn\u2019t control it at all. All they could do was just try their best to guide public opinion and not be used by others. However, no one dared to really attack Pei Tingsong.Originally, Cheng Qiang was very worried that the sports brand from before would\u00a0drop the deal\u00a0due to Pei Tingsong opening his mic. When the news had broken out on the Hot Search List, he had called the brand merchant specially, in order to disclose all the details of the story in advance. Unexpectedly, not only was the other side not in any negative mood, they were also very satisfied.\u201cIsn\u2019t the response online very good? It fits perfectly, our series also focuses on this kind of young and flamboyant style. Pei Tingsong is very consistent with our style, and there\u2019s also Fang Juexia. One of them is calm while the other is flamboyant, and there\u2019s contrast there. They can represent two different types of young people, it\u2019s very good.\u201dCheng Qiang was relieved. Being the agent of a ticking time bomb really wasn\u2019t easy.On the day of the advertisement\u2019s shooting, Cheng Qiang drove them to the filming location. Fang Juexia got in the car and looked out of the window. The parasol tree in the boulevard had, at some point, already grown to cover up half of the sky. Busy people lacked perception of time, and just so imperceptibly, summer was on the brink of arriving.\u201cAt the end of today\u2019s work, you guys can take a break for a while. After that, there will be some more fragmentary events.\u201d Cheng Qiang started the car. \u201cBoss means to strive to release a mini-album for you guys in the summer.\u201d\u201cAre we going to the Maldives or not?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked.Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help but start to laugh. \u201cHave you become Ling Yi\u2019s spokesman now?\u201d\u201cShh, shh, shh.\u201d Cheng Qiang put on his seat belt and said, \u201cThe last episode for the ensemble show will be in the Maldives, and we\u2019re only filming for the first two days. You guys can have fun however you like the days after, we won\u2019t follow you to film it.\u201d\u201cReally? So cool.\u201d Pei Tingsong took advantage of the situation to hug Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cThen I want to stay in the same room as Juexia Ge.\u201dCheng Qiang glared at him. \u201cYou dislike me, don\u2019t you? I haven\u2019t even settled accounts with you for up and vanishing that other day!\u201dAt the mention of this matter, Fang Juexia felt embarrassed and looked out of the window.Pei Tingsong was cheeky and said with a smile, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? How old am I, and you\u2019re still dispatching people to follow me around every day\u00a0ah.\u201dSpeaking of this, Fang Juexia thought of something.\u201cBy the way, I keep feeling a little strange lately.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s strange?\u201d Cheng Qiang drove out of the neighborhood.Pei Tingsong loosened his hold on his shoulder and sat down by himself, looking at Fang Juexia\u2019s face. He just saw his brow slightly furrow. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being neurotic. I keep feeling that someone has been following me recently, but when I look back, there\u2019s no one there.\u201dHearing him say that he was being neurotic, Pei Tingsong immediately said, \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate a human\u2019s ability to predict danger. Sometimes it\u2019s very accurate, and this doesn\u2019t count as some sort of neurosis.\u201d Having said that, he was also a little fidgety and continued, \u201cThe recent stalker fans have really been a little disgusting, they must have also followed you.\u201d\u201cDo you feel it at the dorm?\u201d Cheng Qiang asked.Fang Juexia shook his head. \u201cJust on the way back to the dormitory, or near the company. And it\u2019s just been there for the past two days, I didn\u2019t have a feeling like that before.\u201d\u201cAfter the advertisement is done, rest well in the dormitory for a few days, or go out to have fun.\u201d Cheng Qiang said, \u201cFor the time being, don\u2019t come regularly to the company anymore. You should rest anyway, you\u2019ve been working continuously for too long.\u201dLooking at Fang Juexia nodding calmly, Pei Tingsong wanted to hug him.He was clearly not afraid of the heavens or the earth, but now it seemed that he really had a weakness. If someone even lightly touched it, he would be miserable.The theme of the ad being shot was \u201cPublicize the True Self\u201d. What they needed to show off were the new summer products of the brand\u2019s youth series. They would need to shoot four versions of the TV ad, as well as shoot photos for a full series of print ads. Of course, this also included some gags and material videos for the publicity period.As soon as they arrived at the filming location, Cheng Qiang met the marketing director he had met before. The other party waved to them from a distance. When he greeted them, he was very warm. \u201cYou arrived so early, the roads weren\u2019t jammed\u00a0ba?\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t that just us being afraid of being stuck on the second ring road? I simply hauled them both up early in the morning to avoid that.\u201dThe director said with a smile, \u201cRight, I have something to discuss with you guys. The publicity video we agreed on was a quick survey, which meant some quick Q&amp;A with you guys. Later, our higher-ups said that this seemed to be the same as that magazine shoot from before, and they hoped we could change it. Our marketing team held a meeting all night, and combining things with some hot current events, came up with a new plan. You guys look, if it\u2019s acceptable, we\u2019ll just\u2026\u201dHe handed them the plan, one for each of them. Fang Juexia looked down and flipped through it, and the first line of small words attracted his attention \u2014 read mean comments and give a response.\u201cOf course, this isn\u2019t something acceptable to every star, so it is only one of our plans. There\u2019s a little game \u2018never have I ever\u2019 in the back, which can be used as an alternative.\u201dAs soon as he saw \u201cmean comments\u201d, Cheng Qiang looked at Fang Juexia. He knew that Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t care, but Fang Juexia had suffered too much online abuse before.Fang Juexia turned the page and looked up. He saw Cheng Qiang looking at himself, so he laughed. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Qiang Ge?\u201d\u201cAh, nothing, do you think it\u2019s okay?\u201dHe also didn\u2019t know why, but it felt to him that Fang Juexia had already gotten rid of the source for his sensitive feelings by now. It was probably that his frame of mind was different now, and he was much more mature than before.\u201cI can do it.\u201d Saying that, he looked at Pei Tingsong. \u201cIt\u2019s not just me here\u00a0ah.\u201dIf Pei Tingsong said he wasn\u2019t worried inside, he\u2019d be lying, but he also knew that if Fang Juexia really didn\u2019t like it, he would refuse outright. He wasn\u2019t a man to swallow his anger. On the contrary, he was very brave.\u201cAlright\u00a0ah, let\u2019s do it together.\u201dSeeing that they had readily agreed, the marketing director was relieved that the scheme he had worked on all night had not been abandoned. He explained, \u201cIn fact, we have screened all these mean comments, and there are no extreme ones. If you guys still aren\u2019t at ease, we can show them to you first.\u201dFang Juexia said with a smile, \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary. If we do it that way, there won\u2019t be any surprise when we read it again.\u201dThe marketing director was a bit surprised to hear him say that.He had expected Fang Juexia, who had been harassed by online abuse before, to resolutely reject this proposal. Unexpectedly, he was so easy to convince, and also agreed to cooperate so smoothly.Throughout the process of filming the advertisement, Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong changed into six sets of the new products, with their venue changing again and again as\u00a0 they filmed from morning to dusk. The whole team was very professional, and the stylists matched the series of clothes and shoes they wore based on their two distinct personal characteristics, all in order to maximize and highlight them.The photographer constantly praised the two people\u2019s expressiveness, even giving a high evaluation of \u201cno wasted film\u201d. However, Fang Juexia was as always, bowing and thanking everyone for their hard work.Even if there were many people holding him up now, he would not forget the contemptuous looks they had suffered on their path here. As long as he remembered it, he would feel like his feet were still firmly planted on the ground, not floating up in the air, still in this world.\u201cDone! And there\u2019s still the last publicity video, the two of you have worked hard.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgFang Juexia was wearing a lake blue tracksuit jacket over a raglan short-sleeved T-shirt on top, which had the words \u2018Feel Me\u2019 on the front, and lake blue shorts and light blue shoes below.From the distance, he looked like a tall dawn redwood, beautiful, precious, and full of vitality.Pei Tingsong looked at him from behind, not being able to even move his eyes away. The loose fabric of the shorts swayed in the wind, enclosing a pair of pale long legs that almost glowed, the tight muscles of which were evenly spread across as they tightened and loosened with his every movement.Fang Juexia\u2019s ankles were particularly beautiful, with slightly convex sides, round anklebones, and thin ankles that could be grasped, and when his heel pulled upward, he gave off the feel of being a teenager.\u201cThe two of you sit in front of this camera here, right.\u201dIn the absence of a host, they had to control the scene by themselves. The staff put the comment cards on the table in front of them, a small stack in front of each of them. The cards were black, with comments from antis written on them, one comment per card.Fang Juexia picked up a card and announced the opening lines to the camera with no expression on his face. \u201cReading the mean comments challenge, start.\u201dPei Tingsong bumped his shoulder. \u201cHey, you manage your expression a bit.\u201dFang Juexia turned to look at him and rubbed his cheeks. \u201cDo I have too much expression?\u201dPei Tingsong took the card in his hand and swatted his chin with it a bit. \u201cI mean, please have more expression. Otherwise, I\u2019ll feel sorry for the anti-fans who wrote these comments. They, after all, really, seriously hate us.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Fang Juexia looked down at the card and frowned very hard to show that he was paying attention. Pei Tingsong rubbed his head. \u201cYou\u2019re really obedient.\u201dFang Juexia glared at him and removed his hand .Pei Tingsong almost couldn\u2019t help laughing.\u00a0Really, he has more of a temper towards me than towards the anti fans.\u201cI\u2019ll go first.\u201d He picked up the first black card and read, \u201cAm I the only one who thinks Pei Tingsong is really stupid?\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t know why, but when he heard him read it, he thought it was funny and couldn\u2019t help laughing out loud.\u201cLook at your reaction. People who don\u2019t know would think you wrote it.\u201dThe smile on Fang Juexia\u2019s face didn\u2019t recede. \u201cYes\u00a0ah, real evidence within the group.\u201dPei Tingsong threw the card aside and replied, \u201cRight, it\u2019s only you. You are electricity, you are light, you are the only garbage,\u00a0woo.\u201d Then he complained, \u201cThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s it? Let\u2019s have something that is actually fierce\u00a0ba. \u201cFang Juexia took out one. His voice didn\u2019t change much, and he even sounded like a robot reading a manuscript.\u201cFang Juexia is so fond of hyping his good-at-math persona. Why is he an idol\u00a0ah, the entertainment industry doesn\u2019t need high intelligence. If\u00a0you\u00a0don\u2019t always pretend to be a math teacher, do you feel bad?\u201dAfter reading it, he seriously thought about it before giving a response, \u201cIn fact, I really have a teacher\u2019s qualification certificate. If we didn\u2019t get popular, I was preparing to return to my hometown to teach.\u201d After saying that, he didn\u2019t lose heart and gave a thumb\u2019s up towards the camera. \u201cYou\u2019re a great prophet.\u201dPei Tingsong was amused by his family\u2019s beautiful baby. He looks down at the black card in his hand with a smile. No, he needed to steady himself.After clearing his throat, Pei Tingsong continued, \u201cI really don\u2019t know how PTS this garbage debuted? Don\u2019t you just have some money? He\u2019s already the second generation of a wealthy family, why come harm the entertainment industry\u00a0ah? Go and inherit your family property\u00a0ah.\u201dPei Tingsong took the card and knocked it on the table. \u201cSince the netizens are so happy to answer their own questions, there\u2019s nothing for me to say. But I don\u2019t have \u2018some\u2019 money.\u201d He tossed the card. \u201cI have boatloads of money.\u201dHe was terrifying. Fang Juexia shook his head, drew out a mean comment card and read it out easily.\u201cFang Juexia is the artist I\u2019ve seen with the least amount of variety. He\u2019s dull and boring and doesn\u2019t even feel like a human being. He\u2019s just like an assembly line commodity without a soul. For a period of time, I suspected that he was mute, and I couldn\u2019t understand why someone would like this kind of icy cold idol?\u201dA bellyful of anger blazed within Pei Tingsong with these words. The people online didn\u2019t understand Fang Juexia at all; they just evaluated him from their own imaginary point of view, and it was subjective and full of prejudice.Fang Juexia put down the card with both hands and thought seriously for a while. \u201cWhy do people like me?\u201cFrom the analysis of the comments online, most of them tend to have one answer: because I look pretty attractive.\u201dThat was the truth.Hearing this, Pei Tingsong started laughing, his anger from before swept away. Fang Juexia was just Fang Juexia. It would be best if he was the only one in the world to see this person\u2019s so good and so fresh side, so that he could have one less enemy and keep it all for himself.With this in mind, Pei Tingsong drew out a new one. \u201cI\u2019m most annoyed by Pei Tingsong, this kind of irascible celebrity. What straightforward is he pretending to be, it\u2019s like he can\u2019t curse people out without using dirty words. However much money you earn is how much you have to suffer, understood? Who made you want to be a celebrity, you make so much money as a celebrity, so will you die if you have a little less privacy\u00a0ah.\u201dThese words were really quite ugly, and Fang Juexia knew Pei Tingsong too well. Just as he was ready to stick up his middle finger, Fang Juexia grasped his finger, pulled it to his side, and held on to it tightly.With his middle finger taken prisoner, Pei Tingsong felt that his performance had been limited. He pulled twice, but Fang Juexia didn\u2019t release it. He could only give it up, let him continue holding it, click his tongue twice, and then repeat a sentence from the mean comment\u2019s text. \u201d\u2026However much money you earn is how much you have to suffer.\u201d He raised an eyebrow. \u201cI was born with so much money that I can\u2019t spend it in several lifetimes. What \u2018suffer\u2019?\u201cAnd your logic is more confusing than the relationship diagram for\u00a0Aquaman\u2019s fishing grounds.\u201dFang Juexia looked at him and asked seriously, \u201cWhat is Aquaman?\u201d\u201cAquaman is a superhero, and his super power is fishery management.\u201d Pei Tingsong also put on a serious look when telling him that.Really?\u00a0Fang Juexia, a young man who was usually offline, kept feeling as though this explanation was strange.After saying that, Pei Tingsong continued, \u201cPeople like you who have nothing to do but talk a lot of nonsense every day and think that everyone in the world is drunk but you alone are sober, are essentially pessimistic and defective logical thinkers. You use your narrow ideas to create the illusion of self consistency that aids you in meeting your own emotional needs.\u201cBecause of your failures in life, you can\u2019t establish good social relationships, and you can\u2019t get positive emotional feedback in life, so you need to vent your negative emotions. You also try to find a reasonable excuse for your venting, so you point the finger at people online, especially at stars, because stars can\u2019t bite back like dogs biting dogs back.\u00a0You\u00a0may not be beneficial to society even if you live on. Read some more books\u00a0ba. Reading will never create garbage.\u201dHearing his tirade, where he managed to curse people out without using any dirty words, Fang Juexia\u2019s first reaction was actually to patch up his logic by saying, \u201cNo, he\u2019s useful to society.\u201dPei Tingsong looked at him with an \u2018excuse me\u2019 expression, but unexpectedly, Fang Juexia continued solemnly, \u201cIt\u2019s useful as a sample of the diversity of human thinking. The sample has the value of being observed and providing a conclusion.\u201dPeople\u2019s social activities in this life were just for the sake of collecting human samples.Pfft. Pei Tingsong chuckled.This guy was so smartly cute even when adding on knives.Fang Juexia picked up another one and read it out loud, \u201cThe entertainment industry now is filled with so many evil-doers; are the former anti-materials about the hidden rules washed clean so quickly? Every generation is worse than the next.\u201dWhen Pei Tingsong heard the words \u201chidden rules\u201d, he felt as though they pierced his ears. He really didn\u2019t feel good, but unexpectedly, Fang Juexia remained calm. He still held onto Pei Tingsong\u2019s middle finger in one hand as he held the card in his other hand and tapped it on the table.\u201cI\u2019ve explained it before, and I can explain it again. The hidden rules issue is a rumor. Please bear in mind that no matter what evil mask you\u2019re wearing online, everyone is human and cannot escape legal responsibility.\u201dThe staff in the back were a little surprised. Everyone said that Pei Tingsong was a tough master, but unexpectedly, Fang Juexia, who looked gentle and didn\u2019t speak much, could also be so direct.Today, Fang Juexia also finally discovered that he had already matured. In the past, he used to treat these malicious lingering rumors by staying far away from them, just like he would in the case of allergens. But now, he could already accept the possibility of being disliked.In front of the camera, he put down the card and added, \u201cI\u2019ve already remembered your ID. I\u2019ll give it to the legal department of the company in five minutes.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Acting as if those negative voices didn\u2019t exist was an effective way to manage his emotions, but when they really appeared in front of him, he was willing to face them head-on as well.He had to admit that Pei Tingsong\u2019s indomitable attitude had really influenced him. In the past, in order to preserve himself, he hadn\u2019t spoken out at all, so that he wouldn\u2019t drag any others down into the water for the sake of his future. However, preserving himself and defending himself were the same thing, and no matter how many times he was stabbed in the spine, he would continue refuting the rumors. Fake was fake, and even if no one believed it, even if the cost of refuting those rumors was high, he had to say it.Not shirking away was also a kind of resistance.That night, before going to sleep, he received a message from Pei Tingsong:[A Constant Truth: I\u2019m very honored to collect you, such a precious sample.]Fang Juexia smiled. He always thought himself to be a more low profile person. He didn\u2019t know what part of him could be praised as precious as Pei Tingsong said, so he replied\u2014[Moonlight: I\u2019m just a part of the normal distribution, the most common and the most ordinary sample.]Pei Tingsong did not agree.This world was very crazy, with there being angry people everywhere who took pleasure in attacking others, and the puppets who followed their every step. Anger and violence churned into black water, becoming a torrent impossible to fight against, catching and drowning everyone inside. Someone like Fang Juexia, a mature and logical rebel, was as rare as a real heresy. He leaned on a crutch as he waded against the torrent with his every step firm but also trembling within its depths.Pei Tingsong knew that Fang Juexia wouldn\u2019t easily accept the evaluation he gave him. No matter how much he praised him, Fang Juexia, who was born in negativity, never believed in praise, believing only in his too-sober view of himself.So, he changed his strategy and didn\u2019t try to persuade him any further.[A Constant Truth: Then I also want to be the most common sample, located right next to you. We are two juxtaposed points on the peak of the curve.]They were very small points, but they could face the truth and hypocrisy of the world together.[Moonlight: Okay\u00a0ah.]Stars were very busy, especially stars belonging to small companies. They needed to sacrifice their rest time in order to maintain their exposure, so this break they got was a very hard-earned one for them. Although they still had to continue the job by recording their fixed variety shows, it didn\u2019t really count as being a tight schedule.Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong made plans to go to the practice room to write a song for the new mini album. As they passed by the snack shop downstairs, they bought a lot of stuff that everyone liked to eat and packaged it to-go. Fang Juexia let Pei Tingsong help him carry the bags to the practice room for He Ziyan and the rest. He also took a few of the bags, preparing to give them to Xiao Wen; lately, he had also been working really hard.When he got out of the elevator and came to the staff department on the fifth floor, he found that there weren\u2019t many people working overtime at night. The light at Xiao Wen\u2019s desk was still on, and seeing this made Fang Juexia relieved because he was afraid that he might not catch Xiao Wen for he had left for a meeting.But only when he neared Xiao Wen\u2019s desk did he realize that Xiao Wen was not there. Instead, it was a fresh-faced girl who didn\u2019t look very old.Fang Juexia had a good memory and soon recalled the\u00a0new person\u00a0Xiao Wen had complained about.His eyes swept across the top of the desk, and his attention soon focused on a silver USB stuck into the computer.\u201cAre you the new assistant?\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s voice was calm and composed, but the new person, who had just been called, actually panicked. She bounced up from Xiao Wen\u2019s seat, making the papers land all over the floor. She immediately crouched down and tidied up in a hurry, apologizing constantly.Fang Juexia placed the food they had bought on Xiao Wen\u2019s desk and crouched down to help her neaten things up. \u201cWhy are you this nervous?\u201d He looked at her intern nameplate, which had Wang Lu written on it.\u201cYes\u2026. I\u2019m rather timid,\u201d Wang Lu explained.\u201cYou can\u2019t be timid in this business, you have to get used to walking around at night.\u201d Fang Juexia looked down to collect the documents and found that most of them were schedules of the Kaleido members, combined with Xiao Wen\u2019s work notes.Even after hearing Fang Juexia\u2019s words, the girl could hardly speak up.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d Fang Juexia stood up, put the documents on Xiao Wen\u2019s desk, and said, \u201cOh, by the way, just reminding you, Xiao Wen really doesn\u2019t like other people sitting in his seat. I think the company also assigns interns their own desks, so it\u2019d be better if you used yours in the future\u00a0ba.\u201dFinally, he swept the table with another look, and noticed that the USB in the computer had disappeared.These actions were really suspicious. For so many days, they had all been followed by stalker fans in turn, which meant that there had to be a source leaking of information. If this new assistant was really responsible for this, he must let Cheng Qiang know.Fang Juexia walked to the practice room while pondering on this. At the door, he met Pei Tingsong, who was looking down at his cellphone. His expression didn\u2019t seem very good, as if something had happened. He lightened his footsteps, but Pei Tingsong still noticed him.\u201cYou gave it to Xiao Wen?\u201d Pei Tingsong raised his head, and his expression of displeasure disappeared completely when he saw him. \u201cAs soon as I took the food in, they ate it all. I left you a bowl of preserved egg and lean meat porridge.\u201dFang Juexia nodded. He wanted to tell Cheng Qiang about this matter first, but now he thought of something else.\u201cHave you been looking into the matter regarding the stalker fans recently?\u201d He got\u00a0straight to the point, not beating around the bush at all.Pei Tingsong laughed. \u201cWhy is it I can\u2019t hide anything from you, how did you guess it?\u201d\u201cI heard Xiao Wen say that you asked him to take pictures of some of the stalker fans.\u201d More than that, he always felt that Pei Tingsong was not a person who would only fight back online. He wouldn\u2019t suffer grievances or tolerate any sand in his eyes, so naturally, he would try to find a way to make the other party suffer.Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve found someone to investigate them. They\u2019ll just give them a little lesson, let them know that they can be held legally responsible for what they do.\u201dHe continued, \u201cThese people, most of them come from rich families, and they\u2019re bored to the point of weirdness that they start feeling like they can come into close contact with celebrities. I have to let them know that their behavior will affect their families. If I can\u2019t control them, there\u2019s still their parents, and even the police if that\u2019s not enough.\u201dFortunately, he didn\u2019t really use violence to control violence. Fang Juexia had also somewhat guessed his way of fighting back, so he let out a breath before telling Pei Tingsong about what he had just seen at Xiao Wen\u2019s workstation.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cWhen investigating this intern assistant, we should be able to ferret out a lot of things.\u201dPei Tingsong was quite satisfied. Right then and there, he passed on the information about the intern assistant to the people he had arranged to investigate the matter, asking them to investigate her. They would only get more in fees, not less.\u201cWe\u2019ll tell Qiang Ge about this assistant in a few days. These next few days, don\u2019t make a move, I\u2019ll wait for the net to be drawn in.\u201dAs soon as they entered the practice room, they heard the other members gossiping while practicing dance steps.\u201cI heard that As\u2019 stock has been falling recently.\u201d\u201cNo way\u00a0ba, you didn\u2019t buy shares in our rival company\u00a0ba, Ling Yi?\u201d\u201cHow can I have that kind of spare money\u00a0ah? I just heard from my friends that the top management of Astar has changed again, don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not.\u201dThe group leader saw the last two people come in and clapped his hands. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s practice together\u00a0ba. Isn\u2019t there a song that still needs to be written later?\u201d\u201cOkay\u2014\u201dWho knew if Pei Tingsong\u2019s warning was really effective, but over the next few days, the members ran into fewer stalker fans, and there were no more \u201cregular visitors\u201d downstairs. Both their supporting fans and more loosely affiliated fans called for a boycott of stalker fans online, and because of their voices, the fans were resolute and clear-cut.Although it was difficult to put an end to such things, that didn\u2019t mean that they should be ignored or that they must be treated like this. Even if it was just an online dispute, as long as the subject was discussed, it could wake some people up. They needed to find the source of these participants, and at the same time, let everyone know that this kind of abnormal behavior should be subjected to moral criticism.There was nothing wrong with defending one\u2019s own rights.Under Cheng Qiang\u2019s investigation, the new person was discovered to be a habitual stalker. This time, she had even organized a whole group, and had taken the role of being the leader for the group. She had hidden herself in Star Chart and had sold everyone\u2019s personal information, which included not only Kaleido\u2019s, but also their senior brothers and sisters.Seeing the dismissal notice, a rock in Fang Juexia\u2019s heart was also laid to rest.Finally, he could let himself rest easy.One day, he discovered that the double petaled jasmine on the balcony had sprouted a bud. It was like a baby tooth, a small one, and it was hidden amongst the green branches and leaves very well.It was not until this moment that he realized that summer had really arrived.Summer was the season to be a little lazy. After all, Spring had started its nap and had now gone to sleep, and it wouldn\u2019t wake up again until next year.Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t a person who would go out when he didn\u2019t have work to do. The other members were playing video games in the living room, while he stayed in his room to read the\u00a0Roots of Romanticism\u00a0that he had borrowed from Pei Tingsong before. Back then when he had borrowed it, he had never had enough time to read it entirely, so he had just read a bit. Now when he was reading it, he found himself in a different mood than before. Previously, he had just wanted to understand Pei Tingsong better, but now he wanted to learn more about himself from reading this book.Was he really a romantic? Fang Juexia always doubted that.This book was full of discourses and expressions from the subjects of humanities and social sciences. It wasn\u2019t especially friendly towards someone with Fang Juexia\u2019s scientific background, but fortunately, the text was written well and was very interesting, so he read every word carefully, stopping to think about the content from time to time, with new views appearing in his mind. But as he kept reading, he saw a sentence underlined by Pei Tingsong.[\u201cWhen it comes to the word \u2018freedom,\u2019\u201d\u00a0Fichte\u00a0said, \u201cmy heart immediately opens wide and blooms, and when it comes to the word \u2018necessity\u2019, my heart begins to spasm painfully.\u201d]The main point wasn\u2019t him underlining this, but rather his annotation in English:\u00a0Fichte, you are another me.\u201cNecessity\u201d was also circled by him, and there was another line of illegible English written there. Fang Juexia could only read one or two sentences, and the letters FJX were written there. That probably meant,\u00a0this is Fang Juexia, always saying \u2018obviously\u2019\u00a0and\u00a0\u2018may as well\u2019,\u00a0always taking necessity as the truth.This should be an annotation made by Pei Tingsong while reading a long time ago. After all, the ink from the pen looked a little faded.Fang Juexia found it interesting that Pei Tingsong would have cared about the way he talked so much even back then. It was a great honor for him to be recorded in these annotations by this young master, for his habitual \u201cmathematical\u201d way of speaking.He found a pencil and wrote a sentence on the side.[When FJX refers to freedom, his heart will also blossom. Because the acquisition of freedom is a necessity.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Since he was worried recently, simply reading books wasn\u2019t very effective in meeting his needs, which was why he had secretly ordered a Sudoku book online, for he wanted to learn Fang Juexia\u2019s unique emotion management method.However, just as he got started, he found himself confused and unfocused. At one point, he even wanted to go online to find a tutorial, but unfortunately, his sneaky actions were discovered by He Ziyan.\u201cOh, Sudoku, little philosopher.\u201d He Ziyan was holding the Haagen Dazs ice cream he had bought in his hand, and his headphones were hanging from around his neck.Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t know what he was feeling guilty of, but he covered the Sudoku book with his hand. \u201cAren\u2019t you writing songs? How come you spend hours writing, but then suddenly\u00a0start going out to fish?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t change the subject.\u201d He Ziyan teased him intentionally, \u201cCome, Gege will have a look, how many have you filled out?\u201d\u201cGet up, don\u2019t sit on my bed.\u201d\u201cWow, not only did you learn Sudoku, but also how to maintain cleanliness as well.\u201d He Ziyan grew more energetic the more he teased, and next, he opened the window to shout at the balcony next door, \u201cTeacher Fang, quickly come here and help with some Sudoku.\u201dIn this way, everyone learned that Pei Tingsong was attempting to do a Sudoku puzzle. With the attitude of holding a\u00a0broken pot\u00a0that he was about to throw down again, Pei Tingsong went to Fang Juexia\u2019s room with his Sudoku book. Ling Yi wasn\u2019t there, so it was just the two of them.Fang Juexia had heard what He Ziyan had announced a long time ago. When he turned around to greet Pei Tingsong, his face carried a smile. \u201cYou are doing Sudoku\u00a0ah.\u201d With a smile, he picked up the book in his hand and showed it to Pei Tingsong. \u201cI\u2019m reading this.\u201dWith this, he seemed to be expressing to Pei Tingsong:\u00a0You see, I\u2019m doing the same silly thing as you.His previously slumped down mood was swept away by Fang Juexia\u2019s open and lovely expression. Pei Tingsong put the Sudoku book on the table, and then laid down on Fang Juexia\u2019s bed, looking at him with his eyes as he requested, \u201cTeacher Fang, teach me.\u201d\u201cHow are there any students who, when begging for help, would immediately lay on their teacher\u2019s bed as soon as they arrive.\u201dPei Tingsong raised his eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019m just such a student.\u201dFang Juexia choked. Fearing that Pei Tingsong would continue to tease him on this topic, he could only compromise with himself. \u201cAlright, alright, alright, I\u2019ll teach you.\u201dPei Tingsong, who was still a student, had dyed his silver hair back to a low-key dark brown. Anyway, they were past the publicity period, and he looked a lot more obedient like this.Fang Juexia pulled him up, took a stool, and made him sit properly. One by one, he taught him some of his own tips about how to fill in the Sudoku boxes, explaining things such as explicit number pairs, explicit arrays, and unique solutions, etc. He explained every single one of these very thoroughly.He was very patient and spoke in a gentle voice. He really felt a bit like a teacher. From time to time, he would ask him, \u201cDo you understand this? It\u2019s not actually that hard.\u201dPei Tingsong nodded. Only now had he come to know that Sudoku also contained so many tips and techniques. It also wasn\u2019t that boring when Fang Juexia explained them. On the contrary, he would analyze these techniques and link them back to logic. No wonder many mathematicians in history also carried the title of being philosophers.He looked at Fang Juexia\u2019s serious side profile, unable to help himself from drawing closer.Pei Tingsong wondered if it would be a little blasphemous to kiss him at this time.But he really wanted to kiss him.Pei Tingsong\u2019s thoughts were disturbed by the sudden vibration that came from his cellphone. He looked down and saw that it was his older sister calling, a person who never contacted him in such a proper manner usually.A few days ago, it had been his living-the-high-life mother who had called ten times a day, as if she had finally remembered that she had given birth to a son in her life. Yet, Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t tend to her at all, just skimming through the messages she had sent.Her concern for him was false, but her personal interest was true.Finally, it was now his Jie\u2019s turn. Pei Tingsong knew that her purpose was most likely against that of their mother\u2019s. Although this Jiejie, who was seven years older than him, was usually cold and proud, she at least regarded him as a real person.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you picking up?\u201d Fang Juexia asked.Pei Tingsong thought about it. \u201cIt\u2019s my Jie. If she calls, it\u2019s definitely not for anything good.\u201dFang Juexia knew that his family situation was complicated, and he didn\u2019t want to intervene, but he also saw that Pei Tingsong wasn\u2019t exactly rejecting the idea of picking up the call. It was more like he was playing at throwing a childish temper, so Fang Juexia pushed. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s something big, take the call\u00a0ba.\u201dAfter listening to him say that, Pei Tingsong pursed his lips and picked up the phone. He put on his earphones and stood up, heading out towards the balcony. He crouched in front of the whole green garden raised by Fang Juexia and started talking in English. He reached out to play with the little hibiscus that had grown into a pink cloud in front of him.Fang Juexia sat quietly at the table and continued to read that book he hadn\u2019t finished yet. He didn\u2019t know whether he had been born with a keen sense of hearing or he was too attentive towards Pei Tingsong, but Fang Juexia could detect every small change in his tone.He felt that there was some conflict going on.The call didn\u2019t last very long. Pei Tingsong hung up and kept squatting on the balcony. His eyes moved from the little hibiscus to the\u00a0blue leadwort, and finally fell on the most humble cactus.He pulled the cactus\u2019 pot out of the corner and put it in front of him, staring at it in silence.Fang Juexia went over to him, squatted down beside him, and pretended to make a fuss over something normal. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my cactus, how are the thorns wilting?\u201d\u201cAlright, you.\u201d Pei Tingsong knew that he was teasing him and so directly told him, \u201cJust now my Jie said that that new British boyfriend of my mom\u2019s is a publisher. He\u2019s beating around the bush and wants my mom to give him the copyright to all of my grandfather\u2019s works.\u201dAlthough he said it very simply, Fang Juexia understood the gravity of this matter. \u201cHow is that okay? If the other party is not reliable, what will we do? That\u2019s your grandfather\u2019s\u00a0hard work.\u201d\u201cShe can\u2019t make that decision, because in my grandfather\u2019s will, I am the legal heir to all his works.\u201d At this point, Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help remembering the scene of his grandfather\u2019s death.It had been very chaotic. Everyone\u2019s profit-seeking heart had been exposed in front of a lonely tombstone. He was in the most confused period of his age at only 15 years old. The whole experience had been brutal and manic, pushing his world to the opposite end.He hadn\u2019t wanted an inheritance, he had just wanted his grandfather to live again. Yes, that desire was ridiculous.Pei Tingsong picked up the small watering-can and poured a little water on the cactus. \u201cJust a few days ago, she came to make trouble with me every day, calling me, sending me messages, sending me e-mails, and even said that she would come to see me personally. I ignored her, so she went to my Jie\u2019s place to make trouble. She might have gone crazy.\u201d\u201cMy Jie asked me to take a trip back, break off her idea completely, and sort out the copyrights that have not been managed before, so that my grandfather could also rest at ease.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s brain suddenly slowed down, and he slowly took the watering-can from his hand.It couldn\u2019t be watered anymore, it\u2019d ruin his little cactus.\u201cSo you\u2019re going back to the U.S., right?\u201dPei Tingsong nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll leave after the recording tomorrow. The matter should be handled within a few days.\u201d He rubbed Fang Juexia\u2019s head. \u201cDo you want to come with me?\u201dEven though Fang Juexia really wanted to see the place where Pei Tingsong had grown up, he did not want to do so with such an opportunity. He needed to give Pei Tingsong some space of his own, and not render him unable to deal with his family\u2019s affairs and disputes properly because he was concerned about him.\u201cNext time.\u201d Fang Juexia smiled at him, saying, \u201cI want to go when you have no burdens, just like in your dream.\u201dAlthough he could no longer see the old man, at least it wouldn\u2019t be at an occasion when Pei Tingsong was in a tight corner.Pei Tingsong tilted his head and thought about it. The corner of his mouth curved up, and he asked, \u201cThen will Teacher Fang take me back to Guangzhou?\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t speak, instead he stuck out his pinkie finger towards him.Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t directly stretch out his finger to hook into it. Instead, he took a look behind him, then pulled Fang Juexia over to give him a kiss on his pinkie finger.\u201cWanted to kiss you just now.\u201d He whispered in a low voice, and only then did he hook his finger through Fang Juexia\u2019s, thus reaching an agreement.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgPei Tingsong left the next night, after he finished recording for the variety show. It was a private trip, so it wasn\u2019t convenient for Fang Juexia to see him off. He just returned the\u00a0Roots of Romanticism\u00a0back to him before he left, so that he could look at it when he was bored on the plane.He didn\u2019t know if Pei Tingsong would see the annotation he had secretly written, but this feeling was very good. It seemed that he was chatting with the Pei Tingsong of the past, and it was like the surprise of finding an Easter egg.Back when he and Pei Tingsong hadn\u2019t started doing official fanservice together, besides the work that they had to finish together, he would hardly see him at any other time, and he also didn\u2019t feel anything about it. He spent every day as before, and every day went by very impersonally.After Pei Tingsong moved back, they were together almost every day, with all the other members. Now, just a few days after Pei Tingsong left, Fang Juexia found it hard. He wanted to contact him and wanted to know about his condition on the other side of the ocean, whether people had been giving him a hard time, and whether or not he was eating well.Who would give someone like Pei Tingsong a hard time? This worry of his was a bit superfluous.Later, when he thought about it carefully, he understood that what all this \u2018whether or not\u2019 was, clearly, he just missed him.The time difference was very big, but Pei Tingsong still called him in the morning and at night. Most of the time, Fang Juexia was still in his quilt, having either not gotten up yet or having not fallen asleep yet. After listening to Pei Tingsong for a while, he felt even more that he either couldn\u2019t get up or couldn\u2019t sleep.In order to replenish himself a bit, Fang Juexia resumed his training-devil pace, and practiced dancing along with learning vocal music and lyrical writing every day. Today, when he came in, there were two trainees dancing in the practice room. They were a little afraid of him and moved aside as soon as they saw Fang Juexia.Am I that scary?\u00a0Fang Juexia began to reflect on whether he was too cold in his daily life. At the same time, he also casually watched the little trainees dance. One child fell to the ground and tried to get up smoothly, but he couldn\u2019t get up after several times.\u201cYou\u2019re not putting in enough power here.\u201d Fang Juexia stepped forward and taught him himself, \u201cYour core should be tight. If you\u2019re loose here, you can\u2019t get up.\u201dThe little trainee was flattered. He didn\u2019t expect that the senior of the company who was so popular now would be so approachable. Clearly, he seldom even smiled.Fang Juexia had worked too hard as a trainee. He had made all kinds of mistakes and had summed up his experience, so he had more knowledge to give when teaching others.\u201cRight, you need to practice control. Otherwise, the fixed point won\u2019t look good.\u201cVery good. This turn was more stable than just now.\u201dThese few people unconsciously spent a night in the practice room. It was already very late, and the two children wanted to invite Fang Juexia to eat with them, but he refused, \u201cHow can I make you guys treat me?\u201dThere was no one on the road any more. Watching as the two children left the company from below, Fang Juexia turned to go to the underground parking lot, preparing to drive back to the dormitory.The lights in the parking lot were not bright. The pale white lights directly hit the gray concrete floor, and it was dead silent. Fang Juexia squinted in the direction of his car. Night blindness affected his vision quite a lot, and it took him a great amount of effort before he managed to find his car. Just as he was about to open the door, he suddenly heard the sound of footsteps.That sense of being followed, which he hadn\u2019t felt for a long time now, reappeared.His heart jumped up. Even though his senses were so sensitive, before he got the time to turn around, he was hit hard by someone from behind and slammed into the wall. The back of his waist was in severe pain, and his forehead directly banged against the white wall. For a moment, his head was dizzy, his eyesight dimmed, and his brain filled with fog.This couldn\u2019t be a stalker fan.Fang Juexia\u2019s hands were propped up against the ground, and his brow was wrinkled in pain. At this instant, he vaguely saw a shadow on the wall. It was that of a human figure, who was holding a slender thing in his hand, about to hit him with it again. Fang Juexia skilfully dodged to one side, his instinct making him move faster, after which he turned around.Dang\u2014a steel rod fell to the ground and rolled to his feet.To his surprise, another tall person appeared behind him. He crisply and decisively subdued the man who had just attacked Fang Juexia from behind, who was about to knock him unconscious with a steel stick, and he pressed this attacker against the car.\u201cHello, Mr. Fang. In order to avoid misunderstandings, I\u2019ll explain to\u00a0you\u00a0first.\u201d The tall man said, \u201cI\u2019m the bodyguard arranged by Young Master Pei to accompany you. I\u2019m also the one he entrusted to investigate the issue of you being followed.\u201dUpon hearing Pei Tingsong\u2019s name, Fang Juexia finally felt relieved. His throat was dry and hoarse, containing a trace of the taste of blood.\u201cThis person has been following you for a long time. He kept lingering by your car just now and has now finally been caught. I\u2019m very sorry that he still managed to hurt you a little.\u201dFang Juexia supported the back of his waist and stood up. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dFortunately, Pei Tingsong had found someone to follow him, otherwise he didn\u2019t dare to imagine what would happen after that; he hadn\u2019t expected anyone to be so vicious.\u201cLook, do you recognize this person?\u201d With that, the private bodyguard twisted the ruffian\u2019s arms and pulled them over to face Fang Juexia.Fang Juexia had poor eyesight, so he tried to get closer by taking a step forward.\u201cLet go of me!\u201dHearing this voice, he halted in his steps. His whole person was frozen in place and could not move.He also managed to see that person\u2019s face. This person was much older and as thin as a rake, but he still recognized him.\u201cI told you to let go of me, don\u2019t you understand human words? I\u2019m his dad! See if you dare to touch me!\u201dThroughout his entire life, Fang Juexia would never forget how this person had pointed at his face and the birthmark on his face.As he said with complete certainty\u2014\u00a0you were born to be a failure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was cold-hearted, but he still had fantasies.He had imagined that one day, when he was busy, he would receive a phone call from his mother telling him that his \u201cfather\u201d had returned. Her wait would then finally be rewarded, so every time he received a phone call from his mother, his mood would turn very complicated, being somewhat expectant and also somewhat fearful.He had also imagined that maybe his father would hide within the audience at a future concert. Although Fang Juexia would not be able to see him clearly, maybe he would be down there, listening to him sing and watching him dance.Then, Fang Juexia would think in his heart:\u00a0Dad, you see, I\u2019m not a failure. Even if I can\u2019t see clearly, even if I have a birthmark on my face, I can have a stage.So many fantasies were shattered at this moment.Fang Juexia had never even dreamed that it would be such a miserable reunion.It turned out that the person who had been following him for so many days was not a stalker fan, or a member of the paparazzi, or even a member of his former company that deliberately wanted to pull him down. It was his father.His great father, who knew he suffered from night blindness, had come up to him in the dark underground parking lot while holding a steel rod and brandishing it at the back of his waist.The back of his waist faintly ached, and the pain and shock had emptied Fang Juexia\u2019s mind of all thoughts.He looked at the face in front of him in silence, and it was already far different than the face in his memory. At last, he turned his head coldly and told the private bodyguard, \u201cPlease\u00a0deal with this according to Pei Tingsong\u2019s instructions\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d That person\u2019s professionalism was very high, and without uttering any further words, he immediately readied himself to take this vicious and unrestrained ruffian away, when, unexpectedly, this thin middle-aged man suddenly burst with strength and started struggling desperately, shouting out aloud, \u201cYou conscienceless thing! You don\u2019t even recognize your own father!\u201dHe used extremely ugly words to curse, vomiting all kinds of dirty words. This ruffian possessed no logic, no rules, and was no different from a madman. Fang Juexia didn\u2019t want to listen to him at all, but by the end, the ruffian had even started cursing out his mother.So, Fang Juexia stopped in the middle of turning around, his back freezing for a second. He walked forward, stopped in front of the long steel rod, bent down to pick it up, then turned around and walked towards the madman.When he came to a stand in front of him, Fang Juexia took out his cellphone from his pocket, turned on his flashlight, and aimed it at his aged face.\u201cFang Ping, you\u2019ve been taking drugs, haven\u2019t you?\u201d It was clearly an interrogative sentence, but his tone was clear and he wore a calm look, as if he were stating a fact that had nothing to do with him.The person in front of him seemed to be stunned for a moment, but he couldn\u2019t control his emotions at all. The muscles of his face were twitching, and he looked extremely strange.Fang Juexia nodded and confirmed his judgment. \u201cYou\u2019re addicted to drugs.\u201dBack when Fang Ping had first become addicted to drugs, Fang Juexia had thought that he could be saved. It was said on TV that people could be rehabilitated even if they made a mistake and became addicts, and he had believed it.Even if this person had decided to disappear from their life later, Fang Juexia kept fantasizing that maybe one day, Fang Ping would turn over a new leaf.But as time went by, and as Fang Juexia became more and more rational, he also grew clear on the fact that going completely clean was something that had a very small probability. Most people just made mistakes again and again, never rehabilitating properly. Drug addicts were even more akin to desperate criminals willing to swindle and deceive everyone around them, and they could and would do anything.As Fang Juexia stood in front of him, he realised that he was already taller than Fang Ping. This period of abandonment had pushed him into growing up quickly, and now, when he looked at this man again, he discovered that this person had turned so desperate and incapable, just like a shriveled body drained of all human spirit.Suddenly, Fang Juexia raised the steel rod. At that moment, he saw Fang Ping\u2019s shoulders tremble.He gave a very light sneer. \u201cIsn\u2019t this what you wanted to do to me just now?\u201dHis eyes fell on Fang Ping\u2019s lame leg. Fang Juexia lowered the rod and lightly tapped that leg. Then, without any ups-and-downs in his voice, he asked, \u201cOr did you want to break my leg, to be like you?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d Fang Ping\u2019s body kept trembling, and every word out of his mouth seemed to fall unsteadily. \u201cI didn\u2019t, I just-I just wanted to knock you out\u2026\u201d\u201cKnock me out.\u201d Fang Juexia repeated his words, then continued, \u201cAnd then what, kidnapping? Blackmail? Get a lot of money to buy all the drugs you\u2019ve dreamed of?\u201dFang Ping didn\u2019t speak any more. He also could hardly speak any more, and his trembling legs couldn\u2019t hold him steady. All he could do was let himself be dragged along by the bodyguard, as if he was a dummy sewn out of rags and cotton.The bodyguard opened his mouth to speak. \u201cMr. Fang, the young master has arranged a place, and told me that if I caught someone, to lock them up there and wait for him to come back.\u201d He looked at Fang Ping\u2019s state, which made him unsuitable to linger around here. \u201cHow about, I\u2019ll take him there, and\u00a0you\u00a0go back to rest first.\u201dPeople could come by here at any time, Pei Tingsong had indeed thought things through very thoroughly.\u201cNo need to tell Pei Tingsong,\u201d Fang Juexia said with a dismal smile. \u201cHe already has enough trouble to deal with.\u201dCompared with each other, neither of them was better off.Fang Ping had now fallen into an unconscious state as he came down from his high and was soon taken away by the private bodyguard. Fang Juexia decided to go with him. When Fang Ping woke up, he would interrogate him again. He must find out the whole story.The steel rod in his hand was heavy. Fang Juexia looked down at it. It was so long and heavy that if he had been hit on the head with it, he feared he wouldn\u2019t have just passed out.It seemed as if he was anticipating that sort of dull pain.Throwing the steel rod into the trunk, Fang Juexia sorted out his mood. He was very clear that he couldn\u2019t drive in such a state, he would definitely end up getting into an accident. So he got into the private bodyguard\u2019s car and left the underground parking lot below the company with him.All the way to their destination, Fang Juexia sat in the passenger seat, with his mind in a whirl as he listened to the bound Fang Ping struggling and yelling. He felt a little unreal right now, like this was a dogblood drama, one that was very ugly and very tormenting.The skin on his forehead broke and began to bleed, and the blood tickled a bit as it trickled down to his eyelids. He raised his hand and wiped it off with the back of his hand, continuously looking ahead. He had, plainly, already cultivated himself into a stone, but it turned out that that stone could still feel hurt.The private bodyguard took him to an apartment, threw the tied-up Fang Ping into one of the rooms, and tied him to a single bed, binding him just like one would a beast.\u201cMr. Fang, you can rest for a while. Please call me whenever you need me, I will watch over him.\u201dLike a puppet, Fang Juexia opened his mouth, and with his throat filled with a dull voice, replied, \u201cThank you.\u201d All he wanted right now was a glass of water.After getting a cup of water, he very stubbornly didn\u2019t go to rest. Instead, he came to the room where Fang Ping was locked up, sat at a table less than three meters away from him, and looked at him silently.His throat was dry and itchy. He turned on only the bedside lamp because he didn\u2019t want to see too clearly.All night long, Fang Juexia kept listening to Fang Ping\u2019s screams and roars, like a bystander without any emotions. The kind of loss of control of mind and spirit caused by the illicit drugs was fully and bloodily performed right in front of him. The sheets were torn apart as Fang Ping thrashed and struggled, while his mouth frothed. Under the blessings of his night blindness, this scene blurred, and it seemed much like he was watching someone being burnt alive from a distance; a living man melting into the flames of sin, turning into carbon, ash, and a pool of stinking stagnant water.Finally being reunited after these many years of separation, but it had all been saved up just for this nightmare.Looking at this scene, an untimely set of pictures flashed in Fang Juexia\u2019s mind. They were all of Fang Ping\u2019s high spirited appearance on the stage more than ten years ago as he danced to \u201cCrazy Song\u201d and \u201cImmortal Story\u201d with a beautiful posture, enchanting everyone. With every lift of his legs, his toes were taut straight, and this tight straightness was his pride.During those years, his little self had often looked up at Fang Ping\u2019s figure from below the stage, not even daring to blink out of fear of missing every wonderful moment of his father\u2019s performance.He was a dance maniac, and was only alive when he danced. When he was able to dance, he was so good that he could nourish Fang Juexia with endless love and feelings, letting him feel a warm father\u2019s love, letting him appreciate the charm of the stage, and letting him nourish the greatest fantasy about the stage.Fang Juexia, who had only been about four or five years old, had looked up at his father in the training room and had heard him utter all kinds of heroic words and ambitions.[Dad will definitely be the brightest one on the stage in the future. At that time, you will be able to spot Dad at a glance.]This was clearly the first person to teach him what a dream was.Fang Juexia coldly looked at the man who was already gone crazy in front of him. Suddenly, he felt a fit of nausea. He wanted to vomit, but there was nothing that would come up, so he was only left with the option of drinking water continuously. The cold water ran down his esophagus, and he felt cold all over.The sky brightened, and the night faded from black to dark blue, before finally disappearing. The bound Fang Ping seemed to have survived his withdrawal symptoms for now and had fainted. Fang Juexia stood by the window and quietly looked out at the street that had come back to life. People, looking as small as ants, walked on the road.Ants were very easily trampled to death, so their dreams were even more fragile.His cellphone vibrated several times. It was Ling Yi calling to ask him why he hadn\u2019t returned to the dormitory to sleep. Fang Juexia typed slowly, and he didn\u2019t know what he had replied with.Fang Ping\u2019s voice came from behind him again. His throat was already hoarse, and he was begging Fang Juexia to let him go. He seemed to be very sincerely sorry for his actions and was talking tearfully\u2014\u201cI was wrong, child. I really didn\u2019t want to hurt you. I just wanted to talk to you, but I can\u2019t control myself\u2026\u201cReally, Dad feels so bad, I\u2019m close to death, you know?\u201cDad knows that you are promising now, and that you-you\u2019re successful, and you can help Dad, right?\u201cFor so many years, Dad has missed you very much too\u00a0ah.\u201dDad.That was a far-flung word.Fang Juexia\u2019s emotions were pulling at his reason. Even though he was disgusted by Fang Ping while sympathizing with him emotionally, his reason was still analyzing the truth behind this person\u2019s words, sentence by sentence.He didn\u2019t want to hurt him, but in the end, he had carried an iron rod along to find him.He missed him very much, but he hadn\u2019t returned home for so many years, and just as he had gotten popular, he had started to miss him.Fang Juexia turned his back to him and still looked out of the window. His back was straight like a tree, and every word he uttered was objective and cold. He was more like an interrogator than a son. \u201cWhen did you start following me? Does anyone else know about your return?\u201dFang Ping, in a hoarse voice, rushed to answer the second question, \u201cNo, really, there\u2019s no one.\u201d\u201cAnswer me, when did you start following me?\u201d Fang Juexia repeated his question in a cold and detached manner.\u201cLate April\u2026 I-I, in order to meet you, I spent the last of my money to come to Beijing. Originally, Dad wanted to go back to Guangzhou, but I wanted to see you, child, I\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat drugs did you take before you came here?\u201d Fang Juexia was somewhat relieved to hear that he had not been back to Guangzhou, and he directly interrupted his emotional plea, \u201cWhat did you plan to do to me? What did you want from me?\u201dFang Ping gasped. His whole voice sounded insubstantial, just like that of someone who was seriously ill. \u201cI\u2026. I don\u2019t remember, Juexia\u2026\u201d\u201cYou remember.\u201d Hearing him say his name felt harsh on Fang Juexia\u2019s ears, so he exposed his lie. \u201cTalk, what were you going to do to me?\u201dHis voice was too cold.\u201cI just want to knock you out, because I haven\u2019t been able to find a chance to talk to you alone. I just want to talk to you, to ask you to help me, to help your father!\u201dFang Juexia sneered.\u201cDon\u2019t lie. Do you know what you look like after taking drugs? Have you ever looked in the mirror? If you had swung that rod down, who knows if I would even be able to stand up in front of you after that. Help? How could a corpse help you?\u201dHis questions came out faster and faster, like bullets strafing out.\u201cHave you contacted my company and agent? What about other companies? Who else did you contact? Speak!\u201dFang Ping\u2019s mouth stuttered, his facial muscles trembled, and he simply couldn\u2019t keep up with Fang Juexia\u2019s pace.He had gotten addicted to drugs again. The time he had spent sober was like the last radiance of the sun, a very short amount of time. As soon as he smoked, the body that had struggled to rise up collapsed down again, as his nerves were bitten by maggots. He could say anything and curse out anyone.Right now, none of Fang Ping\u2019s past goodness existed in Fang Juexia\u2019s mind.He remembered Fang Ping\u2019s fury at the hospital when he had learned that he might be disabled for life. He remembered his father\u2019s drunkenness as he had his son as a defective commodity. Fang Ping had casually picked up a chair and smashed it onto Fang Juexia\u2019s back, and his whole spine had turned black and blue. In the summer, when he wore the poor quality white shirt of his school uniform, you could faintly see the bruises.It had seemed as if his clothes were dirty.Fang Ping began to curse him out again. Fang Juexia was unable to distinguish whether the real him was the person who was in the throes of addiction, or was it when he was sober.\u201cGarbage\u201d, \u201cLoser\u201d, \u201cNo one will like something like you!\u201d\u201cWaste\u201d, \u201cDefect\u201d, \u201cNot worthy of standing on a stage\u201d, \u201cFor what reason should you succeed?\u201dThese words were very familiar. Fang Juexia dimly went back to his childhood, when he had been afraid of his father coming back home reeking of alcohol every day. He would dodge the beer bottles that would hit his head at any time, but he hadn\u2019t been able to avoid the ashtray that hit him. It just steadily shattered at his feet, and his toes had bled constantly.Because of this, he couldn\u2019t practice dancing. His feet hurt so much that he couldn\u2019t stand, and when asked by the teacher, he could only lie.He had said it was his own fault.Why couldn\u2019t the positive of human experience offset the negative part of it?The beautiful childhood he had really experienced, and the subsequent shattering that came with it\u2019s collapse, one good and one bad, one positive and one negative, they added up to zero, as if he had never had anything. This was too ideal a situation, while the reality of it was only the doubling of pain upon gaining and then losing something.After struggling desperately, Fang Ping stopped again. He went back and forth just like that, with impermanent fits of madness. When he woke up, he\u2019d start up with his hysterical abuse and screams, and when he passed out, he left him in a terrible silence.Currently, Fang Juexia was like a clean piano lid that was constantly getting stained with dust, filth, and dirty fingerprints.His waist felt very painful, and he couldn\u2019t stand any more. He could only sit on the ground holding his knees as he quietly stared out of the window. The door of the room would open occasionally, and the bodyguard who obeyed Pei Tingsong would deliver food and water to him, but Fang Juexia didn\u2019t even have the strength to thank him.He didn\u2019t dare to close his eyes. As long as he closed his eyes, he could see the original Fang Ping, the Fang Ping who shone with light, the one who was gentle and considerate. He was afraid of recognizing this mad person as him, and was afraid that he would be too soft-hearted.The sky returned to darkness, the clouds turned gray, thunder and lightning resounded and suddenly, rain started falling heavily, with the smell of soil pouring into Fang Juexia\u2019s nose. He felt nauseous again, so while supporting himself against the wall, he stood up and went to the bathroom. However, what took place was just dry-heaving again; he bent down and retched fiercely, as if he wanted to vomit all his internal organs, but nothing came out.Within the mirror, his forehead was bruised and swollen, and there was a scab forming on his broken skin. Fang Juexia went as far as to find it lucky that he didn\u2019t have any jobs lined up recently, otherwise, how would he be able to go on stage and face the camera? As soon as this thought appeared, Fang Juexia felt scared. He had clearly spent so many years affirming to himself that the birthmark on his face was not a flaw of an inferior product, but as soon as this person appeared in his life, those nightmares also reappeared.Those seeds of self doubt that had been left buried in his blood and bones by his own father had only remained dormant for a while.Fang Juexia no longer looked into the mirror. He tried to drive out those negative emotions with his reason, but his whole body was trembling slightly. He needed Sudoku, he needed reason, only with that could he calm down. As long as he could solve some problems and turn his brain around, he should get better.Anxiety climbed into his heart, and Fang Juexia became more and more disoriented.When he came out of the bathroom, he heard the sound of a door closing, and as he followed the sound, he looked up to catch sight of a half-wet person.A hallucination?How was it that it seemed to be Pei Tingsong?As Pei Tingsong looked at Fang Juexia, his heart suddenly ached. Fang Juexia was as pale as a dried-out flower that was stubbornly keeping its original shape, but even a single touch would dissolve it into powder right now. The light in his eyes was completely extinguished, as if he couldn\u2019t see him.He walked up quickly, called out, \u201cJuexia\u201d, and wanted to hold him in his arms. But when he was one step away, he saw Fang Juexia\u2019s lowered eyes, and so he stopped. It seemed that he was afraid that this hug would seem too hasty, and could end up making Fang Juexia even more upset.So Pei Tingsong became hesitant and wanted to retrieve his stretched-out hand back.Fang Juexia slowly raised his hand and touched Pei Tingsong\u2019s chest. It was hot and had a heartbeat.\u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d Only after confirming that it was not an illusion did he say this sentence, acting like a person to whom nothing had happened to recently, one who was just waiting for his lover to return home.He even tried to say the words that he had prepared long ago, and his voice was very calm. \u201c\u2026How are things going over there? Did your mom give up?\u201dPei Tingsong took his hand and looked at the wound on his face. He was both angry and sad, and his heart was wedged with distress. He didn\u2019t answer Fang Juexia\u2019s question. \u201cI rushed back as soon as I heard the news.\u201cHe hit you, didn\u2019t he? Today, I must break his\u2026\u201dFang Juexia shook his head feebly. \u201cHe didn\u2019t succeed.\u201d He was afraid Pei Tingsong would worry and repeated, \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m pretty good.\u201dNaturally, Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t believe him.He had already learned from the bodyguard that Fang Juexia hadn\u2019t closed his eyes all night, and had watched Fang Ping go crazy for the entire night. He didn\u2019t dare even imagine Fang Juexia\u2019s mood at the moment. He just wanted to coax him and take him far away from this scum.\u201cJuexia, will you go back with me first?\u201d His voice was very light, and he raised his hand to touch Fang Juexia\u2019s cheek. \u201cLet\u2019s rest and sleep for a bit. I\u2019ll have professionals deal with this matter, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\u201cSleep?\u201d Fang Juexia seemed to have only heard a few words, and his eyes were confused. He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep here, it\u2019s too dirty.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Pei Tingsong rubbed his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go back, go back to my place, okay?\u201dFang Juexia nodded slightly.In order to facilitate an interrogation, Pei Tingsong had directly arranged a suite in his high-end apartment building. This made it very easy to go back to his place, but it was very difficult to placate Fang Juexia.Fang Juexia was dizzy and uncomfortable. As soon as he entered the apartment, he unconsciously walked to the empty living room. The muggy air left behind by the rain rushed into his nose, clogging up his breath and thoughts, making him uncomfortable, rendering him unable of rational thought. Even Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice seemed to come from a distance, travelling through the patter of the rain, sounding very vague and very powerless.He felt his hand being pulled by Pei Tingsong, felt himself being taken by him towards a room, and all the while he was in a sensitive and slow state.He said he wanted to take a bath. Pei Tingsong wasn\u2019t at ease with this but couldn\u2019t dissuade him. He could only agree and start running hot water into the bathtub. Fang Juexia took off his top with his back to him, and covering the back of his waist was one giant bruise.Pei Tingsong\u2019s fists clenched up tight.Hot water saved his life as it melted the ice frozen on him little by little. Fang Juexia leaned on one side of the bathtub, staring up at the ceiling, which allowed Pei Tingsong to carefully clean the wound on his forehead. When taking a bath, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t say a word, as if he was thinking about something, or was just in a daze.The only time he spoke was when he told Pei Tingsong to leave. He wanted to wash up by himself.Pei Tingsong could only go out and leave a set of clothes out for him to change into after the bath. He was guarding the closed bathroom door from outside, his heart hanging.He regretted returning to the United States at this time, regretted that he hadn\u2019t been with Fang Juexia from the first moment of this encounter. But he also was very clear on the fact that even if he was here, what could he have done.He would have just ended up watching Fang Juexia\u2019s nightmare happen again with his own eyes, that\u2019s all.This person had been willing to be with him only after overcoming all difficulties. Pei Tingsong had finally, with great difficulty, convinced him to try and see, and had persuaded him to come out of the shadows to leave behind the distrust of love created by his own father, and to fall into his own arms.Now, would he regret it?When the bathroom door opened, Fang Juexia came out barefoot wearing Pei Tingsong\u2019s pajamas. He came to Pei Tingsong\u2019s bed carrying hot and humid water vapor around himself. He very deliberately lay on the bed and didn\u2019t let Pei Tingsong urge him any more.\u201cThen you rest.\u201d Pei Tingsong tucked him in, lowered his eyes and lowered his voice. \u201cCall me if you need anything.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgJust as he was about to turn around, Fang Juexia sat up and grabbed his hand, his eyes turning red.\u201cYou\u2019re back, but you haven\u2019t hugged me yet.\u201dAt the moment he heard that, Pei Tingsong suddenly realized that he really was an asshole. He kept saying that he liked Fang Juexia, but he had no confidence in him.He was too worried about whether he could keep his favor, being fragile to the point where if he heard Fang Juexia say one \u201cno\u201d, he would collapse.Pei Tingsong held Fang Juexia in his arms. His nose stung, and he tried to hold back his tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t understand his apology, so he didn\u2019t respond. He just raised his hand and hugged him back, saying with a gentle voice, \u201cYou also didn\u2019t answer my question, how are things over there?\u201dPei Tingsong shook his head, rubbed the back of his neck, and kissed the top of his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Fang Juexia shrank in his arms and closed his eyes.They were just two injured animals, and when they bled, their temperatures lowered, so they had no choice but to embrace each other and survive by using each other\u2019s warmth.Fang Juexia was used to managing his emotions year in and year out, and he was used to overpowering his sensibility with reason, so he couldn\u2019t even be hysterical when he was in pain. All of his bloody and mangled memories and emotions were always separated from him by a piece of ground glass, so they never came in complete or direct contact with his reality.\u201cYou know, sometimes I feel like I\u2019m very dark, too. When I knew that the man who followed and attacked me in the parking lot was him, guess what my first reaction was?\u201dFang Juexia tried to keep his voice steady. \u201cI wanted my mom to come here immediately and see for herself what kind of person she has been waiting for for so many years.\u201dPei Tingsong could hear the despair in his heart.\u201cI stayed with him all night, listening to him go crazy, listening to him curse out me and my mom. Every time, after a while, that idea would pop up in my heart. I even wanted to record him being like this, or take a picture of the steel rod he was going to smash into my head, and send it all to my mom, so that she can wake up a bit and end her fantasy once and for all.\u201dHis emotions, which had been fermenting all this time, finally ripened in Pei Tingsong\u2019s arms and was now on the verge of erupting.\u201cEvery time I wanted to do this, I thought of my mom sitting at the table looking at the door. No matter how sad she was, her face was always full of hope. Just like\u2026\u201dJust like she was waiting for spring every year.He didn\u2019t know what would happen to her if he told her that there would be no spring in the days to come.Thinking of this, Fang Juexia\u2019s tears finally poured down, one big drop falling after another, like stones that couldn\u2019t bear their weight anymore, so they rolled down the iceberg.This was Pei Tingsong\u2019s first time really seeing Fang Juexia cry ever since he had met him. He wasn\u2019t crying for himself, but for his mother\u2019s lost love. A once happily-ever-after story had eventually become a shackle leading to a life-long probation.But even if it was a probation, Fang Juexia still couldn\u2019t bear to break his mother\u2019s fantasy.Probation was at least better than immediate execution.Pei Tingsong stroked Fang Juexia\u2019s cheek and gently kissed away the tears on his face.Fang Juexia looked at him. \u201cWhat do you say? Letting her continue waiting for a lover who already no longer exists, isn\u2019t that\u2026isn\u2019t that cruel?\u201d\u201cWe won\u2019t tell her, we won\u2019t say anything to her.\u201d Pei Tingsong touched his forehead and said, \u201cI will send him to the place where he should go. I won\u2019t let him appear in front of you again, and I won\u2019t let him hurt you again.\u201dFor the first time, he had learned to love someone. For the first time, he had desires of soul and flesh. For the first time, he had learned to give up his resistance, and it was also the first time that he tasted what it was like to feel heartache for others.But while he would rather not have such an experience, he also wanted to make Fang Juexia feel better.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t like that in the past; he also had times when he protected me.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s body trembled in his arms. \u201cHe also used to be like this, hugging me and taking me to the training room so that I could watch him practice basic skills and watch him dance. My mama said that when I was a few months old, I cried a lot. I had to be held by someone every day before I would fall asleep, so he stayed up all night, holding me in his arms and humming his dance music to me. He also boasted that I was the most good-looking child in the world, and he would watch me all night when I had a fever. On the waters of the Pearl River, on that cruise ship, he would let me sit on his shoulders as the river wind blew all around me.\u201dThese were not fake memories, he really had experienced a father\u2019s love once.\u201cBefore he fell down, before I knew about my night-blindness, he said\u2026\u201dHe took a deep breath. \u201cHe said my mama and I were the people he loved the most, and he said I was his pride.\u201cBut in fact, compared to his own pride, I\u2019m nothing, right?\u201dPei Tingsong stroked his hair. \u201cNo, Fang Juexia, you are the best and most precious person in the world.\u201cYou have to remember that failure, alcohol, and drugs, these things have all long corrupted him. He is no longer a normal person. No matter what spiteful words he says, they\u2019re all wrong. Don\u2019t listen to them.\u201dThat\u2019s right. Fang Juexia recited Pei Tingsong\u2019s words in his heart.He wasn\u2019t a normal person, and all the \u201cmissing you\u201d he had uttered were lies.Reuniting after many years apart, Fang Ping still gave him nothing but bruises and wounds.Fang Juexia lay down in Pei Tingsong\u2019s arms and felt his hands caressing his hair and back.Pei Tingsong could feel Fang Juexia\u2019s inner turmoil. It was very mysterious, but he could just feel it. He had been unable to make a decision for so many years, which was why he was suffering so much now. And whenever he saw his father again and suffered from his abuse again, Fang Juexia would be in a lot of personal pain.\u201cIs your heart still troubled? Your father when you were a child, versus the him you met now.\u201dFang Juexia couldn\u2019t deny it.He had continuously persuaded himself, just like his mother, that the man in front of him now wasn\u2019t the person he had been before. The best choice was to let him fend for himself. However, his heart was still in a lot of pain, especially when dreaming of the past, dreaming of when he had been held in his father\u2019s arms and had seen the stage for the first time.Every time he woke up, his face was wet with tears.Pei Tingsong understood his silence. \u201cEveryone in this world is changing all the time, because of various reasons and under various circumstances. Even if we accept this kind of change, it is very difficult to judge whether this person is still the original one or not.\u201dSpeaking of this, he rubbed Fang Juexia\u2019s cheek and asked softly, \u201cHave you ever heard the story of The Ship of Theseus?\u201dFang Juexia shook his head as he reigned in his emotions. \u201cIt\u2019s another philosophical paradox?\u201d\u201cYou guessed it.\u201d Pei Tingsong held his hand. \u201cThis is a very old thought experiment. Suppose there is a ship, and as long as people keep repairing and replacing its parts, it can always keep sailing. Whenever any part of the deck rots, or any part of the canvas is damaged, it will be replaced with a new one. In this way, hundreds of years later, the Ship of Theseus will no longer have any of its original parts. Then, is it still the original one?\u201dFang Juexia considered it, and two answers debated in his mind. With the continuous replacement of parts and renewal of the ship, it had already lost any parts belonging to the past, and then everything of the past ship.But all of these were gradually lost, and it had not been changed directly into a new ship. It was still called\u00a0Theseus, and still sailed like before on the seas all the time.After serious consideration, Fang Juexia opened his mouth and tried to give his own answer, \u201cThis question depends on how we define this ship, right?\u201dPei Tingsong nodded and got closer. The tip of his nose touched Fang Juexia\u2019s. \u201cJuexia, do you remember? You actually already have a definition.\u201cYou said that the essence of a person is the self he tries the hardest to preserve.\u201dFang Juexia nodded, and tears brimmed up in his eyes, as he awakened to the truth after his painful struggle.Fang Ping had long ago lost the self he had once tried so hard to preserve.He tried to tell Pei Tingsong his answer, \u201cSo\u2026 He\u2019s already not the him from before.\u201dHe was also no longer that father who had once whole-heartedly loved him.Pei Tingsong knew this kind of pain because he had also experienced it. It was really hard to admit that his parents didn\u2019t love him, but illusory delusions would only hurt him.\u201cJust let the ship from the past stay in your heart. It has no material form, it will always exist and never change.\u201dThe tears he had held back fell once again. Yes, in any case, he had to admit that his father, the one from before, had long disappeared, and he had actually disappeared from the moment when he could no longer stand up after falling on the stage.That fall had smashed his \u2018self\u2019 completely, so much so that he couldn\u2019t save it at all.It was really hard for Fang Juexia to admit to himself that he was no longer loved. For so many years, he had been avoiding it and had been unwilling to face it, so much so that his father who loved him in the past and this madman now overlapped into a single shadow, which caused him to be more afraid when he walked in the already frightening darkness.He was afraid that he would lose control and be swallowed up by this shadow, so he would try his best to keep his senses about him and remain clear-headed at every moment. This kind of fear made him reject being loved by others while also refusing to love others.Because he didn\u2019t want to create any more nightmares for himself.Pei Tingsong\u2019s face was close at hand, and they were right next to each other. Fang Juexia finally came out of that paranoid \u201cclear-headedness\u201d, and really woke up this time.He admitted that he was wrong.When surrounded by malice, he subconsciously thought that what he needed was a Sudoku book, in order to roughly divert his attention and emotions through logical reasoning. Only now did he discover how crude this form of emotional distraction was.He just needed love, that was all.Fang Juexia never thought that the cocoon he had woven to shield himself from his pain for so many years would be so easily untied by Pei Tingsong. Even just a few moments ago, he had almost subconsciously pushed Pei Tingsong away. He thought he could digest this disaster himself.It suddenly occurred to him that when he had just laid on the bed, Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes had looked lost. It seemed that he had wanted to leave Fang Juexia quietly alone.Fang Juexia changed his perspective. Maybe, Pei Tingsong was afraid that after seeing Fang Ping\u2019s bleak appearance, he would regret throwing himself into a love affair with him\u00a0ba.If it was the him from before, he might have done so. Because he was too scared.\u201cTingsong.\u201d Fang Juexia spoke softly and called out his name, \u201cThank you.\u201dPei Tingsong smiled and felt that his heartache had been relieved a lot. It should be him who should\u00a0 thank Fang Juexia, since he was the one who had saved him.\u201cI know there are many, many failed cases in the world.\u201d Fang Juexia raised his hand and lightly put it on Pei Tingsong\u2019s cheek. The rain outside the window seemed to have grown a bit softer, and the sound also grew softer.\u201cBut I have never doubted the existence of true love.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes were firm, and his eyebrows were raised. It was as if he was saying\u2014\u00a0Look, Fang Juexia is once again talking about that \u201cexistence\u201d that makes your head hurt.And Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart indeed convulsed because of his \u201cexistence\u201d.\u201cBesides, I\u2019m also changing. I\u2019m also trying to calculate the probability of success right now, really.\u201d Fang Juexia knew that his head was a bit muddled right now, but he hoped that Pei Tingsong could understand his heart. \u201cSo don\u2019t be afraid that I will give up, I\u2019m not a coward.\u201d\u201cEn, I know you\u2019re very brave.\u201d Pei Tingsong kissed him on the tip of his nose extremely gently. \u201cIt was me who was worried about losing your favor, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s changed.\u201dIn the past, Pei Tingsong was confident about everything, and it seemed that there was no place he could not go to or anything he couldn\u2019t do in the world. He could easily step into many forests and live all the kinds of life he wanted to. He was free and fearless.Until he fell in love with Fang Juexia.His perversity was wrapped by Fang Juexia\u2019s tenderness, and he finally realized what it was like to be afraid of losing something. Now, he was already rendered incapable of fighting for the probability of success on every little thing, and he had begun to think about the consequences of failure.Pei Tingsong was really very scared that Fang Juexia would one day tell him\u2014I picked the wrong point, and you are still an irrational number.Even though he had clearly just cried, Fang Juexia looked at Pei Tingsong\u2019s upset face right now and smiled unconsciously. It was his first smile ever since he had laid eyes on Fang Ping.\u201cWe\u2019re becoming more and more alike, how strange.\u201dLooking at him was like looking at himself, the opposition and unity of symbiosis caught in a mirror image.Pei Tingsong hugged him tightly and kissed the side of his neck.\u201cIt\u2019s not strange. We are two Ships of Theseus sailing on the sea. We met by accident and became afraid of separating, so you gave me your parts, and I gave you my parts. We are no longer what we used to be.\u201cWe became each other.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He could even smell the scent of salty water and damp wood.Nestled in the hollow of Pei Tingsong\u2019s shoulder, in a way that displayed his full reliance on him, he sniffed and asked softly, \u201cBut we haven\u2019t replaced our parts with new parts. Even with all the changes, there are parts that are still old, so we may not be able to sail for hundreds of years.\u201d\u201cDo you want to become an immortal?\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s voice finally had a smile in it, and he gently touched Fang Juexia\u2019s back with the palm of his hand. Clearly, he was the younger one, he was still behaving like a person coaxing a child. \u201cOld parts are old parts, and we can rot together. Maybe on a calm day, we will sink to the bottom of the sea together and become two sets of remains, just like how dead whales sink slowly\u2026\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s nose stung again. \u201cI like the end of this story.\u201dPei Tingsong smiled at him. \u201cI like it, too.\u201dMaybe one day, some people would dive into the deep sea and discover their existence. They would then uncover the story of how they used to ride the wind and waves side by side together, and they may even realize that every inch of the rotten parts on them actually came from each other.Two completely different Ships of Theseus became each other\u2019s remains and were eventually buried at sea forever.Fang Juexia knew that it might have been a very stupid and risky thing to choose to explain himself just as he had accepted the complete breakdown of his fantasies, but he had really wanted Pei Tingsong to know.Without Pei Tingsong, Fang Juexia could not imagine his own state at this time.He would have definitely been swallowed by the darkness.\u201cI love you.\u201d He let go and looked into Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes. \u201cI love you very much, Pei Tingsong.\u201dPei Tingsong was stunned.This was the first time he had heard Fang Juexia solemnly say the word \u2018love\u2019 to him. He had always thought that they were still at the \u2018like\u2019 phase, especially Fang Juexia. He had never dared to ask for too much emotion from this person; he knew it was very hard for him. Therefore, Pei Tingsong was always afraid of crossing that boundary, was always afraid that his own too-strong feelings would force him into a retreat.But Fang Juexia was so brave that he even took the lead to say these words first.Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes were clear, and although there were wounds on his face, he still looked so beautiful. The red birthmark at the corner of his eye was even more beautiful than any flower\u2019s petals. Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help kissing there as he whispered, \u201cI love you, too. I love you even more than you can imagine.\u201dPei Tingsong had read countless books, and there were all kinds of love in these books. He had tasted them all, but those words had never become real emotions. Words were just words, and they only lived on paper. It wasn\u2019t until he met Fang Juexia that he realized that he could love someone like this.And in loving this rebel, he would automatically become his armor.\u201cThank you.\u201d Fang Juexia took the initiative to press against him and kiss his lips, then quickly released him, his eyes soft and open.Pei Tingsong\u2019s eyes also stung. In order to hide his emotions, he smiled again, looking a bit childish. \u201cYou really, I\u2019ve even imagined the scene of me telling you \u2018I love you\u2019 first many times. It should have been especially romantic, but you beat me to it.\u201dThis sudden \u201caccusation\u201d made Fang Juexia a little confused. \u201cThat\u2026. You didn\u2019t discuss that with me\u00a0ah.\u201dDiscuss?Pei Tingsong felt this was even more funny. How could this guy be this serious? \u201cIt\u2019s more than that, I have never seen you cry before, and I thought that when you would cry in front of me for the first time, it would be because of me.\u201d He lowered his head and bit the tip of Fang Juexia\u2019s nose. \u201cYet as a result, this idea has also been dashed to pieces.\u201dThinking that he had been shedding tears the entire time just now, Fang Juexia was a little embarrassed. He lowered his eyes and muttered, \u201cWhat\u2019s so good about crying\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s good.\u201d Pei Tingsong gently kissed his eyebrows and eyes. \u201cYou also look good when you cry. You look good doing anything.\u201dYoung people\u2019s love was always reckless, they eagerly proffered it up in front of you, for fear that you would turn a blind eye.Pei Tingsong frowned slightly again. \u201cBut if you really do cry, I will feel very bad. My chest gets especially painful, and I\u2019m not afraid of your jokes, I have never felt so bad before. When I received the message from the bodyguard and knew that it was your father who was following you around, my hands started shaking. Even with such hot weather, I still trembled.\u201d Pei Tingsong took a deep breath and continued, \u201cAnd San Francisco is so far away from Beijing\u00a0ah.\u201dHis words were full of complaints, and the ending sound was a childish whine. Fang Juexia could almost imagine how frantic this irascible guy must have gotten at the time, and couldn\u2019t help laughing.Pei Tingsong was still immersed in recounting his own emotions. \u201cI was really both scared and suffering, scared that upon my return, you would be in despair because of your father\u2019s situation, and scared that you suddenly wouldn\u2019t want me anymore.\u201dFang Juexia hugged him and rubbed from the back of his neck to the back of his waist, just as if he were comforting a big dog. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Pei Tingsong said to him, \u201cI won\u2019t let you face it alone. I also won\u2019t let him show up in front of you again.\u201d He looked at Fang Juexia solemnly. \u201cWhen you were taking a bath, I already had him sent to a compulsory drug treatment center. To be honest, I really hate that I can\u2019t kill him and have him disappear from the world, but I know that if you were given the choice, you wouldn\u2019t want to do that.\u201dFang Juexia looked at him in silence, and his eyes had already given him a positive reply.A rehabilitation center was indeed the best destination. He had already accepted the fact that Fang Ping was no longer his father, but he still wanted to give him a chance to be a person.\u201cIf he really can be rehabilitated, it depends on his nature. If he can\u2019t be rehabilitated, then he will stay there for the rest of his life, so as to prevent him from doing anything more extreme.\u201dPei Tingsong finished talking and lightly put his hand on the back of Fang Juexia\u2019s waist. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201dFang Juexia said it didn\u2019t hurt, but Pei Tingsong wore an expression of disbelief, so he whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit painful, but it didn\u2019t harm my bones, so it will be okay soon.\u201dEven if that person really gave Fang Juexia life, and had been warm towards him when he was young, Pei Tingsong just couldn\u2019t accept him hurting the person he liked the most in such a way.It seemed that his senses no longer belonged to him, but had all already been transferred over from Fang Juexia. If Fang Juexia cried, his heart would ache. If Fang Juexia got hurt, he would hurt even more.\u201cNever again.\u201d Pei Tingsong gently stroked his bruise and said, \u201cDon\u2019t cry anymore either, whenever you cry, my heart feels like it\u2019s about to break.\u201dFang Juexia nodded, and the corners of his mouth rose slightly.\u201cIt\u2019s better when you smile.\u201d He flicked the strands of hair on Fang Juexia\u2019s forehead. \u201cOur Juexia looks so good when he smiles.\u201dFang Juexia had never felt so lucky. This word had always stayed far away from his life, so he kept on walking forward, constantly convincing himself that there must be an exit ahead, and that all his efforts would definitely receive a response.He still didn\u2019t know if there would be a response at the exit ahead, but he had met Pei Tingsong en route.This was the luckiest thing that had ever happened to him.The tip of his nose was a little itchy. Fang Juexia rubbed it against Pei Tingsong\u2019s chin, then slowly opened his mouth, \u201cIt\u2019s already the 15th today. You\u2019ve been gone for six days.\u201d Then he glanced up at the clock on the wall and said, \u201cThe calculation isn\u2019t very accurate, but if you calculate based on the present time, you have been gone for six days and ten hours.\u201dIt had really been too long, so long that by this point, his little internal clock had broken down. A second in reality hated the fact that it couldn\u2019t last for a minute in his heart.But Pei Tingsong had come back before the first thunderstorm of the summer.And just in time too, so he didn\u2019t get drenched in the rain.\u201cDid you miss me?\u201dHearing his low voice, Fang Juexia nodded slightly. \u201cEn.\u201d Then he added, \u201cAnd I worried about you every day.\u201dFang Juexia had never seen what a real rich family looked like, he had only seen their portrayal on TV; it seemed that they were all complicated and full of conspiracies. Fang Juexia disliked complicated things, and he was also afraid that Pei Tingsong would be bullied by some crafty guys, that his mother would say many things that would hurt him, and that Pei Tingsong wouldn\u2019t be able to control his emotions and get fooled by others.These days, his heart had been in a wretched state, and he hadn\u2019t been able to do anything well. He had been as sickly as a seedling that lacked water.\u201cI was just afraid of you being worried. It\u2019s not enough to call you every day\u00a0ah.\u201dFang Juexia leaned into Pei Tingsong\u2019s arms sweetly. \u201cOnly when I see you can I feel at ease. I was afraid that you\u2019d deceive me and say that you\u2019re doing quite well, when in fact, you\u2019re not fine at all. You\u2019re stuck listening to your mother\u2019s nonsense, and you would get angry with her.\u201dWhat he said was exactly what had really happened, which made Pei Tingsong want to laugh.\u201cJuexia.\u201dFang Juexia liked to hear Pei Tingsong call him this way. Although other people also called him by this name, Pei Tingsong seldom did. Every time these two syllables came out of his mouth, Fang Juexia felt cared for. Pei Tingsong\u2019s palms were dry and broad, and they felt really good as they stroked against his cheek. \u201cThis time when I went back and saw my mother, guess what my first reaction was?\u201dFang Juexia shook his head. He couldn\u2019t imagine that scene, and even if he imagined something, he didn\u2019t dare to say it out loud.\u201cSo it turns out, she looks like this\u00a0ah.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s hand grasped the fabric at Pei Tingsong\u2019s waist and held it tightly.\u2014He couldn\u2019t even remember what his own mother looked like.\u201cLike what?\u201d Fang Juexia asked, closing his eyes.\u201cHow to say\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong tried to describe her, \u201cShe was wearing a red sleeveless dress with a string of black pearls around her neck. They were very big pearls, but they couldn\u2019t cover the lines on her neck, yet her face was flat without any wrinkles and was bulging a bit, which was different from when I had seen her when I was a child. She was a lot uglier.\u201dHe was very straightforward, describing his mother as if she was a middle-aged woman who was a stranger to him.\u201cAs soon as she saw me, she opened her arms to hug me and called out, \u2018Song\u2019, as if we were a very close mother and son pair. But I already don\u2019t remember how old I was when I last saw her.\u201dFang Juexia was a bit distressed. \u201cThen when you were a child, didn\u2019t you miss your mother?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only when you have a mother that you will miss your mother,\u201d Pei Tingsong replied.Fang Juexia mulled over this sentence repeatedly in his heart, and it seemed especially bitter.\u201cI remember when I was four years old\u00a0ba, she made a rare visit. It was my grandfather\u2019s birthday, and on that day, she was wearing a black dress and standing beside a very tall man, one of her boyfriends. My grandfather asked me to go up to her and greet her. I went over there, but I didn\u2019t say anything, just kept looking up at her. \u201cJust by listening to him, a picture had already started to appear in front of Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes. When he thought about such a small child, he felt that he must have been very well-behaved and very pitiful.\u201cHer boyfriend was French and spoke with a strong accent.\u201d Pei Tingsong could still imitate his awkward tone, \u201cWho is this little guy?\u201d\u201c\u2018Oh, this is my nephew,\u2019 my mom said.\u201d Pei Tingsong laughed. \u201cSo, at that time, I said hello to that man in French, and then went back to my grandfather.\u201dFang Juexia couldn\u2019t imagine a mother who wouldn\u2019t even acknowledge her own child. He became very angry suddenly, despite the fact that he very rarely got angry. \u201cHow could she be like this to you? It\u2019s too much.\u201dHe spoke those last three words very heavily, and Pei Tingsong thought it was a little cute. He raised his hand and rubbed at Fang Juexia\u2019s furrowed eyebrows.Sensing that his face was a little cold, Pei Tingsong turned up the air conditioner two degrees higher and held his hand. \u201cShe explained it later, in front of my grandfather. She said that she really loved the man, but he didn\u2019t like children very much. So, in order not to cause trouble, she had just said that.\u201dTo her, it was just a harmless little lie.\u201cWhen you think about it that way, she hasn\u2019t actually changed.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgFor her, he had been and would always be a tool she could take out to please others at any time.Fang Juexia raised his head and gently pressed a kiss on his chin to comfort him. Pei Tingsong actually wasn\u2019t so sad; this memory had long become a painless one, and didn\u2019t really bother him anymore.\u201cYou don\u2019t know, as soon as she saw me this time, she said that she missed me. I told her to stop acting and said, \u2018I know you just wanted to take away the legacy that my grandfather left me.\u2019 She replied, \u2018No, baby, you misunderstood. He\u2019s just re-publishing the works, he won\u2019t really steal your stuff. Mama still loves you.\u2019\u201dHe imitated his mother\u2019s tone, speaking with an affectionate feel and saying intimate words. Then slowly, the expression on Pei Tingsong\u2019s face cooled down and gradually became impassive.\u201cYou see, in order to achieve her goal, she can utter an out-and-out lie.\u201d Pei Tingsong laughed. \u201cPeople are people. The title of parents can\u2019t make them great, and they can even turn around and tarnish the title instead.\u201dFang Juexia, unwilling to see him sad, stroked his back. He didn\u2019t know what he should say, and it seemed that saying anything was useless. Pei Tingsong had never felt a father\u2019s love or mother\u2019s love; this wasn\u2019t something difficult for ordinary children to obtain, but he had never had them for even a moment.He thought that, fortunately, Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t grow up in China, and he wasn\u2019t required to write essays like \u201cMy Father\u201d or \u201cMy Mother\u201d in every composition class, or even read them in public.He could even imagine such a scene in front of him. A tiny Pei Tingsong holding a blank paper in his little hands, with only the title scribbled on it, and nothing else.How could such a young child naturally accept the fact that he was not loved by his parents and then turn around and comfort him?Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help it as a few tears fell down again.It was dark outside the window, the rain had stopped\u00a0 a long time back, and a thread of red twilight twinkled in the gray sky. Pei Tingsong looked up and felt that the light was very similar to the birthmark on Fang Juexia\u2019s face.Only when he looked down at his lover did he discover that he was crying again.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? I\u2019m fine, really.\u201d Pei Tingsong kissed his birthmark and his eyes. His lips were stained with tears as he pecked his lips twice. \u201cI\u2019m not sad at all. So this time when I went back, it was just to take care of business. I\u2019m an adult now, and I\u2019ve arranged all of my inheritance. She has no way to take anything from me now. My Jie also prevented her from contacting me and threatened her that if she harassed me or her again, her boyfriend\u2019s publishing business would not be able to go on well.\u201d\u201cYour Jiejie is very kind to you.\u201d Fang Juexia rubbed his eyes and said, \u201cShe helps you every time. You have to be nicer to her in the future.\u201dPei Tingsong laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re right, everything you said is right.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re very similar. You\u2019re all a little strange, but you\u2019re both kind people.\u201d\u201cYou clearly haven\u2019t even met her.\u201dFang Juexia opened his eyes a little, and with a little bit of a grumble in his voice, insisted, \u201cBut I know.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright, you know. You know everything.\u201d Pei Tingsong smiled helplessly, but then heard Fang Juexia say to him\u2014\u201cPei Tingsong, you also look very good when you smile.\u201dThis was the first time Fang Juexia had praised him as good-looking. Pei Tingsong first thought that Fang Juexia was being very cute and wanted to laugh. He also felt that it was strange; sometimes when he looked at Fang Juexia, it was like he was looking at a child, when clearly, this was a person who was already this old and older than himself. But sometimes, he felt that he also became a child in Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes, because he always showed a magnanimous and doting smile towards him.Without waiting for his reply, Fang Juexia then said, \u201cI love you very much, and I will make up a lot of love to you, which will be more than your mom and dad\u2019s love added up, okay?\u201dHis voice was so soft, and his words were childish. How could one add, subtract, multiply, and divide love?But Pei Tingsong knew that he was sincere. Fang Juexia was the person who loved to calculate things in this world the most. What he calculated must be correct, and it would be more than the affection of all the other people all summed up.\u201cOkay.\u201dFang Juexia lay in his arms and said that he still wanted to hear about his childhood. Pei Tingsong chose some pleasant things to talk about, for example, when he went fishing for rainbow trout by the lake with his grandfather, and then how the fish was put into the pool and died. Also, for example, when he messed up his Jie\u2019s birthday party and also stole her first car.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t speak too much during this; he was tired and soon fell asleep, breathing heavily, his chest rising and falling slowly. Yet, his hand still held onto Pei Tingsong\u2019s clothes, his tight grip not loosening at all.Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t continue, just looking at Fang Juexia\u2019s sleeping face quietly.Clearly, he was also a person who hadn\u2019t gotten much affection, but he was whole-heartedly thinking about making it up for him.Really, he was a strange person.Only once Fang Juexia was sound asleep did Pei Tingsong get up and leave the room with his cellphone. He went to the living room and made a phone call to the private bodyguard from before to confirm the progress of the matter. He continuously kept feeling ill at ease, and arranged for several more people to keep an eye on this issue. After that, he called Cheng Qiang and told him that he had already returned, but he had caught the flu. He also said that Fang Juexia had agreed to take care of him and that he might not return to the dormitory these next few days for fear of infecting others.Cheng Qiang also very rarely got to rest, and he didn\u2019t probe too much, just telling him to take good care of himself. Pei Tingsong nodded in response, hung up the phone, took a bath, changed into clean clothes before going back to bed and falling asleep while holding onto Fang Juexia, who loved to be clean the most.He finally fell asleep, and then even had a dream.In his dream, he had become short and small, and was wearing a very expensive but uncomfortable little suit. The dream was full of people, and they were all dancing and eating. A sense of familiarity drifted forward; he had returned to the day of his grandfather\u2019s birthday.Pei Tingsong tried to find his grandfather\u2019s whereabouts, but when he raised his foot, he saw a beautiful woman calling out his name, and also calling him \u2018baby\u2019. Very disgusted by this, he ran in the other direction, running out of the house. It was dark outside, and he ran to the garden full of yellow roses and hid behind the bushes.This scene overlapped with his memory.He remembered that he had just hid here in the bushes all alone, thinking about the difference between a nephew and a son, until a servant had found him and taken him back.There was a sound in the grass. The little Pei Tingsong in the dream was a little on guard, and he wanted to know whether it was a squirrel or the servant looking for him.But as soon as he looked up, he saw a beautiful child, who was taller than him and was wearing the most common clothes, but he was very good-looking, with a pink birthmark at the corner of his eye. It seemed that he couldn\u2019t see, so he stretched his arm out to fumble forward, slowly arriving at his side step-by-step.He couldn\u2019t see, but he still managed to find the hiding Pei Tingsong.Only after he drew closer did Pei Tingsong discover that his left leg was in a plaster cast, he was on crutches, and his arm was bruised.\u201cDid you come to wish my grandfather a happy birthday, too?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked.The child shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m here for you.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cYou want to be friends with me, don\u2019t you?\u201dHe nodded. \u201cEn.\u201d\u201cHow old are you?\u201d Pei Tingsong answered first for himself, \u201cI\u2019m four years old this year.\u201d\u201cSeven years old.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re older than me, I have to call you Gege.\u201d Pei Tingsong said, \u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201dHe nodded. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that I couldn\u2019t see, so I fell down. Later, the doctor told me that I can\u2019t see anything when it\u2019s dark.\u201d\u201cBut you still came to find me.\u201d Little Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t understand. \u201cYour leg is broken, and it\u2019s so dark, but you still came to find me.\u201dUnexpectedly, that beautiful Gege turned to smile at him. \u201cI wanted to come.\u201cI promised to make it up to you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 86Chapter 86 \u2013 Ordinary LoveTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksWarm dependenceWhen Pei Tingsong woke up and unexpectedly found that he had shed some tears, he felt very disgraced. They had changed their sleeping posture when asleep, and had gone from embracing each other face to face, to him embracing Fang Juexia from behind, with one of his arms stretched under his neck.They were like two inseparable petals in a bud, stuck tightly close together.Fang Juexia was still sleeping heavily, so Pei Tingsong gently pulled out his embrace, making sure not to wake him up. After getting out of bed, Pei Tingsong wiped at the little damp spot on his pillow. After a while, he just turned the pillow over and hid it, pretending that nothing happened.He was hungry, for he couldn\u2019t eat anything on the plane while returning, but the apartment was as empty of food as his stomach, so he changed his clothes, put on his hat and mask, and went downstairs by himself. After sleeping for two or three hours, as the evening dusk transitioned into night, he realized that all the supermarkets were closed now, so he had to go to the convenience store to buy something.Pei Tingsong had grown up with almost no idea of how to take care of others; it had always been other people who took care of him. Some people took care of him because they loved him, such as his grandfather, while others took care of him because it was their job.But as soon as he stepped into the convenience store, his head was filled with thoughts of Fang Juexia. When he went to the snack area, he thought\u2014\u00a0what does Fang Juexia like to eat? He seems to like candy.\u00a0So he picked out many kinds of candy, especially the fast-selling candy with a \u2018Hot\u2019 note stuck on it, and tossed them all into his basket.And there was also Wangzai Milk, which he used to feel was cloying as soon as it was mentioned, and which he now basically picked as soon as he saw it.There were no fresh fruits and vegetables in the convenience store, so Pei Tingsong could only buy some salad and\u00a0oden. When checking out, the cashier said, \u201cYou can take a look at our summer limited edition\u00a0oh, it\u2019s a coffee smoothie, very delicious.\u201d\u201cIf I drink coffee at night, I can\u2019t sleep\u00a0ba,\u201d Pei Tingsong replied casually.\u201cAh\u2026that\u2019s true.\u201d The cashier laughed awkwardly and continued billing the items. However, Pei Tingsong suddenly spoke up, \u201cI want two cups, please help me fill them.\u201dHe didn\u2019t even know what the time was when he had woken up, and he definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep anymore.He came out from the convenience store carrying a big bag of snacks, and noticed that the store next door was a florist. He had never realized that there was a florist here even though clearly, he had lived here for so long.The proprietress was arranging flowers inside the store. Her careful and serious appearance reminded him of Fang Juexia; he would squat on his small balcony every day, and sometimes stayed there all afternoon. He obviously loved to be clean, but for the sake of his little flowers, he would tolerate getting his hands often covered in dirt, and he would then often wash them for more than ten minutes.After seeing the tall boy stand at the door for a long time, the proprietress couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cDo you want to buy flowers?\u201dPei Tingsong didn\u2019t have this idea at first, but he nodded once he saw that there seemed to be a eustoma in the middle of the bouquet that the proprietress was holding.\u201cWhat do you want to buy? Do you need a recommendation?\u201d The proprietress was a middle-aged woman who spoke quietly. She asked him questions while tidying up the arrangement in her hands. \u201cIs it a gift?\u201dShe didn\u2019t look like someone who would recognize him, or maybe Pei Tingsong was really wrapped up too well.\u201cEn.\u201d Pei Tingsong came in and stared at that arrangement.\u201cOne look, and I can tell it\u2019s for your girlfriend. How about roses? This season\u2019s roses and pink dahlias are very beautiful, oh, and jasmine.\u201dPei Tingsong shook his head and pointed. \u201cI want this one, the white eustoma, a big bunch of them.\u201d\u201cYou like this one\u00a0ah.\u201d The proprietress gladly took out some fresh eustoma. Only when it got to the point that she almost couldn\u2019t hold onto them anymore did Pei Tingsong say it was enough.\u201cThis flower is very good, beautiful, and has a strong vitality. It can continue blooming for more than ten days when it is put into the water. It\u2019s not delicate at all.\u201dIt really was beautiful and not delicate; it was Fang Juexia.\u201cI\u2019ll tie a bow around it for you, your girlfriend will love it.\u201dPei Tingsong, who had already paid, stopped the proprietress\u2019 actions mid-way. \u201cNo need, just like this\u00a0ba. My boyfriend can do it when I get back.\u201dWith that, he walked away carrying a big bunch of eustoma that could bury him, leaving behind a confused proprietress who still hadn\u2019t processed everything, wondering whether it was a boyfriend or a girlfriend.There was also an old woman selling vegetables on the street, and she was sitting on the ground. There weren\u2019t many vegetables left, with only a few tomatoes,\u00a0sponge gourds, and some leftover vegetables now available. Pei Tingsong originally walked past her, but then he turned around and bought all the old woman\u2019s vegetables while also urging her to go home quickly.By the time he got in the elevator, Pei Tingsong was exhausted. He put everything on the floor of the elevator except the bunch of flowers, which he continued to hold onto seriously.Once back home, he put everything down, then changed into his slippers before heading straight to the bedroom. Sure enough, Fang Juexia was still sleeping, but when he heard the sound of movement, he seemed to wake up. He raised his head with his eyes half-open, looking like a baby chick falling in the clouds, indistinct.In a trance, Pei Tingsong forgot that he and Fang Juexia were bandmates in a boyband, and forgot the dazzling stage and spotlight that their lives circled around. Right now, they were just like the most ordinary couple in the city, living and falling in love in an ordinary way, and their daily life was filled with fireworks.\u201cWoke up?\u201d Pei Tingsong went over and lay down in front of him. He gave him a kiss on his left cheek and then another kiss on his right cheek. Fang Juexia snorted, stretched out his arms lazily, made a small circle in the air, and lastly put his hands on Pei Tingsong\u2019s shoulders. Pei Tingsong had brought back a slight smell of rain mixed with the smell of sage on his clothes, very summer-like.\u201cYou went out.\u201d He rubbed his eyes. \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d\u201cJust went downstairs and bought some stuff.\u201d Pei Tingsong liked seeing this appearance of his, when he had just woken up. After he covered himself in the quilt for a while, he became especially soft, and his face turned a bit pink.Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t used to staying in bed, so after talking a bit, he got up. As soon as he came out of the bedroom, he saw the flowers on the table and the big heap of things Pei Tingsong had bought. He knew that Pei Tingsong was a young master, but he still couldn\u2019t help laughing at him. \u201cWhy buy so many flowers? There aren\u2019t even enough vases for you to put them in.\u201d\u201cHow is there no place to put them?\u201d Pei Tingsong opened a wine cabinet in the kitchen, and it was filled with clean and beautiful glasses. He took them out one by one huffily. \u201cThey can be put in all of these, I have plenty of glasses to put flowers in.\u201dFang Juexia laughed at his childishness. Pei Tingsong still wasn\u2019t done. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s not enough, there\u2019s a pond.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s also a swimming pool, right?\u201d Fang Juexia thought of Pei Tingsong\u2019s story before they had slept, the one about killing the fish in the swimming pool.\u201cAnyway, I can afford these flowers, and they\u2019re all my flowers.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Fang Juexia lengthened out the last syllable of this word, making it especially gentle. He saw the vegetables that Pei Tingsong had bought, and none of them were very pretty. Some of them had already withered and he didn\u2019t know why he had bought them. But he didn\u2019t rebuke him, instead started washing them all while saying, \u201cI\u2019ll make a vegetable soup\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Pei Tingsong began to fiddle with his flowers. He separated them one by one and shook them a few times. All the buds on the branch were quivering, dripping with water and releasing no aroma, looking very beautiful and pure.Fang Juexia already knew how to cook, and his actions were quick and efficient. He sliced the tomatoes and sponge gourds, put them in a pot, added a spoonful of salt, and finally put the washed leftover vegetables in. Unfortunately, there were no eggs, otherwise the soup would become more fragrant.Hot soup, smoothies, oden, and salad. They were eating strangely and casually, but both people actually found the things they were eating delicious. Fang Juexia left the smoothie for last, and when he took a sip of the half melted smoothie, his teeth chattered from the cold.\u201cIt\u2019s a very good drink.\u201d He smiled, and his lips, that had turned red from the cold, were more beautiful than the roses at the florist.After dinner, Pei Tingsong took the initiative to wash the dishes. In a hurry, he almost broke one, but he managed to save it. Fang Juexia was sitting at the big dining table pruning the eustoma, and almost used up all the glasses he could use.He put the flowers in all the places he could put them, such as the dining table, under the corner of the sofa, on the porch cabinet, in the study, the bedside table in the bedroom, and even in the bathroom. The house was full of eustoma, and the empty house looked like it had come somewhat alive.Pei Tingsong told him that he had lied to Cheng Qiang by telling him that he was sick and wanted him to stay with him to rest for two days. Fang Juexia agreed, and thought it was very interesting. \u201cThen we also can\u2019t go anywhere. There are too many eyes outside, and staying inside the apartment is the safest. It\u2019s like we\u2019re a little couple hiding after eloping.\u201dPei Tingsong liked this description.They wanted to watch Lu Yuan\u2019s variety show for a bit after eating, but there wasn\u2019t a TV in the apartment. Pei Tingsong found a projector in his study. \u201cHow about watching a movie?\u201dFang Juexia said yes, but he doubted whether he would be able to see it clearly. He stretched out his waist and looked through the bag to find a raspberry flavored lollipop, tore off the wrapping paper, and stuffed it into his mouth. He sat cross-legged on the sofa as he watched Pei Tingsong fiddle with the projector that he obviously didn\u2019t use very often.Pei Tingsong finally got it right, and an image was projected onto the empty white wall. \u201cCan you see?\u201dThe projection effect was very good and very bright, so Fang Juexia nodded with the candy in his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s good. What movie is this?\u201d\u201cKill Your Darlings.\u201d Every time Pei Tingsong spoke in English, his ending notes always sounded especially good. That kind of chest resonance, it always made Fang Juexia feel limp and numb whenever he heard it.The title made the movie sound like an art film, or a murder themed suspense film. Fang Juexia beckoned to Pei Tingsong and patted the sofa twice, indicating that he should come over quickly.\u201cRight away, I\u2019ll get us something to drink first.\u201dHe pulled out the last two glasses in his apartment, took out a bottle of Bailey\u2019s Irish Cream from the wine cabinet, and mixed it with half a glass of Wangzai Milk before sipping it. The sweetness doubled like this, and Fang Juexia would like it.For himself, he poured half a glass of rum with half a glass of coke. Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t have a large alcohol tolerance, but he still drank a little occasionally. When he was half-drunk and wrote, his mind would be filled with even more fantastical imagination.After he got back to the sofa, they sat shoulder to shoulder. As they watched the movie, Fang Juexia ended up being not so quiet. This was a movie about literature, poetry and the \u201cBeat Generation\u201d, so there were many things Fang Juexia didn\u2019t understand. Whenever the hero with a beautiful face read a poem, he would look sideways at Pei Tingsong.\u201cThis is Henry Miller\u2019s\u00a0Tropic of Cancer,\u201d Pei Tingsong would kiss him every time he finished saying something, \u201cHe is also one of the Beat Generation, the prophet of sexual liberation. In my study, I still have his\u00a0Rosy Crucifixion\u00a0trilogy, and they\u2019re all erotic novels.\u201d\u201cSexual liberation\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia repeated these words in a low voice, and because he still had some candy in his mouth, the words had a slightly cloying feel to it.He and Pei Tingsong had received completely different educations and had been raised in completely different environments, so he could never be like him, he could never utter words about sex and eroticism casually like him. His tone was weak and contained no confidence. \u201cNo wonder there was the word \u2018cock\u2019 in his poems\u2026\u201dHearing this, Pei Tingsong laughed and teased him with the line he had spoken in the hotel last time. \u201cGege, how do you say \u2018cock\u2019 in Chinese?\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s face suddenly turned red. Originally, he was half lying on him, but now he turned to sit upright.\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he lied.Pei Tingsong started laughing, but didn\u2019t continue to tease him, and they immersed themselves in the plot again. Fang Juexia watched it silently, occasionally sighing tonelessly, and then spoke in the manner of stating the truth, \u201cAlan really likes Lucian.\u201d\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Pei Tingsong took a sip of his coke and rum, and handed Fang Juexia the mixture he had made for him.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgFang Juexia took a big gulp. At first, he didn\u2019t even taste the alcohol in it, and he just thought it was chocolate milk which tasted very sweet. He said to Pei Tingsong, \u201cLook at his eyes when he looks at him. No matter what Lucian says or does, he looks at him like that.\u201dSaying it like that, it was an interesting description.\u201cYou are so smart.\u201d Pei Tingsong tapped his chin and made him face himself. The projected light cast a layer of illusion on his three-dimensional facial features, making them look rather like a bust. His speech was also more pleasant than Lucian in the film, and it enthralled people.\u201cThen should you have figured out that I like you early on?\u201d Pei Tingsong looked into his eyes, the light in his eyes like a turbulent lake. \u201cI look at you like that too.\u201dThe candy in his mouth had melted by a third.The raspberry flavor and chocolate taste of the drink made Fang Juexia intoxicated.\u201cI didn\u2019t figure it out,\u201d Fang Juexia replied honestly.On the projection screen, Lucian fell onto Allen\u2019s leg, holding the fingers he had reached out to touch his cheek. On the sofa, Pei Tingsong held out his hand, grasped the white slender lollipop stick extending from Fang Juexia\u2019s lips, pinched it, and rotated it.A sweet raspberry planet, spinning slowly in a wet and soft universe.The just-born ambiguous nebula flowed into the throat and ignited in his stomach.\u201cWhy?\u201dBecause he also looked at Pei Tingsong like that, so how could he have discovered it? His heart and eyes had long been full of Pei Tingsong.Fang Juexia answered with this within his heart, and then bit at the shrinking lollipop in his mouth.Love is blind, because the lovers could only see their passion for each other.The planet exploded, and his mouth was full of debris. His tongue needed to be saved, so Pei Tingsong came at just the right moment. He held his waist and gave him a complicated kiss under the play of light and shadows.He thought of the lines that were uttered not so long ago, when Allen had said that \u2018it\u2019s complicated\u2019.Lucian had replied, \u201cGreat, I love complicated.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t like it. He liked simple things that could be solved with the use of logic. The only complex thing he liked was Pei Tingsong, and everything related to Pei Tingsong.Simple couldn\u2019t cover him, and Pei Tingsong was attractive because of his complexity.Rum, sweet saliva, coke bubbles, folded oral lining, raspberry and Irish Baileys, tiny taste buds at the tip of the tongue, milk, and smooth teeth.The candy fragments were pushed around by them, and gradually lost their attacking power, melting into a round shape, sticking to their lips and tongue as their breaths grew deeper and deeper.The lines of poetry being recited in the movie were too suitable as background sound right now.[Be careful, you are not in Wonderland.I\u2019ve heard the strange madness long growing in your soul.But you are fortunate in your ignorance, in your isolation.You who have suffered, find where love hides.Give, share, lose\u2014lest we die,\u00a0unbloomed.]Fang Juexia was in Wonderland, and he couldn\u2019t hear anything. Unconsciously, he lay down on the sofa, like a burnt out white candle. His long thin white legs knocked into the glass on the floor, which led to the eustoma falling and water flowing to the floor.His head began to grow dizzy, and there was an indistinct halo in front of his eyes. Half a glass of Irish Bailey had some effect; he felt hot all over, but he wasn\u2019t drunk, he was still sober.Pei Tingsong took off his black coat between kisses, just as he had torn open the candy wrapper just now. But they clearly still had candy in their mouths, and it was too much to hold.Pei Tingsong seemed to be outlining the shape of his lips, gliding along the subtle curve and small and exquisite bow they formed.Every part of the inner part of their mouths was bared open with no reservations, and Fang Juexia began to lose the ability to swallow. He could only accept and accept this invasion passively.This kiss was too long, to the point that the candy had melted. Fang Juexia was also about to melt on the sofa.The dissolved candy and saliva were mixed together and dripped down. They were shining under the sunlight shining in the movie, and made for an image more beautiful than the Milky Way.Their hot hands turned unsteady, and every place they stuck was left stained with their heat.The rescue was temporarily suspended. Pei Tingsong retreated back a little and looked at Fang Juexia from a distance.That kind of pure white beauty set against the colors of the night\u2014it was a kind of defilement to describe it using the words \u201cbeguiling and exotic.\u201d\u201cAre you not going to watch it anymore?\u201d Fang Juexia was talking about the movie. He lay on the sofa, and with soft eyes, continued, \u201cWe\u2019ve only seen half of it.\u201dPei Tingsong leaned down and licked the sugar from the corner of Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth, like an animal.\u201cThe second half isn\u2019t that good.\u201dPoetry doesn\u2019t lie.Yes, Pei Tingsong was so infatuated that his soul now contained a peculiar madness within itself.\u201cAlright\u00a0ba, then we won\u2019t watch anymore.\u201d(5000 words as a\u00a0gift)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only after three minutes did he start to\u00a0 gradually recover his memory.Memories\u2026that were especially hard to look back on.\u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201d Pei Tingsong had woken up earlier than he had and had been hugging Fang Juexia, who was still asleep, as if he was holding a treasure made of jade. When he kissed him, he did so extremely lightly, afraid of waking him up. He wanted to wait for Fang Juexia to wake up naturally after getting enough sleep.Fang Juexia, who had just recovered his memory, felt his face turn red as soon as it was rubbed against once. He reached out to push against Pei Tingsong\u2019s chest, trying to push him away. \u201cLet go, don\u2019t stick to me.\u201d\u201cHow come you\u2019re like this every time?\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s tone even sounded aggrieved. \u201cIt can\u2019t be you\u2019ve forgotten everything\u00a0ah?\u201dFang Juexia of course hadn\u2019t forgotten anything, he remembered it all very clearly. But without saying a word, he arched up and rolled all the quilts onto himself. His eyes drifted, landing on Pei Tingsong lying at the side, who was not covered up at all. His ears grew hot, so he pulled out a little corner of the quilt and placed it on Pei Tingsong.He needed to stay away from the source of danger.Pei Tingsong tugged at that corner of the quilt and pulled him into his arms. He hugged him from across the quilt and purposefully let out a long sigh in his ear, \u201cFang Juexia, I\u2019m dirty.\u201dThis enthusiasm to suck up after already having taken advantage! Fang Juexia choked with resentment and wanted to hit someone.\u201cIf you\u2019re dirty, then just take a bath,\u201d Fang Juexia said with red ears as he used his elbow to fight against his grasp, while also kicking out his feet in the quilt, looking just like a little fish that had been caught. Pei Tingsong thought it was cute, so he kissed and cuddled him. \u201cYou wash me; I even washed you last night, so you have to return it to me.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s words came out more and more frantically. \u201cWhat return? Are you a primary school student borrowing an eraser?\u201d\u201cWhether or not I\u2019m a primary school student, don\u2019t you know best\u00a0ah.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s hands looped around him tight, and he began to sigh deeply again. \u201cWhat to do, I\u2019m no longer a pure Xiao Pei. My precious first time has been snatched away by you, and also the second and third time, so you need to take responsibility for me.\u201dWho was responsible for who ah?\u00a0Fang Juexia flipped over in anger, ready to knock his head. As soon as he lifted his hand, Pei Tingsong caught him. He raised an eyebrow and added, \u201cOtherwise, I will cling to you for the rest of my life.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s heart was beating violently.\u00a0I may really be this guy\u2019s for\u00a0keeps, until death do us part.\u201cYou were already dead set on clinging to me.\u201d After he said that, he pursed his red lips.Pei Tingsong kissed the corner of his eye, then hugged him tightly, stuffing his chin into the hollow of Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder, then rubbing against his neck like a doggy. \u201cI like you too much too.\u201dHe was like this a lot, talking to him as if he were a child. Fang Juexia usually responded to him with actions, because he wasn\u2019t very good with words. However, right now, his hands were trapped in the quilt, and he couldn\u2019t hug Pei Tingsong back.So, he hesitated for a moment before whispering in his ear, \u201cMe too.\u201dIf he didn\u2019t like him, how could he compromise so easily?Pei Tingsong laughed in satisfaction, released his arms, and prepared to lift up the quilt. \u201cLet me see the number of times you\u2019ve been bitten by insects?\u201d\u201cNo, take your hands away.\u201d\u201cJust taking a look\u00a0ma, just a look!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 Give me back the quilt.\u201d\u201cOh god.\u201dThe sunlight diffused through the white curtain, and covered the lovers\u2019 skin like running water.Every part of love in summer was warm, like sunlight that never cooled.Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong spent the next few days carefully and cherishingly, just like tasting a limited edition ice cream.Although they couldn\u2019t walk hand-in-hand in a beautiful boulevard like ordinary lovers, or have a candlelight dinner together in restaurants where tables were hard to reserve, they could cook and stew soup while standing side by side. Fang Juexia would prop himself up against Pei Tingsong as he recited poems and narrated novels, while he would teach Pei Tingsong the skills for quick calculation. They watched movies, kissed, read books, and indulged in even longer kisses.They were trapped in the high-rise apartment for three days, and enjoyed a romance hard to come by for that limited period of time. They were both restrained and free.However, there would always be an end to their two-person vacation. Xiao Wen came to pick them up on the first day they were supposed to report back to the company. He had heard that Pei Tingsong had the flu, so Xiao Wen stupidly brought a lot of medicine. Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia glanced at each other and almost couldn\u2019t hide their smiles. Fang Juexia took hold of the medicine for him, and they then got in the car. Pei Tingsong, who hadn\u2019t gone online for a long time reflexively started cursing as soon as he refreshed Weibo.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Fang Juexia drew closer to see.\u201cFire Ge is on the Hot Search list, they say he\u2019s dating someone. What the hell is this?\u201dXiao Wen was so startled that he couldn\u2019t fasten his seat belt. \u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll click on it and have a look first.\u201d Pei Tingsong clicked on the [He Ziyan\u2019s Love] entry on the Hot Search list. He Ziyan was not like TingJue where the CP fans dominated. His boyfriend power counted as being the highest in the whole group, and many of his fans were girlfriend fans. After seeing this entry on the Hot Search list, they were sure to explode.The first line in the Hot Search entry was a Weibo post by an influencer account. It had been posted a few minutes ago: [He Ziyan, a member of Kaleido, a popular boy-band, is suspected to have been photographed while on a date with his girlfriend. The two staged a sweet \u201ccradling the head and going in for the kill of the heart\u201d at the entrance of a KTV.]There were also four pictures, which had been taken at night, and they were all very fuzzy.\u201cIs this him?\u201d Fang Juexia opened the picture for Pei Tingsong. There was a girl with long black hair, wearing a small blue French-style dress and a mask. He Ziyan was very easy to recognize. Although his head was turned to the side and he was wearing a hat, someone who interacted with him every day would be able to recognize him. The first two pictures showed him reaching for the girl\u2019s head, while the second two showed them standing side by side.There were a lot of fans in the comment area, but there were also a lot of netizens talking about it in the real-time search as well. Many people had already emotionally criticized He Ziyan for dating someone while on the rise in his career and then having been photographed doing it.Idols dating had always been a controversial issue. Kaleido was a group that had only recently become heavily discussed, with the popularity of almost every member seeing a significant rise, and nowadays, there were also variety shows being aired that featured them. Once this kind of love news was released, it triggered a great rise in public opinion on online platforms. Almost everyone believed that this was real proof, but their attitudes were different. Many fans in the entertainment circle felt that this was very serious behavior, but there were also many people who said that Kaleido wasn\u2019t a group that had relied on its fans to rise; they had become popular in the circle several times solely on the basis of their own abilities. Fans of sheer ability thought that he shouldn\u2019t be criticized in this manner.For a time, many different opinions were being bandied about, and the\u00a0\u2018collapsed house\u2019 news\u00a0spread quickly, with great influence.Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t quite believe it and sent a message to He Ziyan. \u201cNo way\u00a0ba, Fire Ge definitely wouldn\u2019t go so far as to secretly date someone\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to call Qiang Ge.\u201d Xiao Wen didn\u2019t start the car.The more Fang Juexia looked at the image, the more he felt it was off. \u201cWhy does this dress look so familiar?\u201d He thought about it carefully, and finally recalled something. \u201cWait a minute, this is the present I sent Miao Ge\u2019s little sister for her birthday last year.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Pei Tingsong took a closer look. \u201cIt seems that\u2019s really Jiang Yao.\u201d He looked at Fang Juexia and inquired, \u201cFire Ge can\u2019t date Xiao Yao\u00a0ba, didn\u2019t she just become an adult?\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s gut feeling told him that that was just impossible.Their cellphones soon vibrated, and it was the Kaleido group chat.[Sexy Teacher Yuan Doing the Flower Hand Dance: What\u2019s the matter\u00a0ah? I saw a group of hip-hop dance instructors eating melons and excitedly rushed over to take a look, only to see that the house that collapsed was actually my own?? [picture] [picture]][Your Fire Ge: Someone is trying to screw me over\u00a0ba? This was the celebration on the day that Xiao Yao\u2019s college entrance examination finished\u00a0ah. Three Water and Yiyi are also there, so how did she become my secret girlfriend?][The Original M-Dash: Yeah, clearly, I\u2019m here, too\u00a0ah! Do I not pair well?!!][Sexy Teacher Yuan Doing the Flower Hand Dance: Clearly, even though it was a four person scandal, you can never even get named.][Water Water Water: These rumor mongers are too much, not even high school students are off limits.]\u201cMiao Ge must be very angry,\u201d Fang Juexia sighed. \u201cHis own little sister getting dragged out to smear his bandmate.\u201dPei Tingsong let out a curse, \u201cIf it was me, I\u2019d explode and open up my mic.\u201dXiao Wen immediately stopped him. \u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t, don\u2019t, little ancestor, let\u2019s go back to the company first. These kinds of baseless accusations showing up one by one, it shows that you guys are really popular. My K is real popular!\u201dFortunately, on the evening of the party, the members present had taken several group photos as a memento. At the time, they had thought that they couldn\u2019t post them online, but now these very pictures had turned into evidence. Star Chart\u2019s reaction speed was as fast as ever, and after drafting a clarification statement, they immediately made a Weibo post to clarify the identity of the girl in the photo.He Ziyan also immediately made a Weibo post.[@Kaleido He Ziyan: Four people get-together to celebrate Miao Ge\u2019s own little sister finishing up her college entrance examinations. You guys aren\u2019t satisfied with making up my life experiences, and now also want to help arrange a girlfriend for me, right? Then I\u2019m going to\u00a0go by your guys\u2019 will\u00a0and get married online\u00a0ah.]His Weibo post was accompanied by several group photos featuring all the four people from that evening, and Meimei Jiang Yao\u2019s face was always covered with a sticker. Pretty much immediately, Jiang Miao also forwarded this post.[@Kaleido Jiang Miao: Sorry for taking up public resources, but the girl in the group photo and the popular secret dating photo is my biological little sister. All the friends who are familiar with me should know that I have a little sister who is a few years younger than me. Because she is still a student, I always pay attention to protecting my little sister\u2019s privacy, and I also hope that the media can give her some space. The child was very happy after the test, and we celebrated a bit, not expecting to cause such a big storm out of it, very sorry for that.]Jiang Miao\u2019s words were neither humble nor overbearing, and he also posted a group photo taken with his little sister at school during the day, from when she had finished her exam, and their clothing was exactly the same as the night photos. No one who had been an old fan for many years didn\u2019t know the existence of this little sister. Jiang Miao even had nicknames and labels like \u201cLittle sister con\u201d and \u201chis Meimei is his only weakness.\u201d After learning that the so-called \u201cgirlfriend\u201d was the little sister of the group leader, the fans started to fight back.Only now did the netizens realize that what they had eaten was a fake melon, so most of them scattered like birds and animals in a forest. There were also many people who came up with the conspiracy theory that there was a rival company making trouble for them. They cursed out the paparazzi, and also cursed out the trend of generating fake news seen so often in the entertainment industry.However, there weren\u2019t many netizens, those who had opened up and cursed people out because of this \u2018love discussion\u2019, who apologized for their own behavior. Their faces had been slapped, but they pretended that nothing had happened. Some people even argued that it wasn\u2019t impossible to fall in love with a bandmate\u2019s little sister, and then added on the label of self-speculation and fanservice.These gossip elements didn\u2019t need to be clarified or given explanations for, they were only keen on watching the collapse of high-rise buildings and the collapse of big edifices. On the contrary, if they didn\u2019t collapse, they would boo and hiss.But even so, false news still needed to be clarified. Ling Yi, one of the people involved in the event, forwarded He Ziyan\u2019s Weibo post immediately.[@Kaleido Ling Yi: I was the one who booked the KTV, so why am I not worthy of gossip and scandal?]The group of fans below the post began to laugh at the neglected Ling Yi.[@Obscure K\u2019s Always Shou Ling Yi: Reflect on why you\u2019re not suited for a girlfriend\u00a0ba\u00a0hhh]Lu Yuan also forwarded Ling Yi\u2019s Weibo post.[@Kaleido Lu Yuan: I was with the program group, just got off the plane, thank you\u2026. Wait, why didn\u2019t you invite me? I could have just not gone to film the program! //@Kaleido Ling Yi: I was the one who booked the KTV, so why am I not worthy of gossip and scandal?]As a cross-talking boyband, Kaleido\u2019s team spirit was hard to explain. Usually, they always argued back and forth and quarreled with each other without trying to be polite in public. However, whenever something happened, they would all start to protect each other on their own.As soon as Fang Juexia entered the company, he went to the piano room to practice playing the piano and composing songs. He also received a WeChat message from Cheng Qiang and heard that the company had paid to remove this news item from the Hot Search list, so he took out his cellphone to check the latest situation. Plainly he hadn\u2019t made any Weibo posts in a long time, but as soon as he got to He Ziyan\u2019s Weibo, he immediately left a message below it.[@Kaleido Fang Juexia: If there was a party, why didn\u2019t you bring me along? Meimei\u2019s dress is even from me.]His serious comment was soon pushed to the top by fans.[@Did Kaleido win a prize today: Grandma, the advertisement blogger you followed has commented!!!][@6A Grade Fancy Jeweled Xeriscape: AHHHHHH JUEXIA GEGE! How are you so cute\u00a0ah,\u00a0so seriously saying that people didn\u2019t take you along][@Did Fang Juexia make a post today: Shit, this dress is actually from FJX, I\u2019m jealous.][@Deaf\u00a0fan dispersing: I want to buy the same dress, then rounding it up, the beautiful baby will have given me the dress!][@TingJue girl\u2019s head is brushing the sky: AHHHHHH IT\u2019S A HOT AND FRESH JXGG! The tone is too cute\u00a0ba.]Fang Juexia refreshed the page, and unexpectedly, saw Pei Tingsong\u2019s comment. In such a short period of time, it had already been pushed to the position right under his comment.[@Kaleido Pei Tingsong: Why didn\u2019t you bring me to the party? Meimei also isn\u2019t wearing the shoes I gave her.]Fang Juexia laughed when he saw it.This person was really strange. He had to imitate him even when he was commenting. Was he a copy-cat?There was no need to wait for Fang Juexia to say this, for his fans spoke out first.[@You and me under the Pinot Tree Supreme: Are you a copytree? How is it that you\u2019re copying everything from your Ge?][@Eustoma blooming on a cactus: Shit, one of you gave a dress while the other gave some shoes, I\u2019m going to die of jealousy! This girl has really reincarnated as a king, her biological Gege is Jiang Miao, and there\u2019s five handsome Ge as her friendly Gege. They give gifts and have parties, the first gossip boyfriend in her life is He Ziyan, what kind of Mary Sue heroine in a romantic drama is this\u2026.][@TingJue is real: I just don\u2019t understand, during the college examinations, Teacher Yuan was elsewhere filming a program, and it\u2019s normal that he wouldn\u2019t have gone. PTS and FJX should have both been in Beijing though\u00a0ah, so why didn\u2019t the two of them go\u2026.][@I dare not say that TingJue is real replying to @TingJue is real: Sister, careful, he\u2019s going to curse you\u00a0wwww][@ Putuo Temple Site\u2019s Fine Jeweled Xeriscape replying to\u00a0 @TingJue is real: Don\u2019t ask, if you ask, K won\u2019t be peaceful]Right, what did the two of them do the night of the college entrance examination?This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgFang Juexia exited the app to check the date, then immediately closed Weibo with red ears.They didn\u2019t do anything, nothing at all.In the evening, the company specially held a meeting to discuss this. Recently, there had been a lot of intangible on-goings, and although this trouble was normal for a boyband in the rising popularity stage, Cheng Qiang still reminded them one by one.\u201cSomeone must have posted this slander this time deliberately, and there are a lot of such things in the circle. Some time ago, there was also a small flower who was explosively revealed to have secretly married, and it was also news that people in the circle deliberately released.\u201dLing Yi clicked his tongue a few times. \u201cReally odious.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what being popular is, can\u2019t do anything about it. Our Star Chart is also a music company, and in fact, the atmosphere here is especially relaxed. Besides Shang Sirui, all your senior brothers have basically dated people before. The company has no ban on dating, but you need to be aware of one thing.\u201d Cheng Qiang knocked on the table in the conference room. \u201cYou need to let me know. At the very, very latest, you need to let me know once the feelings have stabilized, and only then can I be ready.\u201d\u201cUnderstood\u2014\u201dLu Yuan asked, \u201cDoes the company pair people up? I can\u2019t even meet a woman right now.\u201dLing Yi shook his hand. \u201cMe too, I\u2019ve only met Xiao Yao recently. If this goes on, I\u2019m going to fall in love within the group\u00a0ah!\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s whole body froze as soon as he heard this. Pei Tingsong was as thick-skinned as ever though; even though this had pricked him right there, he acted like someone who had nothing to do with the matter and snarked at Ling Yi, \u201cYou want to fall in love within the group, but who wants you\u00a0ah?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s Juexia,\u201d Ling Yi lay across Fang Juexia\u2019s body. \u201cAfter all, I\u2019m an appearance con.\u201dFang Juexia guiltily cooperated with him with a smile, but his eyes unconsciously glanced at Pei Tingsong, who was sitting diagonally opposite him. The two of them looked at each other, and the corners of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth curled up in a smile.Quickly retrieving his gaze, he realised that Ling Yi was still chattering-on next to his ear. He didn\u2019t know why, but Fang Juexia discovered that in the midst of his embarrassment, he also felt a little happy, as if this secret love brought him not only sweetness, but also excitement.Every day he was with Pei Tingsong, he was breaking the rules.Secretly enjoying themselves, having a clandestine love affair, eating the forbidden fruit.These were not clean phrases, and they had all fallen upon him now, but Fang Juexia had actually begun to enjoy this uncleanness.Cheng Qiang explained something about the summer album and arranged their music selection and recording. Fang Juexia was in a daze the whole time. At the end of the meeting, only when his name was called out by Cheng Qiang did he return to his senses.\u201cEn?\u201d Fang Juexia looked at him.\u201cI asked if the demo you gave us to listen to last time, you could put it in the summer album this time,\u201d Cheng Qiang said.So it turned out to be this.Fang Juexia nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll speed up the production, but I might not be able to do it very well. It\u2019s also my first attempt at composing music.\u201d\u201cAlright, anyway, the company\u2019s principle is to prioritize using your original song.\u201dAt the end of the meeting, the six people found an empty vocal-training room to discuss the summer album, and returned to the dormitory at 11 p.m. On the way back, Jiang Miao was concerned about Pei Tingsong\u2019s cold. Pei Tingsong happened to get a call, and after a careless glance, he picked it up. Fang Juexia felt as if something was going on with him; when he answered the phone, he looked serious and didn\u2019t speak. He just uttered a lot of \u201cen\u2019s\u201d before finally saying, \u201cSend it to me and I\u2019ll have a look.\u201dWhat had happened this time? Fang Juexia was a little suspicious.Failing at cueing Xiao Pei into a discussion, the topic turned to He Ziyan, who had experienced great ups and downs within a single day.\u201cIt\u2019s actually pretty interesting to think about it now.\u201d He Ziyan said, \u201cI also count as having tested out the waters of love in advance, but I didn\u2019t expect that netizens would respond with such a huge reaction that even my former two girlfriends picked it out.\u201d\u201cYes\u00a0ah,\u201d Lu Yuan teased him, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you didn\u2019t even have your first girlfriend\u2019s WeChat? Netizens are really scary.\u201dListening to their discussion, Fang Juexia felt faintly uneasy inside.Even though he liked this kind of secret love, he knew that with Pei Tingsong\u2019s personality, he must want to be open about it someday, and be just like the other lovers in the entertainment industry.But he didn\u2019t want his relationship to affect the group. No matter how he looked at it, there was no good time to expose it in the short-term.Maybe in another three to five years, when their respective careers were all mature\u2026.As he thought of this, Fang Juexia also couldn\u2019t help thinking if\u2014Would they still be together then?Forever.This word was like a trap for everyone in love in the world. Fang Juexia thought that he was calm enough and brave enough, but even he couldn\u2019t avoid human nature.He was expecting [forever], an event with such small probability, to happen to him.After having enough fun in the living room, everyone went back to their rooms. Fang Juexia entered his and opened the glass door of the balcony, and the jasmine-flavored wind blew in on the summer night. His cellphone vibrated, and it was Pei Tingsong.[One Constant Truth: Are you scared?]Scared?Scared of what?Ling Yi tidied up the new Minion figure he had just bought and hummed, \u201cI will always remember the wind in summer\u2026\u201dFang Juexia typed out a line of words. Before sending it, he deleted the second half of the paragraph and edited it.[Moonlight: I\u2019m not afraid of being exposed, but if one day, everyone finds out, I hope it\u2019s because we made it public on our own.]Staring at this line of words, he thought of the original sentence that had existed in the chat-box for just three seconds.[I\u2019m not afraid of being exposed, I\u2019m just afraid the shelf life of this relationship will be shorter than I think.]Before the time was ripe, and if the tasting period of this candy had already ended, it would then become meaningless to peel off the candy wrapper and show it to the world.When it came to the nature of worrying about losing favor, Pei Tingsong had really inherited it from him.After a while, Fang Juexia\u2019s cellphone vibrated again.[One Constant Truth: That\u2019s for sure, with what we\u2019re playing at, we should be able to stab ourselves. I hate that I can\u2019t let everyone know that you belong to me now, and that no one can take you away from me. How can I let others take the lead? That would be slapping the face of me, Pei Tingsong, and I won\u2019t do it.]Really?The corners of Fang Juexia\u2019s lips quirked up into a smile, and he suddenly thought of a certain person\u2019s black history.[Moonlight: Little friend, it seems that your face has been slapped this entire time.][Moonlight: \u201cWhy would anyone want to top you\u00a0ah?\u00a0I can\u2019t imagine the way you look in bed at all.\u201d][Moonlight: \u201cDo these people have a thing for ice or wood?\u201d][Moonlight: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t desire your body.\u201d][Moonlight: \u201cI\u2019m not gay.\u201d][Moonlight: Does it hurt?]Pei Tingsong just watched as these messages jumped out one by one, just like little goldfish jumping out of a fish tank.Fang Juexia, a person who seldom sent so many messages, could still overwhelm Pei Tingsong a bit with this barrage. Pei Tingsong could only stare at the screen and say to himself, \u201cNo\u2026. Why are all these old accounts being dug up?\u201dHe Ziyan happened to hear him just then. \u201cOld accounts? What old accounts? Oh, right! You brat, you still owe me money for charging up your game that time!\u201d\u201cWhat\u00a0ah\u2026.you\u2019re plundering a house on fire!\u201d\u201cWhat \u2018plundering a house on fire\u2019? I am Fire.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 88Chapter 88 \u2013 Ambiguous UndercurrentTranslated by juurenshaEdited by NoksDoomed to defeatAfter setting the date for the release of the summer album for July, Kaleido grew busy making the mini-album at the company every day.Compared with regular albums, mini-albums only included one main song and three non-main songs, and this time, the main song had been bought by the company from a composer abroad, and one of the three non-main songs was to be the one Fang Juexia had created before.After all, it was a follow-up mini-album, so there wasn\u2019t as much pressure, so everyone was relatively relaxed. Their attitude while participating in the production of the mini-album was one purely of playing around at music. Summer was a season filled to the brim with sunshine and romance, so the style of the music was also positioned in this way this time. Compared with their previous albums, which had been full of strong feelings, this album\u2019s requirements were towards adding more elements concerning love.This was why Chen Zhengyun, the producer and boss, was not as at ease for Pei Tingsong to write the lyrics of all the songs as he had done before.\u201cXiao Pei\u2019s lyrical style is too intense, it\u2019s not gentle enough.\u201d Chen Zhengyun discussed at the meeting, \u201cThis time, we need to have the feeling of summer love.\u201dFang Juexia, who had never raised any objections during meetings, quietly refuted this statement in his heart. Pei Tingsong could actually be very gentle; he could coax a person, even read poems to him, and also buy flowers and candy for him.He was the most qualified person in the world to refute this statement.Others could only see the thorns present all over Pei Tingsong, only Fang Juexia can feel his soft heart.\u201cHow am I not gentle?\u201d Pei Tingsong was not satisfied with this evaluation, so he directly slapped the table in the meeting room and challenged the boss as usual.Everyone burst out laughing. \u201cDo you call that gentleness?\u201dHe Ziyan said with a smile, \u201cOther people may write love songs with \u2018I love you, you love me\u2019 or something, but when it comes to Xiao Pei, he directly mentions you stepping into the skies and\u00a0breaking the heavens.\u201dLing Yi called out, \u201cBros, spam the barrage with the word \u2018fear\u2019!\u201dLu Yuan rubbed his chin. \u201cThe fierce man is gentle, hahahaha!\u201dJiang Miao, who had never involved himself in any group snarking activities, also glanced at Pei Tingsong and said, \u201cMaybe after Xiao Pei dates a bit, he can write lyrics with more of a love song atmosphere.\u201dPei Tingsong extremely wanted to refute them. \u201cNo, you guys\u2026\u201dFang Juexia pursed his mouth and cleared his throat. His expression was like that of a little hamster with a bulging mouth; his cheek pouches were filled with secrets.Alright\u00a0ba. Pei Tingsong gave up. He decided not to be just\u00a0a giant of language; he needed to prove that he could really write love songs with his actions.\u201cYou guys wait. I definitely can do it.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d He Ziyan teased him, \u201cIs there ever a time when Xiao Pei can\u2019t do it?\u201dPei Tingsong was too lazy to mind them. He held the pen in his fingers and spun it skillfully. Chen Zhengyun showed them all the selected songs one by one, and everyone discussed the appropriate arrangement styles.Fang Juexia looked up seriously and listened carefully. Suddenly, he felt something touch his leg. He lowered his head doubtfully, only to see that it was actually a foot in a purple AJ, which had stretched out to his leg. He had just come out of the practice room and was still wearing loose dancing slacks. The tip of that AJ covered foot had already lifted up his slacks to lightly poked against the skin of his leg twice.As soon as he looked up, Fang Juexia saw Pei Tingsong\u2019s head tilted towards him. His eyes were deep, and he was still twirling the pen in his hand.He was probably blaming him for not speaking up for him, thought Fang Juexia.He pulled his legs back, not accepting Pei Tingsong\u2019s covert blame.\u201cWe have also been discussing cooperating with some of this year\u2019s summer dramas, and it is possible that one of the non-main songs will be used as an interlude in an episode of a TV series.\u201dCheng Qiang was still talking, and Fang Juexia tried to concentrate and listen carefully, but there was something that kept distracting him. As soon as he retreated, Pei Tingsong would draw closer.Pei Tingsong liked to play with fire, and without any blushing or fast-beating heart, teased him in front of so many people.\u201cSo, we have to speed up the pace soon. After making the demo, we have to send it to the drama department, so that they can choose the songs.\u201dHowever, Fang Juexia had never been a little white bunny who would let himself be bullied by others. When dealing with Pei Tingsong, his temper was especially large.There was a clattering sound, and Fang Juexia\u2019s pen fell to the ground beside his elbow. He apologized in a soft voice and bent down to pick it up. He reached for the pen that hadn\u2019t been capped in the first place, directly grabbed the leg that Pei Tingsong had stretched out, and quickly drew an X on his exposed ankle.Then he quietly sat up and put his pen on the table.No one discovered the ambiguous undercurrent flowing under the table, and there was no evidence besides that little X.Although everyone had teased Pei Tingsong at the meeting, after the demo of the main song was given to them, it only took Pei Tingsong two days to complete writing lyrics for it, which was much faster than what the other lyricists, arranged by the company, managed to achieve during the same period. Chen Zhengyun carefully compared the two sets of lyrics; Pei Tingsong\u2019s lyrics were both more vivid and poetic. It wasn\u2019t simply a grab bag of assembly line lyrics where no matter what you\u2019re singing back and forth, it\u2019s always just \u2018you love me and I love you\u201d.With the main song decided, the six people from Kaleido entered the studio to record. They had learned from their previous experience, and this time, they were very careful in keeping the demo and the completed song absolutely safe, for fear that another accident like the previous one would occur.During this period, Star Chart and Kaleido\u2019s official Weibo also released a notice on Weibo. Although they didn\u2019t even post a picture of the album, with the message containing just the words \u201ccoming soon\u201d, the excited mood of fans on seeing this was hard to express, and forwards and comments soon soared.Everyone had guessed that with the popularity and lasting power of \u201cBreak Through\u201d, Star Chart would definitely strike while the iron is hot and release a follow-up album, but they hadn\u2019t expected it to come so soon.Halfway through this period, Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong also went back to film \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019, and the popularity of the program grew increasingly higher and higher with each episode, and after the broadcast every Saturday, you would find the TingJue CP trending on the Hot Search list.As a result, the program group\u2019s budget also increased. They directly built a small planetarium for a new episode. After filming, the several guests got together to eat as usual. After eating, the ZiXi pair, who had things to do, left first, but Shang Sirui insisted on going to a KTV, so the rest of them continued their evening activities.\u201cHey, we have to take a group photo this time, make a preemptive strike\u00a0ah.\u201d Shang Sirui joked about He Ziyan\u2019s scandal from last time, \u201cOr else suddenly they\u2019ll say I have a girlfriend.\u201dZhai Ying replied with a smile, \u201cDream on.\u201dPei Tingsong teased, \u201cFire Ge has received many scripts for idol dramas nowadays, a blessing found within misfortune.\u201dThey began to chat as they played around. All of these people were willing to talk, and they\u2019d more or less have something to say about themselves in every get-together they had. Fang Juexia was always a member of the audience at such occasions, but he hadn\u2019t expected Zhai Ying to talk about Astar\u2019s matters at this particular gathering.She first mentioned that their group\u2019s comeback had been delayed, and only after Shang Sirui asked why did the rest of them find out about the big conflict at the upper levels of Astar, and how there were two factions pulling at each other.Although Fang Juexia was no longer in Astar, he had heard about most of this when he was still a trainee. Astar had originally made its fortune in the early days by relying on several popular singers and groups. One of them, Li Luo, a veteran national singer, had also become one of Astar\u2019s shareholders. However, the boss at the time had supported Jin Xiangcheng when he was retiring to a higher supervisory position, thus making him the new boss. However, Jin Xiangcheng\u2019s means of doing things were more low, and even though he managed to promote many popular groups through his own methods, he also ended up making many enemies.He remembered that Ling Yi had casually mentioned the fall in Astar\u2019s stock. Apart from Pei Tingsong\u2019s older sister causing difficulties, it must have something to do with the high-level infighting.Pei Tingsong asked casually, \u201cWhy should high-level infighting delay your guys\u2019 comeback?\u201dZhai Ying took a sip of beer. \u201cBecause we are a group designed by President Li.\u201dFang Juexia asked, \u201cLi Luo?\u201d\u201cYes. There is also another more key problem.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m Li Luo\u2019s sister-in-law. In other words, he\u2019s my brother-in-law.\u201dShang Sirui suddenly realized. \u201cOh! No wonder you could debut after only having trained for such a short time!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very strong myself, okay? Or do you think being the ace in a girl group is so easy?\u201dIt was only then Fang Juexia realized that Zhai Ying was actually an airborne; no wonder he hadn\u2019t seen her when he had left. And even though she knew that he and Astar, who had been friendly once, now hated each other, she didn\u2019t care about it all that much; everything made sense now.She must also not be pleased with Jin Xiangcheng.Fang Juexia said, \u201cBased on Jin Xiangcheng\u2019s style, he will not let you guys stage a comeback until he has established his position. You doing well is tantamount to fueling President Li\u2019s prestige within the company. Besides, your group\u2019s popularity is so high, so the numbers shouldn\u2019t be bad.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m hoping we don\u2019t do a comeback, I\u2019m afraid that he\u2019ll deliberately give us bad songs. He\u2019s already done something like that before, which greatly damaged our group\u2019s vitality.\u201d Zhai Ying sighed and spoke, \u201cAfter all, we\u2019re not like you guys, who create your own songs.\u201dFang Juexia smiled. \u201cWe are a small company, so we have no other way.\u201dAfter the gathering, they all left separately. Fang Juexia was still thinking about Astar on his way back to the company. Back when he had entered Astar, one of his interviewers had been Li Luo, and it could be said that Li Luo was the one who had led him into Astar. During his trainee period, Li Luo had also helped him a lot, which was why everyone thought that he would be able to debut with a new boy-band soon.That was until Jin Xiangcheng snatched the planning and execution of \u201cSeven Luminaries\u201d from Li Luo.Things were hard to predict; he was already no longer a member of Astar, but such open and secret struggles still hadn\u2019t stopped.However, Fang Juexia kept getting a bad feeling about it, and he was even worried about Liang Ruo. Although he had already said that he would not be involved with anything concerning Liang Ruo in the future, he still didn\u2019t want that person to become the victim in a struggle of interests.Or, in other words, he didn\u2019t want anyone to be a victim.Besides completing their personal events, their daily job was to come to the company to prepare for the album. Although there was no need to do promotional shows, future fan meetups and variety shows would still require a stage. Therefore, Fang Juexia and Lu Yuan started choreographing, and this time their style was more natural. After grinding out choreography details all afternoon, Lu Yuan was half-starved and dragged Fang Jjuexia to go eat.Thinking that Pei Tingsong was still writing lyrics in his small studio, Fang Juexia was absent-minded the whole time he ate, and then Qiang Ge called Lu Yuan away.\u201cTake your time eating\u00a0ah. I\u2019ll go first.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Watching Lu Yuan leave, Fang Juexia put down his chopsticks, packed a\u00a0shrimp seed noodle\u00a0dish and\u00a0mung bean ice drink, then went directly to go find Pei Tingsong.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgThe studio where he usually wrote lyrics was next to the piano room, opposite the vocal music room, and it used to be a small exercise room. In the beginning, Star Chart had only occupied the first floor of this large office building, and resources were scarce, so even such a small room had been equipped with mirrors. Later, with gradual development, Star Chart took over all the five floors, which meant that there were more training rooms, and pretty much everyone stopped using that small room, so it gradually became a storage room.The little demon king had quarreled fiercely with Chen Zhengyun, saying that he had to have a place to write his own things, and only then did they arrange that one room for him.Fang Juexia exited the elevator with the food he had packed. It was actually his first time coming to Pei Tingsong\u2019s small studio.When he got to the door, Fang Juexia hesitated again. He knocked on the door, but got no response, though he could hear the sound of an electronic piano from inside.Could he not hear him?\u00a0Fang Juexia raised his hand to knock on the door again, but suddenly the door opened, and his hand was left hanging there in the empty air.\u201cYou came?\u201d Pei Tingsong took his raised hand and pulled him in. His expression had changed very quickly; he had originally looked impatient at being disturbed, but when he saw that it was Fang Juexia who had come, he immediately showed a childish smile. His face changed faster than the time it took to turn the pages of a book.\u201cIf I told you to go eat, you wouldn\u2019t go.\u201d Fang Juexia carefully pushed the door closed behind him and handed Pei Tingsong the food he was carrying. \u201cI just went to go eat, so I brought you some.\u201dThe room was really not that big, but it had everything inside. The wall on the left side of the entrance had a row of desks and musical instruments. On the right side was the original large mirror, and the floor was carpeted, with several lazy-boy sofas placed around. This kind of environment was very consistent with Pei Tingsong\u2019s American style of leisure.Seeing that Fang Juexia had even remembered to bring him food, Pei Tingsong happily took hold of the bag, then cradled his waist and gave him a kiss on the cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re being so good to me.\u201d He wore a cream white short sleeve shirt with a pair of glasses, and his hair was tamed, so he really did give off more of a college student feel right now.Fang Juexia pushed against his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the surveillance in here has been removed by me.\u201d Pei Tingsong said casually while picking Fang Juexia up and seating him down on his desk. He then put his own hands on the table, surrounding him.Fang Juexia\u2019s heart jumped up violently. The temperature of the air conditioner in the small room was clearly very low, but he still felt hot. \u201cWhat are you doing dismantling the surveillance?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with surveillance here, and I can\u2019t concentrate on my work.\u201d The corners of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth quirked up, and he took off his glasses with one hand. \u201cBut now it seems that I am very prescient.\u201dAfter that, he kissed Fang Juexia. There was absolutely nowhere for Fang Juexia to duck in order to avoid it, so he took a bite in revenge, but because he was reluctant to use his whole strength, he ended up causing the opposite effect. Pei Tingsong pretty much felt that this was flirting.Just like the X he had drawn on his ankle.Fang Juexia\u2019s teasing was always unconscious, so much so that even he wouldn\u2019t discover it himself.The hot kiss made Fang Juexia dizzy, and he couldn\u2019t see anything besides Pei Tingsong\u2019s handsome eyes. He started mistakenly sucking in air, and his reason became intermittent. He wandered between resistance and obedience, all his thoughts covered in hot fog.He thought that Pei Tingsong\u2019s clothes were so white and so clean.Clean.This gave him a tenable reason.\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019ve danced, and I\u2019m dirty, I\u2019ll dirty your clothes.\u201dPei Tingsong chuckled and separated from him for a short time, but his eyes were still staring at those moist shiny spots on his lips. \u201cHow many times have I dirtied you? It\u2019s the perfect time for you to return the favor.\u201dAfter having gotten physical, Pei Tingsong used more dirty talk than before. Originally, Fang Juexia had thought that he was a guy with no lower limit. Now he thought that he might be lower than the lower limit he had imagined before.This short pause allowed Fang Juexia to look up, but as soon as he looked up, he saw a row of mirrors on the opposite wall, and reflected on them were his red neck and ears, making his heart pound against his chest.\u201cThe noodles will get cold in a bit.\u201d Fang Juexia pushed him away and came down from the table. His movements showed his hurry, and he brought down a lot of Pei Tingsong\u2019s manuscripts with him, all of which floated to the ground like snowflakes.When Pei Tingsong saw him crouch down to pick it up, he wanted to pull him back. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, it\u2019s all scratch paper, I already don\u2019t want them. Come and sit down, keep me company while I eat.\u201dFang Juexia wasn\u2019t willing. \u201cYou eat first, I feel uncomfortable with all of this all over the floor.\u201dAlright\u00a0ba, who let his family\u2019s little white flower have obsessive-compulsive disorder? However, Pei Tingsong also didn\u2019t bother listening to him, squatting down to pick it all up with him. Fang Juexia collected all of the scratch paper, and afraid that Pei Tingsong would make trouble and not eat well, he took the stack of paper and went to the lazyboy sofa in the corner. Rather than have Pei Tingsong continue what they were doing before, he forcefully changed the topic. \u201cIs this the scratch paper for the lyrics?\u201d\u201cNot all of them\u00a0ba, some of them were just written in a daze while practicing calligraphy.\u201d In fact, he didn\u2019t have much of an appetite, so he stuck a straw into the mung bean smoothie, and started drinking with the cup in his left hand while casually playing a few notes on the electronic piano with his right hand.Fang Juexia didn\u2019t have the habit of looking through other people\u2019s manuscripts, but he simply felt that the words on the top-most sheet were good-looking. Line by line, each one of them was beautiful, and the handwriting was flowing and coherent. At first glance, it looked to be the product of abundant inspiration. It didn\u2019t look like some lyrical scratch paper, but on the contrary, more like a modern poem.So he read it silently in his heart.[Love turns man into a contradiction of stupidityHead all confused, happy in degeneration, like meWant to use the safest hug in the worldTo wrap your fragile bones and dreamsSleep well\u00a0ba, I\u2019m a loyal night watchmanYour smoothly beating heart is in my handsAnd the whole world is in my handsBut I thought again, in the unguarded middle of your nightOn your soft shorelineTo start up the most dangerous campaignBurn up a whole night\u2019s worth of the smoke of gunpowderDoomed to defeat, I will put the last bulletInto your body]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His beautiful eyes were wide open as he looked at Pei Tingsong.Seeing him like this, Pei Tingsong laughed. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? Did you see something just now?\u201dFang Juexia shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d Even though he said no, his face burned. His mind was full of Pei Tingsong\u2019s free and easy words\u2014 every line, every word.Having too good of a memory was a bad thing.As the corners of Pei Tingsong\u2019s mouth quirked up, he put down the smoothie before extending both of his arms and setting them down on the sofa, then he leaned forward to encircle Fang Juexia within the lazyboy sofa. Fang Juexia felt a little flustered; he leaned back unconsciously, nearly falling into empty space and bumping against the wall, but Pei Tingsong caught the back of his head with his palm in time.\u201cBe careful.\u201dFang Juexia had completely fallen into his arms now.Pei Tingsong\u2019s palm slipped slowly down from the back of his head, grasping the pale back of his neck. Fang Juexia liked to wear casual shirts, and there were many such similar styled shirts hanging in his wardrobe. They looked very common when they were just hanging there, but became so clean and beautiful when they were worn by him.He couldn\u2019t help lowering his head.Fang Juexia thought he was going to kiss him, so he reflexively closed his eyes, but soon realized that Pei Tingsong went much lower than he thought, for he had bitten the top button of his white shirt instead.He unbuttoned Fang Juexia\u2019s clothes with his mouth and kissed the clavicle hidden inside. Then he looked up again, smiling childishly and kissing him on the lips.\u201cYou read what I wrote?\u201d Pei Tingsong asked.Fang Juexia nodded and said, \u201cJust one page.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s just that one anyway, the rest are all useless.\u201d Pei Tingsong was open and natural. He took Fang Juexia\u2019s hand and put it on his waist, so that their posture would change into them embracing each other. \u201cYou are so nervous. Do you think I will do something to you?\u201dHe didn\u2019t know why he was nervous, but he became like this every time, even though he really did like Pei Tingsong.\u201cDesire and sex are both natural things, just like love.\u201d Pei Tingsong said, \u201cThere are still a lot of books in my bookcase in the dorm. Whenever I miss you, I start writing some stuff, especially in the evening.\u201dDesire was the derivative of love, and the imagination in the poet\u2019s dream.\u201cDo you want to read them?\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s ears had turned completely red. He just kept looking at Pei Tingsong, unable to utter a word in reply. All because he could not deny that the moment he read Pei Tingsong\u2019s poem, his heart had fluttered.Who could refuse a poet\u2019s display of love?\u201cNext time\u00a0ba,\u201d Pei Tingsong kissed his side profile and his ear, softly whispering, \u201cNext time I\u2019ll read it out loud to you.\u201dClearly, he had just said \u2018next time\u2019, but the image that appeared in Fang Juexia\u2019s mind was that of a completely dark night. Was that the power of language? He, who had always kept himself detached and without desire, had now gradually begun loosening the net that confined him, peeling off his hard shell, and bit by bit, accepting the instinct of love and desire. It was so much like melting.The winter snow imprisoned by spring would become spring water one day\u00a0ba.As Pei Tingsong was softly kissing Fang Juexia, his cellphone, which was in his pocket, vibrated. He frowned at this interruption and took it out to see that it was Cheng Qiang calling, so he could only pick it up.\u201cHello, Qiang Ge.\u201d Pei Tingsong put on earphones while still holding Fang Juexia\u2019s face in his hand as he rubbed his lower lip with his thumb, his eyes full of him. \u201cReally? It\u2019s already settled then, did you tell Juexia?\u201dUpon hearing his name, Fang Juexia opened his eyes wider and tilted his head while looking at him. His appearance was so lovely that Pei Tingsong drew closer and kissed the corner of his eye.\u201cThen I\u2019ll tell him\u00a0ba. I\u2019ll let him come to my workshop later.\u201dWhen he heard Pei Tingsong lying, Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He bit the area around Pei Tingsong\u2019s thumb, making some kind of show of force. He also deliberately drew closer to Pei Tingsong\u2019s face, demonstrating that he was already in the workshop. Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help laughing and avoided him. Finally, Fang Juexia\u2019s face, that was already in his grasp, came ever so close.A bit of a temper rose, and Fang Juexia deliberately kissed him, blocking his mouth.Pei Tingsong was stunned for a moment. Cheng Qiang, on the other end of the call, heard him stop talking midway and asked him what happened. Pei Tingsong drew back a little bit. \u201cNothing, I was drinking some water.\u201dDrinking water?\u00a0Fang Juexia raised his eyebrows and pulled his cheek. Pei Tingsong was dealing with his agent on one end of the call while rubbing Fang Juexia\u2019s back on the other end to make him behave.\u201cUnderstood. I\u2019m writing lyrics right now, so I won\u2019t keep talking with you\u00a0ah. In a moment, he\u2019ll come.\u201dHe hurriedly hung up the call. Fang Juexia knew that the time for pranks was over and wanted to slip away quickly, but Pei Tingsong grabbed his waist and pressed him into the carpet, pretending to be fierce and threatening. \u201cYou are really getting stronger and stronger now. Do you not believe that I will punish you right here on the floor?\u201dFang Juexia replied seriously, with a smile, \u201cYou were the one who lied first, aren\u2019t you someone who wants to\u00a0keep it real?\u201dPei Tingsong immediately released him. \u201cOkay\u00a0ah, I\u2019m going to come out of the closet to Qiang Ge right now.\u201d\u201cHey, hey, hey.\u201d Fang Juexia gave up and softened, hugging his arm and getting up. \u201cWhat did Qiang Ge want with me just now? Is there something going on?\u201dOnly after Pei Tingsong sat down properly did he take a sip of the mung bean smoothie he had just placed on the ground. The ice had melted completely, and the sweetness pricked his throat.\u201cHe just said that there is a very good drama team coming to cooperate with us. The popular drama from last winter belongs to their company, and their summer one is a campus drama. After the producer heard the four songs of our demo, he very quickly took a fancy to yours.\u201dFang Juexia sort of couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cMy song?\u201d\u201cYes, yours.\u201d Pei Tingsong rubbed his face. \u201cYou\u2019re really good, a popular group took a fancy to you all of a sudden.\u201d\u201cBut there are no lyrics yet,\u201d No matter how he thought about it, Fang Juexia found it inconceivable. \u201cThe main song has to at least have lyrics.\u201d\u201cThey said they like this style, it\u2019s very special; the melody is an earworm and will definitely be popular. For the theme song of a TV drama, the best thing is for it to conform to the style of the script.\u201d As he said that, Pei Tingsong had already received the synopsis and the style description of the story that Cheng Qiang had just sent, as well as some TV drama materials. He turned on the computer to check.Fang Juexia drew close to see the name of the TV drama.\u00a0 \u201c\u2018Green Waves\u2019, it sounds like a literary film\u2019s name, but it\u2019s actually a campus drama.\u201dThe drama had a touch of mystery. It started with a series of stories about a suicide incident in a high school. The heroine was a good friend of the girl who had committed suicide, and after the girl died, she transferred to her friend\u2019s high school and met the secret love written about in her good friend\u2019s diary\u2014the male protagonist. In the process of searching for the truth about her friend\u2019s death, they revealed that her good friend\u2019s campus life for the past two years had been full of suffering and pain from being bullied.At the end of the story, it turned out that the female lead was actually the girl who had committed suicide. After her death, she was reborn as a person who did not exist in the world \u2013 the \u201cperfect friend\u201d that she had desperately wished and hoped for.\u201cIt\u2019s a great story.\u201d Fang Juexia inexplicably found himself\u00a0 really looking forward to it. Thinking that his song could become one of the interludes in such a drama, he felt a sense of encouragement.\u201cYes, it\u2019s said that it was written by a gold medal screenwriter.\u201d Pei Tingsong opened another document. \u201cHere are some script fragments. The crew said that they already have the theme song for the beginning of the TV series, and they want to match your song to the love parts. The romance between the male and female leads is relatively light, and this kind of melody, which is not too sweet but very emotional, is very suitable.\u201dFang Juexia looked at the key words in the style description: summer, first love, keep at arm\u2019s length, green and unripe, clean.\u201cIt feels like the lyrics are a little hard to write.\u201dPei Tingsong agreed. \u201cIf they let me write it by myself, it may be simpler. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve suddenly got assigned a topic for a composition.\u201d He thought of something. \u201cWhat was on your mind back when you wrote this song?\u201dThe sudden question caught Fang Juexia somewhat off guard. He thought carefully. \u201cIt seems\u2026I didn\u2019t think of anything.\u201d\u201cYou weren\u2019t thinking about anything while writing it? How is that possible?\u201d\u201cReally, I just wanted to write some melodies, and I already had some in my mind.\u201d Fang Juexia himself didn\u2019t feel that was very convincing, so he simply said, \u201cLeibniz\u00a0even said that music is the unconscious operation of mathematics in the soul.\u201dPei Tingsong was amused by him. \u201cAlright\u00a0ba, I\u2019ll just not expect to get any inspiration from you. I\u2019ll turn it over and over in my mind myself\u00a0ba.\u201dSeeing that he had begun to read the materials again, Fang Juexia also read them from his side and repeated the words, \u201cFirst love\u2026. Summer, a summer song. \u201cPei Tingsong suddenly noticed a sentence in the outline, which said that the hero actually also secretly loved the female lead. He thought, maybe he could write from the male lead\u2019s perspective.So he lay down on the table and asked Fang Juexia, \u201cWhen you see the words \u2018summer\u2019, \u2018first love\u2019, and the rest of these words, what picture appears in your mind?\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s thoughts on these words weren\u2019t very clear. Middle school was already a bit far away from him, and what\u2019s more, his life had always been a\u00a0fixed line. Looking back on his youth, most of it was filled with training.But if they were talking about first love, then for him, that must be connected to Pei Tingsong.He could recall every detail related to Pei Tingsong: the first time they met, the first time they quarreled, the first time he saw him smile, the first time he heard him apologize.The fall under the elevator, the confession in the dark corridor, the first time he heard him say that his birthmark was beautiful.The shadows of the amusement park, the embrace when falling from the sky, the soft dusk on the balcony\u2026.They were all vivid in his mind.\u201cFirst love is all the memories you gave me.\u201d Fang Juexia leaned on the table like him, and they looked at each other, \u201cThe dusk where we chatted about what true love was, the big, bright sun at the amusement park, the fireworks you showed me, the movies we watched when hiding in the hotel and your apartment, and the shady road where we want to walk hand in hand but can\u2019t.\u201cAs for summer\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia showed a smile, thinking of his saddest days, thinking of Pei Tingsong worn out by the journey and rushing back, but not daring to hold him.\u201cSummer is the rain you didn\u2019t let me get drenched in.\u201dLooking at his clear eyes, Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart was thickly filled with a stinging and swelling sensation.For him, first love was an open and bright date that they gave to each other.Suddenly inspired, Pei Tingsong quickly kissed Fang Juexia. \u201cI know, I have an idea.\u201d\u201cSo fast?\u201d Fang Juexia was very happy inside and thought that he was going to get to work now. \u201cThen I won\u2019t disturb you, I\u2019ll go back to dance.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Pei Tingsong grabbed his wrist and insisted on keeping him by his side. \u201cYou keep me company. I have many books, and you can read and keep me company for a while. It\u2019ll be very fast.\u201dFang Juexia felt that was strange, but Pei Tingsong was always so strange, especially when he was writing.\u201cThen you don\u2019t need me to help you?\u201d Fang Juexia pointed to the electronic piano. \u201cI can help play that melody for you.\u201dPei Tingsong took out his pen and paper and set his comfortable swivel chair aside for Fang Juexia. He pulled out a chair from under the workbench and sat down on it. \u201cYou\u2019re helping me just by staying with me.\u201dOkay ba,\u00a0Fang Juexia happily replied inside.Still afraid of disturbing him, he sat quietly as he took in everything on his desk carefully. There were all kinds of pens in the pen holder, some desk lamps with peculiar shapes, many stacked books, notebooks, notes, and a pile of recording equipment. There was even a microtonal sampler in there. Fang Juexia only remembered that it was very expensive and could be used to record some sounds that were difficult to record. He had heard He Ziyan talk about it before, but no one could buy it.It turned out that Pei Tingsong had one; when he went back, he needed to tell He Ziyan that there was no need to buy one now.Fang Juexia picked up\u00a0Poems by\u00a0Tsvetaeva\u00a0on the desk, and started reading it in silence, quietly keeping Pei Tingsong company by his side, waiting for him to write the lyrics.Thinking of Fang Juexia\u2019s words, Pei Tingsong followed his inspiration down its path and wrote. Every part of the melody was covered with words in his mind and gradually became more concrete, like a slow motion image appearing frame by frame, like a fragment of a story.It only took 20 minutes for him to write out all the lyrics. Pei Tingsong took the piece of paper and looked over it again and again, humming the tune in his heart and matching the words up to it.\u201cDone.\u201d It was only when he got out of the mood created by writing the lyrics that he discovered that Fang Juexia had fallen asleep nestled in his swivel chair. The poetry collection was spread out over his stomach, his chest was slightly undulating under his white shirt, and his breathing was steady.Pei Tingsong finally believed that there were certain kinds of people in this world who were born to be the muses of others.Back during the time when he had constantly been struggling against things, he had thought that only being a cynic was grand.But if Fang Juexia was here, his muse was here, and now Pei Tingsong only wanted to be a small-scale third rate artist.The workload for the mini-album was light, and Kaleido was always highly efficient when it came to creating music, so the preparatory work was completed soon. However, the producer for \u201cGreen Waves\u201d put forth a request for a Fang Juexia solo version of \u201cNight Trip\u201d to be part of the OST.This was also very common. Generally, a group song wouldn\u2019t be picked as the theme song for a drama, because the point of BGM itself was to let the audience enter the situation in a better way and ensure that they get absorbed by the emotions of the scene, and the frequent change of singers in a group song would likely fracture the audience\u2019s emotional foray into the scene. Star Chart expressed their understanding, and then specifically let Fang Juexia record a solo version. Pei Tingsong even proposed that he wanted to arrange the song again.The producers of the drama production team saw this sincerity, and repeatedly expressed their gratitude.After recording the song, Kaleido went to Qingdao specially to shoot the MV for the main song. Qingdao was green and very beautiful in summer. The picture of the six people running along the shady road of the Eight Great Passes, looking back and laughing together, was finally selected for the cover of the album \u201cLast Summer\u201c.Later, they heard that there would be many singers and popular groups releasing new albums in July. Out of fear of running into that, Star Chart finally chose to release the mini-album early. On June 20, it released its first wave of the main song.The main song \u201cLast Summer\u201d had a lively style, full of the summer feel and catchy. The first day\u2019s playback numbers broke \u201cBreak Through\u201d\u2019s record. Many people came to listen to it just because of the good reputation the last album had garnered.However, Kaleido\u2019s comeback this time didn\u2019t include many promotional performances, and so it lost out on a lot of exposure. Coupled with the achievements and staying power of the last album really being too large, it became very difficult for this one mini-album to surpass it all at once. For Kaleido, this was just a summer reward they had created for their fans, but for many people who were staring at their achievements, this undoubtedly became ammunition for mockery by their anti-fans.The audience numbers and amount of discussion for the mini-album were not as good as they had been for \u201cBreak Through\u201d, so these antis began to play up the theory of \u201cthey\u2019ve exhausted all of their tricks\u201d. The album sales were high, so they just said that mini-albums were cheap, with ten such albums being worth one of a main album, so there was no\u00a0value\u00a0there.But Kaleido and Star Chart didn\u2019t care about that very much. In order to promote the album, they participated in some more events, taking part in some reality shows and radio programs. The six members, who worked every day, simply didn\u2019t have the time to care about such stuff.The whole situation changed a few days later. Just as Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia had guessed before, \u201cGreen Waves\u201d really stood out from the many other idol dramas of mediocre quality, and soon became the top hot summer drama series.The drama\u2019s cinematography contained quite a lot of the cold tones found in the Japanese style of shooting, while the plot of the drama caught everyone\u2019s heart. Almost everyone was pursuing the drama online, and popular posts centered around \u201cGreen Waves\u201d emerged one after another. In addition, the episode with the highest rating was the one in which the male lead realized he loved the female lead: the two people, who rode bicycles to visit witnesses, met a group of children carrying fragrant flowers on the beach while on their way back to school; the flowers were tiny but beautiful.This scene was filmed very beautifully, and the youthful internal troubles being able to be seen with just a glance. The BGM for this scene was coincidentally Fang Juexia\u2019s solo version of \u201cNight Trip\u201d. The fusion between the music and the video was extremely wonderful, and in one move, this scene became the most famous scene out of the entire drama.Suddenly, this song that was composed and sung by Fang Juexia, and the lyrics for which were written by Pei Tingsong, entered the trending list for popular songs on major music platforms, and its playback numbers rose sharply. With the popularity of the drama, this song became the first pop song to go out of the entertainment circle in the summer, and its ranking exploded. All over the Internet were cover songs of this song, with snippets from this song becoming popular BGM for short video apps.The popularity of love songs was always higher than that of dance music. With this song being used in more popular videos, it not only saw a growth in its own popularity, but this also had an unexpected impact on the original version sung by six people. Together with \u2018Last Summer\u2019, the whole summer mini-album leaped into the rankings, and its sales broke through the barrier again.Because the songs were so popular, MLH\u2019s promotional singing program specially invited Kaleido to their studio to record a six person version of \u201cNight Trip\u201d for a special stage episode.For the TingJue CP fans, this song was even more special. Precisely because this was Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia\u2019s first cooperative piece.In order to celebrate the song breaking all these records, many TingJue CP stations also created a variety of corresponding peripheral items, and the TingJue God station named \u2018Snow Imprisoned in Spring\u2019 sent an even more meaningful gift.[@Snow Imprisoned in Spring CP station: In order to celebrate the success of our Geges\u2019 first cooperation, we specially contacted the Green Waves drama group, and after obtaining permission, we made two sets of summer school uniforms from the TV series (P1), including name-plates printed with the names of Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia (P2). Two lines of lyrics have been embroidered to the front of the two white shirts, with one line per shirt. Placing them together, it becomes complete (P3 details). Hoping Geges will like this special gift. We will always miss every night trip from when we were young.]On the day of the radio program, after the group members heard they could wear their own clothes, Fang Juexia put on the white shirt made by the Snow Imprisoned in Spring station, but he didn\u2019t wear the nameplate. He thought that no one would find out because he really had too many white shirts.Like Pei Tingsong, he had become a person who liked to \u201ccarry around contraband goods\u201d.The atmosphere while recording the radio program was very good. The host and the six people of Kaleido chatted like they were old friends chatting about the past; they also drank soda while talking about music and the past of their youths.They sang an acapella version of \u201cLast Summer\u201d live on the program, which was different from the original dance music style, for it was very gentle.After the main song was sung, the host cued into the audience interaction segment, randomly selecting some questions from the radio messages and posing them to Kaleido.\u201cFriend with the ID \u2018Forever Domino\u2019 says, \u2018I especially like the feel when Kaleido writes their own songs. This time, the style is very different from the previous album, and I like it a lot. I want to ask, do Geges have any creative stories to share?\u201dHe Ziyan said, \u201cFirst of all, thanking this fan. In fact, the song production of this album allowed us to play with a more creative space than that with the last two albums. Besides the composer of the main song being a producer from overseas, the other non-main songs were all works of our members, such as Juexia\u2019s \u201cNight Trip\u201d, Miaomiao\u2019s \u201cDaydream\u201d, and my \u201cSwimming Across this Sea\u201d, and the lyrics for these were as always, written by our Xiao Pei.\u201dLu Yuan nodded. \u201cXiao Pei made a big breakthrough this time. At the beginning, all of us were doubting whether he could even write love songs.\u201dPei Tingsong spread his hands. \u201cUsing actions to prove myself.\u201dJiang Miao said, \u201cThe arrangement of the solo version of \u2018Night Trip\u2019 was also completed by Xiao Pei. They say that there are many little details in it.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201d The host asked, \u201cCan you be specific?\u201d\u201cSpecific\u2026\u201d Pei Tingsong took a look at Fang Juexia and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a difference in the drumline between the solo version and six-person version of \u2018Night Trip,\u2019 everyone can listen to it. Little friends with sharp ears may find some small Easter eggs.\u201dLing Yi teased, \u201cTch, tch, selling some suspense.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s OK. If you guys can\u2019t hear it, you guys can ask him at the autograph session.\u201d\u201cHahahaha.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s glance in his direction before answering made Fang Juexia feel strange. Unconsciously, he became lost in thought. He began to think about the difference between the two versions.It seemed that the drumline in the solo version was a bit simpler.But was that all?The host continued, \u201cAudience member with ID \u2018Two Fire is my little baby\u2019\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish reading, Ling Yi couldn\u2019t hold back his laugh, and then everyone began to laugh.\u201cWhat are you laughing at? Can\u2019t I be a little baby?\u201d He Ziyan raised his eyebrow. \u201cLet me listen to what they said.\u201dThe host continued, \u201cShe said, \u2018Two Fire Ge, I\u2019m a senior high school student in Year Three who has just finished college entrance examinations. Now it\u2019s time to declare a major, and I have a major I really like in my heart, but my family has other ideas; they think another major has more prospects. Now I\u2019m so confused\u00a0ah, and I want to hear Gege\u2019s thoughts?\u201dFang Juexia said with a smile, \u201cThis is a tough problem.\u201d\u201cYes\u00a0ah, I thought you wanted me to tell a joke.\u201d He Ziyan spoke seriously after finishing his joke, \u201cIn fact, I guess your confusion isn\u2019t about the fact that you can\u2019t make a choice, but that you don\u2019t want to give up the decision you already have made in your heart.\u201dFang Juexia also agreed with his statement. Oftentimes, when people said things were very hard and they were very hesitant about it, it was because, in fact, they had long ago made up their minds.\u201cIf you already have the answer in your heart, you must work hard to try it out. Even if you fail in the end, you will not regret it. If you listen to others and choose the direction you don\u2019t like, it\u2019ll be very hard to stick to it. Looking back, it may become the most regretful thing in your life.\u201dThen He Ziyan laughed again. \u201cThis is my very casual and irresponsible suggestion\u00a0ah. Everyone will find themselves being confused during this period of time. For the past 20 or so years, I have been confused the whole time, and I had no family to help make decisions for me, but I have also gotten through that time. Don\u2019t be afraid; bravely going to do things is the only way.\u201dNo family.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgHearing him lightly sketch out his past, Fang Juexia felt a little distressed. He didn\u2019t know much more about He Ziyan\u2019s youth than these fans did. He Ziyan didn\u2019t talk about it often, and normally, he was always joking around, like he had no worries.But Fang Juexia also knew that no one would really be devoid of any worries in life.The host sighed. \u201cEveryone\u2019s youth, every youth\u2019s summer, maybe there are many stories\u00a0ba. Only by moving forward will there be a bright future.\u201dHe continued, \u201cAudience member with ID \u2018Green Light of Summer Years\u2019 said, \u2018Hello, I\u2019m a fan of Kaleido and also a fan of the drama \u2018Green Waves.\u2019 Today is my birthday, and I\u2019d like to ask Juexia Gege to sing \u2018Night Trip\u2019, is that okay?\u2019\u201dWhen Fang Juexia heard this, he asked, \u201cBy myself?\u201dJiang Miao turned his head and gestured to him. \u201cGo ahead\u00a0ba. Ling Yi sang his OST last time.\u201d\u201cYes\u00a0ah.\u201d Ling Yi saw a guitar to the side and suggested, \u201cHow about Xiao Pei goes along\u00a0ba, he can play the guitar.\u201dSo they hastility started up an acoustic solo version of \u201cNight Trip\u201d. Pei Tingsong took the guitar, plucked the strings and looked at Fang Juexia.Fang Juexia nodded. The sound of the guitar was very gloomy, and suddenly, the atmosphere in the studio turned into one of several people sitting around on the grass while listening to music.\u201cYour window under the scorching sun, go thereBicycles circling the tree lined road whereWhen you have time, the back seat is shining fairDusk is no different affairThe light shining on you and your hairJust becomes different, I swear.\u201dHis voice was very special; it was cold, but when singing such a love song, it contained a more subtle and hard to describe feel to it, which made it different from when others sang the song.Originally, it started off with a somewhat sad melody, piled with green and romantic words, but it gradually became a lot gentler.Pei Tingsong played the guitar and occasionally looked up at him. When their gazes connected, they smiled.\u201cStay away from other people\u2019s eyes hereWandering around an abandoned amusement park whereThe sunburn on your cheekbones thereIs as beautiful as a kiss with due careDo you like fireworksI hope that\u2019s the case here.\u201dBack when Fang Juexia had written this song, he had only relied on his pure musical talent and instinct to create it. The melody was very good, but there was no soul to support it from beginning to end, not until Pei Tingsong filled it with lyrics. Only then did it become complete.\u201cThe heat burns the moon\u00a0fairShining debris falling into the waves\u2019 lairSweat is always transparent, wet and white and bareCrying cicadas cover up desire hereFlowers eat the sunshine of July airThe fragrance of your neck weaves a net of dreams rare.\u201dAs he sang, Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help but think of when he had woken up in that small workshop and gotten the lyrics, and how his heart had sped up.\u201cReally? Will it rain tonight?I\u2019m beginning to hate the rainCycling home will drench your shirt, right?The coastline is overgrown with green algae, like my wishful thoughts of youFlowers suddenly bloom, want to kiss your heart, nowhere to hide from view.\u201dPei Tingsong was playing the guitar while singing the harmony for Fang Juexia in his own low voice, perfectly integrating into the song. In the solo version of the OST, the harmony was also sung by him.\u201cWait? Let the day go dark again, I pleaI\u2019m starting to like the nightWill darkness make you try to rely on me?Don\u2019t want the heat wave to end, why can\u2019t July stretch out of sightWhen we hold hands, my chest is hot, and I\u2019m holding pure white light.\u201dAll the things they had experienced together, all those memories that were vivid in their minds, they were all cut into countless fragmented metaphors by Pei Tingsong and inserted into the song, like a chaotic jigsaw puzzle. Putting it all together, it seemed to have nothing to do with them, and only seemed to be a story about first love. Besides them, no one else could trace the origin of this song back to its source.\u201cIf asked who you are going on a date with tonightAnswer with a smile, it\u2019s the moon lit brightYou blame me for being good at lying, alrightI say summer is so long and a delight.\u201dNobody knew, but everybody sang along.\u2014The author has something to say:As usual, putting the full version of the lyrics below ~ Warning you that it\u2019s long, there\u2019s still time to scroll away now, babies.Everyone can compare the lyrics with the part where they were discussing things in the workshop, and you will discover more~<<Night Trip>>Composition: Fang JuexiaLyrics: Pei TingsongArrangement: Pei TingsongThe right of final interpretation: Zhi ChuYour window under the scorching sun, go thereBicycles circling the tree lined road whereWhen you have time, the back seat is shining fairDusk is no different affairThe light shining on you and your hairJust becomes different, I swearStay away from other people\u2019s eyes hereWandering around an abandoned amusement park whereThe sunburn on your cheekbones thereIs as beautiful as a kiss with due careDo you like fireworksI hope that\u2019s the case here.The heat burns the moon fairShining debris falling into the waves\u2019 lairSweat is always transparent, wet and white and bareCrying cicadas cover up desire hereFlowers eat the sunshine of July airThe fragrance of your neck weaves a net of dreams rareReally?

Fang Juexia took it naturally and after taking a small sip, handed it back to him. Pei Tingsong blocked this action with his wrist, urging him to take another sip in a low voice.Only then did Fang Juexia take another mouthful before putting the water bottle on the table.The host continued to read the messages being sent by the audience. \u201cA listener with the ID \u2018Peanut Smoothie\u2019 asked, \u2018I want to ask the little group leader what his deepest summer memory is?\u2019\u201dPei Tingsong grabbed the water bottle, took a big gulp himself, and then screwed the bottle shut.Jiang Miao, who had been named, spoke into the microphone, \u201cThank you for asking.\u201dHis deepest summer memory.He thought about it, and his eyes turned soft. \u201cMy deepest memory should be the scene of eating watermelon with my little sister. We grew up in my uncle\u2019s house, so it was a bit different from other children\u2026.\u201dHe hesitated for a moment, and then laughed. \u201cI remember, back during my first year of junior high, I came back from studying one night, and since the school was a little far away from where we lived, it was already very late by the time I got home. However, it turned out that my little sister hadn\u2019t slept yet. Instead, she quietly snuck out of her bed with a bowl in her arms and came into my room.\u201cThe watermelon in the bowl was the portion she had saved for me after dinner, instead of eating it herself. However, she was too young to know that when the weather was hot, watermelon had to be kept in the refrigerator, so the portion she had for me had already gotten a bit stale. But in order to make her happy, I still ate it. We sat facing each other on the bed, and she laughed at me and told me that she had dug out the seeds and buried them in the flowerpot. Then, while eating, when I found another seed, she became very angry and said the watermelon was insidious.\u201dFang Juexia looked at Jiang Miao. He was very seldom emotional, but unlike Fang Juexia\u2019s cold and introverted self, Jiang Miao was always steady and self-sustaining. He would take the overall situation into consideration and protect every member; this was already his nature, carved straight into his bones.But, in fact, he had suffered a lot in his youth\u00a0ba.After saying that, Jiang Miao laughed and looked at the host. \u201cI feel like that is the best watermelon I\u2019ve ever eaten.\u201dFang Juexia, who didn\u2019t like talking much, suddenly spoke up, \u201cIf Miao Ge and I had known each other when we were at school, we would have been good friends.\u201dJiang Miao looked at him and said with a smile, \u201cYes, we would have been classmates with the best relationship.\u201dThese words weren\u2019t false.Back when the group had first been formed, he and Jiang Miao were the first members to have been finalized before the group\u2019s debut. At that time, they often had meals together, and he had gotten to know a lot about Jiang Miao\u2019s past through their conversations. If Jiang Miao had not been forced to, he might not have made a debut in an idol group at all.Fang Juexia knew that back then, in order to raise his little sister, Jiang Miao had done a lot of things, such as working some jobs, working as an anchor, playing guzheng for people in livestreams, and that he had also received a lot of contemptuous looks and bad comments. The environment he had grown up in had caused him to mature earlier than others, and had allowed him to become a person who can protect others.But he had also been just a teenager at that time.He Ziyan patted Jiang Miao on the shoulder and said, \u201cAs Yao Mei\u2019s gossip boyfriend, I want to clarify that this Meimei has been silly since she was a child. In a way, she is very similar to her big brother.\u201dLing Yi laughed and said, \u201cYao Mei is now in her rebellious phase, be careful or else she\u2019ll hit you.\u201dHe Ziyan retorted back, \u201cWhat am I afraid of? There are too many people undergoing their rebellious phase around me. I even share a room in the dorm with the rebellious child.\u201dPei Tingsong hit him with the little doll in his hand. \u201cHow much do you owe me for my appearance?\u201dEveryone laughed and created a fuss while talking as usual.The host then threw the question to Lu Yuan, who was sitting right beside him. \u201cIs there anything profound that Lu Yuan remembers about summer?\u201d\u201cSummer\u2026\u201d Lu Yuan looked up at the ceiling and said, \u201cI won a prize a few years ago during the summer. At that time, I was still very young and didn\u2019t really understand everything that was going on, and so the subsequent developments caught me like a runaway horse, with nothing being under my control at all.\u201dAfter saying that, he laughed a bit. \u201cWhen you feel like you\u2019ve won everything, and then you lose everything at the same time and become all alone, that feeling was a very hard thing for me to accept. I was depressed for a long time after that. It was only when I came to Kaleido through a strange combination of circumstances that I discovered that God is actually fair. He takes things away from you, but as long as you don\u2019t give up, he will give you better stuff in return.\u201dThis was a very frank remark, and Lu Yuan didn\u2019t launch an attack against his former bros who had kicked him out of the dance group with this topic. He also didn\u2019t indulge himself in past glories. He had reached the point where he could recall his youth peacefully.\u201cNow that I think about it, I actually miss that summer of the competition a lot. There were so many people working hard together, chasing dreams together. I\u2019m now a judge, and when I go to watch the contestants compete, it\u2019s like I\u2019m looking at myself from back then. So I tell all of them\u2014 \u2018The result isn\u2019t actually what\u2019s important, what\u2019s truly important is every moment you are in.\u2019\u201dIt was rare for Lu Yuan to not indulge in crosstalk or crack jokes on purpose. On the contrary, he was very serious as he recalled the events of that summer.\u201cSo what that summer taught me was that people are very easily separated. Sometimes, it\u2019s because no one did anything wrong, but as we keep walking, we just separate from each other. So, we must cherish everyone who is still around us.\u201dFate was a huge wave, and human beings were tiny existences in front of such waves. They could only be pushed forth, either in the form of groups, or even scattered individually.These six people with different personalities were the kind who were pushed together.The host agreed with him very much. \u201cVery emotional\u00a0ah, this segment.\u201dLing Yi also said with a smile, \u201cHow come today\u2019s program isn\u2019t much like Kaleido at all?\u201dPei Tingsong said, \u201cEvery time we accidentally fall into an emotional segment, we quickly try to retreat, so it\u2019s still very much Kaleido.\u201d\u201cHahahaha.\u201dThe host continued, \u201cThe audience member with the id \u2018It\u2019s a long time until Pinot Tree is full-grown\u2019\u2026\u201dLing Yi started laughing out loud. \u201cI can sing this audience member\u2019s ID.\u201dFang Juexia looked at Pei Tingsong beside him. \u201cThey must be looking for you.\u201dPei Tingsong shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m the king of nicknames.\u201dThe host was also amused. \u201cThe audience member said, \u201cXiao Pei was only 17 years old when he joined Kaleido. He had been living abroad all the way before that, and I\u2019d like to know what his original thought process had been when he had to come to Kaleido?\u201dAfter listening to this question, Fang Juexia first started sweating. Pei Tingsong hadn\u2019t joined a boyband voluntarily; in fact, to tell the truth, Fang Juexia was the only one in the entire group who had wanted to be an idol from the beginning to the end.Pei Tingsong was an accident within accidents.\u201cWhen I first arrived, Kaleido had actually already been formed.\u201d Pei Tingsong spoke directly, without thinking much about it. \u201cAll their plans had been formulated to fit a five person group, and the configuration was very complete; they already had the lead dancer, lead singer, rapper, and face of the group. My joining them was quite sudden at that time, and it also caused a lot of trouble for everyone. The choreographed main dance, which should have been in a line shape, and the main song for the debut, both of them fell through unexpectedly, and we had to change to a new one.\u201dThis was the first time that the rest of Kaleido had heard Pei Tingsong apologize for how he had originally parachuted in. Everyone was a little surprised.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that,\u201d Ling Yi said. \u201cWhen we heard a new Didi was coming, we were really happy. We just didn\u2019t expect this Didi to be so tall\u2026\u201d\u201cHahahaha.\u201dPei Tingsong also laughed. \u201cMy original thought process about this was actually not good; I had a lot of prejudices, and using the words \u2018young and frivolous\u2019 to describe my attitude back then would be too nice. At that time, my definition of dreams was very narrow, and I put up a lot of self-righteous resistance. After my family member, who loved me the most, passed away, I felt like a lonely bird in a cage; I wanted to fly out, but I just couldn\u2019t.\u201cWhen I was a teenager, I went to the underground rap scene. You know, the environment there was very chaotic and crazy.\u201d He shook his head slightly. \u201cSo later, my Jie came to find me and scolded me.\u201dHe Ziyan was startled. \u201cThere are actually people who dare to scold you\u00a0ah.\u201dLu Yuan laughed. \u201cHahahaha, what\u2019s the matter? Can\u2019t you let people express their feelings?\u201dFang Juexia looked at Pei Tingsong. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d\u201cShe said that for people like me, dreams already no longer counted as being a luxury, and that it was my own arrogance trapping me. She wanted me to see the real world.\u201dTo try and pursue your dreams like an ordinary person.Jiang Miao\u2019s tone was mild. \u201cAlthough this sounds a little harsh, it really was good for you.\u201dThe entertainment circle was an extreme miniature of a small world, a petri dish filled with good and evil. Pei Tingsong was a cynical idealist, who, whilst embracing his own rebellious view of the truth, had fallen from the sky into the ups and downs of this small world.\u201cMaybe\u00a0ba.\u201d Pei Tingsong shrugged. \u201cBut even she may have not imagined that I would be so lucky.\u201dIt was originally a trial to 'see the world\u201d, but he ended up falling into this group, which contained these kind and brave people.Falling right in front of Fang Juexia.Fang Juexia turned his head and asked him, \u201cHow is the real world?\u201dPei Tingsong smiled and nodded. \u201cVery good.\u201dOnly in the real world can I meet you, so no matter how hard it is, it\u2019s good.The radio program was being broadcast in real time, and the program team also edited and put together a special version with video, publishing it on their website. That night, several members of Kaleido went onto the Hot Search list, with tags like #Jiang Miao\u2019s Family#, #Lu Yuan\u2019s Championship#, and #Acoustic Version of \u2018Night Trip\u2019# trending.In the eyes of most netizens, the Kaleido group had many inherent labels, such as 'strong abilities\u201d, \u201cnot like a boyband\u201d, \u201ccrosstalk group\u201d, and so on. They were always said to be beautiful, strong, and pitiful, and even though they were called unlucky, they rarely came out to talk about their pasts themselves. If it hadn\u2019t been for the fact that the theme of this program was [Summer Youth], they might not have recalled their past in public.This program also allowed more people to understand the past experiences of the members, thereby letting them see not only what they were like when performing on stage, but rather the real Kaleido.[@Need to be an upright person: After listening to some of their clips and then listening to the songs, I\u2019m feeling very emotional. Every one of us can\u2019t return to a certain summer, and when we were young, we always thought that we were the world. However, it was only when we kept going forward that we realized that the world was so big and we were so small.][@7788 is not 6: This group really moves people, P.S. \u201cNight Trip\u201d is really wonderful, FJX\u2019s voice is amazing.][@Is it raining today: Before, whenever Kaleido was mentioned, I only thought about FJX and PTS, but after listening to this radio program, I\u2019ve suddenly fallen in love with the leader of the group. How gentle\u00a0ah.][@Online waiting for a boyfriend: I used to watch Lu Yuan\u2019s performance in that competition, but after the competition finished, a lot of things happened, and so there was no follow-up. Later, I saw him in Kaleido, and I was very surprised. Sure enough, some people are destined to succeed.][@Never shipping\u00a0RPS\u00a0again: Has my CP brain worked against me again? Why do I feel that the atmosphere when PTS and FJX were singing \u2018Night Trip\u2019 was especially subtle\u00a0ah? Is it this song being a filter? I\u2019m plainly not their\u00a0CPF\u00a0ah!][@Lolololololo replying to @Never shipping RPS again: I also think so\u2026. (whisper, only-fans Jiejies, don\u2019t flame me, my idol can flame better than you)][@Hidden secret: The previous \u201cBreak Through\u201d gave off a tragic feel of them fighting with their backs against the water, but seeing these boys singing while chatting on the radio, gently comforting the audience, and sharing their stories, I got the feeling like they were just my friends, seated next to me, so I felt a lot closer to them. I have to admit that I learned about this group only after listening to \u201cNight Trip\u201d. In the beginning, I couldn\u2019t imagine that this was a boyband song, but now after watching this program, my thoughts have undergone a lot of changes. I hope they will get better and better and have more good works.]The effect of the song \u201cNight Trip\u201d on the audience was very successful in driving the whole album of \u201cLast Summer\u201d into popularity, as it attracted many music lovers who weren\u2019t so sure about the usual boyband style. Originally, they had created this summer mini-album with the core idea of creating more niche music. They hadn\u2019t intended for it to make it to the Hot Search list, so they had played around with many new styles and types of music arrangement, giving it a more experimental feel overall.However, this new attempt was widely praised by music critics, while also breaking their inherent impression of the music created by boybands.[@Verified Little Fish chats about music: After listening to Kaleido\u2019s \u2018Last Summer,\u2019 even though there are only four songs in the whole album, the contents are very rich. The lyrics are all good, and Pei Tingsong finally broke through his previous works this time, changing from a rebellious boy to a gentle narrator; it was very surprising.The level of arrangement in the main song is very rich, and the atmosphere created by the drum set is very strong. In particular, there is a sound that is very similar to the sound of dulcimer, it sounds especially fresh. The piano cover in the chorus part gives off the feeling of the rainy season in summer. Seeing that He Ziyan completed the music arrangement independently, you have to praise him for the great progress he has made.About the European electronic style \u2018Daydream,\u2019 its psychedelic arrangement and lyrics fit its daydreaming mood very well, especially the part that loops. And there\u2019s \u2018Swim Across the Sea\u2019 that comes off with a bit of a country music style; it\u2019s very rare for a boyband to try this style. The guitar is good, and it captures the hot feeling of summer well. The whole song is like a picture, with the country, the ocean, endless sun, and sunburnt shoulders.Finally, I have already praised \u2018Night Trip.\u2019 Fang Juexia\u2019s talent for composing music has gone beyond many people\u2019s expectations. This kind of sensitivity and creativity in the melody is very vital. Compared with the six-person version, I think the solo version has more soul, and while the arrangement is very depressing and addictive, this is the trade-off between two very good versions.Generally speaking, this is an album that you can listen to without any prejudices. It can be said that after Kaleido came out with \u2018Break Through\u2019, an excellent work from a standard boyband group, they came out with their own high-leveled answer. I appreciate their attitude towards creating original music and believe that there will be even better works from them in the future.]Having gotten a lot of good reviews from professional music critics, this album became the summer\u2019s dark horse. From the public\u2019s point of view, the most difficult thing for a boyband was to have a national track that managed to get out of the circle. Including \u201cBreak Through\u201d as well, Kaleido currently boasted of two masterpieces. After its initial burst of popularity, it now showed off a stable fan-base, and the saying that they were \u201ca flash in the plan\u201d collapsed in on itself.What\u2019s more, with Kaleido being this kind of boyband that was in charge of their creative works, as long as they kept creating such songs, they did not have to fear a decline in popularity.Cheng Qiang walked into the dressing room and clapped his hands. \u201cAfter a while, the new album\u2019s face-to-face meetup will be over, and we will directly have a celebration banquet.\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cWhat are we eating, what are we eating?\u201d\u201cLing Yi, you just know how to eat.\u201d\u201cBarbecue\u00a0ba, Qiang Ge.\u201d He Ziyan leaned back on the chair and projected a pleading look at Cheng Qiang.\u201cAlright\u00a0ah.\u201d Cheng Qiang crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cThey can, but you eat less. You\u2019re going to be filming a drama soon, so you have to do a good job with weight management.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dPei Tingsong had already finished his make-up and hair, and had been scrolling through Weibo on the sofa for a long time now. Fang Juexia also took a seat beside him after getting his hair blown out. Since only the two of them were on the sofa, Fang Juexia nudged Pei Tingsong\u2019s foot with his own.After looking down, Pei Tingsong raised his eyes again, looked at Fang Juexia, and praised, \u201cToday\u2019s hairstyle looks really good.\u201dI didn\u2019t come here to ask for your praise, Fang Juexia said in his heart.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cAre you scrolling through Weibo?\u201dPei Tingsong nodded, thought of something, and then drew especially close to his ear to tell him, \u201cThe thing with you wearing the \u2018Snow Imprisoned in Spring\u2019 station shirt, they picked it out.\u201d\u201cWhat??\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cHow can that be?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help laughing as he explained, \u201cCP fans all carry around a microscope to find fluff with. They can even start licking up fluff from the tip of a knife, and you\u2019re fighting with them.\u201dFang Juexia still couldn\u2019t understand how he had been found out. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t even wear the nameplate\u00a0ah. That shirt was similar to all my other white shirts, and I even took some out to compare before wearing it. How did they find out?\u201d\u201cLook.\u201d Pei Tingsong handed him his cellphone. On the screen was a Weibo post made by a TingJue girl.[@Helping TingJue keep the closet door shut every day: Sisters! Beautiful Baby at the radio station was absolutely wearing the clothes sent by @Snow Imprisoned in Spring CP station! Look at the picture I screenshotted, it\u2019s a close-up of Baby singing. The embroidery at the front are clearly words! I used\u00a0PS\u00a0to process it, and I can see some clear words in P2, and there\u2019s the word \u2018summer\u2019 there! (today is another day when I don\u2019t fulfill my ID\u2019s duty) [picture] [picture]]Fang Juexia clicked open the picture and enlarged it.God, it was actually true; he had thought they wouldn\u2019t be able to see it clearly.He couldn\u2019t help scrolling through the comments.[@When I\u2019m\u00a0deaf, I\u2019m happy: My God, I never thought that this amazing giant fluff would be given by our beautiful eustoma. Who would dare to believe it\u2026.]Why can\u2019t you believe it?\u00a0Fang Juexia was puzzled.[@Ordinary TingJue girl: It\u2019s really the white shirt embroidered with the sentence, \u201cI say summer is so long and a delight\u201d! God, I love FJX forever, the beautiful baby is so brave!][@TJSZD: This is really a two-way relationship\u2026.How can I be getting done by TingJue?][@The Fine Jeweled Xeriscape around the Pinot Tree Supreme: So sweet, wuwuwu, the compilation of the radio fluff spots next door adds up to 15 minutes, sisters, go watch it! When the wolf cub played the guitar, he looked at Juexia Gege 17 times. There were too many small movements, and they are completely a warm, in love\u00a0xql\u00a0ah!]Was-was it so obvious?Fang Juexia felt some guilt, as if he had been caught doing something bad. He put the cellphone into Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand and said, \u201cNot reading anymore.\u201d\u201cRead enough\u00a0ah?\u201dFang Juexia thought that his own contraband goods had been so obviously caught, but Pei Tingsong\u2019s weren\u2019t.Because he was too cunning.Wait.\u00a0Fang Juexia suddenly thought of something. \u201cHow did you know that they had discovered the shirt?\u201dPei Tingsong was stunned upon being interrogated so suddenly. \u201cThat\u2026\u201dWhen the last person\u2019s styling was finished, Cheng Qiang urged them to prepare for the meetup. Pei Tingsong used this as a pretext to duck away, but was caught by Fang Juexia, who stood up at the same time. \u201cTalk.\u201d\u201cI-I just follow some CP stations.\u201d\u201cFollow?\u201d Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t believe his own ears. \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Pei Tingsong explained immediately, \u201cMy side account is following them.\u201dFang Juexia felt this was even more unbelievable. \u201cYou even have a side account? Are you not afraid of people digging it out?\u201d\u201cWhat do I have to be afraid of?\u201d Pei Tingsong shrugged, grabbed his wrist, and walked through the dark passageway of the dressing room. \u201cI never curse out people in my side account, only in my main account.\u201dWho did it like that?Fang Juesha expressionlessly put forth an illogical request. \u201cShow me your side account.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t do.\u201d Then Pei Tingsong called out to Xiao Wen and transferred his cellphone to their assistant on the grounds that the meetup was about to start.Cunning. He was really cunning.The venue of this meetup was a little different from those held before. Star Chart had reserved a large cafe with many green plants spread about, a large projection screen was set as the center of the stage, and it was like a music salon. Not many fans had been invited, but the whole event was being livestreamed so that all the other fans could see it.The six of them were all dressed in very simple summer clothes, and they came down from the second floor to greet their fans. The fans tried hard to control their screams as they waved at them.Sitting on the six high stools in front of the projection screen, according to their official positions, Ling Yi, who had gotten the microphone, said, \u201cThere is no host today.\u201dHe Ziyan said, \u201cMaybe the company has finally realized that it\u2019s a waste of money to invite a host for us.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dJiang Miao looked to the members seated on the left and right to him. \u201cLet\u2019s say hello to the fans first\u00a0ba, one, two, three\u2026\u201d\u201cHello, everyone! We are Kaleido!\u201dThe fans, who were just a few meters apart from them, also followed them to make the K gesture.Jiang Miao, as the official spokesman, continued after greeting, \u201cFirst of all, thank you all very much for your support for \u2018Last Summer.\u2019 We have also received many excellent comments.\u201dOne fan yelled, \u201cYou\u2019ve been nominated for the BMA!\u201d BMA stood for the Best Music Awards. At present, it was the most authoritative music award ceremony in the Chinese-speaking circles, and included many categories of awards.\u201cReally?\u201d Ling Yi asked without thinking.\u201cHahahaha, what\u2019s the matter with you guys?\u201dLu Yuan was also a little confused. \u201cNo, we really don\u2019t know. Qiang Ge also didn\u2019t say anything\u00a0ah.\u201dNot far away, Cheng Qiang stood up and expressed that he also didn\u2019t know about this.\u201cThe list just came out!\u201d That particular fan raised their cell phone with a smile.Only then did the six of them nod, and then Ling Yi suddenly turned to hold Fang Juexia\u2019s hand. \u201cCongratulations, congratulations.\u201d He turned to the other side and shook Lu Yuan\u2019s hand. \u201cCongratulations, congratulations.\u201d\u201cCongratulations to you too, congratulations to you too.\u201d The stage suddenly turned into a strange scene where six people were congratulating each other.\u201cEnough, we\u2019re acting as if we got the real prize.\u201d Pei Tingsong said disdainfully. \u201cHopefully anti-fans won\u2019t start mocking us online about getting an award on loan.\u201dThe fans laughed loudly. \u201cPei Tingsong, how can you be so practiced!\u201d\u201cPracticed to the point that people feel distressed!\u201d\u201cHahahaha!\u201dAfter causing enough of a fuss, Jiang Miao returned to the main topic again. \u201cThen our first song today is still our main song \u2018Last Summer.\u2019\u201d He turned to the music conductor behind him and said, \u201cTeachers\u00a0can all start now.\u201dThe music started, and the six of them sang the main song while seated on high stools in this cafe filled with a summer atmosphere. Then, the scene from \u201cGreen Waves\u201d with \u201cNight Trip\u201d playing as BGM was shown on the screen, and the six people watched it with relish.Fang Juexia watched the short clip. The male and female leads, dressed in school uniforms, stopped riding their bikes and walked across the lawn. The accompaniment was right in their ears at this moment, and it created a youthful, heart pounding atmosphere. He couldn\u2019t help thinking of what Pei Tingsong had said about the accompaniment on the radio program.The drumming in this version was really different from the six-person version. It wasn\u2019t as complicated, but the rhythm was a bit special.Vaguely realising something, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t take up his microphone, and drew close to Pei Tingsong\u2019s ear. \u201cThe rhythm of this drum is very special.\u201dPei Tingsong turned his chair so that he could face Fang Juexia with a smile. \u201cYou can hear that?\u201dFang Juexia looked into his eyes. \u201cWhat drum is it?\u201dOn the screen, the backs of two hands were shown close to each other as they kept brushing against one another and then separating, with fingertips restlessly moving, wanting to grasp each other in the desire to hold hands under the moonlight.\u201cThe afternoon I wrote the lyrics, when you fell asleep\u2026\u201d His voice was light and slow, and every word was fatally matched with the drumbeat being played out in the accompaniment. In full view of the public, he confessed to the moonlight.\u201cI sampled your heartbeat.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Unexpectedly, it had actually been used on himself.The background music of \u201cNight Trip\u201d was still ringing in his ears. Every \u201cdrumbeat\u201d that had been arranged by Pei Tingsong corresponded to the restless heart in his chest beat by beat; it was amazing. This was his melody, the rhythm of his heart, and line after line of hidden meaning being narrated by Pei Tingsong\u2019s lyrics.His heart beat and the drum beat synchronized, both beating with full vitality.Their song was alive, as was their love.This was the first time Fang Juexia found himself at a loss on what was best to do because of having been taken too seriously, and he did not know what his next course of action should be.At the end of the song, the fans gathered around and started clapping, thus awakening Fang Juexia from his indulgence.Ling Yi took the microphone and asked, \u201cSounds nice\u00a0ba? You guys all chase the show?\u201d\u201cWe chase it!\u201d\u201cOur members have begun to try the drama route.\u201d Lu Yuan took over the conversation and said, \u201cBoth Miao Ge and Fire Ge are starting to step into new fields.\u201dJiang Miao smiled and waved his hand. He Ziyan said straightforwardly, \u201cNot quite worthy of that yet.\u201d\u201cWorthy!\u201d the fans yelled.Pei Tingsong picked up the microphone. \u201cHow can it sound so much like you\u2019re\u00a0cursing\u00a0someone out?\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201dFang Juexia also picked up the microphone, but he was talking to everyone seriously, \u201cThis is the first time Miao Ge is participating in a film shoot. I heard that there was a lot asked of him during the audition, but he managed to pass it smoothly. Let\u2019s give Miao Ge a little applause.\u201dThe fans applauded with great cooperation.Jiang Miao immediately explained, \u201cActually, there wasn\u2019t. Because the theme of the film is about music, they needed someone who could play the guzheng.\u201dLu Yuan added, \u201cDidn\u2019t they also need someone with a good appearance and clean temperament? Three Water is especially suitable to play that kind of male college student, the pure male college student.\u201d\u201cHahahaha!\u201dFang Juexia said very seriously, \u201cZiyan will join the drama group the day after tomorrow, so let\u2019s give Ziyan a little applause too.\u201dHe Ziyan laughed. \u201cJuexia is a ruthless applause cueing machine today.\u201d\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dBut Fang Juexia still remained very serious. \u201cIt\u2019s your first time, so we have to encourage you well. Your very first acting role is in a big urban drama production.\u201dPei Tingsong was amused by the way Fang Juexia was cheering on his teammates wholeheartedly, so he picked up the microphone and asked him, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Juexia Ge go act, with him being so attractive, it\u2019s a bit of a waste for him not to act.\u201dThe fans\u2019 wishes were even stronger than his, and they agreed excitedly, \u201cYes\u00a0ah!\u201d\u201cWe want to see Juexia Ge act!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too wasteful not to show this face in an idol drama!\u201dFang Juexia had never been very good at facing sudden enthusiasm. \u201cEn\u2026 I feel like I may not be very good at it, and on my face\u2026\u201d\u201cStop it.\u201d Pei Tingsong directly cut off his words. He asked first, \u201cDo you guys think the birthmark on Juexia\u2019s face looks good?\u201dAfter that, he stretched the microphone out towards the audience, and the fans close by yelled in unison, \u201cLooks good\u2014\u201dThe other members also joined in, \u201cIt looks so good\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cLike a flower petal.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the\u00a0finishing touch\u00a0to a painting, okay?\u201dLing Yi nodded. \u201cYes\u00a0ah, when I saw Juexia for the first time, holy shit\u00a0ya, I was so shocked at that time. How could there be such a beautiful boy\u00a0ah?\u201dJiang Miao said with a smile, \u201cSo that\u2019s why you proposed to live in the same room as Juexia.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Ling Yi didn\u2019t hide it. \u201cI\u2019m just such an appearance dog. When I came to know about the dormitory arrangements, I immediately told Qiang Ge that my first choice was Juexia, followed by Jiang Miao.\u201dLu Yuan first deliberately let out a \u201cohho\u201d sound, and He Ziyan soon followed his example, \u201cOhho!\u201dFang Juexia, who didn\u2019t know the inside story behind the dormitory room arrangements, was a little surprised. \u201cYou took the initiative? I thought rooms were randomly assigned.\u201dPei Tingsong suddenly reached out and pulled him. \u201cHey, that\u2019s not fair, someone walked through different channels\u00a0ah. I\u2019m applying for redistribution of the dorm rooms, and we\u2019re drawing lots.\u201d\u201cCome on\u00a0ba, you.\u201d He Ziyan mercilessly complained, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember how unlucky your hands are? Go along obediently with Ge\u00a0ba, Gege won\u2019t treat you unfairly.\u201d\u201cTch.\u201dFang Juexia suddenly remembered the topic of acting they were discussing just now, so he flipped the question onto Pei Tingsong. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go act?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t want to.\u201d Pei Tingsong simply refused. This reminded He Ziyan of a particularly funny past event, and he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to start digging through old accounts\u00a0ah.\u201dLing Yi, who had just taken a mouthful of ice mocha, realized what He Ziyan wanted to do, so he rushed to add on, \u201cI know! Xiao Pei\u2019s dark history!\u201dHow does everyone know?\u00a0Fang Juexia still found it a bit inexplicable.However, that he didn\u2019t know things about Pei Tingsong was true, for in the past, he had avoided him, so naturally, he wouldn\u2019t know his dark history.Pei Tingsong quickly realized what was going on. \u201cHey, don\u2019t be like that, you can\u2019t say nonsense about that!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Anyway, our group has lost its image long ago.\u201d He Ziyan began to tell the fans, \u201cYou guys may not know that Xiao Pei has already made his debut on screen a while back.\u201dThe fans were really very surprised. \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cIn what?\u201dLing Yi scrambled to say, \u201cLast year, an idol drama crew came to find Qiang Ge and said that they wanted Xiao Pei to act in their show.\u201dPei Tingsong didn\u2019t want Ling Yi to talk any further, so he tried to go around Fang Juexia in order to cover up Ling Yi\u2019s mouth. However, Fang Juexia wanted to listen, so he caught Pei Tingsong\u2019s hand and didn\u2019t let him do anything to stop Ling Yi from talking.Ling Yi went over to the captain\u2019s side and hid behind him as he continued, \u201cIt seemed that back then, Xiao Pei had just fought with the anti-fans online for 300 rounds. He was in a bad mood, and it seemed that something else had also happened. Anyway, he was in a flammable and explosive state, and as soon as he received Qiang Ge\u2019s message, he directly refused. No, that\u2019s too abstract,\u201d Saying that, he signalled He Ziyan, \u201cLet\u2019s act it out. I\u2019m Qiang Ge, and you\u2019re Xiao Pei. \u201cPei Tingsong still persistently tried to stop them. \u201cI\u2019m going to start cursing people out\u00a0ah.\u201dLing Yi wiped his face, and in a moment, he had become Cheng Qiang. He further lowered his voice as he imitated, \u201cXiao Pei, go act.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgHe Ziyan pulled a long face. \u201cAct like hell, you\u00a0horse.\u201d Then he immediately explained it. \u201cIt was using the little horse in the emojis.\u201dFans below the stage burst out laughing. \u201cGrumpy Pinot Tree Supreme!\u201dFang Juexia was very surprised by this reply. He grasped Pei Tingsong with both hands, while staring at him with a very shocked expression.\u201cThey already said it all. I was really mad at the time.\u201d Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t have a microphone, so he just explained to him in a low voice.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t the most urgent thing, friends, the key was\u2014\u201d Lu Yuan also added, \u201cQiang Ge finally actually managed to fulfill Xiao Pei\u2019s wish.\u201dJiang Miao narrated the end of the story, \u201cHe escorted Xiao Pei to dub an animated film called \u2018The Kingdom of Fantasy Animals,\u2019 and he voiced a horse.\u201d\u201cHahahahahaha!\u201d\u201cGoing to watch it tonight!\u201dFang Juexia chuckled and started laughing to the point where he let go of the person he had grasped in his hands. His whole person bent over, and he just couldn\u2019t sit still.Pei Tingsong was helpless as his dark history was being revealed, but his hands still instinctively protected Fang Juexia out of fear that his family\u2019s little white flower would fall off his seat from laughing so hard.He Ziyan summed it all up. \u201cSo, in fact, in terms of acting, Xiao Pei is our senior.\u201dPei Tingsong copied Fang Juexia\u2019s catchphrase, which he frequently used when he was with him, \u201cShut up.\u201dUnder this sort of relaxed atmosphere, they cooperated with the music conductor to sing \u201cSwim Across the Sea\u201d, then interacted with the fans in the livestream, and also chatted about things that had happened during the creation and song-writing process.Pei Tingsong, who was holding a grudge against He Ziyan for exposing his dark history, turned on his tip-off mode and said that He Ziyan, his roommate, would get inspired while taking a bath, and would then come running out wrapped in just a bath towel. He Ziyan also retaliated by saying that he had complained that Pei Tingsong\u2019s initial version of \u2018Night Trip\u2019 was completely incomprehensible.\u201cHahahaha, hurting each other!\u201d\u201cLing Yi luckily managed to dodge the crisis.\u201dTime passed quickly. After drawing a round of prizes, they watched the previously recorded behind-the-scenes gag clips that took place while making the summer album with their fans, and with this, the activities for the meet-up were almost over.Jiang Miao picked up the microphone and said, \u201cTime really does fly\u00a0ah, there are still ten minutes to go before\u00a0 we\u2019re done. We\u2019re going to sing the last song from \u2018Last Summer\u2019 for you guys.\u201d\u201cSo fast\u00a0ah, I can\u2019t bear it.\u201d\u201cThe last one?\u201d\u201cThis song is one that I wrote, and it\u2019s very suitable to listen to on such a summer afternoon.\u201d Out of habit, he cued Fang Juexia, who usually spoke less on such occasions, \u201cJuexia, what\u2019s this song called?\u201dFang Juexia was a little bit slow, and it was only after he looked at the small card in his hand that he faced the audience and straightened his arms out like a host as he announced, \u201cDaydream!\u201dThe fans cheered, \u201cIt\u2019s my daydreaming treasure!\u201dLu Yuan turned in his chair and said briskly, \u201cWe hope everyone\u2019s daydreams can all be realized!\u201dThe conductor behind them started to play the background music, and everyone started singing into their microphones while still seated on the stools. With no electronic music present, the song sounded less psychedelic, and appeared more gentle and fresh.\u201cThe first time I kissed you, all day my head was faint and unscrewed, and the whole universe sleepwalked with me askew.\u201d\u00a0After the second part of the song was sung, Fang Juexia\u2019s microphone suddenly seemed to have a problem, it had stopped emitting sound. He lowered his head and slapped it a few times with his hand before he turned to look at Cheng Qiang, who was standing not far behind them.It was originally Pei Tingsong\u2019s turn to rap next, yet, his attention was attracted by Fang Juexia, who was slapping at his microphone. He didn\u2019t think much about it before stuffing his microphone into Fang Juexia\u2019s hands and taking the broken microphone from his hands to examine it.Fang Juexia was startled by his action and glanced at him. He stuffed the mic back into his hands and whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re about to sing.\u201dOnly after realizing that he had already missed a beat did Pei Tingsong react. He quickly picked up the microphone, and the other members around him started choking with laughter, which was how the fans came to realize\u00a0 that Pei Tingsong was entering the song at the wrong spot.Unexpectedly, Pei Tingsong directly started rapping with a more laid back flow, but the lyrics he was rapping were different from the CD version, it was like he was rapping freestyle.Because he had forgotten the original lyrics.\u201cAlmost the whole world knows my regard, why haven\u2019t you responded because you think I have no temper to guard. A heart of forgetting words and getting stuck, the wrong beat and a mess of plans,\u00a0dreamy dreamy baby, why you make me crazy.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s heart had just been dangling there, but after hearing Pei Tingsong quickly save the scene without leaving behind any trace, he let out a breath of relief. He had to admire the strength of Pei Tingsong\u2019s improvisation in his heart; even the flow was different from the original.He felt a pat on his back, and when Fang Juexia turned around, he saw Cheng Qiang, who then handed him a new microphone. He nodded and took hold of the microphone, then harmonized with Pei Tingsong\u2019s rap.\u00a0\u201cYou are my daydream, daydream.\u201dThe combination of this cold and clear humming and Pei Tingsong\u2019s low-pitched rap made it feel like the sound had gained multiple layers, and Pei Tingsong grew smoother and smoother.\u201cPromise to make my bad habits far and few, all in exchange for the unique you. The sun is dense during summer\u2019s afternoon, and the cafes are busy like a monsoon. Want to take you, change you into a star true, and then hide you in my palm to accrue. When it\u2019s sunny or rainy through, Bailey\u2019s cream will always bring a good mood too. Don\u2019t listen to all the hearsay, just 3, 2, 1, come into my arms, bae.\u201d\u201cYou are my daydream, daydream.\u201dAs he sang on, Pei Tingsong heard a nearly imperceptible smile in Fang Juexia\u2019s voice. The corners of his mouth drew up slightly, and he sang the last sentence.\u201cYou are the secret in my dreams, you know, that I have publicly announced millions of times long ago.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 92Chapter 92 \u2013 Celebration DinnerTranslated by juurenshaEdited by Noks\u201cYou can rely on us.\u201dThis sudden direct fastball hit Fang Juexia\u2019s heart.He totally hadn\u2019t expected Pei Tingsong\u2019s freestyle to end with such a sentence, one that was so grand and straightforward, while being veiled as well.His heart was stuffed so full, and the caffeine he had just taken now seemed to be causing him some trouble.In any case, it seemed that he couldn\u2019t escape from Pei Tingsong\u2019s palm.When the cafe\u2019s music salon session ended at 5:30 p.m., Kaleido returned to the second floor as they waited for the fans to leave under the staff\u2019s arrangements. The six big boys leaned on the window glass and waved to the fans who were going home. Ling Yi even went as far as opening the window and shouting to them, \u201cBe careful on the way back.\u201d It was as if they were not idols, but ordinary friends, who had invited everyone to come over and be a guest, sing songs, and have a heart-to-heart chat.The sky had turned dark by the time they left. Cheng Qiang kept his promise and took his six cubs to a high-priced Japanese style barbecue shop.\u201cWow, Qiang Ge is upping the ante today.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great, I\u2019m going to eat a super large amount of Wagyu beef today!\u201dThey settled down in the private room that had been booked for them a long time ago; it had a long table and seven tatami mats. Jiang Miao, Lu Yuan, and He Ziyan sat in a row, while Pei Tingsong, Fang Juexia, and Ling Yi sat across from them. Xiao Wen took a seat at the innermost end, and Cheng Qiang took a cushion and sat at the outermost end. \u201cThe throne is left to me. You guys start ordering\u00a0ba. Originally, Boss was going to come too, but then he got pulled into a meeting with your senior brothers, so he\u2019ll probably be late. Let\u2019s just first start celebrating within our little group.\u201d\u201cQiang Ge, I\u2019ll save you some money.\u201d As he said that, Ling Yi grabbed the menu and started ordering dishes as if he hadn\u2019t eaten meat for hundreds of years. Cheng Qiang\u2019s eyes widened as he looked on.\u201cOrder some alcohol\u00a0ba.\u201d Lu Yuan yelled, \u201cI haven\u2019t had alcohol for a long time, I\u2019m coveting it a little.\u201d\u201cGo ahead, order, order, let\u2019s have fun today, everybody have a drink.\u201dAs the dishes were being brought out slowly, Cheng Qiang poured a glass of alcohol for himself and then let the six of them fill up their glasses. \u201cCome, come, come, we also haven\u2019t had dinner together in a long time. Let\u2019s have a drink first.\u201dPei Tingsong was really worried about Fang Juexia\u2019s alcohol tolerance, so he didn\u2019t pour him anything too strong, just pouring a glass of strawberry alcohol for him; after glancing at it, he saw that its alcoholic content wasn\u2019t high, so decided that it should be okay. He also knew that he wasn\u2019t very good at drinking either, so he also didn\u2019t pour anything too strong for himself.\u201cThis tastes really good.\u201d After the toast, Fang Juexia turned his head while holding the small cup as he said this to Pei Tingsong.Pei Tingsong put a dumpling on his plate. \u201cDrink less, you won\u2019t be able to eat in a while otherwise.\u201dCheng Qiang emotionally slapped the table. \u201cWe have experienced a lot during this past half year. But things also slowly got better and better, which means that hard work will definitely have results.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Xiao Wen was the most supportive of this statement.Lu Yuan said, \u201cWe don\u2019t just work hard\u00a0ba.\u201dHe Ziyan laughed and said, \u201cWe are also hot\u00a0ah!\u201d\u201cHahahahaha, so shameless.\u201d Ling Yi laughed while eating meat.Cheng Qiang pulled the topic back. \u201cToday\u2019s celebration, although it\u2019s very small, is all people from our own family. But there are many good things to celebrate. The first is our \u2018Last Summer,\u2019 the #1 song for this month! Clap!\u201dEverybody put down their chopsticks and clapped.Fang Juexia was still slow by half a beat. \u201cWe\u2019re first?\u201dPei Tingsong laughed. \u201cYou still have no wifi\u00a0ne.\u201d\u201cAnd the second good thing, which you all already know about\u2026 Congratulations to Kaleido for being nominated by the BMA! I have looked at the list, and we have four nominations in total, which has already broken the records for a boyband!\u201d\u201cWow!\u201d This piece of information obviously made Kaleido more happy than the news about the song just now. Although it was just a nomination, it was already a very, very big affirmation for a male idol group.Especially for these music-loving boys.\u201cMy God, then we can take part in the awards show at the end of the year?\u201d\u201cSo excited, I\u2019m going to start writing my acceptance speech now.\u201d\u201cRemember this for me\u00a0ah, young man: the first person you have to thank is the agent,\u201d Cheng Qiang pointed to himself and said.Jiang Miao poured another glass of alcohol for Cheng Qiang, and as if deliberately reminding him, dragged the topic back, \u201cQiang Ge, what\u2019s the third one?\u201d\u201cThe third thing is\u2014\u201d Cheng Qiang clapped his hands in the direction of the door to the private room, and then sat back on the tatami mat wearing an \u2018it\u2019s handled\u2019 expression on his face. Yet, as a result, the other seven people had to wait quite a while with him, making the atmosphere suddenly turn embarrassing.\u201cYi?\u201d Cheng Qiang stood up and opened the door. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you guys hear my signal?\u201d\u201cOh, oh, oh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The waiter entered the room with a very exquisite cake in his hand.\u201cThe third good thing is\u2014 It\u2019s our Juexia\u2019s birthday\u00a0la.\u201d Cheng Qiang sat down again before continuing, \u201cAlthough it\u2019s not today, tomorrow night, Ling Yi and Lu Yuan have other events, and I have to go with them. We won\u2019t be able to get together tomorrow night, so let\u2019s celebrate it together today.\u201dAs soon as he finished talking, Ling Yi clapped his hands and led everyone in singing the happy birthday song. Pei Tingsong took the birthday cap from the waiter\u2019s hand and put it on Fang Juexia\u2019s head, as if he was putting on a small crown.Fang Juexia hadn\u2019t thought about this at all. Recently, he had been very busy with the new album, the publicity events, and other various activities. He had long forgotten his own birthday.It turned out though that everyone else had remembered it.\u201cHappy Birthday to Juexia in advance!\u201dLing Yi quickly took the opportunity to say, \u201cThe birthday gift I bought for you has already been put on your bedside table\u00a0la!\u201dLu Yuan nodded. \u201cMe too. I already prepared it in advance.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s always quiet face contained a bit of a delighted expression right now. He wasn\u2019t very good at expressing himself, so he poured a glass of pink strawberry alcohol for himself, toasted everyone, and kept saying \u2018thank you.\u2019Everyone chatted while eating, discussing topics ranging from their personal life to gossip in the entertainment industry. It was a great pleasure to eat melons; one moment, the conversation consisted about which two actors had developed real feelings for each other while being part of a drama, and the next moment, it was about the power struggle of big companies.Jiang Miao was a person who worried about others more, so he kept using the small tongs to help everyone roast the meat, and also ordered a new wave of dishes after everyone had eaten nearly everything on the table. Later, they began to play the finger-guessing game and the drinking wager game.By the time all the meat had been consumed, the alcohol had gone a bit to Cheng Qiang\u2019s head, and his face had turned red. Although he had started late, when it came to\u00a0dispensing soulful chicken soup to everyone, he showed concern for each and every one. At last, he took the glass that kept swaying back and forth and bumped it against Fang Juexia\u2019s glass. Like an old father, he advised him, \u201cJuexia\u00a0ah, you should remember this, if you have something going on, you should rely on us more, you know? Don\u2019t carry everything by yourself, that\u2019s so hard\u00a0ah.\u201dThe effect of cup after cup of downed strawberry alcohol had accumulated, and Fang Juexia was also a bit dizzy. As soon as he nodded, his head felt even more dizzy. \u201cEn\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, Juexia.\u201d He Ziyan said, \u201cAlthough we are not particularly reliable\u00a0ba\u2026\u201dLing Yi made a preemptive strike. \u201cWho said that? I\u2019m reliable.\u201dJiang Miao looked at him with a smile. \u201cBut we are your bandmates. So if you have a very hard time, you can rely on each of us.\u201dPei Tingsong agreed with this very much. He tilted his head on Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dWith Pei Tingsong leaning on him like that, Fang Juexia\u2019s whole person completely slanted over, and the half a cup of strawberry alcohol that he was still holding in his hand spilled all over Ling Yi.\u201cHey, hey, hey!\u201dHe Ziyan craned his neck over. \u201cHe seems to be drunk\u2026\u201dLu Yuan frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s too fast.\u201dPei Tingsong quickly pulled Fang Juexia up. Looking at the table, he noticed that Fang Juexia had drunk almost two-thirds of the bottle of strawberry alcohol. \u201cNo, how can you drink so fiercely\u00a0ah?\u201dFang Juexia was already showing the symptoms of being drunk,\u00a0 giggling away. \u201cBarbecue\u2013was a little salty\u2026 This one is\u2026 sweet.\u201dFinished.At that moment, Pei Tingsong went back to the day they had drunk with Shang Sirui at the hotel, and now, when he recalled those memories, his hand started to throb.As soon as Fang Juexia drank, he became a child, one who would say anything and dare to do anything. He had to find a way to take him away, all to prevent him from saying something that he would regret when he got up tomorrow.\u201cQiang Ge, your phone.\u201d Jiang Miao grabbed Cheng Qiang\u2019s arm.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cOh, oh, phone,\u201d Cheng Qiang sat upright and picked up his cellphone. Seeing that it was Chen Zhengyun calling, he happily answered, \u201cBoss, we\u2019re still here, nearly done eating.\u201d\u201cAh, you booked that. Okay, okay, I\u2019ll bring them over right away.\u201dAfter he hung up, Cheng Qiang ate another vinegar boiled peanut. \u201cWell, the boss and the rest of them just finished on that side. He has booked a KTV luxury room for you guys, and your senior brothers will also be there. Everyone can have fun together and won\u2019t need to go back to the dormitory tonight.\u201d\u201cYes! I want to play with Sansan!\u201d\u201cFinally this time, a place for me to shine!\u201dFang Juexia was in a daze, but upon hearing \u2018KTV\u2019, he grew a little excited. \u201cSing? Are we going to sing? \u201d He stuttered a bit, and spoke vaguely like a child, \u201cI-I can sing.\u201d\u201cWe know you can sing.\u201d Pei Tingsong supported him up. \u201cAre you dizzy? Do you feel bad?\u201dFang Juexia wanted to say that he wasn\u2019t dizzy, but when he shook his head and felt the dizziness come on again, he became confused about whether he was dizzy or not, so he just hummed twice.What does a hum mean ah?\u00a0Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t know whether he should laugh or cry at this.\u201cCome on\u00a0ba, let\u2019s go.\u201dAfter tidying up a bit, they called for a taxi as they prepared to go downstairs. Pei Tingsong helped Fang Juexia all the way down the stairs, and it was as if he was holding up a little white snake with no feet. Fang Juexia walked askew, tottering back and forth.\u201cQiang Ge, he\u2019s too drunk. Getting over there will be an ordeal, and maybe in a little bit, he\u2019ll start feeling bad.\u201dCheng Qiang, who had also drunk a bit too much, rubbed his new buzzcut. \u201cReally? Ah, then-then\u2026.\u201dPei Tingsong pulled Fang Juexia into his arms and let him lean against him. \u201cI\u2019ll take him back\u00a0ba.\u201dJiang Miao asked him, \u201cThen, you also won\u2019t go?\u201d\u201cI happen to not feel well, too.\u201d Pei Tingsong just randomly came up with a reason. Who could have known that this reason would then be heard by the drunk Fang Juexia. \u201cDon\u2019t feel well? Where do you not feel well, let me see\u2026.burp. \u201dAfter drinking alcohol, his voice had become affectedly sweet, and he had stuck himself onto Pei Tingsong without any scruples, holding his arm like a clingy kitten.\u201cStop for a while\u00a0ba, ancestor.\u201d Pei Tingsong tugged at him while feeling the closet door crumbling.\u201cYou\u2019re so fierce.\u201d Fang Juexia suddenly turned angry, and blushed while speaking in an aggrieved tone, \u201cYou don\u2019t like\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong immediately covered his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m wrong.\u201dI like you, I especially like you.Pei Tingsong sweated for his broken closet door.Ling Yi, standing to one side, was a little surprised. \u201cIt turns out that Juexia turns into this when he\u2019s drunk\u00a0ah\u2026\u201dLu Yuan clicked his tongue. \u201cWhen you\u2019re drunk, you even start kissing people, you\u2019re not much better.\u201dThe taxi, which had been hailed in advance, arrived late. Cheng Qiang mumbled\u00a0 a few words to Pei Tingsong and sat down inside. Pei Tingsong, who half-held Fang Juexia, nodded, while that silly guy in his arms stretched his arms to obediently say bye-bye to them. After a while, their taxi also came. Pei Tingsong had to exert a lot of effort before he managed to drag Fang Juexia inside, and the entire way back, Fang Juexia kept mumbling that he was going to throw up, but also saying that he wanted a hug.Fortunately, the taxi driver was a middle-aged uncle, who did not know or suspect their identities.It was so hard to take care of a drunk person, and Pei Tingsong finally managed to drag him home. Only the two of them were left in the dormitory. Fang Juexia sat on the little stool at the entryway, clamoring that he was dizzy. Pei Tingsong squatted to help him take off his canvas shoes, and then put them away. Every time Fang Juexia got drunk, their identities seemed to switch as well; Pei Tingsong became the Gege, and Fang Juexia became the childish Didi.He did enjoy this switch occasionally.\u201cSleepy, I want to sleep.\u201d Fang Juexia rubbed his eyes.\u201cYou want to sleep now\u00a0ah?\u201d\u201cI want to sleep!\u201d\u201cOkay, okay, okay.\u201d Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t outstubborn him. Knowing this guy\u2019s drunken temper, he simply picked him up, carried him into his room, and put him on his bed, which was always clean and had no wrinkles.\u201cSleep, our Juexia wants to sleep.\u201d As he coaxed him, he spread out the quilt for Fang Juexia, \u201cI\u2019ll get the towel wet to wipe your face with.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t go.\u201d Fang Juexia seemed to be biting down on every word very hard. He grasped his arm, and his strength grew. \u201cDon\u2019t go, I like you, you keep me company.\u201dPei Tingsong froze beside the bed.Fang Juexia\u2019s face had turned red, his hands were hot, and he was smiling in a very silly, yet very beautiful way. \u201cI want\u2026.want\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong bent over and touched his forehead. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d His eyes were very bright under the lamp at the head of the bed, looking just like the stars. He even opened up the quilt obediently and pulled Pei Tingsong into it. \u201cYou sleep with me, okay?\u201dAfter having already received such an invitation, Pei Tingsong felt that if he didn\u2019t agree, he would be\u00a0Liu Xiahui.\u201cThen\u2026. If I dirty your bed,\u201d He lay down and rubbed his face against Fang Juexia\u2019s cheek as he continued asking, \u201cwould you mind?\u201dFang Juexia kissed his lips, and then hiccuped childishly. His response was upright and logical.\u201cYou\u2019ve already dirtied me, and I-I didn\u2019t blame you then\u00a0ah.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He grabbed the hem of his clothes dyed with pink strawberry alcohol and pulled it up to show him. \u201cYou see, here, it\u2019s dirty here.\u201dSo it was this\u2026.\u201cThen\u2026 take off your dirty clothes?\u201d Pei Tingsong lifted the hem of his shirt further, helping Fang Juexia to take off his T-shirt, and talked as if coaxing a child, \u201cIf the clothes are dirty, we just won\u2019t wear them anymore.\u201dFang Juexia went along with his words and very angrily balled up his top before throwing it on the ground. \u201cNot wearing them.\u201d After that, he looked down at himself. He didn\u2019t lift his head up even after a long time had passed, seemingly wearing a very serious expression.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Pei Tingsong felt he was being very strange, so he went over.He saw Fang Juexia staring wide-eyed at the love bite on his chest; it was a little purple.But Fang Juexia didn\u2019t think it was a love bite, and even thought that he had gotten that spot dirty, so he let out a questioning hum, and then rubbed it with his fingers. He rubbed it very hard, and after doing so a few times, it turned red. \u201cThis-this is also dirty.\u201dLooking at him like this, Pei Tingsong thought that it was both funny and cute. He even raised his hands to admit frankly, \u201cThis is also me getting you dirty.\u201d\u201cWhat to do?\u201d Fang Juexia curled up his mouth, and his beautiful eyes were very innocent. \u201cIt\u2019s so dirty\u00a0ah, I can\u2019t wipe it clean\u2026\u201d\u201cIt can be wiped clean, don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d Pei Tingsong gently patted Fang Juexia, then attempted to placate him by kissing his lips. \u201cWho said it\u2019s so dirty? Our Juexia is the cleanest.\u201dKissing was an effective way of relieving emotions.Pecking, and then pecking again just wasn\u2019t enough. All Fang Juexia kept thinking was how it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cStill need to kiss.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Pei Tingsong kissed him as he wished.It was an aggressive kiss, the tip of his tongue prying open the shell of his mouth and going into the softest and deepest part to entangle with Fang Juexia\u2019s wet and soft tongue. The flavor of strawberry and alcohol tasted so sweet that he felt faint.When you loved someone to the point that they were difficult to give up, even a kiss was bewitching.Fang Juexia was kissed until he grew soft, and he keened vaguely like a small animal. His mind had turned very young, and school-aged kids were the best at imitating, so he mirrored Pei Tingsong, kissing and licking him back. The hot and humid tongues entangled with each other, and they kissed until the moans and wet sounds came one after another, just like waves in an ocean.Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t plan to let him off so easily, so he forcefully parted and said, \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d\u201cNot enough!\u201d Fang Juexia suddenly hugged him, turned over, and pressed Pei Tingsong down, forcibly demanding a kiss. Pei Tingsong was a bit overwhelmed by his enthusiasm, \u201cBe good, wait a minute.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t want to wait!\u201d Fang Juexia lowered his head and kissed him. Pei Tingsong could only follow his wishes and devour his tongue and lips until they were soft and swollen. He kissed him until he fell against him and became a pool of melted strawberry smoothie, leaving only syrup sticking to his chest.It was too hot, they were about to burn up.The bedside lamp shone on his snow-white skin, and it glowed with light. It seemed that what he was holding was not a body thirsty for love, but a piece of hot moonlight.Moonlight was cold, but it also belonged to the night, and adding on muffled erotic moans, it was even more beautiful.He suddenly thought of song lyrics, thought of that line of [flowers eating the July sunshine]. Was he the flower, he wasn\u2019t just eating sunshine.But also his lover\u2019s body.The moon was a hole in the black night sky, and so was he. He was a lollipop with the white stick removed. His sparkling and crystal-clear body was empty, with just a small hole left. So he asked Pei Tingsong to come in and compensate him as if restoring something to its rightful owner.Only then could this candy come alive and melt.Melt into the dark night.(Buy the raws to gain access to the uncut scene! Quick preview of the translated smut below (NSFW warning):)Click to readAfter they finished, Pei Tingsong\u2019s cellphone coincidentally started ringing at the same time. It was the alarm he had set, at one minute to twelve in the morning, as a reminder for him to not forget to wish Fang Juexia a \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 at the very first second of his birthday.Originally, it was a very good plan; just like any teenage boy, he would be able to convey his best wishes to the person he liked right at that time.But now, the person he liked was in his arms, in a completely blind drunk state, and he had even made him cry. Pei Tingsong patted Fang Juexia on the back and coaxed him, \u201cBaby, happy birthday, you\u2019re another year older now.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s eyelids were a bit swollen. When he looked up at him, he had already stopped trembling, but he was still stuttering a bit in his response, \u201cBirth-birthday, it\u2019s my birthday.\u201d\u201cYes, your birthday.\u201d Pei Tingsong kissed his birthmark, \u201cThank you for coming to this world and letting me meet you.\u201d\u201cThen-then you are my present?\u201d Fang Juexia looked at him and pursed his lips.Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t expect him to say so, and actually felt a bit panicked. \u201cReally? Can I count as being a gift?\u201d\u201cYou can.\u201d Fang Juexia nodded seriously. \u201cBecause I like you, you-you are better than any other gift.\u201dWhen he held Fang Juexia, it felt like he was holding the entire world.No, it was better than the entire world.Fang Juexia was so tired that he fell asleep after being coaxed for just a little while. Only once he was in a deep enough sleep did Pei TIngsong get up gently and bring hot water over to help clean him. He was as careful as he would be with the most precious piece of porcelain. When he was pretty much done, he picked him up and carried him to his room, so as to sleep in his own clean bed.The smell of Pei Tingsong\u2019s blankets made Fang Juexia feel very much at ease. Without much struggle, he adapted to the new dream cocoon he had been placed in, leaving the responsibility of cleaning everything, and of washing all the sheets, on Pei Tingsong.The young master, who had once had to rely on Fang Juexia to even make his bed, was already very good at taking care of people now.After finding Fang Juexia\u2019s new bedding and laying it out properly, Pei Tingsong felt really tired to even move his favorite baby back, so he went straight back to his room and tunneled into the quilt that had been warmed up by Fang Juexia.He came up with a lot of lies to be used to deal with the questions his bandmates would throw at him tomorrow. Anyway, Fang Juexia was already drunk, so everything could just be pushed onto him.The little moon, who didn\u2019t know that all the blame had been pushed onto him, sensed Pei Tingsong entering the quilt, so he turned over and obediently hugged him. The two people leaned against each other, falling deeply into their dreams.Pei Tingsong had overestimated his bandmates\u2019 self-control; when he woke up, there was no one in the dormitory. He guessed that they had gotten too drunk to even walk and had all just slept in the luxury booth.Eight o\u2019clock in the morning, the perfect time to go back to sleep, but Pei Tingsong still got up.He had more important things to do than sleep.It was only at noon that Fang Juexia, who was very tired, groggily woke up. He was surprised; clearly, when he was sleeping, he had felt that he was being held, so how could he wake up alone in bed now?It must have been a dream\u00a0ba.After a while, he noticed that the pattern on the sheets was unfamiliar; he was on Pei Tingsong\u2019s bed. At first, he was a little confused, and then Fang Juexia remembered everything. His face couldn\u2019t help but grow hot as his hands went numb, and he hurriedly got out of bed.This time, his waist felt particularly sore, to the point that Fang Juexia felt bad even when walking, so he walked out slowly in his slippers.\u201cPei Tingsong?\u201dNo one responded to him. The dormitory seemed empty, and Pei Tingsong was also not there. He called again, but no one answered.His bedsheets were drying on the balcony of the living room, and no one else would do that besides Pei Tingsong. Maybe he wasn\u2019t here because he had gone to buy something at this time, or he had been called away by Qiang Ge. Fang Juexia decided to wash up first.So, Fang Juexia went back to his room. As soon as he pushed open the door, the balcony\u2019s curtain was stirred by the wind. The huge white curtain fluttered and a lush verdant scent poured in, covering Fang Juexia\u2019s face.His cellphone vibrated a few times. Fang Juexia walked over and saw a lot of birthday wishes, the names of familiar people and unfamiliar people all rushing and swarming on that small screen.Fang Juexia replied to each one with a \u201cthank you\u201d, then finally, saw Xiao Wen\u2019s WeChat message.[Xiao Wen: Juexia! Happy birthday! By the way, Qiang Ge wants you to post a line on Weibo, just saying thank you to everyone is fine!]He replied with an \u2018okay,\u2019 then logged onto Weibo. They said that just saying thank you to everyone was fine, so he really did just post a line saying \u2018Thank you everyone.\u2019 After posting it, he wanted to quit, but his finger slipped unconsciously and he ended up refreshing the home page.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgUnexpectedly, he saw that a media account that he had followed a while back had posted a message about its anniversary.[@One Sniff Platform: Today is June 26, International Anti-Drugs Day. Cherish life and stay away from drugs.]Fang Juexia stared at this short sentence, carefully looking at it for a long time, then clicked to open the picture attached below, before closing it soon.This coincidence seemed to be predestined by the heavens.But now, at least, he would no longer be like what he was in the past, when he felt that those two words were so harsh and chilling. Some irony concerning this would always exist, but it wasn\u2019t impossible to face anymore.[@Kaleido Fang Juexia: Forwarded a Weibo post.]This was the first time he had forwarded something he had wanted to forward without being urged by his agent.He would always remember it.The room felt stuffy and a little stifling to him. Fang Juexia was used to opening up the curtains in the daytime for ventilation, so he did the same this time too. But when he opened the curtains, he was stunned.His little garden was full of snow-white eustoma. On the jasmine branches, gardenias, spider plants, geraniums, and pansies, wherever his eye fell, it all looked like snow.There was a eustoma blooming even on that bolt upright cactus.Fang Juexia picked them up one by one, finally harvesting a whole bunch of snow colored flowers. The last one was leaning against the cactus, and he squatted down to catch sight of a bow on the cactus pot, signifying a small gift.Only at this time did he discover that there was a big dark blue box behind the cactus; this big box was hidden amidst the flowers and plants. He moved the cactus to retrieve the box and then opened the lid, finding a white notebook inside.Fang Juexia opened it up and saw the words \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 written on the first page; it was the handwriting he was most familiar with, in beautiful and open strokes. Upon flipping further through, he realised that every page was filled with Pei Tingsong\u2019s handwriting. Page after page, they were all poems he had written.He had said it before\u2014he would give him everything.Fang Juexia\u2019s heart was suddenly full, and he didn\u2019t even dare to read it carefully, so he closed the book. He thought of that afternoon in the hotel before, when Pei Tingsong had told him his grandfather\u2019s story. He said that his grandfather had written a whole book of fruitless love poems.Now, Pei Tingsong has done the same thing; he had really put all the words and sentences written for him together and had given them to him as a gift. Inside this notebook was his talent, his nighttime yearning and desire.There was a small box under the notebook, which contained a small USB drive. Fang Juexia recognized it as his own USB drive, the one that he had stored his demo on, and which had been taken away by Pei Tingsong.Feeling that it was a little strange, Fang Juexia took it out, went to the table, put the flowers and the poetry collection on the table, turned on the computer, and opened the folder on the USB drive.There was something there named [to: FJX]This was a video. It seemed that the video had been filmed quite a few years ago. At the beginning, it showed a two or three-year-old child sitting in the garden. The sunshine was very strong and shone down on him until he squinted his eyes.Fang Juexia heard an old voice calling him Xiao Song. The child turned his head back, raised his little fist, called out \u201cGrandpa,\u201d as he began to smile until his eyes curved, looking as lovely as a crescent moon.So this was Pei Tingsong when he was a child. Seeing this scene, Fang Juexia\u2019s heart was about to melt. He unconsciously drew closer to the screen and looked at the child.It was as if he was now involved in his past.As soft music played in the background, he saw the house Pei Tingsong had lived in as a child. It was very beautiful. He saw the swimming pool where he said he had drowned rainbow trout, and he also watched him trample on the withered branches in the winter while letting out childish laughter. In midsummer, he rode on his grandfather\u2019s neck and stretched his little hand to pick apricots.Once he grasped it, it was all sunshine.All the time Pei Tingsong felt that Fang Juexia had missed, he had sorted them out to place here.Fang Juexia\u2019s heart crumbled into small pieces, as if that child had stepped on the top of his heart, and the pieces then softly fell apart. Lost in a trance, he could actually hear his heart beating, the sound coming not from his chest, but from his ears. The background music changed, his sampled heartbeat an extra track now.He watched Pei Tingsong growing up bit by bit, gradually going from a very young child to a teenager. Every moment of change had been recorded and stored in this video; however, the words he had cut out and added here were repeated.Each of these words was \u201cI love you,\u201d with every sentence reflecting off a heartbeat.There was when he was a child, sweetly saying \u201clove you,\u201d probably to his grandfather. There were also some words he had said after a prank, where he had put on an affected tone, and was deliberately trying to be funny, and there were also some moments when he was sad, when he was wronged, and when he unconsciously recited things when he was reading.The end of the video featured him as a teenager, and he was lying in front of a white sickbed, his shoulder blades propping up his empty shirt. He was sobbing, gripping the sheets with his fingers and saying the last \u201cI love you.\u201dThe screen suddenly turned black, leaving only the heartbeat in the background resonating with Fang Juexia.It was only now that Fang Juexia discovered that he was actually in tears.\u201cI love you.\u201d He suddenly heard a confession, in a voice completely different from the previous one. It was not the voice of a young child, nor was it the voice of a vulnerable and confused teenager, but rather, it was the voice of the mature him, the one Fang Juexia was familiar with.He said \u201cI love you\u201d in a low and gentle way, over and over again in the dark.This situation reminded Fang Juexia of his darkness, both safe and warmth. Every \u201clove\u201d collided with his heart beat, and his nose sting even more.His subconsciously always running internal clock told Fang Juexia that Pei Tingsong had said \u201cI love you\u201d a total of 22 times.The screen suddenly lit up, and Pei Tingsong\u2019s smiling face appeared in front of his eyes. He was so beautiful that he should be loved by everyone.But his eyes only looked at him, with the most honest and passionate love.\u201cJuexia, Happy 23rd Birthday.\u201dFinally, he said it for the 23rd time.\u201cI love you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He felt that this scene was too comical and was at a loss on what was going on; clearly, he hadn\u2019t liked to cry before.As Pei Tingsong sang the last verse of the song, he put the tray on the table, and its contents were revealed\u2014there were longevity noodles and a small cupcake with red velvet strawberry cream, which had a small candle stuck into it, its slender flame fluttering in the wind.\u201cI baked this cupcake. It was my first time making it, and the big chiffon cake really drove me crazy, so I could only make cupcakes. However, having just one on a big tray looks better, so don\u2019t dislike it.\u201d After that, Pei Tingsong pointed to the bowl of noodles. \u201cThese noodles were also made by me. You can eat them however you want, anyway, it\u2019s just to make things happy.\u201dFang Juexia couldn\u2019t help but laugh.These words didn\u2019t sound at all like someone who studied philosophy.When did he make these noodles? It couldn\u2019t have been made just during the time he entered his room?Pei Tingsong had really gone to great lengths.\u201cQuickly eat it, if it sticks together after a bit, it will become harder to eat.\u201d Pei Tingsong picked up the chopsticks and handed them to Fang Juexia, but unexpectedly, Fang Juexia hugged him instead.\u201cThank you.\u201d He heard Fang Juexia say softly.It was cool around his neck, maybe because his tears were falling down. Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart creased a bit, seeming as if it had been grasped by something.Clearly, he wasn\u2019t a gentle person, but after meeting Fang Juexia, he hated that he couldn\u2019t offer up the entire world to him. Even if he knew that he was crying because he was happy, he was still reluctant to see those tears.\u201cIn front of me, you don\u2019t need to do any emotional management at all. You can cry if you want, and laugh if you want.\u201d Pei Tingsong patted him on the back. \u201cBut when you cry, I still feel a little sad.\u201dFang Juexia nodded, sniffled, and said thank you again.\u201cDon\u2019t say thank you to me,\u201d Pei Tingsong replied.So Fang Juexia, with his head buried in the side of Pei Tingsong\u2019s neck, kissed the side of his neck again. \u201cI love you.\u201dHe could do nothing else but this.It was true that his cake had been baked so-so, and his noodles were tasteless, but Fang Juexia still found it all delicious.Listening to him complain about his sore waist, Pei Tingsong reached out and rubbed his waist while watching him eat. \u201cYou\u2019re so hungry\u00a0ah, I still have a pile of cupcakes over there. I\u2019ll get you two more?\u201dFang Juexia said, \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve eaten such a small birthday cake. I can finish it in one bite.\u201dPei Tingsong increasingly felt that he had spoiled Fang Juexia into developing a temper. \u201cYou\u2019re still not satisfied\u00a0ba, if you\u2019re still not satisfied, next time I\u2019ll\u2026\u201dFang Juexia blinked and asked, \u201cDo what next time? Never make it for me again?\u201dPei Tingsong began to smile, reached out with a hand and wiped the icing at the corner of his mouth. \u201cNext time, I\u2019ll make a big, super big one, okay\u00a0ba,\u00a0Gege.\u201dFang Juexia nodded contentedly, and then taking advantage of the fact that their bandmates were still not back, furtively kissed him again.They watched the video again, and Fang Juexia kept pausing it. He kept asking after every picture\u2014where was this, who took it, what happened at that time, and why was he so happy. He never tired of asking questions like this, and Pei Tingsong never tired of answering them.With this, it was almost like Fang Juexia had really participated in Pei Tingsong\u2019s past.This was the best gift he had ever received.After getting together with Pei Tingsong, he felt that he had returned to his childhood, to those days when he was very small and very easily satisfied. Life, at that time, hadn\u2019t been filled with the pressure of running after something and the fear of being alone, or the mechanical practice day after day, or the avoidance of risks and mistakes.He was no longer the person who would clench his teeth and keep moving forward in the darkness. Now, there was someone holding his hand, so he could enjoy the moment instead of being forced by time to keep moving forward.People were not born unfeeling stalks of grass or trees.Fang Juexia was also not a dead branch.After all, he now wanted to revive and bloom for the sake of spring.July was green, and the biggest winner in the whole of July was also the drama \u201cGreen Waves.\u201d Both of the two leading actors gained a super large amount of popularity because of their roles in the drama, and the hashtag #Green Waves Finale# exploded directly on the Hot Search list.In the last episode, when the female lead found the diary buried under the jacaranda tree, she realized that she herself was the \u201cperfect friend\u201d that she had created after her mental breakdown. As her memory rushed back, her silent and deep love for the male lead drowned her completely, like waves rushing over her head. When she woke up again, she found herself lying on the hospital bed, and she had been reborn to the time before her suicide. Originally, she thought that everything since then had been just a dream, but then the male lead came to visit her with a jacaranda flower in his hand. The name he called out was the name of the girl from the illusion, not the original name of the her who had committed suicide. The female lead finally shed tears.Everything they had gone through hadn\u2019t been forgotten, and the series finale ended abruptly.At both the two climaxes in the last episode, the BGM \u201cNight Trip\u201d was played, especially so when they met in the ward at the end. With the superb acting skills of the lead actors, the effect was extraordinary.After the finale, a lot of hot discussion appeared online, and \u201cNight Trip\u201d once again found itself on the Hot Search list, this time being praised as a divine song.[@weareyoung: As soon as the prelude of \u2018Night Trip\u2019 appeared during the finale, my tears started pouring out directly. This wasn\u2019t a dream\u00a0ah, everything you guys have experienced was real.][@Oranges and Bananas: I broke out with goosebumps at the part with the diary, it\u2019s too strong. \u2018Night Trip\u2019 appearing at that moment must always remain a famous scene, it\u2019s really amazing.][@Real name\u00a0Amwaying\u00a0Green Waves: FJX\u2019s cold voice is so infectious, full of youthful regret\u00a0ah. After hearing the lyrics of 'summer is so long and a delight\u201d with the male lead finally saying, \u201cYou said before that you would accompany me again before the end of the summer to see the sea, do you still want to go?\u201d, my tears directly started falling down.]When the crew of \u201cGreen Waves\u201d went on a variety show, they specially invited Fang Juexia as well. However, Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t attend the show because of a scheduling conflict, so he recorded a video with Pei Tingsong, the other creator of the song. During the recording of the program, the staff played that video on the big screen.When these two people appeared in the same frame, it almost detonated the scene, with the audience screams almost covering up the voice of the host, thus being a panoramic view of the popularity these boys now had.However, only after watching this program did Fang Juexia realize that the original screenwriter for \u201cGreen Waves\u201d was Editor Xu from \u2018Escape,\u2019 which came as a real surprise to him.With a divine song such as \u201cNight Trip\u201d, Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong had successfully become new stars in the field of music creation. They were the two aces of a popular boyband, and they had also joined the popular variety show \u201cEscape For Your Life\u201d, so their popularity now ranked at the top amongst young male artists, and there were numerous brands extending olive branches to them, while many music programs were also extending invitations to them.However, Fang Juexia had always believed that most of his success this time was due to luck, so he refused a lot of such business activities and devoted himself to studying composition. He also went to the United States several times with Pei Tingsong to study.Although Kaleido\u2019s summer album \u201cLast Summer\u201d hadn\u2019t participated in the filmed promotional performances category, it still won first place seven times whenever a live vote wasn\u2019t happening at the scene, all because of its growing ranking and high album sales. For a boyband to have produced two big hit albums within half a year, it was pretty much a miracle.He Ziyan joined the drama group, Ling Yi took part in a new music competition program, and Lu Yuan had been a mentor on a hip-hop program the entire time. Each Kaleido member\u2019s personal activities were in full swing, and the dormitories that used to be crowded were now empty.For Kaleido, this summer was pretty much a good harvest season. Perhaps because of this, time passed faster for them. Busy people often don\u2019t feel the passage of time, and one day, they realized that the summer heat had disappeared, and the air that drifted by their arms carried a hint of coolness. Only then did they realize that autumn was already here.After studying composition in a systematic manner, Fang Juexia had made rapid progress, and he had gathered a lot of good demos on hand. He was getting more and more comfortable with creating music, and had started to enjoy playing around with music. Sometimes, he and Pei Tingsong could spend a whole day in his small workshop.Originally, everything was going for the better, but that soon proved itself to be just a dream. Zhai Ying, who was filming \u201cEscape For Your Life\u201d with them, found herself mired up to her chin in negative news. First, rumors about her being an airborne member due to her background circulated around, and then, rumors about her sexual orientation made their rounds. The girl group she was a part of had been unable to make a comeback for a long time, and with news of their comeback being put out repeatedly, only to be proved false again and again was not good for her. The fans had already had a lot of speculation, and now, the appearance of this negative news affected the impression of passers-by online.But with so many episodes having been filmed, they had already become very good friends, and Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t be more clear about Zhai Ying\u2019s personality. It was just that there were few onlookers online who thought independently; most of them were just there to eat melons, and followed suit in yelling and attacking. It didn\u2019t matter whether things were really like this; as long as they were able to vent their emotions, they would consciously benefit.After a few days, the rumors had developed to the point of \u201cZhai Ying quits \u2018Escape For Your Life.\u2019\u201d Even after such a long time experiencing rumors flying around, Zhai Ying had never made a sound, but this time, she posted a photo on Weibo. It was a photo of her with the door of the final exit taken after filming the first episode. Many people guessed that it meant that she wouldn\u2019t quit the show.Pei Tingsong was the one who told Fang Juexia about this Weibo post.At that moment, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t know whether it was out of his friendship with Zhai Ying, or whether he remembered Li Luo\u2019s kindness to him in the beginning days when he was at Astar, but he unexpectedly got the idea to stand up for Zhai Ying. This may not be much for many people, but for Fang Juexia, who had always stayed away from the Internet due to the cyber-violence he had experienced before, this was something he would have hardly done in the past.But he still did it this time.Fang Juexia actively logged into his account and forwarded Zhai Ying\u2019s Weibo post.[@Kaleido Fang Juexia: The scariest thing in the world \u2013 Escape\u2019s main door. (Next episode, please also take me along for the group photo)]He was the first person in the circle to forward Zhai Ying\u2019s Weibo post, and he didn\u2019t even tell her about it in advance. Following him, Pei Tingsong also forwarded Fang Juexia\u2019s Weibo post.[@Kaleido Pei Tingsong: And there\u2019s also me, who by the way, is refuting the person on the right. The scariest thing is the \u201cmental arithmetic brute force cracker\u201d on the right / / @Kaleido Fang Juexia: The scariest thing in the world \u2013 Escape\u2019s main door. (Next episode, please also take me along for the group photo)]After discovering that her Weibo post had been forwarded, Zhai Ying immediately sent Fang Juexia a WeChat message, saying that he plainly should not have gotten involved in this.Fang Juexia just replied with the line\u2014 \u2018it was necessary\u2019.Following them, the whole crew forwarded Zhai Ying\u2019s Weibo post one by one, until finally, even the screenwriter Xu Qichen appeared.[@Xu Qichen: Happy, it turns out that the scariest thing in your mind isn\u2019t me\u00a0ah.]In this way, the rumor about Zhai Ying leaving the show collapsed in on itself, and the group spirit displayed by the \u201cEscape For Your Life\u201d program group was praised by many people.When their bandmates learned about this matter, they even started joking that Fang Juexia was becoming more and more like Pei Tingsong.However, Pei Tingsong knew that Fang Juexia must have had other considerations when he did this. After all, he wasn\u2019t an impulsive person.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgThere was nothing new under the sun, and there were too many melons to eat and too many scandals to expose in the entertainment circle every day, but what Fang Juexia hadn\u2019t expected was that this time, the rumors would fall on his own family\u2019s bandmate, He Ziyan. The news released the same day He Ziyan returned to Beijing after wrapping up filming.They were just celebrating He Ziyan wrapping up filming in the restaurant, with all of them eating happily, when Cheng Qiang went out to answer the phone. It was only after that that everyone came to know what had happened online.There was an Internet rumor about He Ziyan\u2019s family that had spread from the anonymous forums to the more formal forums, the source of which could not be verified. It was revealed that his mother was a public servant who had embezzled money, and she was in the public security division, so the netizens from before couldn\u2019t reveal his past, because there were people backing him.The expos\u00e9 was very\u00a0descriptive, saying that he had a bad relationship with his family, and that when he was young, he was very rebellious, always fighting and making trouble. He even dropped out of school because he couldn\u2019t get along with his family, and ran away from home to come to the entertainment industry.He Ziyan\u2019s tainted family was constantly emphasized between the lines in this piece, with there being vague statements and certain\u00a0nodding and winking. The water army that had been bought also magnified the corruption, arousing the malice of public opinion even further.\u201cWhat trash has all been written here? It\u2019s groundless.\u201d Lu Yuan was so angry that he broke his chopsticks. \u201cPeople even believe this kind of thing that doesn\u2019t even come with a picture. Just saying that I know someone\u2019s someone\u2019s someone\u2019s friend, that counts as an expos\u00e9?\u201dAfter reading the piece, Pei Tingsong also thought it was ridiculous. \u201cAs soon as someone opens their mouth, someone will believe whatever they say.\u201dFang Juexia felt that the other party was being especially malicious; they didn\u2019t make up this rumor sooner or later, but made it blow up right after He Ziyan had finished filming.Ling Yi was beside himself with anger. \u201cIt can\u2019t be Astar again\u00a0ba.\u201dWith the previous incident concerning the leaked song, coupled with several altercations after, Astar was the foe that they dreaded the most.Fang Juexia, who had an old feud with Astar, shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, this timing is very strange. Ziyan\u2019s recent popularity is high, but the highest peak should have been when the official publicity for the drama started. They didn\u2019t release any rumors at that time, and they also didn\u2019t release any rumors when the drama was about to start filming. Instead, they deliberately waited until the drama finished filming to release the rumors\u2026.\u201dAs he said this, he looked at He Ziyan. \u201cThe purpose I can come up with is that they probably want to stigmatize the actors. After all, the rumor created this time is very sensitive and special; it\u2019s very easy for it to go out of the circle, and it\u2019s very likely that netizens who don\u2019t know the truth will follow suit and boycott the drama. If it really got to that point, if the filming side wants to protect the drama, it may replace Ziyan, but public opinion will still greatly hurt the audience numbers for this drama. If they still keep Ziyan, the drama will basically gain an abandoned status.\u201dPei Tingsong nodded. \u201cOnce the accusation is really established, no matter what they do, it\u2019s both the actor and cast who will be getting harmed. So the source of rumor, in my opinion, is probably the financiers who have a competitive relationship with the drama team.\u201dThis analysis was chilling.Cheng Qiang\u2019s brain was spinning fast, and he contacted several reliable people well-versed in public relations in his circle. However, he also felt very uncomfortable; in order to avoid rumors to this extent, they had to actually call in the public relations department.At the dining table, He Ziyan, who hadn\u2019t spoken from start to finish, suddenly laughed. \u201cThis move is really cruel.\u201dHe was right, it was really cruel. Fang Juexia thought corruption wasn\u2019t a matter that ordinary netizens could investigate and figure out the truth behind. The sensitivity of this kind of incident provided too much convenience for Internet rumors; if they couldn\u2019t figure out the truth, the words \u2018sensitive matter\u2019 could always be pushed out in justification.In addition, many people were curious about He Ziyan\u2019s private life. He had never mentioned his parents, and he had experienced many things. It was mysterious before, but now that the card of \u2018mother\u2019 had been shuffled forward as his big background and everything had been exposed, it made everything seem logical. These coincidences were particularly applicable in this play, which this rumor-maker had deliberately created.In fact, the group members also didn\u2019t know about He Ziyan\u2019s family. Although they had a close relationship, each of them had left enough boundaries for each other. Everyone had the right to keep secrets, but sometimes asking was also a kind of concern.But, at this time, Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help thinking that no matter what kind of family environment He Ziyan had come from, unless he possessed a background like Pei Tingsong\u2019s, there was no possibility of peacefully handling such rumors.This was because even if you simply reveal your own family, and then involve your parents as well, there will still be people who wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201cBut with this issue, they could also count as having a flaw in their plan.\u201dHe Ziyan suddenly opened his mouth, and his words confused everyone.Fang Juexia looked up at him to see that he picked up the cup, and was tilting his head back to take a gulp of alcohol. He then smiled broadly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, everyone. I have a way to clarify this.\u201dHe said this in such a sure manner, but Fang Juexia felt it even more strange. Although he didn\u2019t know He Ziyan\u2019s family, after being together so long, he had pretty much felt He Ziyan\u2019s indifference towards this matter. Maybe it was because he was the same as himself, or maybe he was the same as Pei Tingsong, and he maintained almost no contact with his family.Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cZiyan, wait a minute. If it\u2019s all made clear, the people in your family\u2026\u201d\u201cI have no family.\u201d He Ziyan said with a smile, \u201cI am an orphan.\u201dThis sentence stunned everyone in the private room.He had kept silent about the subject of family to his bandmates, and saying that they didn\u2019t secretly guess at his situation was impossible, but no one had ever thought that the truth was like this.He had said that he had no family to help him choose as if he had been talking about the weather. It wasn\u2019t that he was indifferent to his family, but that he really had no family.Generally speaking, they were similar, and Jiang Miao, whose parents had died early, gave him a complicated look.Ling Yi couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cFire Ge, then back then you\u2026\u201dHe Ziyan\u2019s face looked as relaxed as usual, as if he was talking about something not related to himself. \u201cBack then, I grew up in a welfare home; in fact, it was an orphanage. I had been there for as long as I can remember, and I had no father or mother, only the auntie and the dean of the welfare home. In fact, it was very good in the beginning. We could still attend school in the welfare home, there were young volunteers who helped teach us, and you could leave if someone adopted you. But I couldn\u2019t bear to leave the dean, so I never left.\u201cLater, when the dean fell ill, the welfare home couldn\u2019t manage its finances and collapsed. I was 14 years old then, and I was adopted by a family. But because the father of that family often beat me, I ran away.\u201dFang Juexia couldn\u2019t imagine He Ziyan\u2019s life at that time. He had no father or mother, the welfare home in which he had lived disappeared, and he was abused by his adoptive father. Finally, he had to run away and start living on his own that early on in life.Lu Yuan, who was sitting beside He Ziyan, simply grabbed his shoulder, without saying anything.He Ziyan\u2019s fingers gently and slowly drew circles the table, and with his eyes still lowered, he spoke in a voice that was still very calm, \u201cLater, I went to work secretly; restaurants, bars, I did a lot of jobs. I liked music, so I earned money every day to save money, so that I could buy the musical instruments I wanted to buy. Sometimes I would sing in the bar for a whole week, singing all night long.\u201dThen he looked up and laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time. Now when you want me to recall it, I can\u2019t remember many things.\u201dSeeing the smile on his face, Fang Juexia heart stung a bit. He Ziyan, who always clowned around, could actually smile like this.\u201cIt\u2019s all in the past.\u201d Cheng Qiang remembered that when he was recruited into the company, He Ziyan didn\u2019t ask if he would be able to make a debut. He had just asked him if the company would arrange courses in vocal music and composition for him?When Cheng Qiang replied yes, he came.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s all stuff that happened a long time ago, you guys shouldn\u2019t worry about it.\u201d He Ziyan raised his eyebrows and said, \u201cFortunately, at that time, because I was reluctant to give it up, I kept the certificates from the welfare home. Those can be used as proof for clarification. Yes, they made use of something that was difficult to clarify to deal with me, because they felt that no matter what family I was from, as long as I didn\u2019t have a powerful background, it would be very difficult for me to get out of this mess, but I\u2019m really sorry.\u201dHe Ziyan smiled. \u201cI really don\u2019t have a family.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just don\u2019t get any snot on me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just very sad.\u201d Ling Yi\u2019s mouth was pursed, and his tears were still dripping down, one big drop after another. Lu Yuan was the same, gulping down cup after cup of alcohol after hearing this, both angry and sad. \u201cThey must think you will explode in popularity after this drama, and want to prevent that from happening. Last time, it was gossip about an affair, this time, it\u2019s about family, they\u2019re too disgusting.\u201dFang Juexia understood them being in such a mood. Lu Yuan and Ling Yi came from happy families, and even more, Ling Yi was a child who had been spoiled as he was growing up. When he thought of He Ziyan\u2019s life, he would definitely compare it with his own, and would be very sympathetic.On the contrary, Jiang Miao, Pei Tingsong, and him, the three of them seemed very silent; they wanted to comfort He Ziyan, but couldn\u2019t think of any words to comfort him with. Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help but glance at Pei Tingsong, only to see him looking down, his eyelashes casting long shadows under the booth\u2019s light, making him imagine the clouds that floated in the sky during midsummer, and how the shadows of those clouds would also appear on the ground.Jiang Miao had been very silent from the beginning; he was always calm, but he was also the most comforting person in their group. Fang Juexia looked at his thin shoulders; he had worked too hard after his drama had started filming, and he seemed to have shrunk a bit.It was also strange to think that there were several children from unhappy families in their group. It seemed like a coincidence, but it was just that real.Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help recalling how, when he was a child, his teacher always said that the adjective in front of the word \u2018family\u2019 should be \u201chappy\u201d and \u201cblessed\u201d, and so he would look forward to such a \u2018happy\u2019 family, mistakenly thinking that everyone\u2019s family was a happy family.Now, it seemed that everyone was aware of only the changes they personally went through in life, while there were how many broken families that really existed around everyone.They couldn\u2019t continue eating their celebratory meal anymore, so Cheng Qiang arranged for people to send the members back to their dormitories, while asking Jiang Miao to comfort He Ziyan a bit before he rushed back to the company to work overtime.On the way from the parking lot to the dormitory elevator, the\u00a0 people in front talked noisily, while Fang Juexia and Jiang Miao walked behind.\u201cMiao Ge,\u201d Fang Juexia took the initiative to ask, \u201chave you known about this for a long time?\u201d In fact, his tone made it clear that he wasn\u2019t asking a question, and that he was just verifying his own answer.Jiang Miao also smiled. \u201cYes.\u201dHis eyes moved to He Ziyan who was walking in front of him. \u201cWhen I first entered the company, the company arranged for us to live together. He asked me why I cared for my younger sister so much, and I confessed that my parents had died together in the plane crash, leaving just the two of us to grow up together with relatives, which is why I can\u2019t help but take care of her.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cLater, he told me about his matters. With everyone comparing their miseries together, and then both looking after each other, life didn\u2019t seem so miserable anymore.\u201dFang Juexia had guessed something similar.After listening to Jiang Miao\u2019s words, the idea that he should confess to them also popped up in Fang Juexia\u2019s mind, that he should tell them about everything that he had gone through, from his nightmarish father to the darkness that he had dealt with for so many years.But looking at the heaviness on Jiang Miao\u2019s face, he felt that now was not a good time. He didn\u2019t want his experience to cloud over other people\u2019s worries.They were similar, both covered with a mature shell. If they took it off, what one may find hidden inside may still be a child who couldn\u2019t grow up or run away. No matter how much time passed, that child would always be hiding inside.No one could erase the existence of this child, and the best way to deal with him was to maintain a peaceful coexistence with him.From not too far away, Ling Yi waved at them, who were behind him, and yelled, \u201cHurry up\u00a0ya, the elevator is closing.\u201d\u201cThe definition of family is sometimes very narrow.\u201d Fang Juexia suddenly opened his mouth again, and sounded as if he were making some kind of mathematical conjecture or judgment.Jiang Miao, who had already walked forward quickly, turned back upon hearing Fang Juexia and looked at him with complicated eyes. He looked at his thin shoulders and the rare fire in his always cold eyes right now.\u201cWe are family, too.\u201d He said seriously..Cheng Qiang went back to the company and dealt with this matter while restraining his anger. The mess last time, the one about the dating gossip, could be said to simply be a common routine in the circle, but the rumors this time were just low-down and the worst.Originally, with this type of gossip creating an uproar, Star Chart and the public relations team would have found it difficult to reduce the impact of such rumors, because no matter how they tried to explain and clarify it, no one could really speak about sensitive matters, moreso with it termed as corruption. Some people would say it was an issue with the public security system, while others would say it involved the financial affairs of an enterprise; in a word, the moment the rumor first came out, then no matter what, anyone could say that the upper authorities weren\u2019t allowed to make the entire matter public, and could seize to distort the matter using that pretext.Even if He Ziyan\u2019s real parents were pulled out, it couldn\u2019t guarantee that the other side wouldn\u2019t go along with this and say that what they spread about was false. Most people just wanted to believe in whatever story they wanted to see.Who could have known that the reason He Ziyan had always been evasive and unclear was because he really had no parents.Cheng Qiang felt very powerless. In order to clarify the rumors, these boys had to reveal their scars, but if they didn\u2019t clarify the matter, then He Ziyan\u2019s efforts up until now would have been in vain.This was probably something that had to be endured on the climb up to the top.Star Chart\u2019s clarification plan was executed very quickly; the relevant documents were listed one by one, which included all the certificates that He Ziyan had given them, the old documents from the orphanage, and the collective account of the work he had done as an adult. There were all kinds of documents, and all of them together proved that He Ziyan did not belong to any family.Along with this announcement, Star Chart posted a strongly-worded message, using very serious words for the first time in order to express their anger. The fans and many other deceived netizens also expressed anger at the rumor after this clarification was released.[@melody: It\u2019s too much, forcing people to take out their identity as an orphan in order to clarify the matter.][@I also like Kaleido today: The rumormaker is dead, I\u2019m so distressed over my Fire Ge 55555.

I thought back then that he had a bad relationship with his family, but I never imagined he was an abandoned child. This rumormaker really deserves to die.]Although they had to wash their dirty linen in public, this matter was finally dealt with. The drama crew, after communicating with Star Chart, also published a Weibo post protecting their actors, calling on \u201cthe ill-intentioned people\u201d to compete fairly.Nobody thought that this malicious rumor would end with such a sob. The furor of the matter lasted for three or four days, and many people clamoured that everyone needed to resist the bad atmosphere created by rumor-mongering in the entertainment circle. This made a big splash, making it seem as if the netizens would really start to resist it.But Fang Juexia knew better than anyone that once the next rumor appeared, many people would step into it again like before, eat the melons they felt were sweet, and would become the anonymous accomplices carrying those rumors forward.Perhaps it had gone on for too long, or maybe because He Ziyan was really not good at showing weakness, but even if the members were drinking and chatting together, he would still laugh like he was used to and joke about his previous terrible matters.\u201cIf these things happened to others, they might have already talked about it tearfully in a reality TV show several times,\u201d Pei Tingsong said sharply.He Ziyan shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not okay, my complaints can\u2019t destroy my image as a silly head gong.\u201dLu Yuan laughed. \u201cHahahahaha, is that even a good reputation?\u201dPei Tingsong was unconvinced. \u201cI approve the part in the front, but you are not the head gong.\u201dFang Juexia glanced at him and asked calmly, \u201cIs the head gong position decided on our childishness level?\u201dLing Yi laughed until his stomach hurt. \u201cHahahahaha, what\u2019s going on with your guys\u2019 gong group?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk about it, what gong or shou\u00a0ah?\u201d Jiang Miao stopped them. \u201cFortunately, there is no camera filming right now, otherwise everyone would know that you guys are secretly reading gay stories.\u201dUnder the arrangement of the company and the program team, He Ziyan went to Ling Yi\u2019s music program as a guest to help the singers. As soon as people got busy, things turned around quickly.However, Fang Juexia still felt a little uneasy. In the past, he had thought that rumors would only be about himself, but he didn\u2019t expect that they would also involve family members. Work went on, as did the right and wrong in the entertainment industry. Today, it was about his bandmate, and the next day it was about his family. He didn\u2019t know if it was because he had been in the circle for too long, but Fang Juexia kept thinking of himself while looking at other\u2019s experiences.It was like being forced to swallow bowls of white rice mixed with fish bones; they already didn\u2019t want to consume it, and then, they also had to protect against the spines inside the bowl, wondering if one day, it would scratch their throats.But there was no other way; when they weren\u2019t popular, everything was calm and still, but now that they had gotten popular, none of these things could be stopped.Kaleido had risen faster than any of them could imagine, having spent two years dormant before exploding in popularity this year. The two gold lettered signs of \u2018strength\u2019 and \u2018originality\u2019 tagged on them made them unique among boybands. They had even jumped over the transformation process most idol groups had to go through by leaving their own position and name in the music world.The biggest fear among boybands was uneven popularity among members. Now, in addition to their two top members, the other members were also blooming in other fields. All of the members boasted of a very stable popularity, and long-term development was not a problem for any of them.There were too many dramas looking for Fang Juexia, all offering the lead male lead role to him, but he didn\u2019t care about acting, and he didn\u2019t really like doing variety shows either. It was even more difficult to arrange these things for Pei Tingsong. However, even though their exposure rate was not greater than that of their bandmates, their popularity grew higher day by day, especially when it came to their CP fans. It was completely unprecedented, with the power of any one of their CP fan stations being enough to topple any of that of the only-fan stations of Kaleido.Star Chart didn\u2019t force them to work, but they were constantly invited to do advertisements, and the fashion circle also favored them. One magazine cover after the other invited them, and later, even a blue-blooded luxury brand extended an olive branch to them, arranging for them to come see one of their shows. Fang Juexia listened to the company\u2019s arrangement and agreed. Gradually, their modeling clothes changed from before, and the clothes for shooting the single person covers were also specially sponsored by the brand.The rumors online changed even faster. Since they had changed to adapt a high luxury brand style, many gossip forums had already begun to discuss it. Many posts and threads had been created on these forums, saying that Fang Juexia had found a new financier with a strong background and great strength, which allowed him to face absolutely no problems on his climb to the top. The rumors were suspended once before being reposted, which made Xiao Wen so angry that he kept losing his temper in the car every day.\u201cWhere is this financier? If you had a financier, would you still have to work so hard?\u201dWhen Fang Juexia heard him say this, he just felt that these rumors were of a rather ordinary fare. He had become very popular too quickly in a short amount of time. Even before, when he was not popular, there had been all sorts of rumors, and even now, there were constant disturbances, so it was useless for him to worry about them. \u201cAre there few of these kinds of rumors? This kind of news can\u2019t cause any big disturbances, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dUnexpectedly, Pei Tingsong, who was sitting next to him, joined in on the excitement.[A Constant Truth: I\u2019m the original financier; I\u2019m rich, have a good background, am protecting you, and I\u2019m even handsome.]Reading this message made Fang Juexia feel that it was both infuriating and funny.[Moonlight: Shameless.]Seeing this word, Pei Tingsong began to laugh.[A Constant Truth: Gege, just this much is shameless? You\u2019ve been with me for so long, and your temper is getting bigger and bigger, but your face hasn\u2019t become thicker at all.][A Constant Truth: I have many shameless things to do with you.]Fang Juexia blushed as he read these words, so he turned his face and looked straight ahead without looking at him. But just as he did this, the cellphone in his hand vibrated again. Xiao Wen, who was in the passenger seat, thought it was strange. \u201cWhose cellphone is it that keeps vibrating?\u201dHe had to look down and read the incoming message.[A Constant Truth: You\u2019re not allowed to hide, I\u2019m really going to bully you in earnest.]This guy was really\u2026.\u00a0Fang Juexia puffed himself up, turned his face to look at him, and glared at him.As soon as their eyes met, Pei Tingsong smiled at him. His smile was so childish, with his eyes curving into crescents, and he even mouthed at him silently, \u201cYou are so cute.\u201dHe really couldn\u2019t do anything to him, it was hard to even pretend to be angry with him. Only after Fang Juexia took a deep breath, turned his head, and looked out of the window, did he manage to hide the smile on his face.The sweet-scented osmanthus blossoms on the side of the road fell to the ground in milky yellow dots, all fragments of autumn. As the wind swirled, their fragrance wafted through the window.So sweet.Cheng Qiang found them for a meeting; the others hadn\u2019t arrived yet, only Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong had come in early, so he first explained the recent brand endorsement to them. \u201cThe brand merchants really like your popularity and reputation at present, but in order to be safe, they are planning to give you guys only the title of style ambassador first, and then they\u2019ll wait until the new year to promote you guys to spokespersons officially. By then, the cover-shoot for your guys\u2019 magazine should also be quite complete.\u201dFang Juexia only nodded, not speaking.Pei Tingsong leaned back on the chair and said lazily, \u201cIsn\u2019t it just about picking a new face? But they\u2019re dragging it on this much.\u201d\u201cYou got something good, and you\u2019re still showing off your cleverness, not even thinking about how long you\u2019ve been popular for?\u201d Cheng Qiang told the assistants to put the papers away properly, and then warned, \u201cBe very careful right now, especially you, Xiao Pei, don\u2019t quarrel online, be a bit more steady, and don\u2019t make trouble. In the blink of an eye, it\u2019ll be the end of the year, then the release of your winter album, and all sorts of major parties and awards ceremonies will be held. By then, we\u2019ll be so busy, we\u2019ll never be done. Now, keep a low profile for me, understand?\u201dFang Juexia nodded obediently and even pressed Pei Tingsong\u2019s head down to make him nod along with him as well.It was just at this time that Ling Yi pushed open the door and came in. \u201cYour baby Ling Yi has arrived!\u201dPei Tingsong pretended to be deaf and dumb. \u201cWho? Who\u2019s a\u00a01?\u201d\u201cYou little brat Xiao Pei.\u201d Ling Yi pinched his neck from behind and shook it desperately. \u201cHave you been infected by your CP fans to become deaf like this?\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t get the joke and asked, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201dHe Ziyan came in with Ling Yi. \u201cJust now, we used our side accounts to scroll through Weibo, and saw that your guys\u2019 only-fans and CP fans had started to quarrel. Good god, they were flaming to the point that that\u2019s what you call it\u2014 a murky sky over a dark earth with neither the sun nor moon giving off any light.\u201dPei Tingsong kicked him with his foot. \u201cAre you narrating a book?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve discovered my hidden skill.\u201d He Ziyan sat next to him and continued, \u201cIt\u2019s normal for fans to tear into each other every day, but it\u2019s too exciting when your fans quarrel. Isn\u2019t your CP called TingJue? So, it\u2019s all blue skies over the TingJue girls\u2019 heads and because you two interact too much, they\u2019ve become more publicized. Then they were cursed out by the only-fans; it\u2019s fine if they just curse them out\u00a0ba, but they even gave the CP fans a bad nickname.\u201dFang Juexia, who hardly ever surfed online, was a little surprised. \u201cEven fans have bad nicknames?\u201d\u201cYes\u00a0ah! What did they call them, do you know? \u201d Ling Yi tried to hold back his laughter. \u201cDeaf\u00a0girls! Hahahahahahaha!\u201dDe-deaf?He Ziyan repeatedly sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s really a pun, just too wonderful. It\u2019s not only related to TingJue, but also criticizes and curses out the CP fans as being deaf and dumb, not waking up no matter how they\u2019re yelled at, taking the fake to be real.\u201dSaying that, Fang Juexia unavoidably felt a bit guilty; after all, they really were real, and were just pretending to be fake while switching in something real.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgPei Tingsong clicked his tongue. \u201cPeople can call them whatever they want, but they even came up with a bad nickname.\u201d\u201cYou think it\u2019s only-fans giving CP fans names\u00a0ah, isn\u2019t it all the same flipped around.\u201d Ling Yi was like someone who was enumerating a family\u2019s valuables when regarding his bandmates\u2019 fan circles. \u201cLook, don\u2019t you have the nickname Putuo Temple Site from before? Your only-fans always call themselves believers, and they\u2019re saying that the believers are willing to be vegetarian all their lives in exchange for the deaf girls being able to hear and see clearly.\u201dFang Juexia accidentally laughed, then opened up a bottle of water in order to suppress it.Ling Yi added, \u201cYet, as a result, the TingJue girls hit back, saying that they were afraid that the believers at Putuo Temple Site weren\u2019t all nuns.\u201dHe Ziyan started laughing hard. \u201cHey, hey, I saw another one. Because Juexia\u2019s full name can be abbreviated as\u00a0Hairline, the CP fans say that Juexia\u2019s poisonous only-fans are girls with receding hairlines, that is, bald girls. Putuo Temple Site nuns paired with bald girls, even your poisonous only-fans match perfectly, no wonder they quarrel every day.\u201cIf they quarrel, that\u2019s nothing much, but Sansan also taught me a phrase: I curse you, and you curse me, and my two Gege sleep together, you\u2019ll see.\u201dFang Juexia almost choked on his own saliva.With the two of them mocking it, even the quarrel became funny.Cheng Qiang, however, had a headache. \u201cBe careful with your side accounts for me, you better keep your masks on tightly. Some time ago, a little flower\u2019s mask fell off, and even her love affair was accidentally exposed, and there was so much uproar over it.\u201d\u201cUnderstood\u2014\u201dOnceall the people arrived, the meeting shifted into business mode. Cheng Qiang collected and explained all the work they had done since the beginning of the year; there was a whole heap of stuff, and everyone grew sleepy just listening to it. Just when Ling Yi was bored enough to start secretly playing\u00a0Xiao Xiao Le\u00a0under the table, Cheng Qiang finally changed the topic.\u201cAnother more important matter is about your tour.\u201dThe six people came to life in a flash.\u201cA tour???\u201d\u201cAre we going to have a concert?\u201d\u201cWhen? Where is the first performance? Beijing?\u201dCheng Qiang moved his hands up and down in the air to suppress them a bit. \u201cCalm down, okay? It\u2019s like you guys have never had a concert before.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve never had one\u00a0ah!\u201dFang Juexia couldn\u2019t help laughing. He thought it would be a long time before they could have their own concert, but he didn\u2019t expect that this day would come faster than he had expected.Cheng Qiang explained, \u201cThere are many things to prepare for a concert, such as determining the concept, selecting the venue and doing the paperwork for it, negotiating for sponsors, designing the special effects, re-choreographing, and rehearsing\u2026 It\u2019ll probably take more than half a year. Most of your fans are still students, so we have preliminarily determined that it will be during summer vacation next year.\u201d\u201cSo long\u00a0ah.\u201d Ling Yi pulled a pillow into his arms and complained, \u201cThere\u2019s more than half a year left.\u201dJiang Miao said with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s very good. This way, the winter album will also have been released, and with two regular albums plus three mini albums, plus each member\u2019s solo, we will certainly have enough repertoire for the concert.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Cheng Qiang sat down and said, \u201cYou can also invite your senior brothers to be your guest.\u201dNormally, Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t pay much attention in meetings, but he raised his hand this time. \u201cQuestion, will one of the concert venues be Guangzhou?\u201dFang Juexia was stunned and looked at him immediately.Lu Yuan first took over. \u201cThere must be some held there\u00a0ba, the first tier cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou must all be there\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cI also want to go to Guangzhou,\u201d said Ling Yi, happily rocking back and forth, looking like an electric sunflower toy bought from a roadside stand. \u201cThe food in Guangzhou is delicious.\u201dCheng Qiang nodded. \u201cAs long as nothing unexpected happens, there should be some held there. The company\u2019s current idea is to hold ten concerts in China first, and then concerts abroad will be determined later.\u201dHe Ziyan couldn\u2019t help but complain, \u201cSmall obscure K can actually do an overseas concert?\u201d\u201cHahahaha!\u201dBy the time the meeting ended, it was evening. Cheng Qiang urged them to go back, while he had to deal with some mail in the company. The weather had gotten colder, but the weather in Beijing was always unpredictable. The weather during daytime was still the cool and crisp autumn weather, but as soon as it got dark, the wind started whistling. Fang Juexia only wore a sweater over his shirt, and looking from behind, his gaunt shoulders stood out with their thinness, and his pale ankles were also thin.After two steps, Pei Tingsong grabbed him and said, \u201cAccompany me to the workshop to get something.\u201dFang Juexia found this gesture inexplicable. \u201cNow?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201dHe said he wanted to get something, so Fang Juexia would certainly go with him. After opening the door, Fang Juexia stood outside and waited. Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t turn on the light; he simply took down a dark brown windbreaker coat from the back of the swivel chair, then pulled Fang Juexia in, closed the door, put the windbreaker on his shoulders, took his arm, and helped him put his arms into the sleeves before buttoning it up. He tied up the belt of the jacket, all the while thinking that Fang Juexia\u2019s waist was very thin.Looking down at Gege\u2019s waist for a while, Pei Tingsong loosened it up again. \u201cDon\u2019t fasten it.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s face was smiling. With no lights on, the room was shrouded in darkness, and only the moonlight outside the window was shining on his face. It was like a layer of frost covering a gentle ice beauty.Pei Tingsong couldn\u2019t help but lower his head and pull his belt until he was pulled into his embrace. Fang Juexia, who couldn\u2019t see clearly, could only sense the gentle smell of sea salt as it wrapped around him. Hot and humid kisses fell down like rain, his teeth were pried open, and his tongue was hooked out. As they entangled together, his hands moved unconsciously up, as they always did in this situation, and he grasped the fabric of Pei Tingsong\u2019s coat.With just a kiss, he felt the taste of love all the way from the inside to outside.\u201cIt\u2019s cold outside,\u201d Pei Tingsong said with his forehead lowered.Fang Juexia let out a soft \u201cen\u201d, and then heard him volunteering, \u201cI\u2019ll help you warm up.\u201dAnd he did so by grinding up against Fang Juexia in the dark, while his heavy breathing pressed him into retreating. As soon as he retreated a bit, Pei Tingsong attacked, and just like that, he stumbled step by step until he had no space to retreat to, for his back was now against the door. As Pei Tingsong went from his lips to the side of his neck, to his collarbone under his shirt, Fang Juexia panted a few times, his face hot, and only then did he stop.After finishing kissing him, Pei Tingsong was still a little unhappy. He straightened Fang Juexia\u2019s collar. \u201cYou see how little you wear, your lips and face are cold.\u201d\u201cOnly the sick would feel hot,\u201d Fang Juexia quibbled.Pei Tingsong pinched the tip of his chin. \u201cThen are you not embarrassed right now, are you sick?\u201dIndeed, it was worse than being sick.Fang Juexia was hot all over, but he couldn\u2019t get anything good out of quarelling with him, so he could only switch the topic, \u201cWhat did you want to get?\u201dPei Tingsong pulled him out. \u201cIt\u2019s on you, little one.\u201dOn hearing this address, Fang Juexia felt as if his heart had been scratched by a cat\u2019s paw. He said solemnly, \u201cIf you can\u2019t calculate our ages, I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019m three years older than you, I\u2019m your Ge.\u201d\u201cTo be precise, it\u2019s two and a half years.\u201dThe two of them snarked at each other as they walked down the corridor and actually bumped into Cheng Qiang, who came out of the office in a hurry. He was just removing his cellphone from his ear, it was clear that he must have just ended a phone call.Pei Tingsong felt it was strange and called out, \u201cQiang Ge.\u201d Only then did Cheng Qiang turn back. \u201cWhy are you guys still here? Perfect, Juexia, there\u2019s something I have to discuss with you?\u201dWhat was the matter now?Fang Juexia had a bad feeling and didn\u2019t speak. He simply\u00a0 looked up at him.When Cheng Qiang walked over, he hesitated when he saw Pei Tingsong. Fang Juexia was calm and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ge. You say it directly\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s your father\u2019s matter.\u201d Cheng Qiang originally only knew that Fang Juexia was from a single parent family, but he didn\u2019t know about the specific situation of his father, so he talked about it as if carrying the idea that this could all just be a rumor. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true, but an anonymous e-mail was sent to us, saying that they have evidence of your father taking drugs. Now they are asking us for fees to not report it publically, and if we don\u2019t give it to them, they will find another company to reveal the matter to.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s face suddenly grew cold. \u201cHow much is it?\u201d\u201cSeven digits.\u201d Cheng Qiang frowned and looked at the real person who was involved. \u201cThe company can also pay this\u2026\u201dA smile appeared on Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth. His voice was very light, containing no emotions, but he interrupted Cheng Qiang for the very first time\u2014\u201cDream on.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When he looked up at Cheng Qiang, a trace of regret appeared in his heart.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Qiang Ge. I kept trying to prepare to confess this entire matter to you, but this entire time, I haven\u2019t found a suitable opportunity to do so.\u201dCheng Qiang was really surprised to see this news at first, but the recent storms had honed his endurance. He pulled them into the office, made them sit down, and then said, \u201cIt\u2019s also very hard for you to speak on this private matter, and right now, they still haven\u2019t directly exposed us, so there is still room for us to maneuver. Let\u2019s hold off the other side first; the company has to discuss such a large PR expense required to suppress this news, so the other party shouldn\u2019t announce it immediately.\u201d\u201cQiang Ge,\u201d Pei Tingsong said, 'send me that anonymous email, and I\u2019ll have someone investigate it.\u201dCheng Qiang nodded. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll contact the PR team.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll come along with you,\u201d Pei Tingsong said as he lowered his head to send a message. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to invite a PR team, I\u2019ll invite the most expensive and best PR team. There\u2019s been pile after pile of garbage appearing recently, and I\u2019ve wanted to clean them up for a long time now.\u201dCheng Qiang sighed and looked at Fang Juexia. \u201cJuexia, now that things have already come to this stage, I hope you can tell me all about it.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s inner struggle was not because he was unwilling to talk about it, but that facing up to his father\u2019s ugliness was too painful. However, right now, he had no other choice.He took a deep breath and looked at Cheng Qiang, trying to find the most calm and objective words to describe his past.\u201cMy father used to be a promising dancer, but he was disabled by a stage accident, and his career was ruined. Later, he became a drunk, unleashed domestic abuse on us, and became addicted to drugs. He abandoned my mother and me ten years ago, leaving with all the money from our family. Not long ago, I saw him again. He had been a drug addict for many years, and the first time we met again, he tried to knock me out, kidnap me, and bring me away in exchange for drug money. Later, we sent him to the rehab center. I thought it would be over after that, but didn\u2019t expect that\u2026\u201dThroughout the whole narration, he spoke clearly, without any emotions, while also omitting the details. It seemed as if he was just repeating something that had nothing to do with him. However, Cheng Qiang, who was listening to it, only felt that every word of his was weeping with blood. He couldn\u2019t imagine how these things were something that a father could do to his own son at all.Knock out, kidnap, exchange for money.These were all real experiences Fang Juexia had undergone that they didn\u2019t know anything about. From the first day that Cheng Qiang had taken over Kaleido, the one he had loved the most was the child in front of him. Plainly everything about him was the best, but because he was taciturn and afraid of making mistakes, he lived every single day as if he were on a highwire.He couldn\u2019t help gripping Fang Juexia\u2019s shoulder after listening to this, but Fang Juexia just shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m just very sorry that I didn\u2019t tell you guys about it back when he appeared. Now, with everything happening, it\u2019s all become so frantic.\u201dCheng Qiang said with a bitter smile, \u201cEven if you had told us back then, it wouldn\u2019t have been that useful. If someone really wants to connect a father who is addicted to drugs with his son, even if we had started preparing way back during your guys\u2019 debut, we would have no way to cut our losses.\u201dDebut.Upon hearing that word, Fang Juexia just felt that his throat was completely dry and hoarse, and that his face seemed to be covered in a thicket of tens of thousands of icy cold needles.He was born with a birthmark on his face, and also had night blindness, an illness that made him completely unsuitable for performing on a dark stage, and on top of all of this, he was even carrying the ticking time bomb of having a drug addict for a father.He was such a person, such a him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Fang Juexia raised his head, his eyes red, and murmured, \u201cIn fact, I shouldn\u2019t have debuted at all\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong immediately took his hand. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Fang Juexia, I\u2019m going to repeat myself, you were born to belong on the stage. If even you aren\u2019t suitable for it, no one is.\u201dHe was such a precious person, how could he aggrieve himself like this?Cheng Qiang knew that it was his words that caused this change in mood in Fang Juexia, and he was filled with guilt. \u201cNo, Juexia, you did nothing wrong in this entire matter. If it wasn\u2019t for you, Kaleido wouldn\u2019t be where it is today, do you understand? In fact, it\u2019s not like there isn\u2019t a solution to this matter, worst comes to worst, we\u2019ll just shut them up with the PR fee they\u2019re demanding, and the big matter will become smaller\u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dFang Juexia tried hard to calm himself down a little more and analyzed the whole matter to Cheng Qiang. \u201cSince they dare to blackmail us, they will do so a second time. After all, there are still hidden dangers in whitewashing things and presenting a false peace. With such a big story, they will not stop just for the sake of seven million. If I get more popular in the future than I am now, they will only threaten me again and again, taking it as a weakness.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s eyes were firm. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, I\u2019m also a victim. So, in regards to my father taking drugs, we have to talk about it, and it has to be me who says something about it.\u201dThis path he was talking about was a desperate move.Cheng Qiang\u2019s first reaction was to completely disagree. \u201cHow can we do that? If you really say something, do you know how many of our opponents and antis are going to take this and cause trouble? They may even stigmatize you as an addict as well.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d As soon as Fang Juexia had become aware of this matter, all the possible slander had already appeared in his mind. He was more familiar with the taste of dirty splashed water than anyone else.Those years of slander were like a stain on his body; no matter how much he wiped at it, he couldn\u2019t wipe it all off. Those malicious rumors had pretty much become scars on his body that hurt when he touched them. No matter how much he explained, how he made every effort to clarify the rumors, all he got in exchange was just more spit and abuse.At first, he didn\u2019t really understand why this was happening; why didn\u2019t people want to believe the truth? Then, slowly and gradually, he got used to the malice of this circle. Most of the time, there was no reason behind it. Truth was the least valuable thing in this industry.As a result, Fang Juexia\u2019s heart also cooled bit by bit. He no longer argued fearlessly, and for his response, could only give the best stage performance each time.He had been living with these repulsive scars ever since then.\u201cThere\u2019s no other way. The only thing I can do is scrape the poison off of the bone.\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to go on like this any more; he was going to thoroughly gouge out all those dormant sores.Fang Juexia told them, while telling himself this too, \u201cIf this secret is kept the entire time, no one knows what will happen in the future. I have no way to make this time bomb any more uncontrollable. As for the accusation of whether I am a drug addict or not, we can get a drug test done and put it online as proof.\u201dAs Cheng Qiang was considering it, he heard Pei Tingsong speak, \u201cAlready arranged a PR team, it\u2019s the most famous one in the circle.\u201d\u201cHow much was it?\u201d Fang Juexia asked.\u201cYou guys don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d Pei Tingsong continued, \u201cThey are ready for a video conference to be held any time now, to put forward strategy and discuss response plans. However, the other side gave us the same advice that Juexia did.\u201d He looked at Cheng Qiang. \u201cThey also think that we need to make the first move with this matter.\u201dKaleido was the first group that Cheng Qiang had officially led and managed. He had endured all sorts of storms with Kaleido, so when he encountered such things, his first reaction was always to be relatively conservative.\u201cI see. Let\u2019s do some overtime now, and I\u2019ll call the company\u2019s PR department to come over and inform the necessary departments as well.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201dIt hadn\u2019t been long since the situation with He Ziyan, and now it was the group\u2019s official ace\u2019s turn. The company attached great importance to it, and even Chen Zhengyun, who had just returned from a business trip, rushed back to the company. The PR team held a meeting with Fang Juexia for a full hour, and after understanding everything, they gave a general outline on how to handle this issue.Via video call, the person-in-charge said, \u201cIn fact, Mr. Fang\u2019s idea is right. First of all, we should make the truth public before the other party can expose it, so as to avoid having the other party call all the shots with this explosive story. If we take the initiative to let Mr. Fang make it public, and then arrange for articles and guide public opinion, we can shift the focus of the incident from \u2018the father of a talked-about star is a drug addict\u2019 to \u2018biological family tragedy, frequent exposure of privacy, and a second blow.\u2019 In this way, we can minimize our losses.\u201dThe subject of the matter being discussed was sitting at the table. The moonlight that lit the early hours before dawn shone against his back, and his whole person was shadowed by it. Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart kept aching as he looked at him. In the past, he may have already been flaming back online, but now he knew that that was not a mature way to deal with this situation. He also wanted to grow up and protect the person he loved the most.While everyone here was talking about this and expressing their own views and strategy, Fang Juexia, who was in the center of the vortex, remained silent. He only listened, not uttering a single word, seemingly thinking about something.After a long time, when the PR team had already started to contact writers and other public opinion forces, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s one more matter.\u201dCheng Qiang looked at him suspiciously, while Chen Zhengyun called a halt to the meeting directly. \u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cFrom the beginning, I have been wondering if this matter was my father\u2019s doing, because he already has a previous record of extortion.\u201d Here, Fang Juexia shook his head. \u201cBut I think the possibility of that is very low, because he is now in the drug rehabilitation center, isolated from the outside world. But this matter, besides myself, my mother, and Xiao Pei, who helped me deal with it some time ago, no one else should know about it. So how on earth did someone unearth this matter? This is the point I find very perplexing.\u201dThis was also what Pei Tingsong kept turning over and over again in his mind. Clearly, he had put Fang Ping in the most strictly controlled rehab center, and then had also sent people to watch him all day. He was completely isolated from the outside world, so there was no chance for him to get out and make any more trouble.\u201cWhen I met him, and he extorted me, I asked him, and he didn\u2019t admit to contacting any company or media, but I doubt that now.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cHe said that in order to come to Beijing to find me, he used up all the money he had. This is strange because I had already been followed for nearly a week before the day of the attempted kidnapping. During that week, what did he rely on to maintain himself, and especially with a long-term drug habit, how could he last so long by himself?\u201dPei Tingsong also had thought about this question before. \u201cDo you suspect that he already met with some other people before you? These people got some information from him and gave him money to maintain his habit.\u201dFang Juexia nodded. \u201cI guess it was like that. When he\u2019s caught in the thrall of his addiction, he can hardly be regarded as a human being. As long as anyone would give him some money to exchange for drugs, he could do anything. Whether it is selling my relationship to him or selling anything else, he could do any of that.\u201dChen Zhengyun, who had been listening to him in silence, suddenly grasped the key point. \u201cAnything else?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Fang Juexia looked at him. \u201cThat\u2019s what I needed to add. Boss, there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve been hiding from all of you.\u201dUnder the conference table, his hands clenched tightly and his knuckles turned completely white, but on the surface, he was still the calm Fang Juexia. \u201cI have congenital night blindness. In dim light, my vision will become extremely impaired, even close to total blindness.\u201dPei Tingsong was stunned. He didn\u2019t expect that Fang Juexia would reveal this matter at the same time as this. This was basically him declaring to everyone here the biggest secret he had been carrying on his own for so many years. His forbearance and prudence, and those many years of painstaking practice, had now all dissolved into foam.Cheng Qiang couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cNight blindness? Then when you are onstage\u2026\u201dFang Juexia said lightly, \u201cWhen the light isn\u2019t bright enough, I can\u2019t see and can only dance based on the intuition I trained. But on most stages, there\u2019s plenty of light.\u201d After that, he looked at them with dim eyes and apologized again, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve kept this from everyone.\u201dChen Zhengyun, wearing a solemn look, put his hand on the table. He was really surprised, but when he thought about it again, all the unreasonable details of the past were now becoming clear. He thought of when he had seen this child for the first time; clearly, he possessed a natural gift, and he was born to do this\u00a0job, but even then, his whole person carried a sense of burden. His thin shoulders were always heavy, but he wouldn\u2019t speak about it, and he practiced every day. Even before he debuted, he slept on the floor of the practice room for many days in a row.Now, he finally knew why.\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Chen Zhengyun smiled. \u201cFortunately you managed to hide this, otherwise we would have missed out on a genius.\u201dFang Juexia had never, even a little bit, felt wronged for himself due to his own matters, but Chen Zhengyun\u2019s words made his nose sting for a moment.Every day since his debut, and before every performance, Fang Juexia would have trouble sleeping and eating. Even in his dreams, he would dream that he had made a mistake or had even fallen on the dim stage, thus implicating the whole group. His dreams were filled with him being criticized by everyone.[Why did you want to debut? You\u2019re completely not suited to dance on a stage, you know!][Fang Juexia, look at yourself. You were born as a person who would make mistakes on the stage.][What\u2019s the use of practice?! No matter how much you practice, you can\u2019t not make a mistake!][You want to drag everyone into the water with you, right?]\u201cYes,\u201d Cheng Qiang chimed in, \u201cThe rest of them aren\u2019t here right now, but if they were, they would definitely all thank you. Juexia, you are Kaleido\u2019s backbone, do you understand?\u201dFang Juexia tried hard to make himself smile and nodded his head hard to accept their approval. \u201cThis point may also become a threat used by others to attack me. I\u2019m guessing he has already told others, so I fear I have no choice but to also make this public.\u201dThe PR team was silent for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, it\u2019s not a big problem. Genetic diseases are categorised as private information, and yours doesn\u2019t cause any harm to others. Besides, you\u2019ve never made any mistakes over the years.\u201dNever.Fang Juexia gritted his teeth and nodded.Pei Tingsong felt powerless and helpless. He had clearly tried his best to help Fang Juexia avoid suffering through this, but it couldn\u2019t be avoided at all. These nightmares, which had been lingering around for so many years, had now broken out in a flash, and were growing into a giant beast that would nearly devour Fang Juexia, and there was nowhere to hide.Right after he revealed this matter, the person-in-charge of monitoring public opinion in the PR team said, \u201cMr. Fang, your worry isn\u2019t unfounded. There really is someone who has started to spread rumors about it.\u201dThe other side had sent out screenshots of the revelations, although the contents were vague.Visit lightnovelreader.com for extra chapters.[Recently, the new top celebrity FJX has a big melon, guarantee it\u2019s true. A person who is very close to him revealed this story, and you will all know who it is later. He has a disease that has been hidden for a long time, and it\u2019s the kind that will affect his future. I\u2019m waiting for you guys to dig the grave.]The messages below the post were obviously stirring up trouble, describing the matter in a more malicious way.[Disease? What disease can affect his future?][It can\u2019t possibly be AIDS\u2026.][Saying it like that, maybe it really is. There is finally evidence on those rumors about hidden rules that have drifted around; this proof that will arrive soon is too fierce.][AIDS wtf, then their entire group are\u2026.tch, tch, tch your circle is really messy][I just knew that the previous hidden rules rumor wasn\u2019t groundless. Otherwise, why does everyone say that FJX was involved with that, and no one else is mentioned? Just because you\u2019re beautiful, you can be self-conceited?]\u201cAre these people really all sick? Are they really not afraid that we\u2019ll drag each of them out and sue them?\u201d Cheng Qiang was furious. \u201cContact the moderator now!\u201dPei Tingsong looked at Fang Juexia, just to see him look coldly at the vicious remarks being projected on the screen, without displaying any emotional fluctuations.Habit was a terrible thing.But he really had gotten used to it.Even if a rumor saying that Fang Juexia had committed suicide in the dorms circulated around today, he wouldn\u2019t experinece much fluctuation in his mood.The PR team explained, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, now that we know it\u2019s night blindness, it can all be clarified by presenting relevant medical records and certificates. I believe Mr. Fang has all these.\u201dFang Juexia nodded. He gave them all the evidence he could find, and even asked, \u201cDo you need me to have a comprehensive physical examination?\u201dHearing these words, a sharp, piercing pain stung Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart.The mood of the people in the PR team also turned very complicated. They had experienced too many things within this entertainment industry, such as cheating couples, couples who seemed to get along in public but were starkly divided in private, and even more exaggerated and bloody gossip. Professionalism allowed them to smooth things out and leave their employer with a decent face.But now, the person standing in front of them was clearly a clean boy, but he had to scrape his own hands clean, hating he couldn\u2019t tear off his own skin to show them whether the flesh and blood under it was as black and dirty as the world said it was.If you throw enough mud, some of it will stick, and eventually, even his bones would be melted down and destroyed one by one.\u201cBefore I post on Weibo, I need to let my mama know.\u201d Fang Juexia tried to calm himself and got up to leave the meeting room.As soon as he left, Pei Tingsong stood up and told Cheng Qiang, \u201cI\u2019ll accompany him.\u201dCheng Qiang nodded and watched Pei Tingsong chase after him.Fang Juexia\u2019s back was very thin, and in the dimly lit corridor, it looked like a withered leaf. He walked to the corner of the stairs and stopped, his hand, which held the cellphone, trembling unconsciously.Pei Tingsong, who had followed him, came to a stand in front of him and held his trembling wrist. \u201cJuexia, don\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019m here.\u201d What he didn\u2019t realize was that his voice was also trembling involuntarily.It was already 2:30 in the morning, and no one picked up for a long time. Fang Juexia lowered his head and kept hitting the \u2018call\u2019 button after every failed call. Transparent tears fell on his hands, his screen, and his vision grew more and more blurry.He had held back his tears for the entire night, but in the end, they still finally flowed out when it came to his mother.\u201cWhat to do\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia, who kept extremely calm at any given time, finally showed weakness in front of his lover. \u201cPei Tingsong, what do I do\u2026 I still have to tell her, but I\u2026\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s heart felt like it was being gripped hard. He seemed to have returned to that rainy night during the summer again, as he watched his already black-and-blue lover approaching the abyss once again with his own eyes.Anyway, this time, he had to hug him first.Pei Tingsong pulled Fang Juexia into his arms and said in a gentle voice, \u201cJuexia, come here.\u201dHe suddenly felt that Fang Juexia had grown thin again. This person, who was obviously several years older than himself, was now akin to a child in his eyes. He looked so small, and so distressing. Even when stroking his shoulder, he didn\u2019t dare to use any force. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you didn\u2019t want your mama to wait for her whole lifetime?\u201cSuffering long-term pain isn\u2019t better than suffering short-term pain. Even if you hide it for a while, what will you do in the future?\u201dFang Juexia buried his head and listened to Pei Tingsong\u2019s question, every sentence buckling onto his closed-off heart.\u201cIt can\u2019t be that you want her to travel to the end of her life alone, still guarding her heart for the person who won\u2019t come back?\u201dObviously, he was holding the bad ending of this fairy tale in his hands, but he had never dared to tell his mama until now.He was too afraid to disappoint his mama.Fang Juexia cried silently on Pei Tingsong\u2019s shoulder. All the pain, grievances, and fear he had, he gave them all to Pei Tingsong. He knew that it was unfair; he should be stronger and bear everything himself.But at this moment, in the whole world, he only wanted to rest on Pei Tingsong\u2019s shoulder.Even if it was for just a minute.\u201cYou know,\u201d Pei Tingsong gently stroked his back, \u201cfor your mama, the most important thing isn\u2019t her dead love, but you.\u201dThe cellphone he was holding began to vibrate, and it was his mama calling back at 2:30 in the morning. Fang Juexia struggled out of Pei Tingsong\u2019s arms, wiped away his tears, and forced all of his emotions down before he dared to pick up the call.At the other end of the call, his mother\u2019s voice was anxious and worried. Fang Juexia had been making a living outside for many years, and no matter what happened, he had gritted his teeth and carried it through. He had never called her at such a late time before.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, baby? Juexia, are you sick? Mama\u2019s already awake now.\u201dFang Juexia held back a sob. \u201cMom, a lot of stuff has happened, and I have to use the PR team to deal with it. There is one thing I have to tell you.\u201d He continued, a frown forming on his face. \u201cIn June, Dad came to see me.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d Mama Fang\u2019s voice grew faint, \u201cYou-why didn\u2019t you say anything about that before?\u201d\u201cBecause\u2026 Because the day we met, he was still addicted to drugs.\u201d Fang Juexia desperately tried to hold his emotions back, but the truth was just that bloody. \u201cHe was holding an iron rod, and was ready to knock me out and then kidnap me, all because he didn\u2019t have money to continue sourcing drugs at that time. But, fortunately, a bodyguard stopped him, and he failed. After that, we took him to a rehab center.\u201dIt suddenly quietened down on the other end, and Fang Juexia\u2019s chest was aching a lot this whole while.\u201cNow, someone is trying to blackmail us about this, and I have to\u2014make it public myself.\u201d He knew that every word of his was piercing through his mother\u2019s heart, but he had no choice. He also fervently hoped for all this to just be a nightmare.How he wished he didn\u2019t have such a father, that he didn\u2019t have this disease that had tormented him for more than ten years, and that he didn\u2019t have any of this dirty water splashed on him, which he couldn\u2019t wash or wipe off of himself.\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll see it in the news, so\u2026 So I can only tell you in advance.\u201cMom, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dSorry that I finally\u2026.Broke your dream with my own hands.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 97Translated by juurenshaEdited by NoksLots of Weibo comments, don\u2019t like, don\u2019t readAt this moment, Fang Juexia felt like his mother was sitting in that ever-familiar chair right in front of him.And that door, which had never been locked, had collapsed in an instant.With no sound coming from the other end of the call, Fang Juexia began to regret it. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have said everything so directly; he should have at least waited until he returned home and was beside her. He had just confessed everything, but how long would it take his mama to really accept everything, and how would she sleep tonight?\u201cMom\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia called out again.Finally, a sound came from the opposite side. It sounded like a sigh, a very weak one.\u201cI see.\u201d Mama Fang was trying to put on a good face; after so many years, putting on a good face had become a part of her life. Even if they both, mother and son, had really been abandoned, and she knew she must raise her son by herself, she had still never shown any pain in front of Fang Juexia. She was always smiling.But, at this moment, when she came to know the harm her own husband had inflicted on her son, her tears finally burst out. \u201cIt\u2019s Mama who is wrong, Juexia. It\u2019s Mama who is sorry to you.\u201dHearing his mama cry, Fang Juexia grew even sadder. \u201cNo, Mom, you are the best mama in the world. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I just didn\u2019t want someone else telling you about this matter.\u201d\u201cI know, don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d Mama Fang tried her best to stop her tears from flowing. \u201cMama knows now. You must remember, you are always Mama\u2019s most important person. No matter what happens, you must protect yourself. Mama is old now, and no longer has the ability to continue protecting you.\u201dFang Juexia gripped his cellphone and crouched down along the wall. He had never been a child who was good at expressing his love. Rather, he was like a wanderer who returned home after many years; the more he cared, the less easy it would be for him to say it.Pei Tingsong also crouched down and touched his hair gently.\u201cI love you, Mama.\u201cYou still have me.\u201dHe finally said it out loud, while sobbing like a child.\u201cIn the future\u2026you can wait for me to come home, okay?\u201dAs Pei Tingsong watched all this, he experienced and understood what it meant when people said that the love for the person also\u00a0extended\u00a0to everything related to him. He didn\u2019t understand maternal love, nor did he understand paternal love; he had read many literary works praising this feeling, and had learned about the natural dependence human beings would form for their mother in the process of human growth. However, up until now, these were only recorded words and subjects for him to consider.But after witnessing his most beloved Fang Juexia trying his best to protect his family\u2014He felt it deeper than any words.After the meeting that lasted all night long, everyone started to move. This was a tough battle to fight; the stain left on him from his father was real, and the fact that he was also an addict was something that netizens would easily get most disgusted by. It was very easy for the narrative online to diverge from their plans, so everyone had to be 110% energetic when executing it.Fang Juexia even brought out the steel rod that he had specially preserved before as part of the evidence.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Cheng Qiang was a little worried, \u201cIs this not enough evidence to show that his father had abandoned his wife and child?\u201dThis was also what Fang Juexia was most worried about.But what he didn\u2019t expect was to receive a certain email from his mother at 5:30 that morning.[Juexia, Mama thought about it a lot, and understands the seriousness of this matter. It\u2019s true that Mama has been deceiving herself all these years, but you will always be the person Mama loves best and the child I want to protect no matter what. These are the medical records from when Mama went to the hospital to be treated after getting beaten, all the procedural forms and certificates I\u2019ve filled out over the years when filing missing persons reports, the accounts I sorted out after he took everything away, and the injury photos taken at that time, including yours and mine. Originally, I wanted to wait for him to wake up and then would let him have a look at these, but now I\u2019m afraid that day won\u2019t come.I don\u2019t need you to be too strong. Mama just wants to wait for you to come home safely and happily.]Fang Juexia sat in front of the laptop and one by one, opened the attachments sent by his mother. The memories these past bits and pieces encapsulated bubbled up in an instant, and he felt as if his entire being was in a state of dissociation. His body was in pain, but his soul was still analyzing these memories rationally.He even pointed to a bloody wound in one of the photos and described it to Pei Tingsong, \u201cLook at this. I remember I was only as tall as the table at the time, and I had hid in the corner. After he left, I pulled Mama up and wanted to take her to see a doctor.\u201d His profile didn\u2019t have a very pained expression, he was just staring blankly at the screen. \u201cShe covered her head with clothes, I led her, and we spent the night in the emergency room.\u201cThe nurses and aunties in the emergency room started to recognize me later on.\u201d Fang Juexia turned his face to look at Pei Tingsong and even laughed. \u201cShe said I was really handsome, the most beautiful boy she had ever seen.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t look anymore.\u201d Pei Tingsong closed the screen and said, \u201cLet them go handle this.\u201dFang Juexia nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, I already can peacefully remember all this now.\u201dHe was far stronger than Pei Tingsong had imagined.The PR team made the decision to not purposely suppress this news. In order to resolve these matters thoroughly, they didn\u2019t delete the initial post that revealed the news, but they also didn\u2019t let it develop. In the later stages of the initial post, they arranged for people to come out and point out that the mention of \u201cAIDS\u201d was strange. With one person saying it was suspicious, everyone started thinking that, suspecting that it was an action taken by anti-fans, so the direction of the thread began to tilt, and the focus of the debate went from guessing the disease to whether someone was maliciously slandering Fang Juexia.At the same time, they arranged for a lot of accounts to publish some very poor and inconsistent smear-posts, then spread them online, with some of them even saying that Fang Juexia was terminally ill. Simultaneously, they bribed a few big verified accounts to leak the news ahead of time.[@Are you gossiping: Guaranteed, top class F\u2019s father has an extremely bad criminal record, and it should have already been dug up. When that happens, someone will definitely end up blackmailing him using this matter, so you guys just wait to eat the melons.][@Melon field manufacturing machine: There are some rumors that a high face value, top-class idol\u2019s father abandoned his wife and son. Now that his son is popular, he has come back and is extorting him by demanding sky-high alimony. It\u2019s another real dog blood drama in the world.]These melons were quickly transported to other places, and there were rumors flying all over the place, especially amongst the many people in the fan circles; they all knew at least a little something about it.Although it wasn\u2019t that different from the facts, the PR team deliberately blurred the truth about the drug addiction, in order to make Fang Juexia\u2019s self disclosure more impactful. On the other hand, they still hadn\u2019t discovered the dark hand manipulating this matter from behind yet. The unwritten rules of turmoil within the circle made it clear that one should not shove the other companies directly on the table, but first impressions were also very important, and therefore, Fang Juexia\u2019s image as a victim had to first appear in public view.So, they put the father who caused this whole issue on the opposite side.Fang Juexia struggled with this issue. If he was the only one who would be affected, maybe he would give up on using this PR strategy. But he wasn\u2019t just Fang Juexia, he was also Kaleido\u2019s Fang Juexia. Behind him were five bandmates who were sharing his hardships.He had too much to shoulder.The team quickly arranged drafts that were to be published on the major official accounts and the marketing Weibos, all to ensure that they would be the ones with the subsequent initiative, and thereby control public opinion. Every draft was completed by a dedicated copywriter, while Fang Juexia\u2019s clarification post was solely written by himself, and the team only helped in polishing and modifying it.By the time the post was finalized, it was already 11:00 A.M. Fang Juexia, who had not slept all night, sat at his desk and copied out the clarification post onto a piece of paper by hand, then took a good photo of it and posted it to Weibo.[@Kaleido Fang Juexia: shared pictures][I\u2019m very sorry to take up a little bit of everyone\u2019s time. Here, I have a few things to confess to all of you.First of all, my father is a drug addict, and has been one for many years. When I was a child, my father\u2019s future was ruined, and his temperament changed greatly. At first, he drank too much and often beat and cursed my mother and me. Later, he became addicted to drugs and changed completely. We suffered from domestic violence and his drug abuse for five years. On the eve of my 13th birthday, he took away the small amount of savings that we had to live on, along with all valuable things from our house, and left us.Ten years later, not too long ago, he reappeared, followed me with a steel rod, and attempted to kidnap me. Fearing that he would do more harm to me and my family, we admitted him into a rehab center. His appearance was surprising, and it really frightened me. The drugs had already corroded his humanity away, and the encounter completely drained me. Not long ago, our company received a blackmail notice: if we didn\u2019t agree to their terms, they would expose the fact that my biological father is actually a drug addict. But I thought, that was the truth anyway, and I don\u2019t have to bother other people to speak for me, I\u2019ll do it myself. He is him, and I am me. I appreciate that he has given me life, but ever since I came home ten years ago and saw that our house was nearly empty, there has been no father-son relationship between us.Moreover, I would like to make public the so-called \u201cunmentionable disease\u201d circulating online. I have congenital night blindness, with low dark vision, and the possibility of it being cured is very low. My childhood dream was to be a dancer, but night blindness made me lose this possibility forever. The psychological trauma left by this incident made me passively conceal it, and since the stages for singers and idol groups contained both darkness and light, it gave me a sliver of hope. It was just that a person who has a great chance of becoming blind onstage is not qualified to make a debut in any entertainment company. So, I hid the fact of my night blindness, and used endless practice to try to ensure that no mistakes occur.About the online rumors concerning other diseases, including the long-term \u201chidden rules\u201d rumors, my company and I will take the corresponding legal measures to protect our reputation. It\u2019s my disease, I don\u2019t deny it. It\u2019s the same as the birthmark on my face, it has been a part of me since I was born. But with regards to labels that don\u2019t belong to me, please do not stick them on me. Otherwise, I will take these labels and send them back to you with legal summons.]This handwritten letter didn\u2019t contain any great emotional exaggeration, the tone was neither humble nor overbearing, and the handwriting was very strong. However, all the people who read all of it, whether they were fans who sincerely supported him or passers-by who were indifferent to him, were all shocked.Who would have thought that today\u2019s most popular male artist had been born into such a biological family. What was more unexpected was that he himself would stand up and make it all public.In addition to the handwritten letter in the first picture, the pictures following it were those of all the relevant evidence. The second picture was an old picture of Fang Juexia, when he was still a little child. The corner of his eye had his birthmark, and the corner of his mouth was bleeding. The photos were objective and indifferent, showing all the dangers that a child belonging to a failed biological family would encounter, such as bloody toes, bruises on his arms and back, and the traces of stitches left on his mother\u2019s head. Fang Juexia published all the certificates his mother had given him online, including the medical records from the doctor.As long as it didn\u2019t hurt the people beside him, Fang Juexia was willing to have everyone gather around and stare at him.He was willing to use his own wounds to meet everyone\u2019s desire to pry.Drug abuse, domestic violence, kidnapping, extortion, top class popularity\u2026. These words, which were full of sharp contradictions, caught everyone\u2019s attention in a very short time. #Fang Juexia\u2019s handwritten letter# also exploded directly on the Hot Search list, attracting the attention of the entire Internet, sparking large discussions.[@Black sugar pearl milk tea: Shit\u2026 Stalking, kidnapping, domestic violence, are these things a fucking biological father would do?!][@90\u2019s steamwave: I didn\u2019t expect it to be this powerful when I clicked open the Hot Search topic\u2026.So FJX\u2019s father is addicted to drugs, is a domestic abuser, abandons his wife and son, and now he comes back to blackmail his now successful son?! Why doesn\u2019t he go die\u00a0ah?! I\u2019m so angry with this kind of scum father that I\u2019m about to faint from across the screen!][@brokenheart: I didn\u2019t expect it to be like this when I saw astar\u2019s childhood photo on the Hot Search list. He\u2019s so small and thin, I feel so sad when seeing his wounds\u2026.][@Garbage transfer station replying to @brokenheart: Who knows if this picture is real, maybe they just found a \u201clittle actor\u201d, drew some red on him to imitate the birthmark, and then added some special makeup to create the wound. What does this even count as? He could be trying to whitewash himself. His own father takes drugs, how could the son still be a good person?][@I\u2019m going to k*ll you, you pig replying to Garbage transfer station:\u00a0Your\u00a0name is Garbage transfer station. What kind of good garbage can you be?][@What time are you sleeping today replying to @Garbage transfer station: You\u2019re going too far. One look and you can tell that this is FJX when he was small, how could there be a child who looks so much like him? It\u2019s not a big problem to lack empathy for other people\u2019s sufferings, but if you have to spit and maliciously slander when you see a tragic experience, then you really are heartless.][@The first sweetheart in the galaxy: Reading the part with \u201cNot long ago, our company received a blackmail notice\u2026\u201d My hair really stood on end at that part. So some people who knew about this pain tried to use it to threaten a popular star. They\u2019re all completely without conscience\u00a0ba][@Beautiful baby Fine Jeweled Xerophyte: I\u2019m so sad, everyone might not know, Fang Juexia never uses Weibo, but he made a post on his birthday a while ago. And, at the same time, he also forwarded a post about it being global anti-drug day. At that time, we didn\u2019t know why. Now seeing all this\u2026. I really can\u2019t imagine how he grew up. It\u2019s so hard.][@Domino never gives up: God, night blindness. Then during the many stage performances before, Gege pretty much couldn\u2019t see anything, but he actually made no mistakes. How long did Gege have to practice to achieve this level\u00a0ah? No wonder his hearing was so sensitive whenever he got on any blindfolded segment of a show, he was already used to it. God, thinking about it now, there are a lot of little details that match up. Juexia had it too hard.][@Keep kind: Before it was HZY revealing himself to be an orphan, now it\u2019s FJX. K is really one of the most pitiful boy-bands in history. Is this circle really so rotten that they have to blow up their own privacy to prove their innocence?]Visit lightnovelreader.com for extra chapters.[@I\u2019m going to read four books this month: I didn\u2019t like FJX very much before, feeling that his personality was a little too quiet and not likeable. Now I feel very sorry. After seeing all this, I know how this kind of family leaves a great impact on its children. My father would lose his temper and beat others when he is drunk. Ah well, I may not hate him, but I hate myself who is similar to him.][@playplayplayy: That last sentence was very tough. He didn\u2019t say anything about a legal notice, but directly pulled out a legal summons. With this, I also believe him. At least he\u2019s taking the gloves off and starting to use real legal weapons. ][@Egg fried rice goes along with Yakult: The fan circle is pretty speechless about him hiding his night blindness, and then he also didn\u2019t tell his company about his father\u2019s drug addiction\u00a0ba. It\u2019s also irresponsible of him to conceal so much explosive news to make a debut nonetheless.][@XUZNWDH2 replying to @Egg fried rice goes along with Yakult: Although you know all the exceptions, you can\u2019t just blindly use them. What, if a father is a drug addict, his son can\u2019t be a normal person? What kind of unspeakable disease is night blindness? After entering the company, would it harm everyone? Gonna say something unpleasant, since he knew that he had night blindness and he still had to get onstage, even if he fell down, fell off the stage, or died from a fall, all this would only harm the person himself. And\u00a0you\u00a0are too naive, this kind of public company couldn\u2019t not know about these things. As you know, he was born to be an idol and born belonging onstage, while you, with your arguing for the sake of arguing, were born to belong in a parking lot.]While the debate continued, Star Chart\u2019s official Weibo also announced that it would take measures to protect its artists, and that it had already sued several Weibo accounts who had spread such rumors. With the relevant legal documents posted, their tough attitude was already reflected.All fans forwarded it, supporting the company in protecting its artists. Some online articles arranged by the PR team were also published one after another. The first one was an article written from an anti-fan\u2019s point of view, which diverted attention to a contradictory issue in this mess\u2014 whether children should expose their fathers for their own sake. In the article, they tried their best to promote filial piety and paternity, beautified the \u201cdomestic violence\u201d behavior, and ignored the drug abuse. Mentioning all these matters in this way was simply stepping on a mine that existed, that of \u201cpeople\u2019s will\u201d on Weibo, and soon, it attracted many forwards from netizens, with almost all of them cursing it out. In the end, angry netizens even deleted this long Weibo article.The appearance of this article dragged netizens who didn\u2019t originally support Fang Juexia into the discussion, all because they disliked drug abuse, domestic abuse, and extreme patriarchy even more than Fang Juexia.Later, the PR team continued to publish other articles through multiple big verified online accounts or on the public official account. Most of them took a more rational view in analyzing this event, publishing articles on biological families, referring to a popularized science account about the consequences of drug abuse, and digging up old information from the entertainment circle, by splicing together Fang Juexia\u2019s past performances in variety shows and his performances on the dark stage. It was like a behind-the-scenes video, and it was full of stuff the audience loved to watch most.By evening, public opinion was also at its hottest, the netizens had already broken down the very shocking big contradiction into many small contradictions, dispersing into striking the hearts of different groups. Although everyone knew it was Fang Juexia\u2019s melon, no matter from what angle, he was the real victim here. So there would be different people who sympathized with him from different angles.At ten o\u2019clock in the evening, Pei Tingsong posted on Weibo, but changed his old style of temper tantrums and only uttered one line.[@Kaleido Pei Tingsong: There is no so-called domestic violence, only intentional injury. Crime is crime.]This Weibo post was quickly posted on the Hot Search list, and was forwarded and supported by many netizens. Soon after, the several other members of Kaleido also forwarded Pei Tingsong and Fang Juexia\u2019s posts.[@Give me some small dried fish: The best thing about K is that every time a member is in trouble, the rest of them will voice support like bros. It\u2019s not embroidering flowers on brocade, it\u2019s sending charcoal in a blizzard. I hope Juexia Gege can get through this.]The appearance of his bandmates\u2019 support also divided the center of public opinion. In addition to them, there were also some other stars, such as Zhai Ying, who Fang Juexia had supported before, their senior brothers, their friends who had cooperated with them, and even their Star Chart colleagues who didn\u2019t really have that close a relationship with them now also supporting Fang Juexia.Whether it was out of sincerity or enthusiasm, everyone stood up against domestic violence and drug abuse. This all reflected public opinion, and it also made things develop in a better direction.Such supportive comments also began to boom in this scuffle of public opinion, and many opponents and anti-fans also entered the fray. They attributed his almost-debut experience in Astar to the \u2018hidden rules\u2019 rumors, and distorted facts by saying that the reason he left Astar was because he had been kicked out, because Astar knew his family situation and the big boss had abandoned him.The PR team wrestled with the hidden rules theory. In order to solve this rumor more thoroughly, they found Fang Juexia and hoped that he could tell what had happened in Astar at that time. Fang Juexia hesitated again and again and finally gave a reply clarifying that the hidden rules situation was just a rumor, and that there was no need to replay the whole thing.Up to now, he still didn\u2019t want to publicize Liang Ruo\u2019s past of being drugged and raped, and then having the entire situation buried, just in order to dissociate himself from this rumor. Even if he didn\u2019t name names, it would be easy for everyone to pick it out.It was too easy to destroy a person.The PR team had no other way but to suppress such untrue statements as far as possible, but it was tough to use legal measures; the entire process took too long, and the damage to the stars would have already been done. However, if Fang Juexia was unwilling to talk about it, they couldn\u2019t force him to, and at least on the matter of his biological father being addicted to drugs, they had controlled the public opinion to absolutely gain the upper hand.The person in the center of the whirlpool, Fang Juexia, didn\u2019t really care about the development of public opinion, and also couldn\u2019t really sleep. He still worked according to the previous schedule in the daytime, and when night came, Pei Tingsong took him to his small workshop. On the lazyboy sofa, Pei Tingsong held him for two hours so that he would sleep.When he woke up, Pei Tingsong\u2019s cellphone rang. Jiang Miao and the rest had come over with some food. The entire group would have to shoot an ad for a TV station later, so Fang Juexia also got up. They found an empty dance studio and all of them sat down on the floor to eat, just like what they did before their debut.Fang Juexia\u2019s whole person looked a little haggard, and he had sunken eyes. His eyelids were thin to the point they were nearly transparent, and they showed his blue blood vessels. The bags beneath his eyes also looked dark, filled with red blood vessels.Ling Yi took a bowl of porridge, stirred it with a spoon, and handed it to him. \u201cJuexia, you eat some more. This shrimp porridge is very delicious, there\u2019s lots of shrimp in it.\u201dFang Juexia said \u2018thank you\u2019 in a soft voice and took a bite. \u201cEn, it\u2019s delicious.\u201dHis bandmates didn\u2019t utter any words showing their deep concern, and they tacitly chose to stick to their usual mode of getting along with each other. Fang Juexia was very grateful to them; what he was most afraid of was sudden and overwhelming concern.\u201cThank you.\u201d He put the porridge down and looked at everyone. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry I kept it from you guys for so long.\u201dLu Yuan put down his chopsticks and spoke straightforwardly, \u201cWhat sorry, are we bros or not?\u201d\u201cJuexia, you remember on your birthday, everyone said that we hoped that you would rely on us more in the future.\u201d He Ziyan looked at him. \u201cYou should remember these words. These aren\u2019t some polite words of just \u2018I\u2019ll support you\u2019, we would only say these words because we\u2019ve known for a long time that you\u2019ve had a lot on your shoulders.\u201dJiang Miao, who was sitting beside him, gave him a shrimp dumpling. \u201cYes\u00a0ah, you forgot, last time you even told me that we are family.\u201d\u201cReally! Did Juexia really say that?\u201d Ling Yi put down his bowl and immediately hugged him. \u201cJuexia, I really super-like you, the kind where I think of you as my own biological Gege. We\u2019re family, right?\u201d Ling Yi babbled away, and even started crying at his own words.Fang Juexia even had to wipe his tears away at this. \u201cWe are, don\u2019t cry\u00a0ah.\u201dLing Yi sniffed hard. \u201cEn!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re sniffling so much, I can\u2019t even eat my noodles,\u201d Pei Tingsong complained.\u201cJuexia, you look at him!\u201dJiang Miao brushed Fang Juexia\u2019s bangs and murmured, \u201cYour hair is long again, you\u2019ll have to get it fixed by the stylist in a bit\u00a0ba.\u201dFang Juexia held his chopsticks tightly, his knuckles turning white.He once thought that he was full of misfortune, with every step of his heading towards the tragic end that was failure, so he tried his best to live properly. Even in the dark, he still wanted to live \u201ccorrectly\u201d.For a long time, he thought that he would always be alone trapped in the darkness.But that was his biggest mistake.Everything in the world had to maintain a relative balance: love and hate, beauty and ugliness, success and failure, misfortune and luck. He really did have a tragic life; he had had to tear at his old wounds with his own hands, and every step of his was bloody. But he had gotten an even more precious treasure in return.Looking up, Fang Juexia looked at his playful bandmates, and a smile appeared on his face.They were the great fortune of his life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The PR team that Pei Tingsong had invited followed up at all times to make sure no new problems cropped up unexpectedly.Unexpectedly, the number of endorsements Fang Juexia had now grown uncountable. Many anti-fans organized groups to go and make trouble on the brands\u2019 official Weibos, demanding that they replace such a \u201ctainted artist\u201d. However, this behavior also caused many online passers-by to be disappointed with them. In the eyes of the public, the stain that Fang Juexia\u2019s father bore was one that couldn\u2019t be grafted onto him; this had also been the root of his many-years-long miserable life. Although he had many anti-fans, it was impossible for them to number more than the supportive passers-by or his already colossal number of fans.The scene that the anti-fans were looking forward to watching never happened.On the second day after the letter was published, Fang Juexia went along with his business as before, behaving like someone who didn\u2019t have anything going on. He shot an advertisement based on a previous agreement. Although the brand had told him that he could postpone the shoot, he knew that the preparation of an advertisement shoot required the team to start preparing for more than a whole day beforehand, and he would not drag others down like this.Everyone on set was quite professional, showing no real difference from a regular day. Xiao Wen followed Fang Juexia the entire time. Fang Juexia was also as usual, gentle and silent, but dedicated enough as well.The makeup artist doing his makeup specifically consoled him, \u201cToday\u2019s shoot was quite smooth.\u201dFang Juexia showed a smile. \u201cYes\u00a0ah, it went smoother than I thought it would.\u201d\u201cWhat about your other members, are they all working today?\u201dFang Juexia nodded. \u201cEn, there\u2019s also one at school.\u201d\u201cThen, when you get back, rest up early\u00a0oh.\u201d\u201cOkay, I will.\u201dIt was only when Fang Juexia came out of the building where the shoot was taking place that he discovered the large number of journalists that had gathered outside the door as their cameras flashed frantically.\u201cFang Juexia, troubling you to spare us a few words?\u201d\u201cDid you not know about your father\u2019s drug addiction this entire time? Have you ever seen him take drugs with your own eyes?!\u201d\u201cRecently, Astar\u2019s stock has fallen sharply, and it\u2019s said that there have been some shifts in their upper-level management. All of these goings-on, Fang Juexia, do you know about it? Are you not a pawn that has been pushed out to block this big melon?\u201d\u201cSome people have questioned that you have fabricated the night blindness you wrote about in your letter. What do you think about that?\u201d\u201cFang Juexia, have you seen the AIDS rumor online? Can you explain a bit as to why there is such a rumor floating around?\u201dFang Juexia, wearing a mask and glasses, was almost completely surrounded by bodyguards. He managed to squeeze out of the horde of locust-like journalists to finally reach the van parked outside.The moment the door closed, Fang Juexia finally let out a breath.Various hands and lenses were stuck to the windows, looking just like a monster\u2019s tentacles, and they were so close that they couldn\u2019t be thrown off no matter how they tried.Xiao Wen, who was sitting in the front passenger\u2019s seat, turned around and handed him a bottle of water. \u201cJuexia, going back to the company or to the dormitory?\u201dFang Juexia took the bottle of water, but didn\u2019t drink it. \u201cThey\u2019re both fine.\u201dHis cellphone vibrated, and he opened it up to see a message from Zhai Ying.[Zhai Ying: Juexia, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll be worried, so I\u2019m reporting it to you first. Your trainee videos were published online by me, and my brother-in-law transferred\u00a0 them over to me on my request.]Trainee videos?Filled with doubt, Fang Juexia opened up Weibo. Cheng Qiang\u2019s call came at the same time, and he picked it up.\u201cHello, Juexia? What\u2019s with that monthly Astar review video?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m still watching it.\u201d Fang Juexia opened Weibo, and there was an entry of #Fang Juexia trainee video# on the Hot Search list. He clicked on it and took a look; many influencer accounts had posted the video, with the title of [Fang Juexia trainee monthly review video, super strong ability!]\u201cIt seems like it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s something Zhai Ying did.\u201d Fang Juexia replied to Cheng Qiang, \u201cI don\u2019t know what exactly though.\u201d\u201cZhai Ying?\u201d After a pause, Cheng Qiang suddenly realized, \u201cShe\u2019s helping you.\u201dIt really was a collection of videos from his trainee period. Astar used to conduct a group assessment of the trainees once a month, and they would grade them. Trainees who got a lower grade three times in a row may need to leave the company.And Fang Juexia was the only trainee who maintained an A grade for two consecutive years, while his overall ranking had always been first place.Although he was only a teenager in the videos, still being a green youth, his singing and dancing skills had already surpassed those of too many active idols and singers. It wasn\u2019t too much to call him the \u201cceiling.\u201dThis video was the proof of why Fang Juexia had been called Astar\u2019s trump card back then.Due to the recent public discussion, there were many comments on the video.[@Tottering meteor: WTF, the high note at the very beginning shocked me\u2026.he actually didn\u2019t make his debut at Astar??][@Just 998 just\u00a0998: I finally understand why they say that Fang Juexia is the ceiling for idols. His looks and ability as a trainee were indisputable\u00a0ah, the standard pitiful beauty script.][@Today I\u2019m also going to go\u00a0dundundun: Holy crap, that last scene was amazing, the only person in the company to get an A for two years in a row\u00a0ah, that\u2019s a real trump card. How could he have become an abandoned card?][@I, 3, am still a widowed king today replying to @Today I\u2019m also going to go\u00a0dundundun: Who knows, anyway, with this extent, if there was really a big boss behind him, he would have been popular to the point of overturning the skies, why would he have been obscure since his debut?][@Time is running out: Holy shit, I also want to chase FJX, I already look up to strength.]\u201cThe release of this video has suppressed a lot of the public talk about the hidden rules rumor. Now, a lot of people online are cursing Astar for their lack of vision, which is also interesting,\u201d said Cheng Qiang from the other end, \u201cAstar is in a mess now\u00a0ba. They say a\u00a0storm\u00a0is brewing over there.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Fang Juexia could probably guess what was happening.The direction of public opinion was always changing, faster than the time it took to flip pages of a book. Fang Juexia already didn\u2019t have much interest in these matters, but he was sincerely thankful to Zhai Ying for doing this to help him at this time, so he replied very seriously to her on WeChat, thanking her for coming forward.After driving for a long time, the road was a bit jammed. Fang Juexia hadn\u2019t slept in too long, but he didn\u2019t feel sleepy. His eyes just felt a bit sore, so he closed his eyes and leaned his head against the window. In a trance, he heard Xiao Wen answer the phone and say something, but he already didn\u2019t have any attention to spare for that.When he closed his eyes, Fang Juexia thought of Pei Tingsong and the feeling of lying on the bed with their heads against each other, as he listened to him talk or tell stories that he had never heard before. Pei Tingsong had never said a single comforting sentence, but each of his sentences had nonetheless comforted him.Every moment he spent with Pei Tingsong was well stored in a hidden niche by Fang Juexia. He was like a child who secretly collected beautiful candy wrappers. Every time he got one, he would lay it flat and put it in a place only he knew about.Then, whenever he was sad, he could take it out for a look, and he could even smell a bit of that sweet scent. This would then make him happy, it was just as easy as that.He didn\u2019t even need the person who gave him the candy to be around him all the time.\u201cWe\u2019re here, Juexia.\u201dXiao Wen\u2019s voice was very light, probably because he thought that Fang Juexia had fallen asleep. Fang Juexia opened his eyes, but the moment he opened the door, he realized that they weren\u2019t at the company, nor was it the residential area where the dormitory was located.It was the parking lot of the condominium that Pei Tingsong had lived in before.Fang Juexia turned and asked Xiao Wen. \u201cHow did we come here?\u201d\u201cJust now, Xiao Pei called me and said he had something he wanted to find you for. Perfectly, since your work was done, we drove directly over.\u201dSomething to find him for?Fang Juexia was a little confused and said that he would go up with Xiao Wen, but he didn\u2019t expect Xiao Wen to get back into the car. \u201cJuexia, they just announced that there\u2019s a meeting, so I have to go back. If I\u2019m late, Qiang Ge will scold me. I\u2019ll have the chauffeur come back to pick you up later.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Fang Juexia shook his head. \u201cI can take a taxi back.\u201dAfter Xiao Wen left, Fang Juexia headed upstairs while dialing Pei Tingsong. The first time, he got a busy signal, and the call only connected when he called again for the second time. However, just as the call connected, Pei Tingsong was already opening the door.\u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201d Pei Tingsong, with a smile on his face, stretched out his hand and pulled Fang Juexia in. He turned around and busily went to the shoe cabinet to get slippers. As soon as he bent down, Fang Juexia saw the admission ticket for an exam stuck in his pants pocket.\u201cYou\u2019re done with your test?\u201d Fang Juexia asked.\u201cEn, the questions were simple, I came out half an hour early.\u201d Pei Tingsong put his slippers in front of him and was about to crouch down to untie his shoelaces for him. Suddenly, as if he had remembered something, he stood up and whispered to him, \u201cYou should change them yourself first\u00a0ah.\u201dFang Juexia felt that this was strange, but he couldn\u2019t exactly pinpoint what was strange. He just felt that Pei Tingsong was flustered and travel-worn. He changed his shoes and followed him from the front porch to the living room, where he smelled some soup being stewed.\u201cAuntie, Juexia Ge is back.\u201dAuntie??Fang Juexia didn\u2019t react immediately, but unexpectedly, in the next second, his mother appeared in front of him. She didn\u2019t even take off the apron she had on, directly rushing up and hugging him.\u201cJuexia, you\u2019re back.\u201dFang Juexia, who was being hugged by his mama, opened his eyes wide. This was like a dream. He looked blankly at Pei Tingsong who was standing beside him, smiling at him, and then even pulling on his arms to get him to hug Mama Fang back.\u201cMom\u2026\u201d Feeling his mother\u2019s shoulders shaking, Fang Juexia hugged her tightly and patted her on the back. \u201cHow did you suddenly come here? I didn\u2019t even know about it.\u201dMama Fang let go, raised her head, wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes, and said with a smile to her son, \u201cIt was Xiao Pei who specially invited me to Beijing. He said a lot of things.\u201d Mama Fang also looked at Pei Tingsong and said, \u201cMama also missed you very much. I didn\u2019t want to wait for you at home like before, I wanted to come see you.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s nose stung.Every single day since the letter was published, he hadn\u2019t been able to sleep, not because he was afraid of the public opinion attacks online, nor because he was worried about his uncertain future, but because he was afraid of his mother being all alone in Guangzhou. Just thinking of her sitting at home, witnessing her wait over these more than ten years turn into ash with her own eyes, and then having to watch the overwhelming news about him, with every line filled with exaggeration and unfounded slander, what would she think, and how sad would she be?Would she not be able to eat or be able to sleep?But Fang Juexia was always timid when facing his mother. He didn\u2019t know the best way to take care of this and clean up their family, which had already been broken up like this.But, Pei Tingsong had gone ahead and done it for him.He always knew what Fang Juexia dreaded the most and what he needed the most.\u201cMama has stewed some chicken and\u00a0fish maw soup\u00a0for you, and I added safflower, scallops, and sea cucumber. It\u2019s very nourishing.\u201d At this point, Mama Fang frantically went to go watch the stove again. \u201cHey, wait a minute, let me check the stove. Take a seat first. Xiao Pei also just picked me up from the airport, both of you take a rest\u00a0ah.\u201dFang Juexia watched as his mother plunged back into the kitchen, even throwing him to Pei Tingsong. He felt helpless, but also wanted to laugh. Pei Tingsong turned his head and took a peek. When he was sure that Mama Fang was no longer there, he quickly kissed the corner of Fang Juexia\u2019s eye.Witnessing this bold move, Fang Juexia\u2019s heart was about to leap out of his chest. He twisted Pei Tingsong\u2019s arm and went to the sofa by himself to sit down. Pei Tingsong also sat down next to him, laughed at him and did not speak.\u201cHow come you didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d Fang Juexia turned his face and questioned him.Pei Tingsong clicked his tongue. \u201cNo, who, when preparing a surprise, would inform you in advance\u00a0ah? Do you think this is\u00a011/11, where before the event, the merchants all start crazily texting you\u2014 \u2018Everyone, quickly come in\u00a0ah, there\u2019s a surprise at the start itself.\u2019\u201dWhat kind of weird metaphor was this?\u201cHow did you find my mother? Do you have her contact information?\u201d\u201cNo\u00a0ah, I asked someone to find it for me,\u201d Pei Tingsong said in a matter of fact way.He was actually also a little afraid that Fang Juexia would blame him for overdoing things. After all, he had fought against everything by himself so far, seeming as if he never needed anybody\u2019s help. However, Pei Tingsong really felt very sad. He lay in bed every day, thinking of the phone call Fang Juexia had made standing at the corner of the stairs that day, thinking of how he had cried in his arms, when he was so afraid of making his mother sadPei Tingsong just felt that he had to do something. He couldn\u2019t bear for Fang Juexia to be sad, and he couldn\u2019t bear for him to worry, even suffering this way for one extra day was too much.So he made a quick decision to find Mama Fang\u2019s contact information and tell her that Fang Juexia actually really missed her and needed her company.Mama Fang was also having trouble sleeping and eating at home. She checked the online news every day, but she didn\u2019t dare to go find her son. Mother and son obviously had the same thoughts in their hearts, but neither one spoke first. As soon as she heard Pei Tingsong describe her son\u2019s situation, she took the flight he had arranged and flew to Beijing at the first possible moment.It was true that when it came to their lover, one would become hot-blooded, but Pei Tingsong found that he would actually also get worried, whether he had acted just for his own desires. After all, he was quick to make decisions, and doing whatever needed to be done was a part of his innate personality, but Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t that kind of person at all.Doubt at Fang Juexia\u2019s reaction surged up. Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t want to overthink it and immediately changed the topic, \u201cLet me tell you, today\u2019s essay topic\u00a0ah\u2026\u201dHalfway through his sentence, he noticed his hand on the sofa being covered by another pale hand. Fang Juexia drew closer, his eyes gentle, his tone soft, and he said in a quiet voice, \u201cThank you.\u201dPei Tingsong was stunned,all of his previous words cast out of his mind at this moment.\u201cThank you.\u201d It was Fang Juexia\u2019s habit to always repeat himself if what he was saying were important words. The warmth in the palm of his hand transferred over, and the smile on his face was the most real one Pei Tingsong had seen in many days. This was no longer a disguised \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d, but a real Fang Juexia smile.\u201cSeeing Mama here, I\u2019m so happy.\u201d Fang Juexia\u2019s fingers gently twined with Pei Tingsong\u2019s fingers, and his eyes had turned a little red.Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart immediately clenched. He held Fang Juexia\u2019s face in both hands and threatened him in a low voice, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to cry.\u201dFang Juexia\u2019s cheeks were squeezed out of shape by him, and he sniffled a bit. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you like watching me cry?\u201dJust during certain times\u2026 Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t say that out loud, and upon hearing Mama Fang come out, he immediately let go and stood up nervously.\u201cXiao Pei\u00a0ah, do you have any small stove type things here?\u201d\u201cStove?\u201d Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t know what she was talking about, and he searched around the apartment like a headless fly. Fang Juexia knew the state of his home better than he did. \u201cThere isn\u2019t one, Mom, don\u2019t prepare for a hotpot, let\u2019s just drink soup and eat the dishes\u00a0ba.\u201dPei Tingsong was surprised. \u201cHow did you know what your mom wanted to do? I didn\u2019t even understand.\u201d\u201cNonsense, I\u2019m her son\u00a0ah,\u201d Fang Juexia whispered.They helped Mama Fang serve the dishes and set out the bowls and chopsticks, after which they sat down and partook in the good meal that Fang Juexia\u2019s mama had made. After everything that had happened in the recent days, Fang Juexia could never eat much, but with his mama here, he ate more than usual and drank an extra bowl of soup.This was Pei Tingsong\u2019s second time having dinner and chatting with them, experiencing the ordinary daily life that every family had. But this time, Pei Tingsong had something else he was looking forward to. If one day, he confessed everything to this mother, would she accept him as tenderly and enthusiastically as she did now?Visit lightnovelreader[.]com for extra chapters.After dinner, Pei Tingsong helped Mama Fang put the bowls back in the kitchen. Standing at the table, Fang Juexia thought of something and took out his cellphone. \u201cMom, I still have to book you a hotel.\u201d\u201cNo need!\u201d Pei Tingsong shouted towards the outside, \u201cI\u2019ve arranged everything, it\u2019s next door.\u201d\u201cNext door?\u201d Fang Juexia went to the kitchen and saw two people, who looked more like mother and son, washing dishes side by side. \u201cHow can you make this apartment complex feel like a hotel every time?\u201d\u201cAh, that one, rented it.\u201d Pei Tingsong came up with a reason.\u201cXiao Pei was very attentive, he prepared everything for me early on.\u201d After washing the last bowl, Mama Fang turned to Juexia and said, \u201cHe said that living here will be convenient and also safe. There might be reporters at the hotel, Mama didn\u2019t even think of that at first. And here, you can also live with Mama.\u201dFang Juexia nodded. \u201cEn.\u201dAfter finishing washing the dishes, Pei Tingsong came out of the kitchen and was caught by Fang Juexia again. \u201cYou could rent it as soon as you wanted to? And it\u2019s even next door?\u201dPei Tingsong laughed guilty. \u201cYou are so smart.\u201dFang Juexia stared at him without moving, and without saying a word. Upon being watched like this, Pei Tingsong felt that he had no other way; he wanted to hug him, but he couldn\u2019t do so right now, so he could only draw closer and confess to him in a low voice, \u201cActually\u2026.This entire building is all mine.\u201dSure enough.Fang Juexia remembered that when he had first come here, Pei Tingsong had said that he was different from other rich young masters, that he was rich but only lived in two bedrooms.It was him being too naive.Coincidentally, all the other members had events to attend recently, so he would have been the only one living in the dorms anyway. Fang Juexia could now stay here with his mother for a few more days. While they were eating, Pei Tingsong had already arranged for someone to clean up the apartment next door. When he took his mother over, as soon as they walked into the living room, Fang Juexia saw a big bouquet of white eustoma on the coffee table.The corners of his mouth couldn\u2019t help rising up.Being surrounded by events and flashing lights, it had been a long time since Fang Juexia had lived such a life. He was now being taken care of by his mama, listening as she gossiped about her daily life at home and her neighbors, the students she couldn\u2019t teach no matter how much she tried, and the troublemakers in her class.Just listening to her made Fang Juexia feel very safe.He closed his eyes and felt himself lying under the full strength of the daylight.There was no darkness, just warmth everywhere.The outside world was stormy, and Fang Juexia, the one suffering at the center of the storm, in his mother\u2019s company, slept as the orange sunset at dusk escaped from the horizon.This time, dreams also let him be at peace, not disturbing him.The period of low tide was like the rainy season. When it came, it seemed to suffocate the whole population, leaving them completely breathless. His life these past few days had been filled with cold rain, and he was not able to breathe at all.But the sunny day that came after the rain was so beautiful, with the bright blue sky that shone after a disaster and the smell of grass filling the air.He had always liked the scenery d after it rained, and for that reason alone, he could endure the heavy rain.He slept until 12:30 in the night. For some reason, Fang Juexia suddenly woke up and felt thirsty. He got up from the bed and went to the room next door. Seeing his mother sleeping deeply, he quietly closed the door and went to the living room.He opened the refrigerator and took out a bottle of water, but before he could unscrew it, Fang Juexia stopped moving.His arm hung in mid-air for a few seconds, then lowered.Pei Tingsong was sitting in his study, reading some articles when he suddenly heard the doorbell ring, and after checking the time, found it very strange. It was only when he came to the door and saw the monitor screen that he realized Fang Juexia in his pajamas was outside.His mood ignited, becoming just like a\u00a0sky lantern\u00a0about to take off.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dFang Juexia stepped into his home. Although his tone was still as lukewarm as usual, he had a smile on his face. \u201cThirsty, want to drink some water.\u201dIt was like he was being flirty.Pei Tingsong shut the door as he stepped closer. He looked very refined with glasses, but when he raised his eyebrow, the air of a young master seemed to surround him. \u201cYou just want to drink some water?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Fang Juexia looked at him, his eyes absolutely sincere.\u201cOkay.\u201d Pei Tingsong turned around and left, and soon came back with a cup of sweet orange juice. It was Fang Juexia\u2019s favorite juice, and it was in the frosted blue mug Pei Tingsong always used.\u201cDrink it\u00a0ba.\u201d Pei Tingsong handed it to him.Fang Juexia lightly said \u2018thank you,\u2019 then he took it with both hands and gulped it down. Afterwards, he raised his head and asked solemnly, \u201cIs it because I just woke up? I feel like the juice tastes a little strange.\u201dPei Tingsong raised his eyebrows and didn\u2019t speak. He took hold of the mug to have a look. Fang Juexia had drunk all the juice in one gulp.He really was thirsty; it tasted funny but he still drank it all.\u201cWhat taste?\u201d Pei Tingsong, who was very curious, was about to go and pour himself another cup to try, to see if he bought the wrong brand. Unexpectedly, his hand was held at this moment. As soon as he turned his head, Fang Juexia held him by the shoulder and kissed him.The taste of orange juice entered with his soft tongue, just like moonlight breaking in at 12:30, tasting both sweet and cold, yet not icey, but still carrying an ice-cream-like thrill as it melted in his hot and humid mouth, brewing up a sweet heartbeat.This kiss was very short, but it was the first time Fang Juexia had taken the initiative.He retreated to a safe distance, looked at Pei Tingsong, and asked calmly, \u201cDid you taste it?\u201dPei Tingsong stood in a daze and nodded when he heard the question, still holding the same empty mug in his hand.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go back.\u201d Fang Juexia blinked. \u201cGood night.\u201dHe should have been an even more decisive thief.After his bad act of stealing his heart, he was seizing the next moments to slip away. If he stayed too long, there would be too many reluctant-to-part emotions that would arise, and his final result would be to get caught.Fang Juexia was bodily picked up by Pei Tingsong, and there was no place to run after that. He was thrown onto the bed and then pressed down under Pei Tingsong, while his heart beat like a real criminal\u2019s, as guilt and desire intertwined.\u201cYou\u2019re really getting stronger and stronger these days.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s dark pupils reflected his face.He knew to come find him as soon as he woke up, and he had even learned how to flirt.The corners of Fang Juexia\u2019s lips carried a smile, and he accepted Pei Tingsong\u2019s insincere praise. \u201cI was influenced through close association.\u201dMoonlight fell across the gap of the curtain, spying on the lovers who melted into each other, before finally falling on the glasses abandoned on the bedside table and casting a mottled light.Early morning was always the most vulnerable time for Fang Juexia. It was at this time that he needed a tight embrace, and he needed blazing love the most.Everything he needed, Pei Tingsong had.Fang Juexia was the coastline at night, being repeatedly soaked by the rising and ebbing tides.\u201cThank you.\u201d He hugged Pei Tingsong and repeated.This kind of thanks would seem a polite gesture to many people, like it was just etiquette, but Pei Tingsong understood what it truly was\u2014 love.Because he also felt like this, being grateful day after day, grateful for the fact that Fang Juexia had appeared in his life.Fearing that his mother would wake up too early, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t stay too long. He took a shower at 3 a.m., then came out and went into Pei Tingsong\u2019s closet to pull out some clothes to change into.Pei Tingsong sat beside the bed with a resentful face, and pulled at Fang Juexia\u2019s sleeve while complaining, \u201cLiving in my house, wearing my clothes, and sleeping with me, then running off after sleeping.\u201dFang Juexia held back a smile and didn\u2019t quibble with him, instead turning his head back to kiss his lips. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cSee you.\u201d Pei Tingsong finally pulled at his hand and kissed the back of it.Over the next two days, as long as he finished his work, Fang Juexia would go back to the apartment early to accompany his mama, making snacks and stewing soup with her. Pei Tingsong was afraid that she would be bored, so he took advantage of Fang Juexia\u2019s absences to take her sight-seeing at P University. Anyway, it was also a must-see tourist spot in Beijing.Public opinion online continued to ferment, but Fang Juexia, one of the main parties involved, was already no longer anxious about it. Even if he closed his eyes, he knew how those people would curse him out and talk nonsense about him. These were all known, so he was no longer afraid.On the day when the six of them were doing a magazine shoot together, Fang Juexia had just appeared in the studio when he heard a female photo assistant say something to the person standing next to her\u2014\u201cGod, is that true? There have been too many melons recently.\u201dFang Juexia just felt weary at heart upon hearing this, but unexpectedly, the next sentence made his heart come to a sudden stop.\u201cWhen I was just scrolling through, I thought I misread it at first. Liang Ruo is actually leaving Seven Luminaries!\u201d\u2014Juurensha : !!! The truth finally comes out??! And hahaha, flirty FJX is the best!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He couldn\u2019t understand Ling Ruo\u2019s motives for doing so at all.Guessing that Liang Ruo would have also made a Weibo post, Fang Juexia didn\u2019t overthink it and went directly to search for it. He didn\u2019t expect that the Hot Search list that he had occupied for the last so many days had already switched people. The first entry on the list was now #Liang Ruo leaves the group#.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Pei Tingsong, who was standing beside him, soon noticed that Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t looking quite right. \u201cWhat happened?\u201dFang Juexia clicked open the Hot Search entry, and sure enough, saw that Liang Ruo had published a new Weibo post very recently. It was a video, and there were already 50,000 comments under it.\u201cI don\u2019t know why\u2026\u201d He looked up at Pei Tingsong. \u201cLiang Ruo made a Weibo post announcing that he has left his group.\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s face also took on\u00a0 a completely shocked expression at this. \u201cWhat is he doing?\u201dWhile they were waiting for the stylists, they clicked on the video to watch it. Liang Ruo looked into the camera lens with a face devoid of makeup, wearing a simple white T-shirt as he sat with a table in front of him, and at the very beginning of the video, smiled and said hello.\u201cHello everyone, I\u2019m Liang Ruo. Today, I\u2019d like to talk about something that I haven\u2019t been able to talk about this entire time, which may have a certain impact on everyone. First of all, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dUpon seeing Liang Ruo\u2019s brilliant appearance as the leader of a top group, Fang Juexia was about to forget about the fact that he had no makeup on.The way he looked at the camera right now inexplicably reminded Fang Juexia of when he was a trainee.\u201cThe first thing is, I\u2019m leaving the Seven Luminaries group. Here, I\u2019d like to say sorry to my fans and bandmates. I can\u2019t move ahead with everyone any longer.\u201dHe stood up and made a deep bow. Then he looked up again. \u201cMaybe Astar will still bring a lawsuit against me, but it doesn\u2019t matter. I have already been considering this decision for a long time, and there are also reasons why I have to do it.\u201cDuring my trainee period, when I was 18 years old, I was drugged and raped by Jin Xiangcheng, a senior manager at Astar. Since then, I have never been able to get rid of the control this senior manager had on me. Of course, I also got a chance to make a debut, an opportunity that originally didn\u2019t belong to me. As we all know, the strongest trainee in Astar\u2019s reserves at that time was Fang Juexia. After he learned about this matter, he helped me by talking to the other high-level officials there, hoping to get some justice for me. But as you all know, what did we count as?\u201dThere was a bitter smile on his face. \u201cThat was when Jin Xiangcheng was at the peak of his power, and we couldn\u2019t do anything. Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t accept it, so he left Astar. While I, for various reasons, couldn\u2019t leave.\u201dLiang Ruo\u2019s face was very pale. \u201cHowever, if I had left back then, the end result would perhaps have been much worse. But, every single day after my debut was a painful ordeal for me. I have been taking depression medication for a long time, and I have attempted suicide twice. However, I was rescued both times, after which I continued to be abused and violated. At one time, I was very afraid of this matter being known and talked about, because I knew that many people would stigmatize me, so I didn\u2019t dare to stand up. But now, I\u2019ve thought it through.\u201dIn the video, Liang Ruo was seen adjusting his mood before he took out a laptop. \u201cI want to expose the true face of this entertainment giant. Many of the things that Jin Xiangcheng has done to me, I have preserved evidence of. Obviously, I\u2019m not the only victim.\u201dWith that, he clicked his mouse, and the laptop immediately amplified and played several other processed sounds, which were recordings of many other people, and included both boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 voices.\u201cThese are the trainees in the company who have been sexually harassed or abused by Jin Xiangcheng before. When I was collecting evidence, they came forward to provide me with recordings and other relevant evidence. The youngest one is only 15 years old,\u201d Liang Ruo paused. \u201cThanking them for their bravery. They are all braver than me.\u201cI will submit all the evidence to the police, and I believe that there will be results soon. This is far from Jin Xiangcheng\u2019s only criminal behavior; at present, all the other criminal evidence I have in my hands has also already been handed over to the police and the prosecutor\u2019s office. It was only after all this was done that I recorded this video.\u201dLiang Ruo continued to explain, \u201cIn order to avoid unreasonable speculation, let me first explain that the other members of Seven Luminaries did not suffer from any special experiences; each of them debuted on the merits of his own true ability. Apart from Jin Xiangcheng, Astar is still a very good and large entertainment company; it was just that this person\u00a0hoodwinked the public\u00a0and almost destroyed the entire Astar. Thanking the company for cultivating me, and for all their help. I hope everyone can continue to support Seven Luminaries and the other artists of the company. They are very good and hardworking people.\u201cI\u2019m not only quitting Seven Luminaries at this time, but am also quitting the entire entertainment industry.\u201d Liang Ruo easily showed a smile. \u201cFor the rest of my life, I want to live for myself and do what I want to do.\u201cFinally, I thank my friends for their protection in the past. I\u2019ve made you shoulder two years worth of curses because I was too timid.\u201dLiang Ruo lowered his head and said in a soft voice, \u201cSorry.\u201dThe video stopped abruptly.After watching this video, Fang Juexia\u2019s mood was difficult to describe. He knew that at the final part, Liang Ruo had been apologizing to him, but in fact, he didn\u2019t really need Liang Ruo\u2019s apology. No matter what Fang Juexia had encountered for the past two years, he had volunteered for it.Despite Pei Tingsong never having liked Liang Ruo, his first reaction after watching the video was worry. \u201cI am actually a little concerned about his personal safety right now.\u201dHowever, Fang Juexia shook his head. \u201cLiang Ruo is a smart person. If there was no possibility of a full-body retreat, he would not come out at this time.\u201dThis sentence reminded Pei Tingsong: Liang Ruo being able to collect so much evidence and record a video while he was still involved in the hidden rules situation, and then he had also, throughout the entire video, separated Jin Xiangcheng from Astar, and specially protected his bandmates who he didn\u2019t actually have a good relationship with.He wasn\u2019t just one person, but had fallen into another camp, thus becoming a platoon.\u201cLi Luo helped him.\u201dFang Juexia nodded. \u201cI guess so, otherwise, just the contract would become a difficult lawsuit, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to leave just because he wanted to.\u201dAs Liang Ruo himself had said, he wasn\u2019t some kind of good person, but he was by no means heinous. With Li Luo\u2019s desire to completely destroy Jin Xiangcheng, he successfully achieved his wish of leaving Seven Luminaries and Astar. Using one big backer to crush another, this was exactly something Liang Ruo would do.But he was still a little sad, especially looking at the evidence that so many trainees had been violated by Jin Xiangcheng.After the shoot finished, everyone around them was discussing Liang Ruo in the car. Compared with Fang Juexia\u2019s father\u2019s drug abuse and domestic violence, a popular member of a first-line boyband having suffered from sexual abuse from a company\u2019s top level management for a long time, then leaving the group and throwing out all this real evidence\u2014such a hot sex scandal was obviously more eye-catching. What\u2019s more, there were countless relationships between the central figures of these two events, which made it even more intriguing.Fang Juexia, who had been slandered for a long time with the hidden rules situation, turned out to be innocent. As a two-year ace-level trainee, he had left Astar because he couldn\u2019t stand the higher-ups getting away with sexual assault.It took two or three years to really piece together the entire story, and now it was finally being spread around with great relish by everyone online.The truth being brought to daylight, face-slapping and a counterattack\u2014this was the kind of story everyone loved to see.[@Blank page: Shit\u2026 this is actually a linked melon??? FJX is too miserable, a pitiful beauty, miserable twice over, forced to take the blame, Jin Xiangcheng should die\u00a0ba!

I\u2019m very worried about Liang Ruo\u2019s safety now. I hope he will be happy in the future][@Surreal camouflage replying to @Red bean niangao and meatball soup: At the start, it may really have been forced. Maybe later though, it became more about using his body as capital to advance\u00a0ba. Saying it clearly, what actually happened, everyone probably knew, but now that he dares to reveal his face and say all this, I\u2019m afraid that Jin Xiangcheng is going to collapse, and LR himself should have found a new backer\u00a0ba.][@Memeryl replying to @Surreal camouflage: It\u2019s not necessary to think so badly of everyone.

They\u2019re finally fighting out in the open]Opinions varied online.Facts were cut into many pieces, allowing everyone to selectively see them, and everyone also selectively believed what they wanted to believe. In the end, everything was rendered far from its original appearance.Even Fang Juexia, who was at the center of the incident, could only get a glimpse, let alone ordinary people far away from across a screen.He had long been ready to entangle with this hidden rules rumor for the rest of his life, because this was his own choice, and he had never complained to anyone about it. However, he hadn\u2019t expected that Liang Ruo would use such a method, where\u00a0good and bad were burned alike, just to return his innocence back to him.His bandmates, on the other hand, were happy. After finishing their work and returning to the dormitory, Ling Yi even planned to celebrate. \u201cIt\u2019s great, our Juexia has finally gotten rid of this rumor. Before, every time I saw it, I really would half-die from sheer anger.\u201dHe Ziyan also sighed. \u201cAll sufferings have their rewards\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cI really didn\u2019t expect that there would be so many victims.\u201d Jiang Miao shook his head. \u201cHe must be arrested\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll definitely be arrested, it\u2019s already become such an uproar, and it\u2019s that disgusting. Have you guys seen the Hot Search list online? It\u2019s pretty much full of people boiling over with discontent.\u201d Lu Yuan jumped on the sofa. \u201cAnd there are also other melons being implicated; they say that there is a big tiger behind the one surnamed Jin. That tiger fell from power not long ago, and now that they have evidence directly against the one surnamed Jin, even God can\u2019t save him.\u201d\u201cHoly crap, really?\u201d\u201cSo the other evidence Liang Ruo mentioned also includes that?\u201dEveryone was very heated over this topic, but Pei Tingsong didn\u2019t say much; he just looked at Fang Juexia silently. He knew him better than anyone else, and knew that at this time, Fang Juexia would never feel relieved because he had been let off. If so, he wouldn\u2019t have helped Liang Ruo hide what had happened from the start.He must be feeling burdened right now.\u201cI\u2019ll go and pour something to drink. Juexia, you come help me for a bit.\u201d Pei Tingsong pulled Fang Juexia over to the kitchen and opened the door to the refrigerator. As he took juice and beer out of the fridge, he said, \u201cYou give him a call\u00a0ba.\u201dFang Juexia, who had just taken two cans of beer from him, didn\u2019t expect him to say this. He looked up with great surprise. \u201cAh?\u201dPei Tingsong raised his elbow to close the refrigerator door, turned around, and his expression was slightly uncomfortable. \u201cAlthough, from the standpoint of a love rival, I\u2019m very reluctant to let you talk to Liang Ruo. I\u2019m very annoyed at the thought that he likes you and has liked you for so long.\u201dHe began to talk childishly again, but in the middle of his speech, his expression grew more restrained.Pei Tingsong looked at Fang Juexia, and with his eyes directing sincere encouragement towards him, continued in a low voice, \u201cBut you\u2019d still better go\u00a0ba. Otherwise, you\u2019ll feel uncomfortable inside. Rather than a love rival or whatever, I don\u2019t want you to carry any burdens towards him even more.\u201d\u2018Maybe that was also what Liang Ruo had planned,\u2019\u00a0Pei complained darkly in his heart.\u201cAnyway, he can\u2019t compare to me.\u201d Pei Tingsong took out a few cups with a smile. \u201cI still have this much confidence.\u201dFang Juexia laughed because of his frankness and even stuck a frozen beer can against the side of Pei Tingsong\u2019s neck. \u201cWhat are you thinking about every day\u00a0ah?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s freezing.\u201d Pei Tingsong\u2019s neck was frozen so much by him that he had to duck to the side before directly taking the beer can away from him. He said with a smile, \u201cWhat am I thinking? I\u2019m thinking about when my moon can be a bit fuller\u00a0ah.\u201dLu Yuan, who had walked over to get snacks, overheard them. \u201cWhat are you guys talking about? What is this about the moon being full or not, isn\u2019t it just the 15th today?\u201dPei Tingsong\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change and he continued with his words, \u201cWho knows? Hey, help me take some of these over, I can\u2019t grab any more.\u201dLooking at his back, Fang Juexia\u2019s heart lightened a lot.Visit lightnovelreader[.]com for extra chapters.Pei Tingsong was always like this, seeing straight through his tight nerves at a glance, and then enveloping him within the most straightforward and pure emotions to warm his rigid body. His tenderness was different from everyone else\u2019s; he didn\u2019t show it with a certain form or posture, but rather with a softness of consciousness, a complete understanding.Was he full yet?Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help but ask himself.He had to admit, Pei Tingsong had completely seen through him. In the past two years, he had always felt the reason that he could completely let go was because he could accept the state of the other party owing him, and it was only then that he could cut off all contact. However, if that was suddenly changed, he would not only feel that this wasn\u2019t fair, but would even have a burden on his shoulders.It was very strange, but that was just the kind of person he was.Looking at his noisy bandmates, Fang Juexia finally entered his room, went to his small balcony, lowered his head, and dialed Liang Ruo\u2019s number.This was the first time that Fang Juexia had actively sought him out on his own after he left Astar all those years ago.The call was picked up after only a few rings. Liang Ruo took the lead and called out his name from the other end of the call. The last tones of his voice carried a bit of surprise and doubt. \u201cJuexia.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Fang Juexia asked calmly, \u201cYou\u2019re really planning on leaving Seven Luminaries?\u201dLiang Ruo was silent for two seconds. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve decided on that long ago. Hey, do you think I came out at this time to block the limelight and refute the rumors for you? No\u00a0la, I recorded this video half a month ago, but it took a bit of time to submit the evidence and negotiate everything. I didn\u2019t expect something like this to happen to you at that time. \u201cThen he said to himself, \u201cAlthough, I really did feel bad when I saw you having problems over there. So, this video of mine was sent out directly, a little ahead of schedule.\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m flattering you now\u00a0ah?\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t. Thank you,\u201d Fang Juexia said lightly.On the other end of the phone, Liang Ruo restrained his joking tone a bit. \u201cIt\u2019s me who should be thanking you. For nearly three years, you\u2019ve been shielding me this entire time. Like a turtle hiding in its shell, I was afraid to do anything, and then I even went ahead and said I liked you, I\u2019m really tricky\u00a0ba.\u201dIn fact, he hoped to hear Fang Juexia say \u2018yes,\u2019 and he hoped to hear Fang Juexia complain about him a bit. If it was like that, then the distance between them would be reduced.But Fang Juexia had never shown any emotion in front of him, and this time was the same. \u201cI did it voluntarily.\u201dLiang Ruo had known it would be like this.How could Fang Juexia link his own motivation to his behavior?\u201cThis time, my actions were voluntary as well, Juexia.\u201d Liang Ruo maintained a smile in his voice. \u201cDo you know? I used to think naively that since you were willing to protect my reputation after you left Astar, you had to have some feelings for me\u00a0ne. Otherwise, how could you rather let others slander you rather than give me up?\u201dHe had really anaesthetized himself like this.\u201cBut later, I gradually understood that it wasn\u2019t because you were still friends with me; it was just because you are Fang Juexia, and you don\u2019t want to change yourself.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t know how to respond. He looked at the spider-plant on the balcony; the green leaves were curled up, and the tips had turned yellow.\u201cThank you for not changing.\u201d Liang Ruo continued, \u201cOtherwise, I would not have had the courage to stand up today. It took me nearly three years to learn a little from you back then.\u201dWhen they were trainees together, Liang Ruo had a poor foundation and didn\u2019t know anyone, but when he went to the practice room, Fang Juexia was always there. One day, he finally mustered his courage and asked Fang Juexia to teach him.Many times, no matter how patiently Fang Juexia taught him, he couldn\u2019t figure it out.Later on, he lost this only friend of his.Fang Juexia heard what he said, and his heart stung a bit. \u201cLet bygones be bygones\u00a0ba. After this\u2026.what are your plans?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u00a0la, I\u2019ve earned enough retirement money in recent years, and I\u2019ve gotten a lot of money from Director Li\u2019s side. Speaking of that, you probably guessed that\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cEn, I pretty much guessed it.\u201d Since the day that Zhai Ying was able to get his monthly review videos so smoothly, Fang Juexia had already known. \u201cLi Luo wants to completely gouge out Jin Xiangcheng, and this really is a good way of doing it. Although it will have an impact on Astar, it\u2019s better to recover slowly than to watch it rot away.\u201d\u201cYes\u00a0ah, it\u2019s a fight between big bosses. It\u2019s fine if I\u2019m just a chess piece, if you can give me back my freedom, then I\u2019ll willingly be a pawn.\u201d Liang Ruo stated it very easily, \u201cI\u2019ve stayed in this circle long enough. I\u2019m not as talented or as capable as you are, and my bandmates are always targeting me, so it\u2019s no fun hanging around anyway. When everything has been settled, I\u2019ll travel around the world and emigrate to places where no one knows me. Like I told you before, I\u2019ll open up a small coffee shop, and that will be quite nice. As for Jin Xiangcheng\u2026\u201dLiang Ruo sneered on the other end of the phone. \u201cThe crimes he committed are even heavier than you think; just a few of them will be enough for him to stay in prison for a lifetime. All these years of me being a dog have really not been in vain, now I\u2019ve finally gotten the chance to bite back.\u201dFang Juexia didn\u2019t care about the charges against Jin Xiangcheng. He knew that this man had no bottom line, and now that he had fallen to this end, it could count as various forces uniting to come against him.\u201cNo matter what happens, you need to take care of yourself.\u201d After thinking for a long time, he could only come up with this sentence.But Liang Ruo was already very happy on hearing this. \u201cI will. Don\u2019t worry, a villain like me often lives longer. I will definitely live longer than Jin Xiangcheng.\u201dOnly when he said that did Fang Juexia feel relieved. Liang Ruo\u2019s nature wasn\u2019t bad, and he also knew that not everyone or everything in the world could be black or white; everyone was just being pushed along.At least Liang Ruo had woken up and looked back.\u201cHey, Juexia, about you calling me, does Pei Tingsong know?\u201d Liang Ruo asked deliberately, \u201cHe won\u2019t be angry\u00a0ba?\u201dThinking of Pei Tingsong, the corners of Fang Juexia\u2019s mouth raised slightly, and he explained in detail, \u201cNo, he was the one who advised me to contact you.\u201dLiang Ruo sighed at the other end of the phone. \u201cOkay\u00a0ba, okay\u00a0ba. I should have known earlier.\u201d\u201cKnown what?\u201d Fang Juexia was puzzled.I should have known earlier that you would like someone like this.\u201cNothing,\u201d Liang Ruo said with a smile, \u201cI won\u2019t take up your time anymore, big star, I have to go see the prosecution.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Fang Juexia dropped his eyes; it was time to say goodbye. This was a person who had participated in his weary youth, an old friend who had gone his separate way, then walked around and now shaken hands with him to make peace, but it was now the end of this separation.Everything was predestined.Hearing a knock on the door, Fang Juexia looked back to see Pei Tingsong standing at the door. The other party spoke to him in a low voice while gesticulating, asking if he wanted to eat pizza or not.Fang Juexia nodded gently and said one last sentence to Liang Ruo before hanging up the phone.\u201cI hope I can go to your cafe for coffee one day.\u201dThere was a sudden silence at the other end. Only after several seconds passed did Liang Ruo open his mouth again. His voice was trembling, and it was so obvious that he couldn\u2019t disguise it.\u201cAlright\u00a0ah, drinks are free for you, drink as much as you want.\u201d He cried and laughed at the same time, and after sniffling, added\u2014\u201cBut if you bring Pei Tingsong along, you have to tip me double.\u201d\u2014Juurensha : Liang Ruo\u2019s situation was pretty tough\u2026.glad he finally gets to leave though.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100Translated by juurenshaEdited by NoksThe paradise of idealistsThe night Liang Ruo left the group, Astar\u2019s official Weibo made a post.The contents were very long, but generally speaking, there were three main points: having an attitude check towards high-level sexual assault cases and promising to cooperate with the investigation; peacefully terminating Liang Ruo\u2019s contract and giving him their blessings; rectifying the company atmosphere and providing Astar with a bright future.Although a lot of people cursed them out, the good thing was that their attitude was correct and voicing this was timely. Prior to this, netizens were still worried about Liang Ruo\u2019s contract, but after seeing how Astar had directly terminated it, they felt that this counted as a good deed carried out by the company.With something like this happening, it was inevitable that some people would call the accounts into question and abuse them, but there were also many voices who didn\u2019t want to implicate the whole company because of one high level executive. In addition to making a statement, Astar had also set up an anti-sexual abuse foundation within the entertainment circle, with a 24-hour consultation phoneline to provide financial and legal aid to all those in need. This move dragged back up the netizens\u2019 impression and reduced the amount of harsh criticism that was being hurled on the company and its artists.Also, that very night, Fang Juexia received a call from Li Luo. He didn\u2019t expect Li Luo to have the time to call him during Astar\u2019s PR emergency.\u201cDirector Li, hello.\u201dFang Juexia was still that same Fang Juexia, the one who had appeared during the trainee audition back then\u2014 he was calm to the extreme, with no fluctuations in his tone at all. When everyone else had been timid and hesitant to show off their talents back then, Fang Juexia could just stand there and shine.\u201cMy call right now is one that has come very late,\u201d Li Luo said with a little guilt. \u201cTo speak frankly, I didn\u2019t have the ability to uphold justice at the beginning, and let this thing drag on for so long. I may never be able to make up for the subsequent damage done to you.\u201dAfter listening to him, Fang Juexia thought of the situation back then, when he had, hot-bloodedly, run all the way to knock on Li Luo\u2019s office door.Back then, he had been too naive; he had thought that anybody would have the right to punish a higher-level executive for committing the crime of sexual abuse, and that everyone would clearly know right from wrong. But even if they knew that, so what? The criminal was the one in power, and could blot out the skies with one hand, which meant that no one had the right to punish him. Even Li Luo could only remain silent at that time.Fang Juexia had studied mathematics; mathematics was the paradise of idealists, and he was one of them. He was used to facing the logical world as constructed by mathematics, which was simple, direct, and clear-cut. Everything could be put forth out in the open, submitted to reason and verification, and the result couldn\u2019t appear right but in fact be wrong. Once proved, a theorem would then be classified as absolutely correct.But these weren\u2019t numbers or theorems, these were people.In this complex human world, how many things could be deemed \u201cabsolutely correct\u201d?\u201cNo, Director Li,\u201d said Fang Juexia, following it up with a magnanimous laugh, \u201cI was the one who was too idealistic. I very much appreciate you promoting me and helping me; this I will never forget. Astar is where I started, and although it wasn\u2019t suitable for me, I hope it will be better in the future.\u201dLi Luo also laughed, his voice carrying some regret. \u201cIf I had enough power at that time to save you guys, maybe your star path would be completely different. By now, you should have been the person who would have taken Seven Luminaries all the way up to the top\u00a0ba.\u201dFang Juexia had indeed been one of the reserved members for Seven Luminaries.He had stood in the front in every evaluation, calmly accepting the praise heaped on him by all the teachers. A after A was stuck onto him, and he was held up on the altar of the company. Big entertainment companies had so many trainees that it was impossible for all of them to debut. Fang Juexia was the only one who stood out as a surety for a debut with a new boy-band in everyone\u2019s eyes, especially with his two years of trainee experience at Astar,.But the more it was like that, the more dramatic fate became.\u201cBut I\u2019m a member of Kaleido now.\u201d Fang Juexia was neither humble nor arrogant. \u201cMoreover, I\u2019m not the person who can lead a group to the top. On the contrary, I\u2019ve learned a lot from everyone around me now, and every step along the way, we have walked side-by-side.\u201cIn a way, I prefer the present state.\u201dLi Luo said no more. He knew that from the day this stubborn boy had left Astar without any hesitation, their fates would never intersect again. In fact, that so-called gratitude for his help as a superior didn\u2019t count as much; Fang Juexia, this kind of person, would shine everywhere. What\u2019s more, his two years in Astar had simply brought the boy more long-term slander and hostile doubt.Yet, this boy was still grateful for everything in the past, and it was not because he was that tolerant or that generous\u2014It was because he never wanted to change himself.Fang Juexia was still that idealistic advocate, but he had now found a paradise more suitable for him.\u201cThen, I wish you a better future.\u201dOn the third day after Liang Ruo\u2019s withdrawal from the group, Jin Xiangcheng was also arrested on the basis of multiple criminal evidence provided against him. A lot of netizens who were following this matter closely the entire time felt that such an outcome was very much in line with the will of the people, but this issue didn\u2019t just end completely with this.This wasn\u2019t the only case of sexual abuse in the entertainment industry, nor was Astar the only entertainment company to have such a thing happen. The whole circle was full of \u201chidden rules\u201d, and there were few rebels like Fang Juexia. For the sake of their dreams of stardom, many artists were trapped and became victims through coercion and intimidation.Compared to men, there were even more female victims. They had no right to speak, no popular position or fame in the circle, and were constrained by the pressures of public opinion and the power of the big bosses, so they could only bear it silently. After Liang Ruo revealed his story, he became a model for people to follow, and a number of artists also spoke out; most of them were not very popular actors, and they shared their similar though not exactly the same experiences.Besides the entertainment circle, where the issue of sexual abuse had been exposed in front of the public eye, there were other more common industries that also started to speak up with a different tone. Gradually #Anti-sexual abuse in industries# became a hot topic. There were still people who kept trampling on the hearts of the victims, uttering irrelevant sarcastic words, and there were still some others who were just going with the flow.But there were also people thinking about it, and some who were considering it seriously, and this was progress.Everyone didn\u2019t know if this kind of topic would disappear as the tide of public opinion subsided, but at least for this moment, its existence was seen by more and more people.Just because no one had stood up in the past didn\u2019t mean that this kind of behavior was reasonable. No resistance didn\u2019t mean that they were correct. Now anti-harassment voices had appeared, becoming a kind of wake-up call. There were many Liang Ruos in this circle, and even more Liang Ruos who had not been saved and were still struggling in a sea of misery.Those who were forced to lose themselves also had the right to recover themselves again.This autumn, it seemed as if a typhoon had passed through Fang Juexia\u2019s life. Many of the things he had carefully maintained were destroyed, and although he had survived safely through it, he was still left with ruins and remnants of buildings everywhere. Fortunately, he was patient enough and willing to rebuild bit by bit. He also believed that everything would eventually progress in the right direction.His mother accompanied him for a week and a half before she left to go back to teach the children. She simply couldn\u2019t stay too long. On the day she left Beijing, Fang Juexia and Pei Tingsong both went to the airport to see her off. With tears in her eyes, Mama Fang was reluctant to leave her son.\u201cBefore, it was always you who would leave Mama and go to other places.\u201d She wiped away her tears. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for Mama to go, and I\u2019m still not really used to it.\u201dFang Juexia hugged her. \u201cI\u2019ll come to visit you very soon. Be careful at home, and if anything happens, let me know.\u201dBefore leaving, Mama Fang also hugged Pei Tingsong, and thanked him, after which, just like the first time, she repeatedly reminded Fang Juexia to take care of his Didi.But Fang Juexia\u2019s mood had long changed from what it was back then. If they were really talking about taking care of someone, he was actually the one being taken care of.Watching Mama Fang leave, Pei Tingsong stuck his hands into his pockets. \u201cI thought that when Auntie was here, she would want to see your dad. Originally, I had already prepared for it, and if she said anything, I would arrange it.\u201d\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Fang Juexia shook his head and looked at the sky outside the huge floor-to-ceiling windows of the airport. \u201cWhen she gave me all the evidence, she had already given up her heart.\u201dAfter spending all these years lost in obsession, his mother could now also see things more clearly.What she loved wasn\u2019t the person, but all those beautiful memories.Just like the Fang Juexia from before, both of them had struggled repeatedly for the sake of the once beautiful Fang Ping who wasn\u2019t physically gone, but was already lost.Time passed very quickly, and the smell of winter gradually appeared in the air. It was dry and cold, and the moment it went up the nose, the person\u2019s whole being would feel refreshed.Not wanting to give people the impression that he was trying to snatch the spotlight, Fang Juexia deliberately waited for some time. He waited until him revealing his family matter and his secret illness had gradually faded away in everyone\u2019s memory, and only then did he privately set up two charitable foundations\u2014one for genetic disease research and the other for blind children.He entrusted the establishment of the blind children\u2019s fund to a very reliable charity organization, and when the other party also proposed to invite him to be the spokesman for the organization, Fang Juexia refused. He also didn\u2019t use his own name to establish the fund; after thinking about it, he used his grandfather\u2019s name.If there was such a thing as blessings in the world, he hoped to give them all to his grandfather.Ling Yi won second place in the singing competition program he participated in, which also made everyone see the strength of a boyband\u2019s lead singer, breaking through the usual prejudices the audience had. He Ziyan\u2019s TV drama\u2019s broadcast also went smoothly; after the first four episodes were released, the review websites gave it a good score of 8.7 points. Although he was the second male lead, his character was the most perfect, without any bugs, and adding on the more loving filter passers-by had after his life experiences had been picked all over online, his popularity soared.Zhai Ying, who had never been able to make a comeback, was finally released from the freezer after the change in Astar\u2019s higher-level management, and she released a new album with her bandmates, which garnered quite a large response. Although filming for \u201cEscape\u201d was done, everyone of the participants still possessed a \u201cteam spirit\u201d and all helped Zhai Ying, who had been stuck in a blank period for a long time, promote the album.Fang Juexia wasn\u2019t an exception, and he logged into Weibo before a meeting to forward Zhai Ying\u2019s post.[@Kaleido Fang Juexia: Finally getting a comeback, congratulations!]Ling Yi complained as soon as he saw this. \u201cJuexia, with the relationship between you and Xiao Ying being so good, and the frequency of your interactions with her on Weibo catching up to how much you have with us, are you not afraid that your girlfriend fans will get angry?\u201d\u201cDoes he still have girlfriends fans?\u201d Lu Yuan said with a laugh, \u201cWhen he was interviewed last time, someone asked him what kind of girls he liked, and he said solemnly, \u2018Shouldn\u2019t you ask me what kind of people I like?\u2019 With just that sentence, all his girlfriend fans ran clean away\u00a0ba.\u00a0Some people say that \u2018Escape For Your Life\u2019 is poisonous and should be renamed \u2018Escape From\u00a0Wanchai Pier.\u2019\u201d\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dFang Juexia was a little embarrassed, but all he could say was, \u201cThey won\u2019t, the fans all know we\u2019re just friends.\u201dIt was true that as he said, his fans didn\u2019t care about the interaction between their idol and another member of a girl\u2019s group, but they caught onto a different point.[@The best Fine Jewelike Xerophyte in the world: If you\u2019re good friends, you should dance your good friend\u2019s dance!]Visit lightnovelreader[.]com for extra chapters.[@My\u00a0Hairline\u00a0is very good: Congratulations on the comeback!

Some people shouldn\u2019t just follow their friends\u2019 Weibo\u00a0ah, they also should do the dance and sing the song\u2014that would mean you\u2019re real bros!][@Juexia Gege\u2019s little birthmark: Girl group dance!

Feeling moved at heart isn\u2019t as good as really moving! P.S.: Can I borrow Zhai Jie\u2019s promotional singing costume?]This unfolded\u2026.Who would have thought that there would be no fans who would mind this at all? All of them were eager to see the main person they stanned dance a girl group\u2019s dance. Seeing this request blot out the skies online, Fang Juexia could only play dead. Anyway, he had given up going online, so even if he was asked, he would just say he knew nothing about it.Pei Tingsong, on the other hand, scrolled through his comments enthusiastically. Originally, he had just been surfing around with his side account, but when he accidentally saw Fang Juexia and Zhai Ying\u2019s CP clips, he was beside himself with anger. He went back to his main account, wanting to generously help promote Zhai Ying\u2019s new album, but when he went below, into his own family\u2019s little white flower\u2019s Weibo, he unprecedentedly discovered that he shared some resonance with his wife\u2019s girlfriend fans. He hadn\u2019t expected everyone to actually open up a new road and beg Fang Juexia to dance a girl group\u2019s dance.This was a good idea\u00a0ah! Just like that, these fans opened up a new window in Pei Tingsong\u2019s heart, and his field of vision grew wider. Why hadn\u2019t he thought of it before?Once he accepted this idea, his mind was full of images of Fang Juexia dancing a girl group dance.He already couldn\u2019t satisfy himself with just reading these comments; he even went ahead and searched for [Fang Juexia girl group dance] on Weibo.One world, one wish.The main purpose of Cheng Qiang\u2019s meeting this day was to discuss the final plans for the end of the year. \u201cThe recording work for the winter album has been basically completed, and the company has scheduled to release it at Christmas for now. It\u2019s the end of the year, so everyone will be even more busy; there will be four or five award ceremonies and parties on various platforms to attend, so all of your conditions need to be adjusted accordingly for me. Although you don\u2019t rely on your faces to eat, if your faces are nice, that will also be your bonus. Right, next month, Miaomiao\u2019s film will premiere at a film festival, and everyone will attend.\u201d\u201cYes! We\u2019re going to see Miaomiao\u2019s movie!\u201dJiang Miao covered his heart. \u201cI\u2019m so nervous.\u201d\u201cRecently, everyone has been working very hard. I think almost all of your personal events are nearly done\u00a0ba,\u00a0the competitions are over, the programs have been recorded, and the dramas have premiered\u2026\u201d Cheng Qiang checked over these items, and these all were really finished, and perfectly, they had all ended together. \u201cThat\u2019s very good, everyone can take a few days off.\u201dOn hearing about an impending vacation, Ling Yi immediately raised his hand. \u201cAsking a question!\u201dLu Yuan was spirited enough to play along with him. \u201cTwo words!\u201dPei Tingsong rolled his eyes. \u201cHere we go again, they\u2019re going to ask about the Maldives again.\u201dLing Yi tossed the blame right back at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t! It wasn\u2019t me! It was Xiao Pei!\u201dSeeing him taking the blame, Fang Juexia couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cSpeaking of this,\u201d Cheng Qiang put a document on the desk. \u201cPresident Chen\u2019s friend opened a luxury hot spring resort, just around Beijing. Two days ago, President Chen asked me to ask you guys if you wanted to go.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll go! Of course, we\u2019ll go!\u201d Ling Yi asked in a low voice, \u201cThen what about the Maldives?\u201dCheng Qiang sighed. \u201cWe\u2019re going there too, I already told you that we\u2019re going there to record the ensemble show.\u201d After saying that, he arranged for the group to go to the resort. \u201cThen you guys will leave tomorrow for the resort. There are few people there, it\u2019s quiet, and you guys can rest for two days and work hard for me when you come back.\u201dJiang Miao asked, \u201cThen what about you, Qiang Ge?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t go, I\u2019ll let Xiao Wen follow you guys. If something comes up, please contact me.\u201dHe Ziyan, who had been quietly scrolling through Weibo without saying a word, suddenly spoke up, \u201cHoly crap!\u201d The other members all turned their heads. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cXiao Pei.\u201d He Ziyan raised his cellphone and said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you switch accounts while eating melons\u00a0ah? Your hand slipped, and you didn\u2019t even notice you liked something\u00a0ah.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Pei Tingsong froze, then thought of the things he had just browsed, and felt weak all over, so he immediately took out his cellphone to search through his likes.\u201cReally\u00a0ah!\u201d As soon as Ling Yi saw what Pei Tingsong had liked, he started tossing out inhumane mockery \u201cYou sanctimonious looking person!\u201dJiang Miao felt that this was a little strange. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have liked something that was cursing out your bandmates\u00a0ba.\u201d\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t\u00a0ba, my young master.\u201d Cheng Qiang nearly grew frantic. \u201cDon\u2019t mess around with me\u00a0ah, as soon as I see the word \u2018PR\u2019 now, I want to puke. If you\u2019re still going to be like this, I\u2019m going to take away your accounts and suspend them!\u201d\u201cAiya, it\u2019s not that\u201d Lu Yuan, who had already checked Weibo, clicked his tongue a few times before looking at Fang Juexia, who was still in the dark. \u201cJuexia, you treat him as a bandmate, while he treats you as\u2026\u201dBy now, Pei Tingsong had grown so frantic he started cursing, \u201cWhat complete nonsense, shut up for me, or else I\u2019ll break your leg, you see!\u201dHe Ziyan was watching the uproar, and didn\u2019t mind adding flames to the fire. \u201cOho. He\u2019s frantic, he\u2019s frantic, he\u2019s so frantic, he\u2019s started rhyming.\u201dOnly then did Fang Juexia, with a confused look on his face, take out his cellphone and open Pei Tingsong\u2019s liked posts list. What everyone was talking about turned out to be a Weibo post with thousands of comments, posted by an account with thousands of fans.[@Beautiful baby is delicate and pitiful: Based on the Little Beauty\u2019s recommendation, I went to watch Zhai Jie\u2019s new album\u2019s song, and the choreography, respect. The wave and hip twists during the chorus really can\u2019t suit our Little Beauty more. Who says a cold face can\u2019t be sexy? Clearly he doesn\u2019t want to dance it, but he has to. His lips are stubbornly pursed in a line, his ears as red as if they had been bitten, his eyes lowered, not wanting to look at the camera, but the birthmark at the corner of his eyes draws you in anyway. The neckline of his loose white shirt is spread out, revealing a small section of his clavicle. As soon as the light hits him, the lines of his waist are on full display, and as soon as he thrusts his hips, our hearts and livers start trembling.If the daily beauty value of Pretty Baby is ten, then the forced-to-be seductive Pretty Baby\u2019s beauty value will be ten times more than that. Who doesn\u2019t want to see the holy beauty red with lust? So sisters, quickly go leave some messages! If you guys don\u2019t kick up a fuss, and if I don\u2019t kick up a fuss, then when will Fine Jewelike Xerophyte dance like this?! If you push, and I urge, Fine Jewlike Xerophyte will be more beautiful tomorrow than today!]\u201cPei Tingsong\u2026\u201d Fang Juexia put his cellphone on the table, startling Pei Tingsong into trembling.\u201cWhat were you looking at when you were scrolling through Weibo?\u201d\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
