When I woke up I found myself in a moldy motel room.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dIt felt as if my head was about to break open. I clenched my forehead as I got up. The musty smelling blanket fell to my feet.So\u2026 let\u2019s see, after confirming that I had once again failed the civil service examination, I believe I had fallen asleep after drinking by myself.Does that mean I somehow crawled from my studio into some sort of motel?\u2018I must have lost my mind\u2026\u2019I went towards the bathroom as I cursed myself. I thought I would let out some water and check out my appearance. Though I was sure I looked like a drunk college student without even having to look.Then I looked at the mirror and suddenly fell down.\u201cUgh! \u2026Fuck.\u201dI clenched my teeth as I sweared out of reflex at the unbelievable situation.With trembling hands I brushed off my hair. And then I once again looked at the mirror.The face in the mirror was still an unfamiliar one.A good looking kid with a skinny body.\u2026Trying not to panic I held onto my breath. Suddenly I longed for the cigarettes that I had already quitted.\u201c\u2026Huh.\u201dOnly then did I realize that even my voice was strange.I felt like I wanted to bite my tongue.Just what the hell was going on here?I managed to somehow pull myself together and lead this unfamiliar body to search around the motel room.In the bed, I found a note that looked like a suicide note as well as an empty medicine box. This guy must have attempted suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills.After roughly reading the contents of the suicide note, it was about how he was an orphan and dropped out of school because of how unfair and hopeless he felt.I had a bitter taste in my mouth. Even after changing my body it seemed I was still an orphan.On top of the cheap dressing table I found a wallet, when I searched inside I found several bills and the ID card that belonged to this body.[Park Moondae 0X1215-3XXXXXX]\u201cThe last row\u2019s number is 3\u2026\u201dThey were young. With a deflated voice I looked at the photo on the ID Card. it looked better than the mess of a face I had seen earlier, but it still looked gloomy.Still, despite his gloomy look he looked quite young. He should be around 23 years old right now. I thought he\u2019d be younger.\u201c\u2026\u201dNo, this isn\u2019t time to think about this.I tried thinking calmly.By having a rough understanding of my current situation, I slowly calmed myself down. I think I should find out about the whereabouts of my original body and come up with countermeasures. Maybe the guy who tried killing himself also ended up in my body.I grabbed my wallet and opened the motel door.Then I froze.Ahead of me, snow was scattering from the window.\u2026Before I got drunk it was July.\u201cOh my gosh.\u201dI swallowed my saliva. Then I hurried back into the motel room and lifted up the calendar on the desk.[202x December]\u2026The calendar was from 3 years ago.My vision started becoming dizzy.It didn\u2019t take too much time to calm myself down again. Because to me the fact that I changed my body was more shocking than being in the past.I sat on the bed and sighed. I didn\u2019t even remember the numbers for the lottery tickets.Then I raised my head to a flash of nonsense.\u2026Maybe this wasn\u2019t the past but a whole different world.It was a crazy idea yet because I was overwhelmed by the crazy situation it sounded somehow convincing.This seems to happen often in webtoons and web novels that I sometimes read. Was it something related to hunters\u2026?I muttered quietly in a dazed tone. Though I was sure it would be quite insufficient.\u201cStatus window\u2026?\u201dOf course, nothing happened.Damn it.Out of shame I hit the bed with my hand.There is no way that would work, you idiot\u2026[Name: Park Moondae (Ryu Gunwoo)]Level: 0Title: NoneVocals: CDance: \u2013Visuals: CTalent: \u2013Attribute: Infinite potentialIt came up?I fell out of the bed.\u201cUgh!\u201dEven though I was groaning because of my backache, I thought to myself.The contents of the status window is\u2026 it\u2019s not what I expected.***\u201c\u2026\u201dSince even the status window showed up, I was able to calm myself as much as I wanted.This situation ignored the laws of physics. I could tell that it was definitely no joke.Currently, I was out of the motel room and in a nearby PC room. I wanted to find out if there were any other changes besides the fact that this world was from 3 years ago.Just for reference, I asked the counter to call my original number but it didn\u2019t exist.I couldn\u2019t log into the university account, and the SNS account I created for my assignments was gone.In other words, there was no \u2018me\u2019 in this world.I didn\u2019t have much lingering feelings.By the time I was in middle school my parents had died in an accident, and I had already lost contact with all my other relatives when I entered college.I didn\u2019t have any notable personal collections, and all my relationships were cut off as the time I spent studying for the civil service exam became longerIn addition, considering the years I had wasted trying to become a civil service officer, It wasn\u2019t that strange that I had nothing to lose.\u201cThe Ham Ramyun you ordered.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you.\u201dI calmly evaluated myself and received the tray. Then I put some ramyun in my mouth before looking at the search engine.Well, three years ago was when I was desperate and became \u2018fully dedicated\u2019 to studying.Because I had cancelled my smartphone and cut off the internet I wasn\u2019t very familiar with these sites.But there wasn\u2019t a sense of incompatibility.It felt exactly like 3 years ago. Things that were popular at that time stood out. Games, movies, songs\u2026 idols.Speaking of idols.\u201cHm.\u201dI put the chopsticks back on the finished bowl of ramyun and crossed my arms.No matter how you looked at it, the contents of the status window was related to idols.I wasn\u2019t sure why I ended up on this body, but was it somehow related to the status window?Did the original owner of this body \u2018Park Moondae\u2019 wish to become an aspiring idol?\u2026or was it because of my college track record?I wasn\u2019t sure. But I had to make use of what\u2019s available.\u201cStatus Window.\u201dAs I murmured quietly almost as if it was the sound of my breathing, a translucent status window once again appeared in my sight.Vocal was Rated C, and so were the visuals. The rest were blank.Maybe because I had never tried them.I suddenly thought of that but decided to postpone the idea. There is no way that I wanted to showcase my dance and talent in this situation.So, let\u2019s check the other contents of the status window.I remembered the karaoke sign I saw while I was entering the PC room.***\u201cOh.\u201dFirst of all, after confirming the results, it seemed that C wasn\u2019t that low of a grade.I was able to sing well. First, he had a good voice and tone. And since the vocalization sounded clear, it felt like the basics were good. So I thought he was talented.And what was even more surprising than that was, this window came up[Accomplishment achieved! <first attempt>]Level 0 -> 1You have received a point!\u201cAccomplishment?\u201dI was just asking myself but another window popped up.[Accomplishments in progress]10 attempts (0/10)100 attempts (0/100)First experience (0/1)10 experiences (0/10)***Underneath the scrollbar was endlessly going. \u2026It was real hard work. Even the numbers that increased were getting ridiculous. In addition half of them were blank that was impossible to check.I felt a little out of touch so I turned off the window.But since I received a point, let\u2019s try using it like in games.I called out to the status window.At the bottom I could see a new writing that said \u2018Points remaining: 1\u2019\u201cDistribute 1 point to vocals.\u201dThen, the contents of the status window changed.[Name: Park Moondae (Ryu Gunwoo)]Level: 1Title: NoneVocals: C+Dance: \u2013Visuals: CTalent: \u2013Attribute: Infinite potentialThe vocals became C+ right away.Was this really reflected?I immediately chose the same song that I had sung earlier. And I sang it the same way.\u201c\u2026I did pretty well?\u201dThere was definitely a difference. The voice became easier to listen to and sounded more refined. It felt like my voice had naturally acquired the way to sing that way.And the \u2018Attribute\u2019 in the status window.\u201cThe potential is infinite.\u201dFor a normal person, their performance depended more on natural talent than their efforts. And there was a limit to trying. The maximum one could grow, a limit to their potential.But now, the status window showed that the efficiency of effort was ridiculously high and that there was no limit to growing.Andjust now I had confirmed that my skills were actually getting better.I thought as I stroked my chin.Idol\u2026.Did it mean that I should follow the path of this new body?And at that moment, a pop up showed up on the status window.\u201c\u2026!\u201d[Outbreak!]Status abnormality: \u2018If you don\u2019t debut, you\u2019ll die!\u2019A line of text continued under the red writing.[\u2018Debut or Die\u2019]If you don\u2019t debut as an idol within the time limit given, you will die.Time left until death: D-365\u201cWhat?\u201dThe contents were ridiculous, but I had an ominous feeling.Being in someone else\u2019s body was already crazy, but there was no guarantee that something stranger wouldn\u2019t happen.As soon as I finished reading it the weird pop up disappeared.And sure enough, a strange entry was added to the status window.[Name: Park Moondae (Ryu Gunwoo)]Level: 1Title: NoneVocals: C+Dance: \u2013Visuals: CTalent: \u2013Attribute: Infinite potential!Status abnormality: Debut or dieIs this real?\u201cFuck\u2026\u201dI spitted out curses and wrapped my hand around my forehead. I had cold sweat dripping down my face.I had already confirmed that the status window was real. So the possibility of this shitty statement being real couldn\u2019t be ignored.Why the hell did this pop up? Because I was thinking of idols?A burster of laughter came out as I was dumbfounded at the situation. But at the same time I had a thought.\u2018\u2026don\u2019t tell me this is my punishment for selling the data of those idols.\u2019Yes, idols.In fact, due to personal circumstances I was rather familiar with this field.This is because when I was in college. I made decent living expenses by taking pictures of idols on behalf of others. In the process\u2026I have also done some more work.I had seen all sorts of things and heard all kinds of rumors.Besides, the environment makes the person, so as I followed them to take pictures, I had unnecessarily gotten overly-enthusiastic over this field.At that time, I had voluntarily searched for this and that, so this was a field I had a knowledge in.I wiped off the cold sweat by rubbing my face. Then crossed my arms and glared at the status window.I didn\u2019t know what was what anymore. This situation was ridiculous and maddening.But I had no intention of dying.So let\u2019s calm down.Yeah, my life was a waste anyways, but now I was given a chance for a fresh start. The conditions were also favorable.Besides, I wanted to track down the reason why I ended up on this body, I had to use this unrealistic status window more and check it out.\u201cHm.\u201dMy self-rationalization was completed. I grinned as if I was crazy.\u2026now that I think about it, at this time of year an idol survival program had become a big hit didn\u2019t it?Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Debut or DieCH 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018Idol Joint-Stock Company.\u2019It was a survival entertainment show that had been a hit around this time of the year.After the popular auditions of tens and hundreds of aspiring idols who were gathered together and eliminated by voting, several other programs followed that format.The \u2018idol joint-stock company\u2019 was one of those mass produced programs, but there was a reason why it especially became famous.That was because it was more capitalist in an evil way.Let\u2019s look at the advertisement from season 1.[Your idol stocks as much as you buy them!]Yes. it meant that you could vote in \u2018stocks\u2019 as long as you spent money.The program was on its 3rd season this year.Season 2 had collapsed due to an unknown reason, so after that the season was thrown away as if it never existed and they came back with the aspirational slogan of \u2018relisting\u2019.Thanks to this, many people laughed at season 3 saying it would be a mess and fall in ruins.\u2026what about me? I hadn\u2019t thought much about it since I was busy preparing for the exam.Anyways, contrary to people\u2019s expectations, season 3 became an all-time hit.Although there was a lot of controversy and criticism, it managed to produce a male idol group that held tightly to popularity and good ratings by being able to bring up to 80,000 people into music sites and selling 600,000 copies of their album within the first week.So I was going to go on this show too.Today, I went out for this first step.\u201cYes, I\u2019m done! I didn\u2019t take much from the sides just like you asked.\u201d\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201dNow I had finally improved my appearance a bit. I thought that as I looked at my hair in the mirror of the beauty salon.Perhaps eating and sleeping well during the past few days had affected it, but the depressed mood around me had already disappeared. Thanks to that, it was okay to get rid of these messy bangs and show my forehead.Right on time, the lady who was getting a perm while sitting next to me, gave me some lip service.\u201cOh student, you look so good in that~ You\u2019ve improved so much!\u201dI thanked her and proceeded to go to the counter to pay in cash.\u2018I went to the bank and checked it, it\u2019s a relief that I had some money in the bank account.\u2019Looking at the details, it looked like it hadn\u2019t been used since it was his parents\u2019 insurance money. But while I was sorry, I had to use it.\u2018\u2026If I make some money I should probably return it and donate some to a children welfare organisation.\u201dIt felt a bit bitter. After taking off the registration copy and opening the cell phone, I found out that the suicide of \u2018Park Moondae\u2019 wasn\u2019t on impulse.He had been kicked out of his room (and due to the monthly rent being a bit delayed he almost couldn\u2019t get a deposit) as well as having his phone cancelled.And it all happened on his birthday.He must have really wanted to die.\u2026well, I understand. After all, I was like that too.\u2018I hope you are in a good place now.\u2019I sorted out my thoughts after a short silence. Then, I opened the door to the hair salon and left. It was near noon so the sun pierced through my eyes.There was still a lot of work to do before achieving my goal of going out.\u2018First of all, let\u2019s be sure of it.\u2019I already knew everything about the missions, debuting members, and the theme song for this program.Of course, due to the disclosure the details weren\u2019t complete but it was hard to find a better chance than this.Even if I just pass the second round, thanks to the program being big I could somehow catch the attention of a small or a medium sized company.However, there was a critical problem, the public auditions to recruit this season\u2019s participants had already ended.But since I knew a few hints, I was going to use them as much as I could.My goal was to become a participant of this survival program that had already ended its public auditions for the participants.Within a week too.Not at a broadcasting station, but at a karaoke room around here.***-IJC? Oh, Idol Joint-stock company. One of the writers there is a total nutcase.There was some rubbish that some guy snickered out at the after party of the photography club.He said he heard it from a relative that worked at the broadcasting station, this was the guy who told a bunch of rumors so I didn\u2019t like him much.-I heard that she recruited some participants at a karaoke or something. You know\u2026 the one by the broadcasting station. Sung X neighborhood? She recruited an ordinary person while going around the karaoke station and the PD got mad. She didn\u2019t amount to anything yet she ran wild. She is a complete moron, isn\u2019t she?After that the guy fired up and kept talking about the casting system.It was a common thing to talk nonsense at drinking parties, but it was extremely rare for people to talk about such boring things at a group gathering.\u2018Who invited this guy?\u2019\u2018Let\u2019s not invite him again.\u2019\u2018Agreed.\u2019With faces full of discontent, people chatted with their eyes.Of course, I didn\u2019t believe that crap either. I just focused on the free drinks.But surprisingly, there was someone who validated that.-The ordinary person that was casted was Lee Goyoon.-\u2026.oh?Lee Goyoon was a female idol that debuted in season 1. She managed to gain popularity thanks to her cheerful, full of spirits, and pure-looking appearance, who spoke in an elegant dialect.There were shocked exclamations from all around.-Woah, this is one of the people that debuted right?-Yes.-Wow\u2026 how did you know?The girl who was a senior in the department of journalism and broadcasting who was on her way to graduation calmly continued.-That \u2018stupid moron\u2019 is my older sister.For a moment, the guy that was gossiping went silent. Everyone around amusingly scorned him.-\u2026oh, haha, that expression was\u2026-But she was never yelled at by the PD. Instead she got a raise.-\u2026After that, he shut himself up and sat quietly instead.Thanks to that, I was able to comfortably enjoy drinking. I believe I just drank more alcohol while I listened to that guy talk about casting.Anyways, it was a pretty interesting moment so it had remained in my memory.If the number of people they liked from the audition for the survival show was low, it is said that they would go to the karaoke by the broadcasting station for about a week after the audition.-Isn\u2019t getting kids who do street karaoke better? They are easier to cast.-There are already a lot of aspiring singers there, so they avoid it. I heard that they are trying to recruit ordinary people who have a unique charm to them unlike the other survival contestants.It wasn\u2019t necessarily about casting people who could debut, but rather about casting a completely ordinary person who doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening for the sake of making the show fun.These days kids who aspired to be idols would be trained by the agency to not talk recklessly.In the end, this also meant that the ordinary participant might get sacrificed for the entertainment of the show.\u2018Of course that\u2019s not what matters right now.\u2019What\u2019s more important is that in season 3, it was likely that the director would continue using this method.\u2018It\u2019s hard to let go of methods that have been successful.\u2019Maybe because season 2 was ruined, the audition pool might have gotten worse, so they are working harder.So let\u2019s think objectively.Although the body of \u2018Park Moondae\u2019 was very skinny, he was handsome and tall.Plus, his vocals were good, so if I meet them, there is definitely a chance that they\u2019ll give it a try.Also\u2026\u2018I had to raise my level.\u2019I had to invest in stats by achieving practice achievements. In order to be chosen it was necessary to have something special.I grabbed the microphone and chose a song. And sneakily casted a glance at the door of the karaoke room I entered.The door was made of glass.The interior was bright and open since it was intended for people aged 10~20, but at the same time, it was an interior that was nice to look at.That\u2019s why I chose this karaoke.The person I was looking for was a writer who worked at the broadcasting station.If she had to go out while she was busy and look at the general public while preparing for the program, it was most likely that she would come to a place near the broadcasting station that was easy to see.So that\u2019s why this karaoke was the best choice.Without hesitation I chose ten songs in advance and started singing.***[Accomplishment achieved! <10 attempts>]Level 1 -> 2You have received a point!Soon after, I completed an achievement. It was the achievement for singing 10 songs. Of course I knew this would be achieved quickly since it was easy.The point was once again put in singing. So the C+ grade changed to -.As I sang one more song for the sake of testing it, It felt like the basics were better this time.The tone was deepened and the volume increased. Perhaps when the alphabet unit changed this is how the improvement was.At this rate, it seemed I could raise my abilities ridiculously fast at the beginning, but right now there was something else to focus on.\u201cOh, I am someone who is in this kind of work.\u201dI didn\u2019t think I would be scouted so soon.It started a bit early if I calculated the timing, but it was an unexpected score.I accepted the business card from the woman who was wearing glasses.The woman looked tired, but she purposefully put on a cheerful voice.\u201dIt looks like she was trying to impress me, it seems I had succeeded in intriguing her as expected.The name I expected was written on the business card.[Ryu Seorin]The senior girl who majored in journalism and broadcasting was called \u2018Ryu Seojin\u2019.\u2018Just looking at it you could see that it was a name that belonged to sisters.\u2019\u201cStudent, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cMy name is Park Moondae.\u201d\u201cYou have a unique name. Think about this quality. Student, I think you have the ability to become a star. Our people are really good at discovering people with said star qualities.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201dI didn\u2019t act too happy. If I seemed too interested it would seem like I was aiming for this situation.Usually, the first step would be the preliminary profile, but I am sure that they would skip those who were aiming for this.Maybe it was a good approach since the women continued.Student, your face is handsome and you sing well. I think you would do really great if you were to come on the show\u2026 hmm, would you like to go today and try to film a test video?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dWaiting to finish the verification at once, the women pushed a little.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Please call your parents. If you told them their son was casted on a TV show or went to a broadcasting station they would be happy.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t have any parents.\u201dAs soon as I said that, a small spark flashed in the eyes of this so-called writer.It seemed she judged this as stimulating material.Well, it was a necessity to sell stories on survival shows. It was even better if they were criticized for squeezing its juice.It was a waste to miss it just in case this opportunity could be used.However the writer quickly dismissed her look. And said in a gentle tone as if she didn\u2019t want to hurt me.\u201cOh my\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d\u201cI was just saying that I think you should come and watch the broadcasting station comfortably. This experience isn\u2019t something you can always get~\u201d\u201c\u2026Hmm.\u201dShall I slowly accept it?I paused a little as if I was hesitating, and then slowly nodded. The woman\u2019s face became noticeably bright.\u201cOh, that\u2019s a wonderful choice! We are right in front of the broadcasting station!\u201dAnd that\u2019s how the first goal was achieved.It was a better start than expected.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 3": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Debut or DieCH 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayNothing much happened at the broadcasting station that the writer dragged me to. I just had a quick interview in front of a camera.They didn\u2019t even ask me to dance, which should have been asked for formality. Of course, they also didn\u2019t advise me to join a dance academy.That was evidence that they had a clear role for me in the show.But those things didn\u2019t matter to me. The important thing was the fact that my name was put on the contestant list.But there was one unexpected element.The first shooting was way earlier than what I expected.\u201c...In 10 days?\u201d\u201cYes. Park Moondae-gun just came in right at the last minute. A free spot doesn\u2019t usually appear like this, you\u2019re really lucky~ It\u2019s because Moondae-gun is good that\u2019s why you get this spot.\u201dThey phrased \u2018I was just a replacement\u2019 so nicely.Slightly flustered, I thought about it carefully.They worded it so nicely and it didn\u2019t cost me anything to appear, so it was a good offer for me.Of course, if I was actually nothing much after they found out about me, they would act as if they never said I was good.There\u2019s rarely a field where people cut off a person as fast as in this one.In addition, asking a commoner to prepare a performance alone in 10 days without giving them any help was definitely not a good demand.They said it like it was nothing much with a straight face, but if this was a contestant from an entertainment company, they might have complained about this.That\u2019s like telling me to never mind using an arrangement, just use any instrumental track and get some hate. And if I didn\u2019t perform that bad, they would just edit me out.But I expected this much.\u201c...Yes. Thank you.\u201dI nodded my head as if I was nervous for the filming that was happening soon and didn\u2019t notice anything fishy.A look of satisfaction passed by on the writer\u2019s face.\u201cWe\u2019re the thankful ones~ I will contact you with more details.\u201dThat was her cue to leave. I exited the broadcasting station without any regret and made a strategy for the next 10 days.As my preparation time was short, it seemed like I needed to use a more extreme method than what I was planning.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014At the end of the busy 10 days, the day of the first shooting came.It\u2019s an obvious structure in survival programs, but it first started with evaluation of the performances from each contestant.The first evaluation.A person who watched an idol survival program before would know about this, but the impression from this time rarely lasted until the end of the program.For a contestant who didn\u2019t have any interesting factor, it would be the worst if they performed vaguely average.It would be better to fail badly like they were a joke, then put a narration of getting better for their show direction.If you got edited out in here because you didn\u2019t have any special feature, then there was no helping it anymore.Though that didn\u2019t mean one should aim for getting hate from the viewers.\u201cEveryone remembers their own number, right? Your number will be called. When you receive the notice, please enter the corridor~\u201dThe shooting started with the fake appearance of contestants one by one entering the corridor.This was just the portion for a teaser, but for this 40-second teaser, the shooting had gone on for 2 hours.That was because the contestants were 77 people.\u2018There were only young and innocent kids.\u2019Watching the faces of people sitting scattered in this waiting room that was more like a despicable empty space, my motivations slightly faded away.I was a regressor that had a status window, but to be aspiring to become an idol with all these kids made me realize this was embarrassing.\u201cExcuse me, hello.\u201dOne of the kids that was striking conversations here and there came to me.I didn\u2019t know if this kid was just excited or just putting on a facade to look good.From his appearance, he seemed like a middle-schooler.At this age of mine, I was exchanging introductions with a middle-schooler to build connections\u2026.\u201cDid you apply on your own?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWow, me too. Ah, may I ask for your age\u2026?\u201d\u201c...I\u2019m 20 years old.\u201dMy lips were itchy as I cheated my age by 9 years, but unexpectedly I felt great.\u201cAre you from any entertainment company?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cOh, I see! Usually in IJC, there are many contestants coming from entertainment companies. Were you in any entertainment company before?\u201d\u201cNo, I was never in any entertainment company from the start.\u201d\u201cAh.. I see.\u201dInstantly, this middle-schooler kid lost his sincerity.After concluding our conversation, he went off to strike a conversation with another person.He already understood the society at such a young age, I felt like this kid would become successful in the future.Of course, he needed to learn to hide that kind of mindset from the camera, but I was sure he would do fine on his own.Anyway. A middle-schooler was already like that, what a warlike situation.I wonder if I made an absurd decision after being caught up in this unrealistic situation. But it\u2019s no use crying over spilt milk.\u201cWe\u2019re moving to the filming site!\u201dBecause the shooting had finally started.I stepped forward following the middle-schooler kids who were moving like meerkats.I waited for my turn beside the main stage where the first evaluation was held.They called me around the early to middle period.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u201cContestant Lee Sejin B ranks in\u2026.. 15th place! Please take a seat.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201dOne of the contestants who were getting evaluated bowed their head following the MC\u2019s words.He was one of the four contestants getting evaluated together because they\u2019re from the same entertainment company.Out of all other contestants, he was one worthy of some use, but the producer team didn\u2019t seem to take a liking to him that much.\u2018This is severe.\u2019The writer who was spinning her pen, Ryu Seorin, knitted her brows.The number of investors in Season 3 had decreased compared to the previous season. That was obvious. Because this new season was barely able to start after the failure of Season 2.Using a hilarious slogan like \u2018Relisting\u2019, the producer team was determined to erase the shadow of Season 2 and started to prepare for this program.But no matter how many connections or plans they had to hide the failure, there were always things they couldn\u2019t hide.One of those was the contestant pool.The candidates who had better training had gone to other audition programs.They tried to recruit exactly 77 contestants, so a lot of subpar kids were added, which made the difference in levels between them look big.If there were too many contestants who were bad, no matter how they edited the show, there was still a limit on how entertaining it would be.In South Korean audition programs, it was almost impossible for a talentless kid to gain popularity. Even if they edited the talentless kid well, just one mistake would get them endless criticism.It was not an issue of hatred that followed one\u2019s popularity, but they would be labelled as \u2018boring\u2019 and \u2018fraud\u2019.At least, she finished deciding on the first-rank contestants that could be pushed to make into the debut group, with that, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to carry on the program without a dark horse.\u2018The kid coming out now is like that too.\u2019The contestant getting evaluated now was a fresh newcomer who got recruited with 10 days left before this first shooting.At the last minute, one of the contestants committed DUI (Driving Under Influence) and was quickly taken off, which was how this kid got recruited, so she had no expectations from him.\u2018His name was\u2026 what again? Well, he would tell his name before the evaluation.\u2019That contestant\u2019s voice was moderately good, his appearance was not bad either. If things didn\u2019t work out, we could use his backstory too.With that, he managed to pass the low standards this lady had due to the urgency of the recruitment.Even with all those merits combined, he was still only better than a random substitute to fill a vacancy.\u2018Well\u2026 He can be used for a comparison to others.\u2019The judges were chatting and looked uninterested after skimming through his profile that had nothing exceptional except for his family situation.And that lady quietly thought of this.\u2018Yeah, it will be better if he does it very badly. That will get people\u2019s attention.\u2019People would get bored if ambiguously bad performances kept appearing, but if some were extremely bad, the program would look abundant. Following the famous quote, mocking is also a form of attention.There was a high probability that a commoner, who only had 10 days preparing the stage on his own, would be hilariously bad.The lady watched the stage with a bit of expectation.\u201cThe next contestant, please enter the stage!\u201dJust then, the commoner contestant walked up to the stage.Fortunately, it seemed like he found a nice salon, his face now looked more handsome than before.The problem was his mood looked peculiar, as if he\u2019s bored or gloomy.Last time, it was probably because of his family situation, but his attitude was also like this in front of these many cameras?It was actually because he had countlessly seen swarms of big cameras while he was a substitute photographer, but the writer, who wouldn\u2019t know about that, was wondering.\u2018Is he the type who doesn\u2019t show his nervousness?\u2019But actually it didn\u2019t matter. I could just make his image as a kid who couldn\u2019t perform well yet was arrogant. The writer was using her head diligently.At that moment, up on the stage, Park Moondae was listening to the MC.\u201cYes. Contestant. Please introduce yourself.\u201d\u201c...I am Park Moondae. Nice to meet you.\u201dAnd he bowed his head. Then the judges let out a small snort.\u201cWait, is that just it?\u201dOne male judge took the microphone and asked it with a voice mixed with laughter.He asked that question with a slight negative connotation. It probably meant to make him introduce himself properly, but Park Moondae just nodded his head in a serious manner.\u201cYes. I don't have anything in particular to introduce.\u201dAnd the judges burst out in laughter.\u201cWoah, what a unique friend!\u201d\u201cHe is funny~\u201dSeveral judges were whispering quietly. Of course all was caught in the microphone.\u201cAh, looking at your application here, there\u2019s really nothing.\u201d\u201cYeah, true.\u201dIt was about time they\u2019re going to ask \u2018Why are you participating here?\u2019.But the judges seemed to think it would be more striking to ask that after the performance, they stopped laughing soon.And the producer team thought this. They might be able to get a good cut.\u201cThen, please show us your performance.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWith a malevolent childlike interest, the contestant received the microphone from the staff.Soon, the interlude started playing.And everyone was confused.Why did this song appear here?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Debut or DieCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHuh?\u201dSeveral judges started to whisper to each other.\u201cT-Holic?\u201dSeveral years ago, a famous boy group \u2018T-Holic\u2019, who received the grand award for three consecutive years, discontinued their activities. The reason was they were under-numbered due to\u00a0some members joining the mandatory military service.In exchange, their company pushed the solo promotions of the main vocalist and also the youngest member who was yet to be drafted. He released a mini album with a title track that stood out with a strong chorus.However, after some time passed, people only found out that the true value of this album was actually the side track, not the title track.Surprisingly, the song even climbed up to third in the music chart.The tide started from a popular female soloist\u2019s recommendation post, followed by several variety shows becoming the small waves.That side track was <PARTY IN ME>.A song that\u2019s easy to listen to with a good harmonic of strong band sound and sophisticated synths, it was played in many college festivals, eventually it entered the yearly Top 100.And the song that was currently played in this filming was undoubtedly the interlude.The iconic intro with the accompaniment of unique accordion melody in the chorus.It sure was a masterpiece. If this song was sung well, it would leave an impression.Which made it more strange.\u2018This\u2026 How could he choose this song when he didn\u2019t know anything about the show?\u2019Because in this situation, the song was very ambiguous.It wasn\u2019t a peak representative song of a popular idol, but it also wasn\u2019t a popular song from an established singer.It wasn\u2019t a song that one would immediately choose for their first evaluation in idol or singer survival programs.Because the song somewhat didn\u2019t suit the two categories.And it had been some years since the song became popular.She didn\u2019t choose a song for him because she thought he would use a banal song, and this thing happened.The producer team could have checked the submitted songs from the contestants beforehand. But the contestants were 77 people here.The problem was she didn\u2019t want to spend time caring for a substitute, she wanted to just put him short.\u2018This ambiguous song would be hard to be compared with others\u2026...\u2019The writer hit her pen repeatedly on the floor in discontent.The judges, who were surprised with his song choice, were now waiting for the interlude to end in a slight casual manner.And Park Moondae\u2019s mouth opened.I remember the me that I knew (\ub09c \ub0b4\uac00 \uc54c\uace0 \uc788\ub358 \ub098\ub97c \uae30\uc5b5\ud574)Beyond the shining and dazzling season (\ube5b\ub098\uace0 \ub208\ubd80\uc2e0 \uacc4\uc808 \ub108\uba38)To the days of being weary and weak (\uc9c0\uce58\uace0 \ub098\uc57d\ud55c \uc2dc\uc808\uae4c\uc9c0)At the end of those endless days (\ub05d\ub3c4 \uc5c6\ub358 \ub098\ub0a0 \ub05d\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4)The one who embraced the broken me, Oh- (\uae68\uc9c4 \ub098\ub97c \ub2f4\uc544 \uc8fc\ub294 \uac83, Oh-)It\u2019s always me (\uc624\uc9c1 \ub098)Yes It\u2019s me (\uadf8\ub798 It\u2019s me)\u201c...!\u201dIt was good.Starting with an off-beat as if he was reciting softly, the first verse was clean.Many people did not know it well because it sounded at ease, but while singing this song, it was easy to fall off their timing due to its odd beat.It would make them sound like amateurs.But this contestant was nailing every complex beat in the detailed melody.\u2018Dan, tadan-, tan, dan, daaan-, tadan.\u2019\u201c...!\u201dBetween the judges who were subconsciously tapping the table to the beat of the music, one was surprised. She felt that his singing was just perfect.To the general viewers who didn\u2019t know the half-time beat, they would still think that he sang well. Because his singing fit nicely with the instrumental.To add to that\u2026\u2026\u2018His vocalization\u2026 is good?\u2019His vocalization was remarkably good. It wasn\u2019t just resonating, his nice voice color added more depth into it.\u201cWas he like this in the karaoke?\u201dThe writer thought of the singing she heard when she first met him, but she felt like it wasn\u2019t this good. If his singing was this good back then, she would have gotten a longer interview when she recruited him. And helped him choose his song.\u2018Does that mean he got this much better in 10 days?\u2019Regardless of the writer\u2019s shock, the song had passed its verse and entered the pre-chorus.That\u2019s why, I (\uadf8\ub798\uc11c \ub098)I have to celebrate myself (\ub098\ub294 \ub098\ub97c \uae30\ub150\ud574\uc57c \ud574)I can\u2019t forget that again (\ub2e4\uc2e0 \uc78a\uc9c0 \ub9d0\uc544\uc57c\ub9cc \ud574)Yes, remember (\uc790 \uae30\uc5b5\ud574)Until now (\uc9c0\uae08\uae4c\uc9c0)Even with the pitch rising up like an escalator, there wasn\u2019t a single flat note. There wasn\u2019t any heavy breathing either.At this point, something else took the writer\u2019s attention. Such as, the surprised expressions of the judges.Always managing to live through this day (\ud56d\uc0c1 \uc624\ub298\uc744 \uc0b4\uc544\ub0b8)This surprising miracle (\ub180\ub77c\uc6b4 \uae30\uc801\uc744)Don\u2019t forget it, don\u2019t erase it (\uc78a\uc9c0 \ub9c8, \uc9c0\uc6b0\uc9c0 \ub9c8)And let\u2019s celebrate (\uadf8\ub7ec\ub2c8 \ucd95\ud558\ud574)Celebrate this moment (\uc9c0\uae08\uc744 \uae30\ub150\ud574)That\u2019s the party in meAs if every day is a PARTY, Ooh- (\ub9e4\uc77c PARTY\uc778 \uac83\ucc98\ub7fc, Ooh-)Let\u2019s PARTYThe high note was stretched out further. It didn\u2019t even seem forced. As if he could still go one-octave higher, his high note was effortlessly clean.Rather than shouting wildly, the way he was speech-singing with a beautiful and calm tone, it was the right technique for the song.Now, the writer wanted to laugh with a smug smile.\u2018Right, this turns out to be good\u2026 He can totally be the main vocalist\u2026. Actually we were lacking vocalists, woah, hasn\u2019t this turned out to be great? My insight is really amazing. I just recruited him off the street, and yet I got someone this good.\u2019And the second verse came in.The melody was the same as in the first verse, but Park Moondae sang it with a complex different tempo and pulled it off cleanly.Passing the bridge, at the last chorus where the sign of a high note was coming, his voice pushed up higher without hesitation.The high note that gave thrills to one\u2019s back neck left a great feeling. It wasn\u2019t excessive, but it didn\u2019t sound careless either, it was an outstanding climax.Then he was speech-singing the first line from the first verse again, and the song ended.\u2026I, remember the me that I knew (...\ub09c, \ub0b4\uac00 \uc54c\uace0 \uc788\ub358 \ub098\ub97c \uae30\uc5b5\ud574)The contestant sang nicely until the last tone.Right as the instrumental ended, Park Moondae bowed. And he added in an absent minded manner.\u201c...Thank you for listening.\u201dA short silence passed. The writer clenched her pen.\u2018Right. Let\u2019s not throw him, let\u2019s keep him.\u2019When the lady was fixing Park Moondae\u2019s stance, the judges held the microphone up with excitement.\u201cWhoa, Moondae-ssi!!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou, yourself, know that you\u2019re good right!?\u201d\u201c...I practiced hard to sing it well.\u201dAnd the other judge added more comments in an instant.\u201cNo, this is something you\u2019re born with. You have the talent.\u201dHe was a choreographer popular for being blunt.He was smiling up to his eyes like he took a liking to the contestant.He said it in an over the top manner because this was a TV program, but it wasn\u2019t something that he didn\u2019t mean.Park Moondae hid his head down as he felt overjoyed inside.The judges continuously showered him with compliments.Especially the female singer who appeared here as the vocal coach, Mudie\u2019s eyes were shining and gave another praise.\u201cFirstly, your vocal color is very refreshing. And your vocalization is good too, so I can hear your vocal color more clearly.\u201d\u201cRight? It really felt like he was speaking next to my ears.\u201d\u201cTrue, true.\u201dThe sound of them agreeing kept pouring. And Mudie nodded and quickly said this.\u201cAlso, your voice doesn\u2019t seem to only suit one genre, this is a very important factor to be an idol. You don\u2019t have any bad singing habit too, I\u2019ll be looking forward to you in the future. Really.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cMoondae-ssi, you\u2019ve never been in an entertainment company before, right? Earlier you said you have no experience, looking here, there\u2019s really nothing in your record.\u201d\u201cYes. I have yet to\u2026\u201dAnd the young male judge said something. He was a popular idol whose group had lost 2 members in the contract renewal period not too long ago.\u201cThen you\u2019ve never taken any lesson in particular before?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cNothing at all? Not even an academy?\u201dPark Moondae shook his head in silence.The judge who asked that admired him with an expression mixed with a little suspicion. Then Mudie said again with a big smile.\u201cYeah, right, it could be better to wait for one big shot than joining a random entertainment company. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get a good offer from a good company!\u201d\u201cThank you for your words of encouragement.\u201dIt crossed to the writer\u2019s mind that Mudie\u2019s company was preparing to launch a new boy group.\u2018Right, she has shares in her company.\u2019And that lady looked at the contestant who was always politely bowing his head, yet didn\u2019t seem like he was deeply impressed.Then she looked again at the judges who were uniformly giving him compliments, she had a strange feeling.Somehow\u2026 it felt like she had fallen into his plan.Getting a talented contestant was surely a gain for the TV broadcast, but she felt displeased.As the writer rested her chin and looked at Park Moondae who was holding a hand microphone, she realized this.\u201cHe didn\u2019t quite dance for real!\u201dPark Moondae did show moves that were like dancing.However, because this song was not made for promotion, the moves were just like basic dance routines.When backup dancers properly followed a choreography, their movements would be composed of hands stretching out and feet moving following the beat.But in people\u2019s memory, they would remember the afterimage of the original performance that included the dancers.It would be easy to think the contestant\u2019s poor movements were just following those backup dancers, thinking \u2018because it was like that in the original performance\u2019.Especially when his singing was that freaking good!And this was a conceptual song from a top-tier idol, with just his vocal ability alone, he could avoid questions like \u2018Moondae-ssi, are you really aiming to become an idol?\u2019In conclusion, this was the best song to choose in Park Moondae\u2019s situation.\u2018This is something that\u2019s beyond having a good sense, it feels as if he\u2019s an experienced person\u2026..\u2019Somehow feeling deceived, the writer looked over Park Moondae with a dissatisfied look.And as if reading the writer\u2019s mind, one judge who was just watching the other judges gave compliments, held up the microphone.A girl group who became successful due to the popularity of a fancam of them, who were still nobodies then, performing acrobatics with a smile in the rain in monsoon. She was \u2018SaintU\u2019\u2019s Youngrin.\u201cThe level of your choreography was almost nothing, can you properly show us another dance?\u201dThe writer felt like clapping her hands.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2018All\u2019s good.\u2019It was worth singing this song continuously to level up until I was bored in the last few days.The result of putting all my points to my vocal skill, in my status window, the entry for vocal was now A-.It was the natural choice. For starters, in South Korea, a singer who couldn\u2019t sing would get cancelled, nevermind becoming an idol.Not being able to dance could be covered with practicing, but not being able to sing would be obvious in the pre-recording.Also, amongst the kids aspiring to become an idol, in general, there were less kids aiming to become main vocalist than main dancer.Which was why, if I could ascertain myself to be in the main vocalist position from the beginning, the chance of me getting a spot into the debuting group would be higher.Next would be how to select the arrangement song.It seemed like my approach was right; choosing a song that would give me significantly less negative feedback.The approach of filtering the song selection by predicting what the judges could criticize me based on my weaknesses and excluding all the songs that would lead that to happen.\u2018Why is your dance like that?\u2019- Exclude all the songs that have hardcore choreographies.\u2018You\u2019re almost not dancing at all?\u2019- Exclude ballads.\u2018You\u2019re good at singing. But it doesn\u2019t give the vibe of idols?\u2019- Exclude all songs except for idol songs.\u2018This song was impossible to be pulled off by only one person\u2019- Because I couldn\u2019t rearrange any song, rather than experimenting, just exclude all songs that were sung by more than 3 people.\u2018Well, I\u2019ve got to say it\u2019s not as good as the original singer.\u2019- Exclude all songs released within the last 3 years.Then, amongst all the songs left, I just chose a song that had the highest ranking on music charts.Hm, thinking about it again, that was a good approach.I thought I would be able to sneakily pass the evaluation just like this, but of course, there was at least one who didn\u2019t get washed up by the atmosphere.My eyes met the judge who was holding up the microphone.It was a face I recognized.She was the first idol that made me aware I could earn money by taking pictures of idols. Thanks to that, I covered my tuition fee for the second semester of my freshman year.\u2018That person, too, earned the hard-worker image from the acrobatics in the rain video and earned quite the buzz, so it was win-win for both of us\u2019But our meeting this time didn\u2019t seem like it would be win-win for both.\u201cI understand that you\u2019ve never received any training before. But since this is the first evaluation, shouldn\u2019t we check your basics too? As a contestant for an audition, you would have come prepared with a song.\u201dIt would be crazy if I replied \u2018I don\u2019t have anything prepared\u2019 here. That would be worse than keeping my mouth shut.\u201cYes. Then is it possible to use this song.\u201dOne staff member gestured at me to quickly come closer to him. I went up to him and told him the song I had thought of.The camera followed us and even filmed the staff member flinching.Looking at this, it seemed like I managed to prevent myself from getting edited out. It was worth it to put in the effort.And then the shooting site was filled with cheerful and exciting accompaniment.\u201c...!?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Liking you~ (\uc544, \ub098\ub3c4 \uadf8\ub798! \ub110 \uc88b\uc544\ud558\ub294\uac78~)Makes my heart race, this! feeling~ is like popcorn!

That lady was the only professional here.Soon, the part where even kids half my age could dance was coming out.POP! POP!You are my Popcorn~ (Oh Yeah!) (\ub10c \ub098\uc758 Popcorn~ (Oh Yeah!))My heart (\ub0b4 \ub9d8\uc744)CON CON CON CONYou control it~ (Control\ud574~)The song that was released 10 years ago, the chorus of MallangDalkom\u2019s <POP\u2606CON> hit my eardrums powerfully.So-called as a forbidden song during CSAT exams, this was the perpetrator that made students fail their listening exams due to its crazily addictive song and crack lyrics.For the record, I took my CSAT exam that year. And I couldn\u2019t retake it because I didn\u2019t have money.POP! POP!Popping Popcorn~ (Ooh~) (\ud130\uc9c0\ub294 Popcorn~ (Ooh~))It was so popular that all kinds of people uploaded dance covers of it, the difficulty was that easy.To put it simply, even primary school kids could dance it after practicing.If this was 10 years ago when the song was popular, I would have received criticisms. But right now, they would see it as a fond past memory along with gag, so I chose this song.Of course I was dancing my best with a straight face.Even if others looked at me as a gag, if I, the contestant, was snickering, I would become dislikable.I had to give the impression that I prepared this diligently to show how good I could dance.And in reality, I was trying my best. My level went up with just practicing this. I have achieved the accomplishments <First movement> and <10th movement>.Though it seemed like a mistake, seeing how much the judges were laughing hard and clapping at me\u2026. but I didn\u2019t know anymore. They could evaluate me however they wanted.I stopped dancing after finishing the pose at the end of the first verse.Short of breath, I bowed my head down. When I came back to my senses, I heard claps.\u201cThank you.\u201dYoungrin grabbed the microphone first, but the choreographer struck first.Just how much did he laugh that his eyes turned red. It seemed like he was in tears laughing.\u201cWhoa, shi\u2026.. I hadn\u2019t even dreamed of that song coming. Wasn\u2019t Moondae-ssi still 10 years old when POP\u2606CON was released? Did you perform that song for a talent show?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t like that, I performed this song because I am a fan of MallangDalkom sunbaenims.\u201d\u201cKeu-ha!\u201dTo add to this, MallangDalkom\u2019s latest album was released 4 years ago.Because their peak of popularity had already been a long time ago, a 20-year old saying he\u2019s a fan of them would look unordinary.But it wouldn\u2019t be a problem because they\u2019re still idols.Sure enough, the choreographer bursted out in laughter again.Next to him, Mudie muttered in delight.\u201cAh\u2026 He\u2019s cute~\u201d\u201cHe tried his best, it\u2019s important that he tried his best!\u201dThe male idol judge helped out.His doubtful expression from earlier when I said I had no former experience was totally gone.And finally, Youngrin opened her mouth.\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean you did well.\u201dI knew it.This would be the situation where the editors would include a close-up and a sound effect.And they would add a red caption that\u2019s three times bigger, saying \u201cDu-dung!\u201d.I waited for more commentary as I imagined how the program would be edited.\u201cFirstly, I can see that you\u2019re not skillful at dancing from the way you move your body. Right now, even if you get a nice evaluation by raising up the mood, the missions from now on will be challenging.\u201d\u201cI will be prepared for them.\u201dNot me, but the status window would.Holding back my extra remarks, Youngrin nodded her head gravely.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dAnd she loosened her face.\u201c...Anyway, I can see that you\u2019ve put your efforts into this. Well done.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dI felt like I had said \u2018thank you\u2019 10 times today. Would it be this frequent too in the future.As I was estimating that, the judges were discussing their evaluations without holding the microphones so I couldn\u2019t hear it.At this point, there was one more evil system in this program.The contestants would be ranked between 1st to 77th place in this first evaluation. And everyone was assigned to sit based on the rank they were given.Participants had to sit there right after the evaluation, so it was only a temporary rank.If the rank was filled and the next contestant performed better, everyone else\u2019s rank would get pushed down and they had to give up their seat.The lower ranks would get pushed down one rank at a time, then they would film the one who sat on the last rank and cried. That was one of the selling points of this program.Thankfully, it seemed like I wouldn\u2019t have to experience that.My rank.. should be at around 24th place.\u201cPark Moondae-gun\u2019s rank is 17th place!\u201dThey purposefully wanted to shoot a scene where I would get pushed down, so they put me around 5 rank higher. My actual rank should be similar to my prediction.\u2018Because I raised the mood, it seemed like they increased my rank by 4-5 places\u2019As the time passed, if these judges got their eyes cleaned, maybe I would have to give up my seat repeatedly to middle and high schoolers.It was slightly funny that I was bowing my head repeatedly while thinking about it sourly.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cI will teach you more intensely, so rank higher next time.\u201dThe choreographer said that with a mischievous smile. His attitude towards me would change right away if I didn\u2019t get better, but I had the status window in me.\u2018I hope I could get a scene where that choreographer would feel touched by me.\u2019I bowed my head once again and headed myself to the set where the seats were placed.The higher you ranked, the seat became more luxurious and comfortable. You could feel the superficially big difference.The 17th place seat I was sitting on was a leather chair that a corporate executive would sit on.Once I sat down, I greeted the contestant who was sitting across from the 15th place. With his gentle look, he looked like Park Moondae\u2019s age.\u201cHello~\u201d\u201cHello.\u201d\u201cYour singing was very good!\u201d\u201cThank you. You too, seemed like you did well.\u201d\u201cYeah? Ahaha!\u201dI couldn\u2019t answer him because I didn\u2019t see the stage properly, but I managed to tell him that it seemed like it because of his ranking.As the contestant laughed out loud, he pointed at the name tag on his chest.\u201cMy name is Lee Sejin!\u201d\u201c.....!\u201dI almost groaned out. I tried my best to reply with a poker face.\u201cI am Park Moondae. Nice to meet you.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you too.\u201dEnding the conversation naturally, I turned my head to the front and with a nice timing, the next contestant had come up to the stage. But I was thinking of the name I just heard.Lee Sejin.That name was one of the contestants that debuted through this program. So should I say he was a person who I knew would get appointed to win.But there was a problem.That guy, one year after this program ended, would be in a drug scandal. And he was the distributor too.I was sure I saw that name in the 9pm news at a rice soup restaurant near my one-room.[Lee Sejin from \u2018Idol Joint-Stock Company\u2019 arrested on suspicion of distributing drugs.]\u2026Let\u2019s not talk to him in the future.Timing was important for cutting-off people. Now, let\u2019s use this time to check my status window.[Name: Park Moondae (Ryu Gunwoo)]Level : 5Title : NoneVocal : A-Dance : DVisual : C+Charm : CAttribute : Limitless potential!Status effect: Debut or diePoint left : 1First of all, I received a point from leveling up in my stage just now. It seemed like it was from the accomplishment <First performance>.And it seemed like my dance and charm stats were calculated from the performance just now.When I was practicing, it was still not activated. Maybe it needed to be formally recognized to be calculated? I didn\u2019t know the clear criteria for this.Anyway, I felt it vaguely when I was practicing\u2026 Even if the charm is somewhat alright, for dance, I guessed \u2018Park Moondae\u2019 really had no talent for it.If the dance was D, it was probably a similar level to an average person.In the future, I would have to invest 2 or 3 points in dance to actually be able to do it.On another hand, I could see more possibilities with the visual stat in the status window. I didn\u2019t invest any point in it, but as I put more care into my appearance, the level went up on its own.This meant I could increase my abilities through the effects of my status window levelling up and other stuff too. This was quite an optimistic system.And lastly, an unusual pop-up appeared. A small one just right next to the status window.[Successful performance!]You have impressed the majority of people!: Common attribute slots \u261c Click!\u2018Another weird one has appeared.\u2019But there were words like \u2018Success\u2019 and \u2018Impressed\u2019 so the nuance of it being a reward was big.As I pretended to touch my head, I clicked on the slots. And a fascinating thing appeared.There was a gray slot machine. Next to the lever that had already been pulled down, a slot was spinning.And the spinning was getting slower. Soon enough I would even be able to slightly check the contents in the slots.Several of the slots were copper and most of the rest were gray.[Strong heart][Erasure of embarrassments][Crocodile tears][Sleeping is only after you die][Look at me!][... \u2026]\u201c.....\u201dNo, I meant, it\u2019s good that I could guess what kind of attribute it was from just looking at the titles\u2026. But the titles sounded too crude.I looked at the slot machine with low anticipation. Anyhow, it was going to stop soon.Dung-dung\u2026 Dung!Confettis popped out from the slot machine.It stopped at a copper slot.[Attribute: \u2018Sleeping is only after you die (D)\u2019 acquired!]When this attribute is in activation, you won\u2019t become tired even if you don\u2019t sleep.At 00:01 ~ 00:04, the acceleration of your experience will get a 30% bonusThis lasts for a week, one-time use.\u201c.....!\u201dOutside of my expectations, I got an attribute that looked very useful. Although the title\u2026 was like that.But this \u2018slots\u2019, it really meant slots. An essential feature in luck-based and doomed-to-fail games appeared too, this was getting fun.I confirmed that my attribute stat in the lowest part of my status window now had \u2018Sleeping is only after you die (Non-activated)\u2019 in it. Let\u2019s think about when it would be the most effective to use.\u201cContestant Kang Minjo ranks in\u2026 56th place!\u201dThe evaluation continued to proceed.There was still no debuting member that came out yet other than the suspicious druggie next to me.I watched the next participant coming up the stage.A participant with long arms and legs and slender build entered the stage.Seeing as he was alone, he must be a participant with no connections.The participants who were seated on their respective ranks made a lot of buzz. It definitely wasn\u2019t because he came up to the stage alone.\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cAmazing.\u201dIt was because this participant was really too handsome. I could even hear the voices of the judges from below admiring him.\u201cYou look like a deer~\u201dIn my opinion, with a face like that, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about not being able to debut.It\u2019s almost like he actually didn\u2019t need to participate in an idol survival program. Surely he would get to do something after this program.But when I saw the name tag on his chest, it was a name I didn\u2019t recognize.[Seon Ahyun]If he couldn\u2019t debut with that face, he must be really talentless. He was more handsome than most of the currently active idols that I took pictures and videos of.Hm, if I converted his stats like the status window\u2026 other than visual, his other abilities must be at F ~ D.\u2018If only I could see others\u2019 status windows, I would be able to know it for sure.\u2019Surprisingly, the moment I thought about that, a window really appeared next to the participant.\u201c...!\u201dSo I could see others\u2019 windows too.[Name: Seon Ahyun]Vocal : B- (A)Dance : A (EX)Visual : A+ (S+)Charm : B (A+)Attribute : Resilience (Not activated)!Status effect: Lack of self-esteemWhat a spectacular status window. I would expect him to get at least 10th place in this evaluation.However, the last line stood out to me.[Status effect: Lack of self-esteem]With that face? It would make more sense if he had arrogance.Anyway, being able to check others\u2019 status windows was a great benefit. If I were in a pinch, as long as I made it into an entertainment company, I supposed I wouldn\u2019t have to starve to death.As I looked at the stats with curiosity, I heard the MC\u2019s voice.\u201cOkay, participant, please introduce yourself!\u201dThen, Seon Ahyun grabbed the microphone.The hand that was holding the microphone was shaking tremendously.\u201cAh, He, Hello\u2026.\u201d\u201c...!\u201dHe didn\u2019t accidentally stutter because he was nervous. His awkward speech was caused by him feeling out of place.It was a clear symptom of stuttering impediment.And I could feel that he was really conscious of his own speech impediment. Should I say I could notice his overwhelming anxiety and shame.This must be the reason for his status window. I was immediately convinced of this participant, Seon Ahyun\u2019s status window.But with that face and those talents, he could present his stuttering as his characteristic. Why couldn\u2019t he debut?The problem must be with the status effect \u2018Lack of self-esteem\u2019. Could I know more\u2026[Lack of self-esteem]: Despising oneselfAll abilities are decreased by two levels.\u201c...!\u201dSuddenly, another pop-up appeared again. I didn\u2019t expect that I could check the details by only thinking about it.\u2018How very useful.\u2019I should check the remaining days in my status effect again.This was ironic, but I was a bit surprised that the content of his status effect was more extreme than I thought.In games, when we got these kinds of debuffs, we would just give up and restart. But this was a life game that couldn\u2019t be reset, that guy must be fairly annoyed with this too.\u201cAhyun-gun, do you perhaps.. have some trouble while speaking?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I, When I\u2026 was small, I got into an accident\u2026.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dHe started to sell his backstory on the stage.To be precise, Seon Ahyun seemed to be explaining his condition, but the producer team would try their best to make it as if he was selling his backstory.Contrived reactions from participants around me would be included in the teaser too.They would definitely include the participants nodding their head with a sad and regrettable expression in the reaction cuts.Because they were saying these kinds of lines too.\u201cPoor him\u2026\u201dIn a sensitive case like this, they really shouldn\u2019t be showing that kind of reaction.With their editing, on the contrary, some people would think \u2018That kind of reaction is also an assault\u2019.I just looked at the front with a casual expression of \u2018I see\u2019.After giving some banal encouraging words, the judges carefully requested him to perform.\u201cThen Ahyun-gun, can we see your performance?\u201d\u201cYes, yes\u2026.\u201dHis performance was not that bad. Overall, it was a stage everyone would see favorably.Which meant, if his status window was correct, that participant did worse compared to his actual abilities.\u201cSeon Ahyun-gun ranks in 18th place!\u201dWithout a strong mentality and strategy, this situation would have happened. To think that he got a lower rank than me, even with that status window.Anyway, they probably could feel that his abilities were good or they didn\u2019t want to give negative remarks, so his evaluation was good.\u201cYou did well~\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be looking forward to you in the future.\u201dThe judges each left their heartwarming remarks. One even gave a thumbs up.But Seon Ahyun\u2019s face was gloomy as he bowed deeply.He tried his best to brighten up his expression and walked out of the stage. Following the MC\u2019s announcement, he went to sit next to me.\u201c......\u201dThis should be where we exchange our greetings\u2026.Seon Ahyun stole a glance at my seat but didn\u2019t say a word.I shouldn\u2019t create a scene where I would be seen as ignoring him.But it was such a hassle to start talking first. So I just bowed my head towards his side.Seon Ahyun was surprised and bowed his head back continuously.\u201cThe next participants to receive their evaluations are 5 people! Choi Jinsu-gun, Hong Seong-gun\u2026.\u201dCounting the remaining participants in my head, I sighed weakly.There was still a long way to go.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Debut or DieCH 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHow tiring.It was packed with eyes.These ignorant bastards kept participants off the set while the 77 people were being judged.Even during breaks they would divide us into groups and only let us go out to the bathroom.It was probably because it was inconvenient to try and manage dozens of energetic teens, but thanks to this my patience was running out.Thanks to being able to see all the perspectives due to the status window I could see that all the stages were quite boring.I had watched an overwhelming amount of idol performances when I went to film during events, so I couldn\u2019t have been less impressed by the trainee\u2019s performances.Of course, there were 1 or 2 that felt a bit impressive.I stared intently at the two people that sat on the overly fancy sofa.They were currently in first and second place. They came from the same famous agency so they definitely did well, their status windows were also gorgeous.Both of them had debuted with one of them being 1st place.If I stuck to those guys the chance of debuting would definitely be higher\u2026 It felt like a long time ago when I thought of which teenage group I should hang out around 10 years ago.Let\u2019s just think about it again when the time to form teams comes.And fortunately the evaluation was coming to an end.\u201cRyu Cheongwoo, you are\u2026 9th place!\u201dThere we go. The last contestant squeezed into the top rankings which was already packed. Thanks to this situation, my ranking was now\u2026 22nd.I had done a pretty great job.In fact, when I evaluated the people who did better than me\u2026 seven people made it to the cut.I would have to manage well in the future so my overestimation of self wouldn\u2019t show.\u201cThank you!\u201dThe former leader of the national archery team said with a gentle impression and left the stage with a grin.I heard that he had won a gold medal in the olympic team event but I wasn\u2019t so sure, I only knew that he was one of the people that debuted.Anyways, since he didn\u2019t have to go to the army he was a talent that would be wanted by the agency.Then.Come to think of it, Me\u2026 Did I have to go to the army?In the past I had received a Grade 4 for my body and had to drop out for community service at the city hall.The shooting ended just before the scary topic I never thought of took over my mind.\u201cCut! Thank you all for your hard work. Participants will be on their way right away~\u201d\u201cClap~\u201dApplauses and replies came from all around.My head felt dizzy as I moved following the guidance of the staff.As soon as the shooting was over I had to check whether or not \u2018Park Moondae\u2019 was listed.\u201cMake sure to get your rank checked~You can find them on the board!\u201dThe accommodation was a 10-minute-walk away from the set. After the great success of season 1 It was a newly built dormitory at the mountain site behind the broadcasting station.However, we still used transportation to get there, the reason was obvious.They were trying to get a cut for the broadcast.The method of transportation would be different depending on people\u2019s ranks.\u201cParticipants! If you are within the top 10 please come this way~\u201d\u201cHey, It\u2019s a limousine!\u201d\u201cWow~ That\u2019s really good!\u201d\u201cAwesome.\u201dBehind the top ranked participants that were boarding the black limousine with their thumbs up at the camera, the lower ranked participants could be seen.People who placed between 51-77th moved by foot.They tried to appear positive and humorous, but I could see them trying to hold back their tears.Even the cameras obsessively followed those participants.It looked like they were stimulated by their misfortune.Frankly, it was a bit gross.\u201cOh, that good?\u201dFor ranks 11th to 25th, a premium bus was waiting.Lee Sejin smiled and boarded the bus first.I wanted to avoid the unfortunate accident of the two of us sitting together so I purposefully waited a bit before boarding.Then someone hurriedly followed behind to get on the bus and then hesitantly sat next to me.It was Seon Ahyun.\u201c\u2026?\u201dWhy was he\u2026?Well, what\u2019s done was done. Not to mention the quietness was nice.***The accommodations quickly arrived. And just like last season each rank used a different floor.This similar castle system would continue until the team missions started.Spacious 5-person-rooms were assigned for ranks 11-25. Because I was pushed down by 5 people I managed to avoid being roomed with Lee Sejin who was in 20th place. I was lucky.\u201cWow~ Me! I want this bed!\u201dAs soon as someone entered the room that consisted of 2 bunk beds and one single bed, he immediately jumped into the single bed intentionally.I guess he wanted to look naughty and cheerful in front of the camera.I moderately grabbed the bottom of the bunk bed and then once again, Seon Ahyun put his luggage on the bed above mine.\u201c\u2026\u201dHe looked down and bowed his head. Somehow it felt as if I was bringing a child with me\u2026After that, he changed into the training clothes and followed me.Looking at it now, it seemed like a lot of people who aspired to be idols were somewhat burdensome. So someone quieter was more comfortable.I didn\u2019t think it would be a problem right now so I let him do as he pleased.However, I don\u2019t think we should be close enough that we choose the same team because just a small argument could cause me to be criticized for my personality.\u201cEveryone will earnestly start training from now on! It will be called~ Customized movement class!\u201dThe MC introduced the class that everyone already knew about in an exaggerated manner.\u201cCurrently everyone has been graded on Vocals and Dancing based on the scores they received from the judges!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cEach class is divided into upper, middle, and lower levels, and there is individual training provided for each level to help you improve your performance.\u201dUp to this point it was similar to past seasons. But the problem was what came next.\u201cAlso you can change classes in real time anytime!\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt all depends on your dedication and hard work!\u201dFor example, in \u2018intermediate vocal\u2019 if you suddenly swallowed a sponge and did well, you would be put on \u2018advanced vocal\u2019 from then on.Of course, that also meant that if you didn\u2019t do well your class level would drop.After keeping this up for 10 days the final grade would be determined through individual judging of the theme song.This meant that they would burn down the mentality of these children without mercy to get enough footage.\u201cThis badge is for\u2026 participant Park Moondae!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs expected, I had gotten \u2018Advanced Vocal\u2019 and \u2018Beginner Dance\u2019.It felt a bit awkward when I wore a golden badge for vocal and a dark bronze badge for dance on my shoulders.The badges were so exaggerated so it was obvious that they looked cheap.For your information, there were some cases where badges were not provided at all.On the internet this situation was called \u2018absolutely worthless people\u2019.\u00a0(The actual word used here is a korean slang that has that meaning)\u201cFor those without badges\u2026 this means you don\u2019t belong to any class. You will take classes alongside beginner level but you will also receive a special overnight training.\u201dTo be honest, it was more advantageous to receive more camera time instead of just lower class. That way you could create a story.However, once you became an involved party you would have a different opinion.A good example was the former child actor whose hands were shaking over there.I heard that he took a part in a thriller movie that was watched by over 10 million people 10 years ago, but he kept saying he couldn\u2019t continue due to unfortunate circumstances.The participant wasn\u2019t put in a class for dance and he was also in a low class for vocals. In the status window I could see that each grade was F and D.He was probably aiming to make a comeback thanks to this broadcast instead of being an idol himself.The only surprising thing was that his name was also \u2018Lee Sejin\u2019.I didn\u2019t know there was another party that shared the same name, though of course the one that debuted was the other one.Why was I sure that he wasn\u2019t the Lee Sejin that debuted? Because just by looking at him he seemed like a tile that would be used to make a hot topic in the beginning but then get thrown away.And to add to that, he openly expressed his anger.\u201cThe PD is gonna love it.\u201dSoon after all the badges got distributed the huge screen lit up.\u201cNow, it\u2019s time to reveal the song you will be practicing. Over the next 10 days! You will do your best to master this song and present it to the shareholders of <Idol Joint-Stock Company>!\u201dIt was a song that would be played all around until next year. Even me who had quit social media remembered the chorus and choreography for it.It wasn\u2019t at the level of <POP\u2606CON> but it was still worth following.\u201cThe song that will be premiered this season\u2026 <Shining Star>!\u201dAlongside its catchy beat, the lyrics that were moderately overwhelming and bearable began to flow out.\u2013 As I stand in the stage you might not know me yetI will come to you like the spark of STARLIGHT that flashes inside meA dancer appeared on the screen showcasing the choreo. There were shouts and subtle groans coming from here and there.I realized it too.The difficulty of this chorus was a fake one.For the sake of popularity it was difficult to follow and the intro was terribly messy.The first verse went by before I could even think of memorising it. And in the blink of an eye the chorus started.\u2013 The one who shines on this stage today is me!Yes, the Shining Star you will create today is me!Finally waking up to shine. Watch this moment.I shine the brightest!Even \u2018that choreography\u2019 in the chorus looked like it was made for us to fall while doing it.Right away, I made up my mind.\u201cStatus Window.\u201dLet\u2019s just\u2026 not sleep.\u201c\u2026Activate \u2018Sleeping is only after you die\u2019.\u201d***Calories. I had to properly count calories well.What that means is I should have been aware that I burned calories a lot as long as I didn\u2019t sleep. On the first night when I stayed up all night and felt hungry it was really annoying.\u201cT-T-This\u2026 would you like some.\u201dAnd Seon Ahyun gave me some chocolate bar. I felt so grateful that I had spoken informally.He was the same age as Park Moondae. Talking to such a young person made me feel energised.For the next few days, I ate 3 meals a day and tried putting as much food in my mouth as possible. The rice\u2026 tasted like a jjambap, but it was good and there wasn\u2019t a limit to the amount I could eat.\u00a0(jjambap = some sort of military meal)On the second to last day.I finally memorised all the choreography. From beginning until the end.Being able to spend the whole night practicing without feeling fatigue had definitely helped.In addition I managed to level up several times.[Name: Park Moondae (Ryu Geonwoo)]Level: 7Title: NoneVocal: A-Dance: DVisual: C+Talent: CAttribute: Infinite potential, Sleeping is only after you die (D)!Status Abnormality: Debut or DieRemaining Points: DIt was fortunate that there were quite a few hundred achievements up to 500.But I didn\u2019t distribute the points on purpose.If I did it right now It wouldn\u2019t have much impact.\u2018Until right now\u2026 5 people.\u20195 people had been promoted from beginner level dance to Intermediate.There were very few people that had dramatically improved their skills after only a few days of training. So my guess was that most of them failed the first evolution then found their true strength.If they were included here there was a high possibility that they would be tied up and passed up.Then there was no point in upgrading. I had to show a more dramatic improvement in my skills.Since I even had enough scenes to use.That\u2019s because I was scolded by the choreographer from the very first day.\u2013Again!-Foot, bend your left foot!-Why are you swinging your arms? Hold them up!On the first day, as soon as the classes had begun the choreographer mercilessly scolded the participants from all around.Thanks to that the atmosphere had become heavier and heavier as if we were mourning.At the end of the class the choreographer called in me and gave me a talk.-Moondae-Yes.-If you keep working on the choreography like this the next evaluation will be nothing.-\u2026I wasn\u2019t particularly bad at this class.In the first place, this was a \u2018beginners\u2019 class. If I had to pick I would be average. It was at the level where ordinary people who weren\u2019t too bad at dancing worked at.But I was the first person to rank high. So it was a matter of expectations.Sure enough, the lines he said were similar to last season.-No, I am sure of it too. I gave you the wrong rank. I don\u2019t think you were capable of receiving that rank in the first place.That was the right answer. Perhaps he did this for the entertainment of the broadcast or himself.-Let\u2019s do it properly, okay? Fix your mindset.-Yes.Unless you were really lucky and talented, most people wouldn\u2019t suddenly develop basic skills after just a few days of training.But I could, so I just nodded my head as if I made up my mind.Criticism without any advice didn\u2019t do anything. However what was important is that it looked like something that could be hurtful in the eyes of the others.I had to live through these provocative things even though it was a waste.So I had to wait.\u201cThank you for your hard work!\u201d\u201cYeah, don\u2019t give up.\u201dThe choreographer nodded his head as encouragement for the participants that were drenched in sweat.And after making sure that the staff were organising the cameras, he checked his phone and left.That was the end of the morning dance class.Now, it was time for vocal after a meal.For lunch there was Bulgogi and seaweed soup.I ate as much as I could. And after a simple shower I went to the vocal class by myself.Come to think, I have something to confess.\u201cThen I\u2019ll call Moondae~\u201dFor vocals I ate raw.\u00a0(Ate raw = done without effort)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So there were also lots of good words for the training as well.But of course that didn\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t moments when she was angry.\u201cWongil, that\u2019s not it\u2026 Ha.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe participant that had missed the same move for the 5th day in a row silently bowed his head.From the looks of it he was trying to hide his irritation instead of guilt, but that didn\u2019t matter.The important thing was that even for a good teacher, if someone made so many mistakes it would be hard to hide the one they favor.And here\u2019s the main culprit.\u201cMoondae, would you like to sing this part?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs I walked to the area the trainer was pointing at, the accompaniment was played by an electric piano. I started singing the pre-chorus alongside the accompaniment.\u201cI draw the future like a shooting star~\u201dAs the trainer nodded at the clear sound and precise beat, the scolded participant nervously rubbed his feet.Yes, the flower bed was the reason that I sang this theme song so well from the beginning.\u00a0(I am guessing flower bed refers to the fact that he already knew the song due to its popularity in the past.)It was inevitable that the starting point would be different for people who already knew the song and for those that didn\u2019t.Even though instead of the demo the version I listened to was the finished version it would be okay to just go from what I remembered.Besides, my voice fits perfectly into this song. The trainer liked the way I sang it because it didn\u2019t feel dirty.And there were some who were still gossiping as they watched the pleased Mudi.\u201c\u2026He\u2019s really good at it.\u201d\u201cYeah\u201dThe other guys would suffer because of the expectation that was created by the ordinary participant even though they are already high in an standard advanced class.Especially if they were a participant whose strong point was only vocals.According to the first evaluation, there were two participants with A-level vocals this season. And both with dance below grade C. Everyone, including me, was in a difficult situation.And that \u201cChoi Wongil\u201d contestant, who was currently being scolded, was one of the two A-levels.The funny thing is, this is the guy who I thought was a middle school student that tried to identify me before shooting. But he was not a middle school student, instead he was a freshman in high school.Anyway, he deserved to be angry because he had been hearing the same thing from his trainer for several days at an age when he is self-conscious.As soon as he met him, he was compared to the person he had ignored.\u201cRight!\u201dAs soon as my pre-chorus part was over, the trainer tapped the keyboard as if he was feeling refreshed. Choi Wongil did not raise his head despite the light hitting sound.\u201cWongil, do you know what to call this place?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t think he would make this many mistakes based on his ability. After he cleared the whole song on the first day, he constantly quarreled, and eventually his mind had shattered.Let\u2019s see, on the first day, I think it went like this.-Wow, I\u2019m glad you got compliments for your singing. You have to come up quickly from the lower ranks of the dance class!-You are a bit amateurish, so I think that pure image fits the song well.He vaguely said words that touched people\u2019s nerves. It was a subtle nuance in a way that the opponent would be treated as an asshole if he got angry.Besides, it was all said after the microphone man.But in the end, I could not bear being pissed of this much\u2026-You\u2019re very lucky. I envy you. It is the most important factor in the entertainment industry. It would have been nice if you could dance by luck. But still, hwaiting!-I think it\u2019s right to have a lucky person on top of someone who works hard. Most of these people are desperate and put their lives on the line. But no matter how you participate you get such good reviews.It had reached this level.Now, it was becoming embarrassing to be ignored after openly arguing. However, it was inevitable since he can\u2019t do what he knows on purpose.You don\u2019t know, but this side also had life and death at stake\u201cCalm down, don\u2019t be too nervous and let\u2019s try again.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dChoi Wongil started singing again with great effort and made yet another mistake.It\u2019s unfortunate.I was praised by the trainer until the vocal class ended that day which caused me to get sharp glares from some people, including Choi Won-gil.It had been a long time since I had been judged at such a rank, so I was tired, but it wasn\u2019t bad. If it was real, there would probably be no such checks.As the last day of training came both classes stayed the same, and the achievements I had been gaining through training piled up.On the morning of the last day, participants of the advanced vocal class recorded a song.Either way, they would go in groups and their names wouldn\u2019t be specified, so it wouldn\u2019t mean much.Let\u2019s focus in the afternoon instead.It was the long-awaited evaluation time.* * *The lights on the set turned on.\u201cHow have you all been?\u201d\u201cOh, it was hard!\u201d\u201cI was just\u2026 tired, so I slept soundly.\u201d\u201cBecause you teached too hard?\u201d\u201cYeah! Oh, today should be worthwhile.\u201dThe judges sat around the chairs and gave each other appropriate greetings.They had already finished greetings in the waiting room in the morning, but it was to show a conversation for the opening scene for the broadcast.The set we entered and sat in was a room decorated in the style of many-to-one interview rooms.It was a recycled set from last season, and special effects were prepared.The judges that were asked to show off as much reaction as possible in advance pretended not to know and spoke naturally.\u201cIt\u2019s totally\u2026 It seems like it. I think we are going to have an important interview.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an important interview~ A grade interview!\u201d\u201cIs this an interview for joining the Idol Joint-Stock Company?\u201dAs soon as the judges finished speaking, the lights on the desk they sat in front of turned on.\u201cWow!\u201dIn colorful cursive writing \u201cSHINE YOUR STAR\u201d flashed on the desk.This season\u2019s catch-price came to a head and judges began to applaud as they had done in other seasons.But this time, to their surprise, the walls began to move.\u201cHuh?!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this!\u201dThe wall around the interview room set started going down to the floor alongside the skillful reactions given by the judges. Then the wall disappeared and the entire set that was open wide revealed.Behind the judges the voices of the MC rang loudly, causing them to turn their heads.\u201cThe new Idol Joint-stock Company re-listing! The first obstacle is\u2026 Full public evaluation!\u201d\u201cWow!\u201dThe area that was behind the judges was audience seats arranged like an open-air tether and the front seats of the audience were filled with participants.The participants who thought they were just sitting in temporary waiting seats looked surprised and the appearance of a professional MC was displayed.\u201cThe 77 participants who practiced the same song will evaluate each other as the audience!\u201dIn fact, even during the first evaluation the participants were allowed to see each other\u2019s performances.However, they weren\u2019t aware that they would openly evaluate those who practiced the same song within the same period.That was because until the last room people would enter the practice room by themselves and receive an individual evaluation.\u201cRatings will go according to the ranking, but we\u2019re going in the opposite order!\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201c77th place, Chu Seonggu-gun, please come forward!\u201dThe participant who was named staggered onto the stage as if half-dead. Sympathetic gazes and whispers poured out but Park Moondae remained silent.It was because he knew that sympathetic looks could be edited to look deceptive like with Seon Ahyun\u2019s first evaluation.It was a feeling that came from the experience of regularly searching for idol communities to set a price for filming data.\u201cYes, thank you for your hard work.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you\u2026\u201dNaturally, the 77th-ranked participant missed most of the first verse and completely ruined the evaluation.\u201c\u2026\u201dIn a chilly and uneasy atmosphere, participants coming next and the ones next in order would join the stage halfway.After sending about five or six people like that, the judges couldn\u2019t hide the discomfort in their faces.It was a cruel and straightforward order arrangement.However, the production team had nothing to lose.\u2018If you can\u2019t do it anyway, even if it\u2019s for a provocative cut, they have to pay for the appearance fee.\u2019They were written as a throwaway.And it was also to shed more light on it.Among the lower ranks, he possessed the mental power to pull off the stage even in a situation where his mind was collapsing.Or participants who showed significant growth in this short period of time.Some calculated that those who were noticeably handsome or well-known prior among the terrible participants wouldn\u2019t feel concerned because they didn\u2019t attract attention with their skills.Interestingly, there were participants who satisfied both the former and the latter.\u201cParticipant Lee Sejin, you must have worked hard.\u201d\u201cGreat job!\u201d\u201cH-huh, Hyuk\u2026 Thank you, sir.\u201dIt was Lee Sejin, the former child actor. Even though he could barely breathe with his red face, he finished the song until the end without missing a beat.It wasn\u2019t enough and awkward to describe it as \u2018digested\u2019.However, it looked much better compared to the participants of similar numbers that went on the stage.Park Moondae had a brief doubt.\u2018Is he the Lee Sejin that debuted?\u2019Of course, it was impossible to guarantee, so he immediately concluded the idea by putting the participant on a watch list.\u2018I should stay away from drug dealers.\u2019Then the boring middle class evaluation followed.The skills of the participants gradually improved, and there were some that stood out from time to time.But listening to the same song more than 40 times made it hard not to get tired of it.After the terrible atmosphere from the beginning subsided, everyone started to show off their skills, so the judges slowly regained their peace and began to feel bored.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dAround the time when that boredom peaked, it was Park Moondae\u2019s turn.Seon Ahyun raised his fist towards Park Moondae with a blank face. It was a grim expression.He had just finished his evaluation right before and managed to digest the song well.\u201cH-Hwa\u2026 Hwaiting.\u201d\u201c\u2026? Huh, yes.\u201dWhy was he suddenly friendly?Park Moondae was puzzled, but politely returned the greetings with his mouth. It was a triumph of social consciousness.I slowly walked up onto the stage. It was an unfamiliar feeling and my head felt slightly heated with a sense of elevation.\u201cNo.22 Park Moondae-gun!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe judges as a whole were rude.\u2018I can sing well, but I can\u2019t dance.\u2019The choreographer, whose expectations for Park Moon-dae had disappeared after a few days of struggle, thought bluntly.\u2018It\u2019s getting annoying.\u2019\u201cStart the evaluation.\u201dThe boring prelude started playing.Park Moondae began the first move. It was a big move by turning the body and pulling both arms\u201c\u2026?\u201dThe first person that felt the difference was the choreographer.\u2018Is this line different?\u2019Until the last face-to-face class just two days ago, Park Moondae had no \u201cdance line.\u201dThe sense of being able to match the point of connection and disconnection, the point of giving and losing strength.If that is the standard that divided dance and rhythm, Park Moondae\u2019s movement was rhythm.He was sure it was\u2026\u2018Why\u2026 are you so good at dancing?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Debut or DieCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayStrictly speaking, Park Moondae\u2019s dance wasn\u2019t that admirable. It would be good to point out that if he participated in a group dance, It wouldn\u2019t particularly stand out.But, that also meant that it gave off enough pleasure to the people watching that it had the potential to be a part of a group.\u2018Even if It\u2019s just the debut song right now\u2026\u2019He didn\u2019t think he would be too pushed out by the others. It was an incredible development!The choreographer felt slightly agitated at the unexpected situation, but soon calmed down.\u2018You can\u2019t suddenly have a talent you didn\u2019t have in two days.\u2019So, if he had used his brain a little, he would have probably tried to make an impact at the beginning for the first introduction.\u2018He will go back to being off rhythm in a bit\u2026\u2019\u201c\u2026\u201dBut he didn\u2019t go back.Park Moondae stayed at the same level he started in as he entered the chorus part.No, on the contrary he was able to control his speed better in the chorus.Unlike most of the beginner level participants he didn\u2019t flinch his limbs. It didn\u2019t roughly crush around the joints, but it definitely caught the angle.-The one who shines on this stage today\u2026 is me!In addition, he sang honestly without missing or omitting a single part of the song.The technique was lacking, but it was clean and resonant, without any deviants or flats.Next to the choreographer, the judge Mudi lightly tapped on the pen.It looked like she was doing it without realising which meant she probably liked the performance a lot.Park Moondae was the best among the participants so far, even though his ears were not well-versed in vocals.-Look, at this moment\u2026 I shine the brightest!No, it was very great.A clear sound that echoed throughout the ears.\u2018How much effort did the outsider have to put in to keep singing like that while keeping up with the dance?\u2019The choreographer casually thought about it.He treated those who were \u2018good, promising, and had good potential\u2019 with clear distinction from those who didn\u2019t.And now in the choreographer\u2019s own inner world Park Moondae\u2019s rating which was low because of his lack of talent in dancing had been re-adjusted.\u2018Since his strength is vocals he has been focusing more on learning the choreography so he can dance more stably.\u2019However, the sense of discomfort did not go away.\u2018\u2026It\u2019s hard to suddenly become a dancer in two days without a reason.\u2019In the meantime, Park Moondae finished the song without losing his tempo and strength until the end of the second verse.The seats of the judges were silent.Apart from his doubts he suddenly felt a sense of positivity on his head.It was praise-worthy.\u201cHaa-ha, thank you.\u201dImmediately after the song was over, Park Moondae felt so hot, he seemed to have exhausted his stamina and was breathing heavily.Instead of the brazenness of the first evaluation where he boldly selected songs without a change in expression, he had a face full of enthusiasm.Ah\u2026 A face that makes it feel like he had done his best.Such a gap made the viewer feel like crying for no reason.Still, next to the choreographer, the look in Mudi\u2019s eyes made it seem like she was ready to pour out compliments.The choreographer guessed that the other judges might do the same though perhaps to a lesser extent.However, there was no one who could bring this impact on the air as much as he did. Because he was the one who changed the dance class within half a month.So, the choreographer deliberately turned a blind eye to the staff\u2019s tacit perception to give Young-rin the first evaluation.He began by opening his mouth to the microphone.\u201cMoondae.\u201d\u201cHaaa\u2026 yes.\u201d\u201cGood job.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was a simple compliment yet certain.Instead of answering, Park Moondae smiled.It was a smile that gave him the image of being mischievous unlike the silent participant he used to be for half a month.***As expected, a good twist won the favor.There was no way a formula like this wouldn\u2019t work on an idol survival program.Even though I was out of breath and felt as if my heart was going to jump out of my throat, I was also relieved and at ease.There was a good reaction coming from the judges.\u201cOh, my God, that was so admirable.\u201d\u201cMoondae-ssi, today you did nothing wrong~\u201d\u201cYou did a great job.\u201dIt felt like a step further away from sudden death.\u2018As expected, distributing all 3 points I had obtained right before the shooting was a great idea.\u2019Currently the dance was at C.To be honest, the feeling of leveling up felt more impactful compared to how it was when I leveled up Vocals.It felt like I instantly learned that my body couldn\u2019t follow me even if I knew it with my head.The sensation of suddenly being able to use the muscles I couldn\u2019t use was clear throughout my body.It was to the point where I felt a sense of pleasure.Perhaps this was similar to intermediate class participants even if they can\u2019t go to the advanced level.I focused on memorising the song without sleeping at all in the first week, so I was proficient enough to just be able to perform it as I thought of it.If we just limit it to this song, it might be better than most others in the intermediate dance class.\u2018I blew it all at once without the intermediate process.\u2019If it doesn\u2019t get edited out, I would pass the first round of elimination.It seems that I was progressing well towards survival step by step.And there were also the expected questions.\u201cBy the way, Moondae, what the hell did you do for the two days?\u201dIn response to the choreographer\u2019s question I could see judge Mudi mouthing back \u201cWhy?\u2019.The choreographer added an explanation as if to answer it.\u201cYou can dance all of a sudden. It\u2019s been 2 days since we saw each other.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dI caught my breath and deliberately brushed my hair in a daze. Making me seem embarrassed.\u201cI asked a good friend.\u201d\u201cA good friend?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Seon Ahyun.\u201dIn other words, a smoke screen.I couldn\u2019t say I leveled up using the status window, so instead I tried to move them emotionally.And perfectly enough my roommate, Seon Ahyun, was part of the advanced dance class.It wasn\u2019t uncommon for people my age to get practical advice from their peers, so since it wasn\u2019t unheard of I tried it once.-Do you have time?-W-What do you need me for?-uh. I\u2019m sorry, but in case a situation happens, can you do this for me\u2026-Y-yes! I can!-\u2026Well, alright.In addition, even if I was just lucky Seon Ahyun taught me too hard. It would have been sad if I couldn\u2019t grow.I felt a little embarrassed because he taught me passionately for 2 hours by splitting information about every move.I was just trying to fit in\u2026Anyways, the image of Seon Ahyun helping an ordinary participant who can\u2019t grasp key points out wouldn\u2019t hurt his image. So it wasn\u2019t too bad.Let\u2019s make things a little more intense. Let\u2019s add some more useless words.\u201c\u2026Ahyun is very kind.\u201d\u201cHey, are you saying I\u2019m not kind then?\u201dThe choreographer immediately poked in.But his face was full of playfulness with a smirk .I felt like it had gone well. There was a warm atmosphere between the judges.\u201cDo you remember what I said during the first evaluation?\u201dYoung-rin of \u2018Saint-U\u2019 softly asked. It didn\u2019t seem like a real question, but instead a sentence that opened a conversation.\u201cI\u2019m not good at dancing at all, so you said the mission would be too much.\u201dYoung-rin smiled faintly.\u201cIt seems I said something wrong. I think Park Moondae-ssi can get through it even if it\u2019s too much.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cToday, I really enjoyed it. Next time I hope you have more time to move.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try to do that.\u201dThere was no way that I would be able to suddenly relax just with those words, but the audition program was the one that I had to answer for sure. It was kind of fun.Anyway, it was a success. I was well received and reasonably anticipated by the following judges.The great has got to be gold.***Like other idol audition programs, the theme song was the first thing revealed to the public in \u2018Idol Joint-Stock Company\u2019.And of course, the amount of theme songs went to those who are good at it. It was this grade that determined the standard of \u201cgood participant.\u201dAs you might have guessed from the class division badge, the top, middle, and bottom ranks were divided in the order of gold, silver, and bronze.\u201cThe participants who don\u2019t meet the condition for bronze will be\u2026 Ejected!\u201dThey had made that announcement every season, but it has never been realized, so you didn\u2019t have to worry about it.And there was one more grade above the three categories.\u201cIdol Joint-Stock Company, back with a brand new look, who will be the one to receive the platinum rating that represents this re-listed season?\u201dIt was the platinum grade.On the Internet, this rating was used as a meme using all sorts of metaphors, from multi-level games to games to asking after parents.To be honest, I was a little relieved that the production team\u2019s naming sense didn\u2019t go as far as diamond.In any case, the other participants were all stiffened up waiting for the MC\u2019s announcement.In front of each participant was a colorful metal box, which contained a badge symbolizing the grade.I had an idea because I had already guessed the rating.Silver was from ranks 26, but by roughly looking at the status window, I was now in the top 25. And that wasn\u2019t enough to be in the platinum class with top 10. So it was gold.\u201cParticipants, please open the rating box!\u201dI opened the box, holding on to my expression not to show any rudeness.And stiffened.Inside the box was a gleaming platinum badge with a holographic reflection.It was the platinum grade badge.\u201c\u2026\u201dAs I stiffened, Seon Ahyun, who was holding up his gold badge from the side, tilted his head. And he was filled with astonishment.\u201cU-u-uwa Uwaa!\u201d\u201cWhat is it? \u2026huh, great!! Wow, that\u2019s great!!\u201dSimilarly, the (former) 20th place Lee Sejin, who was holding a gold badge, looked inside my box and shouted.Then he slapped me on the back and continued shouting.\u201cYou\u2019re amazing! Platinum!!\u201dI didn\u2019t know since when we were considered close enough to do this.Didn\u2019t you just come and say hello? He did it first so I was reluctant.After a deep breath, I picked up the badge from the box.Other participants seem to think that I am thrilled, but in fact, my mind felt complicated.\u2018Why Platinum?\u2019I knew that about two or three participants every season would receive a platinum rating based on their growth, instead of skills.But I didn\u2019t think I was that bad.And then I realized.\u2018\u2026the rating order!\u2019Because of that, the number of people who will jump out of the middle and lower ranks has decreased. So relatively I stood out.I was well-acquainted with the dance thanks to regression and all-nighter practice, so I think it was better than the status windows of others in the same level class.\u201c\u2026hmm.\u201dI rolled the badge out of my hand.I was sure I had impressed them, but somehow the aftertaste was uncomfortable.\u2018I think I\u2019ll cause a lot of trouble if I do this wrong.\u2019I didn\u2019t know what kind of editing would be included if I made a single mistake in the next evaluation. In the first season, a participant was beaten down using similar routes.No, come to think of it, there was nothing to go to the next evaluation. If I get a platinum rating right now, even if the editorial point was just slightly off, I would be slaughtered as much as possible.Choi Wongil, who was currently staring at me, would be a good prey for an interview like \u2018Honestly, I didn\u2019t completely understand\u2019.But it would be crazy to create tea by showing that you don\u2019t like it here.\u2018I can\u2019t help it.\u2019I slowly picked up my badge and put it on my body. As I turned my head, I saw the other participants that wore the platinum badges.As expected, the 1st and 2nd places in the first evaluation were both Platinum. In addition, most of the people who sat on the sofa received platinum again.The top 10 players seemed to have dug in through the cracks of some of the participants who had fallen into gold.I was the only one in the top 20. Damn it.\u2018There\u2019s going to be a lot of focus.\u2019\u2026No, let\u2019s think positively. It\u2019s actually a good thing.\u2018That\u2019ll be a lot of footage.\u2019It was a battle for number of footage until the stage fancam was released anyway.I would have to avoid being eliminated unconditionally in the beginning, so I could approach my goal of \u2018debut within a year\u2019.\u2018All I have to do is not be crazily disliked here.\u2019I made a firm commitment. Let\u2019s cut down on the number of things that would possibly get me in trouble.Level up like crazy and put everything to Dance and Vocals.\u201cPlatinum-rated contestants, please come up to the stage first!\u201d\u2026and for now, let\u2019s avoid the participants who have Grade A stats on Dance for the theme song stage.If we were compared, there would be no chance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The higher the rating you had the closer you came to the center.Other than that, there were parts that only the platinum group could perform.However, everyone seemed to be paying attention to their grades because getting one cut on camera could change their initial ranking.In addition, the staff and trainers spoke and moved as if grades had a lot of meaning, so it was perfect for young participants to be swept away.In other words the number of participants who came to talk to me as soon as I put on the platinum badge has increased by fivefold.I felt a little skeptical about the blatant social hierarchy that I had never experienced in high school.What will the production crew with such a great personality do in the future\u2026Fortunately, the vicious production crew also had a directing idea. Participants with more than A dance were placed further ahead of the starting timing and the dance break, even among the Platinum classes.And the participant with relatively weak dance skillfully pulled back. Well, of course this included me too.My movements for the dance break were slightly behind the gold. I saw Seon Ahyun and Lee Sejin (Gold) right next to me.Come to think of it, the child actor Lee Sejin got silver. Based on the flow, I doubt that they would really debut.\u201cIsn\u2019t it a little sad?\u201dI skipped over the point of being friendly with Lee Sejin (Gold). The hurdle went down involuntarily since it was slightly out of the point of disgust.\u201cNot really.\u201dI answered bluntly. I was guessing he was referring to the fact that the stage location wasn\u2019t that great for a platinum grade.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repost\u201cWow, I would have been very sad.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\u201cHuh? Why do you think so?\u201d\u201cBecause you are good at dancing.\u201dLee Sejin\u2019s dance was A- and vocals C+, and if his voice hadn\u2019t cracked while he was doing high notes then he might have gotten the platinum grade instead of me.\u201cUm, thank you!\u201dAnyway, Lee Sejin smiled broadly as if he felt a little better.Then, suddenly, another voice came in.\u201cCan\u2019t you dance?\u201dIt was a platinum-grade participant who stood at the center of the front row. There wasn\u2019t any ill-intent in his blank expression.The problem is he took the first place in the evaluation since the first ranking. And, as far as I know, he was the final number 1.His name is Cha Yujin. He was quite famous to the point I often saw his face on the TV at the Baekban restaurant I went to in Gosichon.(Baekban = A meal with rice, soup and side dishes sold in a restaurant.Gosichon = A Korean term used to refer to residences of civil service examinees)However, he was more bizarre than I expected.The microphone was still on and the camera was going around, yet he still asked that?With a reckless personality like this, he still won first place.Of course both the details in the status window and evaluation remarks were good.Still, there was a high probability that the editing of the broadcast was also friendly. Let\u2019s not get involved in this kind of material for no reason.So I laughed on purpose.\u201cDid you not see my evaluation?\u201dThen his expression turned cold. Surprisingly, he seemed to be a conscience-stricken person.\u201cEveryone has to prepare for their own stage. So I didn\u2019t get to see it.\u201d\u201cThen you can look at it the next time and see how it is.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dCha Yujin nodded and turned towards the front. Lee Sejin laughed with a hint of bewilderment.\u201cI guess it\u2019s because you\u2019re from abroad, you have a unique way of speaking.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dSince Lee Sejin was also conscious of the camera the conversation did not go any further.Instead, I looked towards the staff offstage. It seems they were getting things sorted out.\u201cLet\u2019s go to rehearsal!\u201dThe staff screamed. Looks like they were done setting things up.I held my breath.It was hard to wait on the road as they picked up the equipment but I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d do this myself.It was currently 6 in the morning.And the actual performance will be recorded at 4 pm.It seemed this would be a painful march.***Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repostAnd now it was 8 p.m.The main shooting had ended.\u201cThank you for your hard work!\u201d\u201dAs expected from the beginning\u2026 It was full of harship.\u201cHaaa\u2026\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I\u2019m dying.\u201dThe participants fell to the floor one by one, making a sound of pain alongside it. Everyone was drenched in sweat.My condition wasn\u2019t much different, but there was no room to sit since the floor was full of collapsed participants.It was a funny sight.\u2018I\u2019m out of energy.\u2019First of all, we had a rehearsal all morning. Only after that did we finally get a short break and lunch break.The meal was just a sheet of foiled kimbap, probably because we had not yet received the relevant PPL.After eating a bit, a bunch of stylists came into the set.\u2013 Oh, there really is no place left to put our stuff~\u2013 Put your head this way!\u2013 I\u2019ll do it quickly.While they were annoyed by the harsh environment of the vacant lot used as a waiting room, they mechanically prepared the participants and brushed their hair.To be honest, there weren\u2019t much dramatic changes, but it was enough for it to be seen during the broadcast.After that, I changed into the broadcast uniform.By this time, the camera had reached me.-Do you like your clothes?-\u2026Yes.Is there anyone here who would say no?-What do you like about it?-Well, since it is a design that encompasses uniforms and school uniforms, I think you can create a variety of concepts.It\u2019s a pity that there were 77 people wearing the same clothes, so it\u2019s a shame that I couldn\u2019t express my true feelings of how it felt a bit creepy since it felt like I was back in school.As soon as I was done speaking, various participants around me joined in.-I like being able to match various accessories~-Oh! It also goes well with the badge!There would be around one or two camera cuts from this scene, but everyone seemed really enthuastic.And the actual shooting.To be honest, here\u2026 I didn\u2019t know how the editing would go.\u2013 I\u2019m going back~\u2013 Oh\u2026I had to dance in a crowd in a hot place 30 times and it felt like I would get a heat stroke, so I couldn\u2019t care less about that.I think I heard some compliments, criticisms, and motivational comments that were intended to impress me, but my head was still all over the place.To be honest, my memory was hazy. I didn\u2019t know which cut the producers would use out of the 30 attempts.I listened to the PD, and tried to come back to my senses.\u201cEveryone, you worked really hard\u2026\u201dThe main PD, who appeared only at the end of the main stage, seemed to be giving empty compliments, but fortunately after a few words he also gave some useful information.\u201c\u2026and this performance will be on next Friday\u2019s Music Night. You will start shooting again the next day. Please have a good rest until then. Don\u2019t forget that this is a great opportunity for you. You must seize this opportunity.\u201dAnyone who hears it would think that if the participants put in effort, they could seize the opportunity.The participants responded enthusiastically to the words of the PD who can tailor the opportunity to their liking.\u201d Let\u2019s work hard until the end, diligently.\u201d\u201cYes!!\u201d\u201cThen see you next week. Good job~\u201d\u201cThank you for your hard work!\u201dEveryone squeezed out their remaining energy to cheer and clap. I also applauded. My hands shook.\u201c\u2026\u201dUntil next week\u2019s music night monitoring, I had to build up my stamina.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repost***The week went by in a flash.My plans to build up my stamina was only half successful. This is because after the first shooting, I suddenly had a fever and had to stay under the blanket and take medicine for 3 days.It seemed Park Moondae\u2019s body couldn\u2019t endure weeks of hard work.Anyway, after waking up in three days, I increased the amount of food I ate. I also practiced dancing and exercising my strength at the same time.Currently I was holding dumbbells as I watched the music night, so I can say that I worked pretty hard.So let\u2019s just say it was half successful.[Siwon, did you enjoy SoulWe\u2019s comeback performance in the exciting EDM stage?][Of course, Siwon was so excited and my heart feels so excited~ what about you?][Are you kidding me? Woo~][Woo~]On the screen, a pair of idol hosts cheered.It seemed they were speaking through a prompter,, but they still read the cringey script very cleverly.Despite the busy schedule, they were trying to split the time.[Siwon-ssi!

I put down the dumbbells and lifted my smartphone to turn on the page I had logged into in advance.It was the best page to look at to see the general Internet reaction as a viewer\u2019s fireboard made on a giant portal site.Since there was no comeback for a big singer this week, the news page was mostly filled with idol company news.[\u2018MusicBOMB\u2019 talk talk!]-Relisting \u314b\u314b\u314b is this true?(\u314b\u314b\u314b = Ha ha a=ha/ laughing noise)-That\u2019s a lot of brain failure-Wow, pretend to be luxurious season 3!-\u314b \u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b it\u2019s not a re-listing, it\u2019s a delisting.\u2013 What? What happened here all of a sudden?\u221f IJC is making a new season.\u221fAh\u2026-\u314e Am I the only one who came to see the comments instead of the boring stage?Well. The reactions were as expected.Every time I refreshed the page a different kind of insult would appear. More and more people came in compared to the previous music nights.And to summarize the reactions, it was said that season 3 was definitely going to be an overkill and ruined. Because season 2 was too grandiose and flashy, the perception of the series itself seemed to have been ruined.Not surprisingly, mockery aimed towards season 2 could also be seen.\u2013 This time it\u2019s between guys? Are you going to a bigger Korea? \u314b\u221f Same-sex marriage is not allowed in Korea, but you can\u2019t surpass the stronghold of season 2 ^^ \u314b \u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u221fFuck, \u314b \u314b\u314b\u314bThis was the main reason season 2 had collapsed. It was a mixed idol audition that consisted of both male and female participants.Looking back on it, it was a bizarre idea.I wonder what kind of scenario the Producer team was hoping for.If season 2 had just been male-only like it was supposed to, this season would be female again and not receive attention like this.If you do something like that\u2026Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repost-I don\u2019t know~ Who else might get pregnant before marriage and remain a legend in the idol audition world?\u221f A billion \u314b\u314b\u314b Two seasons in a row!\u221fNow we can laugh about it but fuck, at that time I was traumatised. These crazy guys, why would they come to a audition only to upset the audience\u221fHaa a sudden acceleration;\u221fI\u2019m too immersed in the entertainment industry~\u221fYeah, it\u2019s not just entertainment, it\u2019s an audition that wastes money~\u221fIn the meantime, I still shiver when I think of the fact that IJC tried getting involved in the romance of the century.That\u2019s right. A premarital pregnancy had happened.Even if they were in a relationship, a premarital pregnancy in the show was still fatal.It also exploded among the participants.The bigger problem is that the two participants who had a premarital pregnancy were the popular participants leading Season 2.Since the production team is a mixed group anyway, it seems that they thought that it would be better to use the topic for attraction instead of getting rid of it.So, they worked hard to edit the remaining episodes in a way that seemed like a realistic romance show.But that wasn\u2019t the end of it.\u2013 To say you were pregnant while standing with two legs, she must have been a madman that will never be seen again.\u2013 A real IJC legend\u2026 no, not just IJC, it\u2019s MJC \u314e\u00a0(Sort of a word play, i guess it would make more sense in Korean)Among the participants involved in the premarital pregnancy scandal, the male was actually dating another female participant.It is said that the female participant was going to put up with it for the sake of her career, but after watching the pink episode she was blinded and exposed the details on social media.After that\u2026 It was miserable.Portal real-time search terms, entertainment news pages, and even social media were all destroyed.Just\u2026 It\u2019s worth remembering that IJCa Season 2 didn\u2019t make it to the final episode and ended early.And as long as this mega-scale scandal was still engraved in the minds of the viewers, no matter what we did in the beginning it would be impossible to avoid the ridicule.I finished my recollection of the events and focused on the screen again.In contrast to the mess in the comment section, the MCs of Music Night were still smiling.[Idol stocks waiting for shareholders to invest!!][Shine your star!]And here comes the famous catchphrase.[Now, invest in idols who want to fly!]At that moment, the number of comments regen suddenly tripled.\u2013 Fly high, stocks\u2026 Fantastic skyrocketing\u2026 Fly\u2026 ClimbThis was an internet meme that was once popular. I believe it was often used when a participant people thought would do well would fail because of a bad move.Several lamentations passed through the comments, which are almost all over the place.\u2013 And I\u2019m using this again.-Whoever decided on the phrase is really low-key.-20 The old man who left the house tried to act hip but failed.-Crazy broadcasting station bastards, don\u2019t make Siwon say these lines \u3160\u3160I laughed bitterly.\u201cI still see it.\u201dI mean, they were still trying to insult us.It was hundreds of times better than indifference. This early audience would definitely contribute to early word of mouth. I had already experienced that season 3 would be a big success.This means that the majority of them (to put it in a very private way) would try to grab anyone\u2019s stock and cry when they reach the final.But It wouldn\u2019t be like that from the beginning.I was very excited about what kind of reactions would come out.After the MC was done speaking, the TV screen lit up the stage a few seconds later.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repostYoung-rin was standing on the stage. The pin-pointed lighting created dramatic shadows on the clearly outlined face.Well, \u201cIdol Joint-stock Company\u201d was originally a humorous position with black comedy and meme-filled B-style, but since it had become so meme-ridden they seemed to have wanted to change the image a little.They were trying to cover it up solemnly[To all shareholders!

Then let them go!]Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repost\u2013 Have the producers gone crazyAn appropriate comment caught my eye.In the meantime, Young-rin kept speaking out serious remarks under the flashing lights.[Our company\u2019s life and death depend on the shareholders!][<Idol Joint-Stock Company> is now re-listing!]The camera turned upwards.On the stage the flashing lights assembled together like a milky way, making it look like a giant star.And in the middle of the stage, I saw the backs of ten people standing under the light. The platinum grade participants.The camera zoomed towards the ten participants and moved up and down. Because the stage was so huge, the whole body of ten people seemed to be full.As soon as the camera stopped, the Intro started playing.The participants turned back one by one and the camera took action.It was a solo part that was a platinum-grade benefit, but honestly, it was subtle because it was less than a second for both parties.\u2018I\u2019d rather pick a center like the original.\u2019I had a strange feeling as I watched my own sections come by.What I did was correct, but it felt low because it was Park Moondae\u2019s face.\u2018Hm, it seems that the limbs are less shriveled.\u2019After the intro ended the song started playing, the gold grade appeared around the platinum grade. It looked natural thanks to the power of editing.When the pre-chorus started, the lighting changed and the silver grade appeared from both sides, and at the beginning of the chorus, the bronze grade appeared from behind.And then the group chorus.\u201cOh.\u201dIt was plausible. The movement seemed to be in perfect order thanks to the ghostly cutting of the moments where the choreography didn\u2019t fit.The comments section also showed a rare favorable response. Although most of them were embarrassed by the fact that it looked favorable.-Why is the song actually good-It\u2019s a MJC, but the theme song is always fresh.-What a waste of the song. Give me another stone.Of course, they didn\u2019t forget to comment about the participants whenever there was a close-up.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repost-Such young skin\u2026 It\u2019s a little uncomfortable to look at \u3160\u3160-He just hit his neck.

As expected, the camera showed off the side that looked the best.\u2026Wait a minuteI compared the responses in the comment box with the close-up participants.\u201c\u2026Did I make a mistake?\u201dIt wouldn\u2019t be good if there was a big difference from the early buzz.\u201cForget about singing and dancing, should I have made my visuals A first?\u201dIf my appearance was high quality, then it could have been a hot topic even if only one close-up showed up on the theme song stage.Even if it was only a few home-ladies, the photos would have been taken at a place like a production presentation, and they would have been posted on social media, etc.If the fan base was solidified from the beginning, the chances of avoiding elimination later on would be higher.Since I had a status window, couldn\u2019t I have just made my skills look like growing over time?Considering the fact that this season was ridiculed at first and skyrocketed after it aired, I put this strategy aside\u2026 I had overlooked the fact that visuals mattered.I felt my heart grow cold and looked back at the stage on screen.Before I knew it, it was coming to an end.A few close-ups appeared even as it came to an end.What stood out the most was the child actor Lee Sejin. I could feel the will of the production team to somehow create the topic before airing, so they tried giving him a few more seconds.Come to think of it now, the majority of the debut members I know also had a B- or higher stat visuals vise.It would have been difficult for me if the editing team focused on participants with high appearance stat.Park Moondae had a decent appearance, but it couldn\u2019t be considered handsome.As I was about to review my strategy because of the confidence I lost, the screen suddenly changed. It was a mid-advertisement.But then I heard a familiar voice.[<Idol Joint-Stock company> is now relisted!]The first ad appeared here?It\u2019s been over a week since shooting ended, so I thought that much time would be enough to make a edit.I tried to focus on the advertisement, wondering if there would be any hints about the editing direction.[I hope there are many good friends.][I have high expectations.][No (beep\u2013) comes out too?

With this, I had less worries about the editing. My shoulders lowered a bit.It was my first mass media exposure, so I think I overreacted bit.Even if it\u2019s just the early stages, the games usually take place until the 4th episode, so I should try not to worry too much and save some energy.Unlike me, who regained peace in my mind, judges with stiff faces made abusive remarks without notice on the screen shortly afterwards.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repost[Now this\u2026 I can\u2019t even call it a stage.][You know that\u2019s an excuse, right?][I think you just weren\u2019t prepared enough.][Aren\u2019t you embarrassed?]And the faces of the participants, with their firm expressions and biting lips, overlapped and passed.\u2026Looking at the background, it seems that they used the expression that was made after they were tired from all the practicing.In the end, a cut that was edited like a sudden situation came out.[(beep\u2013)-ssi? (beep\u2013)-ssi wait a minute, wait a\u2026 !][(The participant suddenly leaves.)]The crying face of the child actor Lee Sejin appeared.[(What\u2019s the whole story?)]And as the screen darkened, the logo of the Idol Joint-Stock company appeared magnificently.At the climax of the altered theme song, the logo went off, and the MC\u2019s voice was heard.[The re-listing of the new Idol Joint-Stock company!

But you could easily see the public opinion once you clicked on the article.It had been a while since the comment section on an entertainment news post was blocked, and if you look at the emoticon reactions that still showed.\u2018Outrageous\u2019 had surpassed 12,000.It\u2019s clear that since \u2018I\u2019m angry\u2019 wasn\u2019t there, they clicked this instead, so this meant that public opinion was going wild.There were also a lot of columns.[Idol Joint-Stock company, the people deprived of freedom.][\u2018Buy me!\u2019, the kids who have become stocks.]Let\u2019s click on one.[It\u2019s not even \u201cPlease vote for me\u201d anymore.

It\u2019s not like the participants were being criticized.The reason for the failure of season 2 was because the content, the popular participants, were ruined.However, this season, that image was being suppressed due to the sadism of the program that the production team turned off the aggressiveness.Anyway, regardless of whether the program was overtly brutal or even a little arrogant, the survival program was always difficult.I didn\u2019t know if it would be better for us to gather the topic of interest.Thanks to the popularity of the program increasing, the comments were also going up.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repost========================[IJC 3 Platinum-grade summary]: Let\u2019s capture the music night stage.

If possible, help me on the stage\u2026.[Characteristic: \u201cI heard that\u2019s true (C)\u201d acquired!]Stirs emotional agitation in the listener.Activation rate 35%, default activation statusHow was I supposed to accept this characteristic that would only suit a flirt?Does this mean that it would at least attract public opinion on the Internet?No, seeing that it specified \u2018listener\u2019 that didn\u2019t seem to be the case.Let\u2019s think about it for a second\u2026\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter calming down, I think it\u2019s a pretty good trait.Due to the nature of the program, survival participants often delivered words directly to viewers such as making self-introductions and ranking announcements.At themes like that, it would be advantageous for the viewer to feel something instead of just pass by casually, so it was a good characteristic.Furthermore, the expression \u201clistener\u201d might include songs as a way of conveying.If that is the case it would certainly benefit me. It\u2019ll be easy to get people immersed in the stage.Good. It was much better than nothing.I quickly sorted things out and checked the status window.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repost[Name: Park Moondae (Ryu Gunwoo)]Level : 8Title: NoneVocal: A-Dance : CVisual: C+Talent: CCharacteristics: Infinite Potential, I heard that\u2019s true (C)!Status abnormality: Debut or diePoints Remaining : 1Thanks to the achievement \u3008First Experience\u3009 that I achieved after the first performance was aired, I received one more point.And there were only three more episodes left until I achieved the achievement for practicing singing 500 times.Level up within today to earn one extra point, and the points I have now will be distributed immediately.My highest priority was\u2026\u201cLet\u2019s take a picture of my appearance.\u201dIt was time to cross the B-grade threshold.Without hesitation, I organized the status window.\u2018\u2026I hope that the number of mentions can increase in the next content.\u2019I thought casually, and since it was early, I got ready for bed.Filming would start again tomorrow. It started early in the morning, so it was good to save stamina from now on.Considering the order, it seemed like tomorrow I would be shooting a self-introduction video before the first team match.***\u201cThe restart of <Idol Joint-Stock Company>! Participants, did you all have a good rest?\u201d\u201cYes!!\u201dMy expectations were wrong. I looked around the set among the participants who answered the MC\u2019s question vigorously.Signs were placed around the auditorium, where the first theme song was shown.It was in a way that anyone who watched the last season would expect a team fight.Besides me, I could see some other participants looking around the set and exchanging glances among themselves.It was unclear whether they could do it together, but it didn\u2019t seem bad.I\u2019ll try to cast someone.\u201c\u2026\u201dCome to think of it, I didn\u2019t have anyone that close to me. Let\u2019s just focus on what the MC says.\u201cThe stage you will prepare for today is a team match!\u201d\u201cOooh!\u201dAs expected, everyone reacted with a look.\u201cSince it\u2019s the first team match, I\u2019m sure everyone has someone they wish to team up with, right?\u201dSeeing these kinds of words, the next sentence would definitely start with a \u2018however\u2019.\u201cHowever! Idols should be able to show their teamwork no matter who they work with. In this evaluation, you can\u2019t team up with the people you wanted!\u201dIn the first season, the program, which made them plan it and edit it as if they were being left out, to score about 5 people, did a good job.\u201cSo how do we form a team? First of all, please pick a ball from this box!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201dLee Sejin (Gold), was standing behind me and whispered.He was the only person who talked to me in this meeting arranged by the production team, but it seemed like the goal was to get a reaction cut.We can\u2019t ignore the camera.I nodded roughly, followed the person in front and pulled a ball out of the box.\u2018Number 12.\u2019I think that the teams will be formed by number, or teams will be selected in this number order.\u201cParticipant number one, who are you? Put your hands up! Oh, it\u2019s Lee Hongsu!\u201dA participant from the silver grade raised their hand.The MC raised his hand and pointed at the sign placed in the auditorium.\u201cParticipants can each pick a sign when their turn arrives!\u201dIt was the latter. The MC smiled and drew his hand back.\u201cThen, please reveal the contents of the sign!\u201dDing-The sign lit up and texts appeared. It was cutting edge in its own way, but the thing that was really important were its contents.Each sign had the name of a famous agency written on it.\u201cHere are the names of agencies that are leading KPOP around the world! You just need to choose one of these agencies. However, the limit is 14 people per agency!\u201dMC spread out his hands.\u201cHowever, once the quota is exceeded, a person with a higher grade can push out a lower grade participant and take their place instead!\u201d\u201cWow, the rules are brutal.\u201dGold grade Lee Sejin spoke again and trembled.\u201cIf you choose the same agency as me, you won\u2019t push me right? I think I am good?\u201d\u201c\u2026you are gold.\u201dI couldn\u2019t understand why a guy with a high grade would assume I would push him.\u201cGolds can be pushed out by Platinum too!\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not pushing you.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s a cool answer.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dOnly read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repostLet\u2019s not get involved.For your information, there were five signs for agencies. Seven people would be forced to stand in the corner because they couldn\u2019t find a sign.The interviews that would be inserted could be predicted already.[It was really scary][Now it\u2019s a real survival]\u201cThen let\u2019s start moving with Lee Hongsu, the participant who picked number one!\u201dThe first participant stood in front of the agency famous for it\u2019s male idols.My number was 12, so it was still pretty early. Looks like I didn\u2019t have to push anyone out.However, it would make it hard to see the team members in advance.The quality of the stage and the direction of editing would vary depending on who were the other team members in this first round, and the game afterwards would change.Besides, I didn\u2019t know any of the 11 participants that got called up before me. This means that none of them had debuted.I had to use my brain well.\u201cThe next participant, move!\u201dAfter a lot of thinking I chose where I wanted to go to.So far the sign most people went to were the ones chosen by high ranks.All the agencies had their own hit songs anyway, so as long as you chose well among those, there would be no big problem in the song selection.Therefore, the team members were more important than the agencies.It would be better to have someone who is good on stage, so let\u2019s try to calculate based on the people in front of me.\u201cFirst, I should go to a place that has a lot of high grades.\u2019As I stepped forward with the ball in my hand, two gold-grade participants welcomed me awkwardly.It seemed like the two had decided to choose the same sign together.Both of them only gave out a greeting, but they seemed welcoming somehow.They were going through a lot, too.\u201cOh~ the main vocalist!\u201dI would also appreciate it if I could receive a response like that.Fortunately, both participants showed their strengths in dancing.The problem was after this.\u201cNext~ Oooh, Participant Lee Sejint!\u201d\u201dThe child actor Lee Sejin also chose the sign.Lee Sejin, holding number 15, approached with a stiff look and stood behind the sign.Seems like the two gold participants tried welcoming him again this time, but it vaguely failed because Lee Sejin turned around and stood behind them.\u201cAah\u2026\u201dI heard the voice of embarrassment in front of me.Well, he was right behind me, so I should do the gesture.I turned my head and bowed my head towards the child actor Lee Sejin. Lee Sejin also nodded. It was an unbalanced response.As expected, I didn\u2019t feel good. Maybe someone would push him.However, after that, someone with a bronze grade that was lower than silver came in, and the possibility was extremely low.\u2018shit.\u2019And after a while, we reached the 30s.Seon Ahyeon, who was holding the number 33, as usual approached me with a nervous look.\u201c\u2026\u201dWell, it would be nice if the number of gold grades increased. He was also cooperative. I gently waved my hand, and Seon Ahyun immediately had a bright expression and waved his hand back.It was a bit embarrassing.The next impressive addition was the platinum grade Ryu Chengwoo.As a former national archery player, he was one of the debutants I recognised.\u201cI look forward to working with you!\u201dWith a smile, Ryu Chengwoo stood in the line for the 13th person.Only 1 person left.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repostUnfortunately, the participants I knew that debuted as 1st and 2nd place went to different signs. It was the sign that the first participant chose, the agency that is famous for its male idols.Because the agency was especially popular, it was the first one where people got pushed out.There were also a number of people who became a hot topic from their debut or first performance, including the 1st place Cha Yujin.Even Silver got pushed out.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe silver-grade participant, who got pushed out, nodded his head and came up to this sign. He looked as miserable as one could be.\u201c\u2026\u201dFor your information, this person was Choi Wongil.After arguing so hard with me, he failed to do good during grade evaluation and fell to silver.Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I think he doesn\u2019t want to make eye contact with me.\u201cOh, now we have to push someone out for someone else to come in. All 14 slots have been taken.\u201d\u201cOh, gosh.\u201dThe two Gold, who were first in the line, nodded.\u2026I was slowly starting to worry about the members of this team.There was even a guy who pushed in from the 60s.\u201cThe person I\u2019ll be replacing is\u2026 Bronze grade participant Jeong Hyeongjung . I\u2019m so sorry!\u201dGold-grade Lee Sejin also chose this sign.Lee Sejin, who kept his head down, became the first person to push someone out and join this sign.Everyone seemed reluctant because of how sorry and nice he looked.\u201cOh, Moondae~ Are you going to be the main vocalist?\u201d\u201cThe person who suits it the most will do it.\u201d\u201cWow, it\u2019s so cool~ \u2018The person who suits it the most will do it\u2019~.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIf it weren\u2019t for the cameras, I would have swung my fist.I looked at Lee Sejin without answering, and he grinned and slapped me on the back before moving up the line.I was embarrassed\u2026\u201cEveryone, did you manage to choose the sign you wanted?\u201dThe movement only ended after the remaining participants got pushed out were assigned to new signs.At the sign I was in, there wasn\u2019t any change except for that one silver that pushed out a bronze after Lee Sejin (Gold) joined.As a result, here\u2019s a summary of the participants\u2019 ratings.\u2013 2 Platinum, 5 Gold, 5 Silver, and 2 Bronze.Overall, it was the best distribution except for the top team. The members seemed secretly satisfied with the fact once they realised it.Of course it didn\u2019t end here.\u201cNow you are going to want to pick a great song!\u201d\u201cYes!!\u201dThere were 14 people, but there was no way to put them in one team. So we would be divided into teams of seven.First of all the person I wanted to avoid no matter what, and the person I wanted to team up with\u2026I turned my head. And my eyes coincidentally met up with Ryu Cheongwoo\u2019s eyes.Ryu Cheongwoo nodded slightly. It seemed like he was also trying to form a high rank team. All right, then let\u2019s do our best to avoid looking sarcastic as much as possible.\u201cNow, before that\u2026 Raise your hand if you picked the first sign!\u201dThe participants that stood before the first sign raised their hands.The MC smiled and said,\u201cFor the participants who raised their hands, please press the button above the sign!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cSign?\u201d\u201cButton, oh, there\u2019s a square, uh, that\u2019s it.\u201dThe participants murmured between each other, and each found the button at the top of the sign and pressed it.Then the sign flickered and its contents changed.\u201cOh, what?\u201d\u201cA lottery?\u201dTwo lines that featured seven numbers floated on the sign\u2019s screen.The same happened to the sign at my agency.[4, 7, 12, 15, 33, 37, 62.][17, 24, 27, 38, 41, 59, 72.]\u201cDo you see the number on the sign?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cI can see it!\u201d\u201cIf you buy a lottery ticket with that number! \u2026haha, I was joking. You will be teamed up with those numbers! \u2026everyone, do you remember the number balls you drew to get a starting order?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cYou are now a team based on the order of the signs! And you will have a one-on-one match with the other team!\u201dIn an instant, the set was filled with noise.\u201cUh, hey, what number did you have\u2026 I was number five, right? Huh.\u201d\u201cWow, what the\u2026\u201d\u201cAre we divided?\u201dThis sign wasn\u2019t that different either.Once the first button was pressed, the gold-grade participant cheered and hugged the same gold grade participant right behind him. After all, the two had come here together.And immediately after they turned towards me and shouted.\u201cHyungnim! Number 12~ We\u2019re on the same team!\u201d\u201cWow, awesome! I got the main vocalist!\u201dThen someone grabbed me by the neck right behind me, and joined the gold grades in embracing me.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repost\u201cI like our team, don\u2019t you think?\u201dIt was the Lee Sejin with the gold grade. Right. 62 was this guy.While I was stuck between the 3 who were purposefully making a fuss, I tried matching the other numbers with the people.The ones left were 15, 33, and 37.First of all, Number 33 was Seon Ahyun.That was great. I turned around to talk to Seon Ahyun and slipped out of the gap between the three.I almost got annoyed because I felt uncomfortable.\u201cI look forward to your kind cooperation.\u201dSeon Ahyun nodded his head vigorously. All right, who were the rest of the team?It would be good if I had Ryu Cheongwoo, who was Platinum grade and someone who had debuted, the next number was 37\u2026\u201c\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t him. Number 37 was Choi Wongil. It was clear that he was standing here awkwardly with the ball in order.From the looks of it Ryu Cheongwoo was already starting to gather people to start a briefing.\u2018Failed.\u2019And number 15\u2026Damn, it was the child actor Lee Sejin.Similarly, with eyes that refused to communicate, he was looking at the three gold-grade participants who were gathered over here.I\u2019m tired. This was going to be edited out.If we disregarded my expectations, the overall rating wasn\u2019t bad.Maybe that\u2019s why, Seon Ahyun spoke with a rare happy voice.\u201cI-I-I think the team members are good.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dYes, at least you can think positively.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There are so many talented people, and so many good-looking people here!\u201dThe gold grade Lee Sejin said with a smile. Everyone was shy, but nodded as if it was true.It was only natural because it was time for everyone to grow up even if they were just pretending to be in harmony. I\u2019m glad that everyone seemed to atleast have common sense.\u201cBut, ah, actor Sejin. Our names are the same\u2026 How can we differentiate ourselves?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cRight? Since you\u2019re an actor, how about Bae Sejin?\u201d\u00a0(Actor in Korean is Bae)The first gold-rank participant that joined the team, smirked and spoke.\u201cHey, then, since you are big you should be Big Sejin.\u201d\u00a0(Big in Korean is Big)\u201cBig Sejin? Hey, that\u2019s good, Cole! How are you? Sejin-hyungnim?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe child actor Lee Sejin was biting his mouth as if tolerating something, then spoke softly.\u201cI just like my name.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I see.\u201dThe atmosphere cooled down in an instant. Gold grade Lee Sejin hastily opened his mouth.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repost\u201cAh, that\u2019s fine. Then, hyungs and dongsaengs, please call me Big Sejin from now on~\u201d\u201cI like it~\u201d\u201cNice nickname!\u201dThe atmosphere was settled by clapping and applause. Then, around the time each person introduced themselves, the MC picked up the microphone again.\u201cParticipants, did you say hello to each other?\u201d\u201cPlease, let us choose our own songs.\u201dOne of the team members muttered desperately. But that was not a possibility.\u201cNow then\u2026 let\u2019s start the song selection!\u201d\u201cWa\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe song selection is also random\u2026.\u201dEveryone mumbled with tired expressions.The MC waved his hand and said in a humorous way.\u201cAh, everyone! The songs you will get are the hit songs that belong to the idols in the agency you chose! Don\u2019t be disappointed!\u201dPerhaps they thought it was worth doing it, but the atmosphere improved.\u201cNow, the sign in front of you will start switching between representative songs. Press the switch when you want it to stop! Then, the first participant to join the sign, please come forward!\u201dThe team members immediately switched positions.\u201cHyungnim, I believe in you!\u201d\u201cYou can only live by choosing the best song!\u201d\u201cThen, do I have to show my abilities again?\u201dThe first participant went out in front of the sign with cheers.\u201cNow, get ready\u2026 shoot!\u201d\u201cWaah!\u201dThe team member made a strange noise and immediately pressed the switch. Next to me, Big Sejin (I\u2019m going to refer to him like this since he brought it up himself) murmured.\u00a0(The parenthesis is Moondae speaking, not Translator :P)\u201cNo, let me look at it and press\u2026\u201dThe sign slowly turned around to show several song titles.[King of the mountains / VTIC]\u00a0(aka Tiger)[LIFE / VTIC][Eternal Song / VTIC]VTIC. The male idol group that held the most sold album record.\u201cEverything is fine\u2026 Please.\u201dAt the far end, I heard Choi Wongil\u2019s desperate mumbles. I waited silently for the screen to stop.The screen froze slowly.[Into the new world / Mallangdalkomt]\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026??\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!?\u201dThere was a terrible silence.All the team members, except me, had bonobono eyes and looked at the sign.\u00a0(Bonobono= character from a manga)\u201cI-Is this an error?\u201dThe team member who touched the sign mumbled in a confused voice. However, there were no interruptions from the producers.That meant this was real.\u201cIt includes female idols?\u201d\u201cDo you have any female idol songs?\u201dSimilar words were being said all around, not just by us.Of course, their reactions weren\u2019t as strong as ours.The team members were murmuring like crazy.\u201cUh\u2026 So, was it the flower fairy?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 uh, debut song, yeah.\u201dUndoubtedly, \u2018To the New World\u2019 was an innocent and dreamy song that represented a flower fairy.In addition, it was a debut song. A song that never won #1 on music shows since it was released before they changed to a cute concept as mallangdalkom.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repost\u201cAh! thank you!\u201d\u201cAwesome!!\u201dThere were cheers all around as if they had a good song. It was only natural since the selection was full of masterpieces.And then the climax came from this area.\u201cAaaaah!\u201d\u201cHyung! Hyung!!\u201dThe other team in our sign chose \u2018King of the mountains\u2019.For reference, that song was a title track for an album that received a grand prize in the largest music site awards ceremony in Korea two months ago.I\u2019d say that it\u2019s one of the hottest songs you could pick here.That\u2019s why everyone hugged him and made a fuss. The team members had lower ratings, but now there was something to balance so their moods improved.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAnd our side suddenly became speechless. It seemed like everyone couldn\u2019t get out of the shock.What about me\u2018I was avoiding this.\u2019I was sweeping down my chest. This is because I realized that I had chosen an agency sign I didn\u2019t want to.VTIC\u2019s \u2018King of the mountains?I just wouldn\u2019t be able to do it.I was lucky to avoid it.In that sense, for me the competition was as good as it could be.\u2018It seems the others didn\u2019t realise it yet.\u2019When I saw the team members getting depressed, I thought it was for the better.In a sense of crisis, people cooperated the best***\u201cWe are not in sync.\u201dDid I think we could be cooperative? I want to correct myself since that was too high of an expectation.The ones who seemed to have already given up on everything was starting to show\u201cWongil, if I try again\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve tried it multiple times, but it just doesn\u2019t seem like it will work out again\u2026\u201dChoi Wongil bowed his head in a gloomy mood, and then spoke softly.\u201cIt was originally a girl song but I don\u2019t think it fits well since it is changed to fit males. I think I can do the high part\u2026\u201dAs he talked he glanced at me.\u2018He is asking for my part.\u2019I wore the main vocal badge early on thanks to the fiery support of the 3 gold ranks.Perhaps because of his low grade, Choi Wongil stayed silent as he watched me put on the badge.Then, when he found the opportunity to stretch his feet, ihe bloomed.I laughed bitterly.\u201cShould we?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dBig Sejin hit my thigh. this is really\u2026\u2026\u201cHey, don\u2019t mess around with the kid for no reason. In times like this, you have to help him sing his part! What are you doing?\u201dNaturally, people talked as if it was a joke. It wasn\u2019t something he had done once or twice.\u2018I don\u2019t think he\u2019s just a nice guy.\u2019I hid my doubts and continued firmly speaking.\u201cNo, it really doesn\u2019t matter if we change. If we are going to do it, we should do it at the beginning before we learn the choreography.\u201d\u201cR-really?\u201d\u201cMmhm.\u201dI calmly concluded the conversation. Choi Wongil had a very suspicious expression on his face, but he quickly nodded in fear that I might go back in my words.\u201cWell then, I would like to do the first verse chorus\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay. Then I\u2019ll do the bridge part myself.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dOnly read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repost\u201cYou are saying you can\u2019t do it, so we should change parts.\u201dChoi Wongil reluctantly nodded his head. It was a shame that he took a part he couldn\u2019t do.He talked about wanting to do the chorus, but he didn\u2019t wish to let go of his own part.I didn\u2019t think he used to be this bad, but perhaps falling into silver became a trigger for him. It was a bit out of taste.Big Sejin looked between me and Choi Wongil, and then sighed audibly.\u2018I guess in the picture he planned, I sang the first chorus.\u2019I continued pretending not to notice.\u201cOkay then, let\u2019s move onto this part.\u201dThere was one main position left. I felt nervous, pretending not to be a gold level participant.\u201cNow we just need to decide on the main dancer.\u201dBefore Big Sejin could add anything else, I raised my hand.\u201cOh, I have an opinion.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s okay with everyone, I would like to decide the direction of the arrangement before choosing the main dancer.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dArrangement.Although it was the most important topic, it was a topic that everyone unconsciously avoided.\u2018Into the New World\u2019 Was an innocent female idol song.And \u2018innocence\u2019\u2026. was a very difficult concept to digest.It was often misunderstood that it could be done as long as you are pretty, but that really was an illusion.Because it wasn\u2019t a concept where you could easily be strong.In order to leave an impression on the audience for a survival show, you had to have incredibly good skills or exceptional talent.Perhaps everyone thought as such, because the arrangement discussion started like this.\u201cHm\u2026 how about changing the lyrics and going stronger?\u201d\u201cWith a strong beat?\u201d\u201cYeah. Doing it like, Into the new world~ Something with ambition like that!\u201dThe first gold\u2026 it was annoying to refer to him this way. Should I just call him Gold 1?So, this was Gold 1\u2019s opinion. This was something that would come into mind if you were a thoughtful survival participant.Change it so it\u2019s strong.The problem was that it would be hard to make the song feel \u2018overwhelming\u2019 as mentioned before.The lyrics of \u2018Into the New World\u2019 went like this.\u2013 At some point, I realized that I was trapped in this unstoppable maze of time, wandering through imperfect time, save the me that is slowly withering away.This little space inside (Little Flower~)Waiting for the day where it will bloom againCome and find meThat was the first verse.If you want it to be ambitious, you would have to change the lyrics to be more speaker-centered, and then the story of the song would become messed up starting with the pre-chorus.That was because the chorus of this song was about asking the other person to come quickly.\u2013 One step, two stepThe sound of you comingIt\u2019s ringing in my earDon\u2019t hesitate, give me your handNow I\u2019m into the new worldCome to meCome to meIt\u2019s dazzling, a paradise by your sideCome to meCome to meMelody of love for you (continues)\u201cThen should we fix the next lyrics into \u2018Come to me\u2019 after \u2018Into the New World\u2019?\u201dOnly read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repost\u201cUh\u2026 if we say \u2018come to you\u2019\u2026\u201dGold 1 muttered behind my back and scratched his head. He seemed to have realized that the problem wasn\u2019t just that\u201cThen, shouldn\u2019t we fix everything starting from \u2018Save Me\u2019?\u201d\u201cUmm.\u201dYes, because the chorus was so focused on the listener\u2019s behavior, if we tried changing it too quickly, the nuance of the next lines would be crushed.\u201cIf we want it to go like this, we will have to change everything.\u201d\u201cYes, \u2026but if you change it too much, you\u2019ll get an imbalance.\u201dIt was also a question of whether the other team or the production team would be fine with such a change.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSlowly, the seriousness of the situation could be felt on the skin, and the team members became quiet.Big Sejin quickly stepped in and changed the subject.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we talk to the teachers and decide on the arrangement? I think it\u2019s better to learn the choreography as soon as possible to be able to earn feedback! Moondae, is that okay?\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s okay. Let\u2019s do it.\u201dI readily accepted it.Anyways, the reason I brought up the arrangement was to create a shock.The more desperate the atmosphere was, the less they would say when I created an arrangement.Of course, even if I didn\u2019t do this, I think everyone would understand what\u2019s going on if they watch the dance video.\u201cOkay, then let\u2019s start the choreography!\u201dAfter the choreography video started playing under Big Sejin\u2019s leadership, everyone put their heads on the tablet PC screen.No matter how many times the members might have heard the chorus, they probably didn\u2019t remember the choreography in detail.However, as expected, less than 15 seconds after the choreography video started, everyone was silent.\u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was also important how the arrangement process appeared on the show.The opportunity came two days later during the trainer check-up.* * *\u201cYou must have been very worried after receiving your song?\u201dAt the choreographer\u2019s words, the team members laughed clumsily. They couldn\u2019t say that they just finished the choreography and put off their worries.The choreographer didn\u2019t seem to like this reaction, but he let it go for now.\u201cLet\u2019s see what you\u2019ve done.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAnd the team members, including myself, finished the first verse choreography without any mistakes.\u201cWhoa\u2026.\u201dThere was a sign of relief that came from the breathless people around me that showed that we didn\u2019t make a mistake.\u201c\u2026\u2026huh, all right.\u201dThe choreographer nodded his head. It was a fairly neutral move.\u201cHow did everyone memorize the moves? Who got the choreography?\u201d\u201cUh, the team members who were a little more accustomed to dancing did it\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. We did it together!\u201dBig Sejin added more to Gold 2\u2019s words.It was true that the four Gold ranks took the lead, but in fact, Seon Ahyunn was the most involved. I found out that he was a dance major.Well, he wasn\u2019t entirely alone, and the main dancer became big Sejin, so it seemed like he was going to be crushed to some extent.The choreographer just nodded.\u201cUh, you must have worked hard. But\u2026\u201dThe choreographer broke his neck.\u201cI can\u2019t see anyone.\u201dI could hear the sound of Gold 2 breathing next to me. Anyone who hears it would think that a ghost appeared.\u201cWhat are you guys doing? It\u2019s just, \u2018Jane is dancing. This works. That works.\u2019 Aren\u2019t those compliments you hear during school talent shows? And you guys came to make a living with that?\u201dEvery time he said more words, the team members flinched.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I am watching anything.\u201dIt was a natural result because we had avoided the interpretation of the song and only practiced the choreography mechanically.\u201cSome kids are way below the mark.\u201dWhile adding those words he clearly glanced at actor Lee Sejin. Lee Sejin bowed his head down.Actually, I was at a level where I could barely memorize the choreography, but should be glad that they received the bullet instead?The level of feedback so harsh to the point it wouldn\u2019t be strange if one person squealed continued.The choreographer nodded without hesitation.\u201cYou, Seon Ahyun.\u201d\u201cY-Yes\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou said you majored in modern dance. But why is your expression weaker than that of Moondae?\u201dSeon Ahyun\u2019s face was pale.I had a strong feeling that these remarks would never be edited out.This guy was about to make me lose my hair\u2026 Was he intentionally trying to shock me by comparing me to the guy who couldn\u2019t do it right now?\u201cHe\u2019s a good singer. Since you\u2019re auditioning here, you\u2019ve had good reviews so far. If you debut and someone makes an article about you, do you think they will tell you that you did a great job?\u201dThere weren\u2019t many industries where the articles worked well as it did in the entertainment industry, but they say it as if it\u2019s a place where people are judged only by their skills. It was still the same.In any case, it must have been a huge blow to Seon Ahyun, and he looked as if he would sink at any moment.\u2018This is a bit troubling\u2026\u2026.\u2019He was still suffering from a strange condition, but it would get worse if he got in trouble because he couldn\u2019t do his part.\u201cAnyway, your level right now is just that of an amateur who has practiced a bit. Think about what you want to express in this song, and then come back in a good state.\u201d\u201cthank you\u2026\u2026\u201dThe team members, who had been ragged, walked out of the evaluation room trembling. They already had zero lives.However, a similar situation occurred in the following vocal feedback.\u201cGuys. What do you guys want to do?\u201dMudy tapped on the keyboard as if frustrated and sad.Whether she really intended on giving advice, she poured out specific instructions instead of personal attacks.\u201cThe concept of this song is the flower fairy. It\u2019s a song that\u2019s sung beautifully and clearly. But you\u2019re just singing along to the note. I don\u2019t feel impressed or sentimental at all. Aren\u2019t you ashamed to call it that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI wondered if there was any team member who hadn\u2019t thought that this song wasn\u2019t suitable for audition programs. It\u2019s because everyone was around the age where they were almost graduating or already graduated high school.But honestly, we couldn\u2019t say we were shy, so I came up with this answer.\u201cSince it is an audition, I wanted to rearrange it with a stronger feeling\u2026 but because the concept of the song is clear, so it\u2019s difficult to naturally change it to a stronger direction.\u201d\u201cIf the arrangement seems difficult, you should have thought about faithfully living up to the original song more.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMudy waved one hand with a sad expression.\u201cGuys. You have to figure out the direction you want to head first.\u201dAnd with the intervention of the production team, team members\u2019 discussion began immediately.The cameras were close to us, and the production crew were sitting right by it, making it a terrible atmosphere where no one could say anything.But someone had to speak up, so the guy with the armband opened his mouth first. It was Big Sejin.\u201cUm, we worked really hard for two days. Thanks to that, we got the choreography quickly. From now on, if we immerse ourselves in the song with that momentum, I think we can make it well enough for stage coherency.\u201dIt was a natural, comforting talk as if he was already prepared. Look at this guy.\u201cDon\u2019t leave us out, let\u2019s work hard to keep the emotions of the original song! It might be a little embarrassing, but naturally, if we do well, it\u2026\u2026 won\u2019t it be fun and feel a bit like the hit song from mallangdalkom sunbaenims?\u201d\u201cAh, just like Moondae did?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! If you make it a little humorous and innocent, it\u2019ll feel fresh. How about making the beat a little faster and having fun?\u201dIn the end, it was meant to brazenly overdo the innocent female idol song, and rather digest it like the mallangdalko\u2019s concept in its heyday.\u2018\u2026I think he really was prepared.\u2019At that moment I realized. This guy had been waiting for this moment like me.\u2018He deliberately waited for the trainer\u2019s feedback.\u2019If we just said that we should go pure and innocent like the original song, there would definitely be those who object to it.It would also block the possibility of the main dancer role going to Seon Ahyun,\u00a0 who was a better fit for the original song.He picked the meeting cut like this and took the leader\u2019s impact.It was no ordinary skill.But how unfortunate. It was useless for this guy to paint a big picture.Because my opinion was better.Let\u2019s make an excuse first.\u201cThe idea is good, but if it goes wrong, it might look like a mockery of the original song.\u201dIn the end, the song still belonged to senior idols. Who knew what we would hear if we crossed the line and looked ridiculous.Of course, this objection was not expected, Big Sejin replied with a smile.\u201cWe just have to do our best to make sure it doesn\u2019t look like that!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t Moondae-hyung doing too much?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dAll of a sudden, Choi Wongil barged into the conversation.\u201cUm, Wongil?\u201dBig Sejin was rarely embarrassed.It was a fun development where I benefited from the one who tried attacking. You could hear the sound of the big picture being smashed.Choi Wongil poured out anger-filled remarks on Park Moondae with a gradient. It seems he was forgetting that we were surrounded by cameras.\u201cWhat kind of opinions do you have, hyung? Hyung might feel at ease since the trainee\u2019s think good of you, but you have to think about the feelings of the other team members as well. If we just do the opposite\u2026\u2026\u201dOh, that was a surprisingly plausible statement.\u201cOh, of course there is. My opinion.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it, but I think there\u2019s a way to go strong while preserving the original song\u2019s emotions\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cIs there such a thing?\u201dThe other team members shouted stupidly at the sudden idealism that popped out.In contrast to Choi Wongil\u2019s momentary disappointment at the atmosphere that was quickly resolved, Big Sejin put his hand on the back of his head awkwardly.This kid was really not normal.\u201cIf it\u2019s real, of course it\u2019s fine\u2026 but what is it?\u201dI said with a smile.\u201cMixing it with fear.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dLet\u2019s not just be flower fairies, but be flower fairies that went to America.After a brief moment of silence with an exclamation mark, a reaction erupted.\u201cUh, oh! Doesn\u2019t that actually sound good?\u201d\u201cHey, if we add a horror concept to this choreography, it\u2019s going to be really scary!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dFrom Gold 1, who shouted like a Eureka while roughly swirling the memorized choreography with his hands, to Sejin Lee, who expressed that it\u2019s better than the original taste, the responses varied, but it was mostly positive responses.If you are an aspiring idol in this age group, you would want to do something cool rather than innocent, so I thought that they would rather do horror.Big Sejin also gave a brief exclamation and nodded his head. He turned right after seeing the public opinion.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit embarrassing to talk about it right away like this, but\u2026 Do you like Moondae\u2019s opinion?\u201d\u201cWow, he abandoned his opinion and switched!\u201d\u201cAs expected, a true leader!\u201dIn an instant, the atmosphere brightened. Behind the buzzing team members, Mudy with a happy expression could be seen.Judging from the fact that the camera also catched Mudy, I think they will use that cut too\u2026\u2026 I hope it\u2019s cross-edited well.However, there was one guy who managed to break the heartwarming cutscene.Choi Wongil\u2026 close call, but that wasn\u2019t the case.When he came to his senses, he must have been worried about how his words would be edited.He tried his best to blend into the atmosphere somehow, but he also tried not to make eye contact with me because he had too much pride to apologize to me.If it were me, I would have already buried myself in the atmosphere and ended up saying that I was too harsh.We are in an atmosphere where the other person has no choice but to accept me, but I don\u2019t know why. Maybe it\u2019s because he was young, but he didn\u2019t know social life.Then who was the culprit, Seon Ahyun?\u201cGhosts! Let\u2019s go with ghosts! There are even flowers that represent dead humans.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of horror movie is it? It\u2019s too serious? Oh! There\u2019s a movie Black Swan, if you make it feel like that\u2026\u201d\u201cWow, the choreography would be really scary if we did it like that.\u201dSeon Ahyun was stuck in a corner with a depressed expression on his own in the midst of the group\u2019s happy circuit.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dPerhaps because of what the choreographer said, it seemed he couldn\u2019t restore his mental state.I had a hopeful thought for a moment that Big Sejin would come forward and make the cut of a true leader, but there was no sign of that.It seems that if Seon Ahyun came to his senses, he was afraid that he would be mistaken for being the main dancer from the former confucius buff, so he just left it alone.The rest were just guys with bright heads or lack of social skills, so in the end the only thing we didn\u2019t have to check was the overlapping positions since we didn\u2019t have any.It can be so annoying\u2026\u2026 I was frustrated at the thought that I had to do something that wasn\u2019t a part of my destiny.Anyways, it was time to take a step forward with stage quality. Let\u2019s get some words out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He seemed nervous because he thought he was in a bad condition and might hear his words.I was hoping approaching him like this was okay. I tried making the topic as gentle as possible.\u201cThen are you worried about the feedback during the choreography check?\u201dAnd then an apology came back.\u201c\u2026\u2026I-I-\u2019m sorry\u2026 I-I\u2019ll do my best\u2026.\u201dHe really was like a sunfish. His heart expanded.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry for me. And this is not to be misunderstood.\u201d\u2018Let\u2019s try to smoothly convey that the choreographer used the motivation as a personal attack because he had a personality problem.\u2019\u201cThe choreographer didn\u2019t really say that because he actually thought I was better than you. He was trying to stimulate you.\u201dIn order to create a comfortable atmosphere, I sat down near Seon Ahyun while speaking.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repost\u201cI am sure he was disappointed because he thought you could do better. Because he is a strong talker.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeon Ahyun couldn\u2019t answer because he couldn\u2019t just say \u2018No, you\u2019re better at it\u2019. Did he think my words were plausible?\u201cD-Do you, r-really think that\u2026 I can do well?\u201d\u201cHm?\u201dWas he asking me?I guess he had asked this after calculating that there was no way to say \u2018The choreographers are the choreographers and I don\u2019t agree\u2019\u2026I crossed my arms and spoke calmly.\u201cWhy would I lie to you?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dSeon Ahyun swallowed his saliva and asked in a slightly anticipated voice.\u201cT-T-Then\u2026 how can I do w-well\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026are you asking for my opinion?\u201d\u201cY-Yes!\u201dSeon Ahyun eagerly nodded his head.\u2018Are you asking for advice from a beginner who started his career by auditioning?\u2019I tried to hide my cold feeling, and came up with a theory based on Seon Ahyun\u2019s status window.\u201cI think you\u2019re thinking too much.\u201dSeon Ahyun seemed shocked.\u201cU-U-Uselessly\u2026\u201d\u201cI am not saying that your thoughts are useless. It just looks like you\u2019re thinking too much when you don\u2019t need to. How about clearing your head?\u201dLet\u2019s add some specific examples.\u201cJust think \u2018I\u2019m going to do this\u2019.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSeon Ahyun seemed to be immersed in his thoughts. What a contradictory response from someone who just got advised to stop thinking.Anyway, the words that came out immediately afterwards were positive.\u201cO-Okay. I\u2026 I\u2019ll try.\u201dI could see the willpower in his face, so it didn\u2019t seem like he was saying empty words.But the way he was fired up was more than I expected. The strength also entered his shoulders.Besides, he was even mumbling something\u2026 It was probably something like \u2018I can do this\u2019.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHmm, did I have any talent for advice to this extent?As soon as I had doubts, a pop-up of the status window appeared.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repost[\u2018Now that I heard it, you\u2019re right (C)\u2019 activated!]-Target: Seon Ahyun-Effect: Activation of attribute by successful persuasionI see.

It would likely start sounding even more and more like a B-Stat soon.\u2018Hmm.\u2019It was good that Seon Ahyun came to his senses and the quality of the stage improved. But we shouldn\u2019t let him work too hard on his own.\u2018Even if our positions do not overlap, it is difficult for him to eat all the buzz by himself.\u2019I think it would be best if I made a stage that could appeal to individuals.It was necessary to contribute to the quality of the stage and at the same time create an impact on myself.\u201cSo horror? If you guys do well, I think that direction will be good when I see it. What are you going to do?\u201dI raised my hand to Mudi\u2019s question, following the team members who were excited about the direction of the arrangement.\u201cI have an opinion for my part arrangement, is it okay if I tell you?\u201d\u201cOoh, Moondae~ Where?\u201d\u201cThis part.\u201dI put my finger on the lyrics.\u201cBridge.\u201dI saw that Choi Wongil, who was next to me, had his mouth wide open.Thank you for the part Wongil. I will definitely use it well.***Season 3 of <Idol Joint-stock company> was burning on the Internet with ridicules and criticism saying that it would fail.At this point, only the participants\u2019 profiles and their first performances were revealed. Although the production presentation had not been held yet, an open call to recruit audiences for the first team match was already posted on the Tnet broadcaster\u2019s website.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repostIt was due to a problem with the shooting sequence, but anyway, thanks to the overflowing buzz, the selection for audience applicants was quite competitive.And here, there was a person who broke through the competition ratio (27:1) and came to the audience proudly!\u2018You won\u2019t get caught, will you?\u201dNow that she looked at it, she didn\u2019t seem that confident.She swallowed her saliva. In her backpack she had a small bag that was easy to carry and a camera hidden under a cardigan covered with a smoke screen.There was a reason why she dared coming to the audience and hide her camera.IJC, the first stages of the season, the moment I saw \u3008It\u2019s Me\u3009 She had an intuition.This might be it!\u2018This atmosphere\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sure I\u2019m being criticised right now, but when the broadcast starts, all of this might turn into interest. As long as the kids who come out are okay!\u2019Then the value of the photo she took now would rise up to heavens!It was half a gamble. However, originally the words soaring stock gamble were dominant in her mind. Besides\u2026\u2026\u2018\u2026 If there is a really good guy, it\u2019s good to take their pictures from the beginning.\u2019At the same time, since her (former) idol was losing her pride by entering society through the back door, she wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to wash her account clean.So today she had to take as many pictures as possible. She didn\u2019t know which participant would explode on which stage.She calmly waited for the shooting to begin.The MC who used to be an actor but switched to an mc for shows, came out on the stage and delivered a few words of encouragement, the filming began.\u201cFor this stage, two teams that cover the songs of their senior idols from the same agency will face off against each other. A huge perk awaits the winning team. For the perks\u2026 Please check them out in the show!\u201dEven though people agreed to the pledge of not giving spoilers until it aired.There were many people chatting about it on the internet, so it seems they didn\u2019t want to reveal anything except the stage.\u201cIdol Joint-Stock company Season 3, the long-awaited first team battle begins now! Shine Your Star!\u201dAfter the voting method was announced, the first stage immediately began after the stage set up was done.The first stage was two teams that covered idol songs from the QuZ Entertainment, which was famous for their popular idols.\u2018Isn\u2019t it a little boring?\u2019It wasn\u2019t that bad, but overall, it couldn\u2019t be helped that it was worse than the original.She secretly took a few shots, but had no expectations. The important thing was the team with some of the participants mentioned on the internet.It was only after the second team match was over that a team worth seeing appeared.It was the team with Cha Yujin, who got the most cuts on the \u3008It\u2019s Me\u3009 stage.\u201cOh, Cha Yujin!\u201d\u201cThey are alright.\u201dSince it was a team with many familiar participants, there was a difference in the initial cheers. There were already people holding placards.Above all, he performed well.\u2018Wow, They are quite good aren\u2019t they?\u2019As if they had already debuted, he had a level of skill that was impressive, and the arrangement was also good.It was a stylish and cute version of an old song that was consumed like the top goal memes on the Internet with an overly sexy concept.In addition, not only Cha Yujin, but also the participant in charge of rapping from the same agency stood out.\u2018These two will be it.\u2019Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repostShe diligently took data centered on the two. While cleverly avoiding the eyes of the security guard who wandered in the middle from time to time.The next team to compete with this team was also interesting in a different sense because it had many well-known participants.\u2018Perhaps this would be the last place on the show?\u2019She thought it was a little exciting, but also felt a sense of regret.Now, from the next team onwards, it didn\u2019t seem like it would be fun at all.Since more than half of the players worth watching took part in the previous team performances, it seemed like the next few would be boring.And, unsurprisingly, the next stage wasn\u2019t much fun.Perhaps it was made with the remaining team members who were not selected, but only one team was evaluated using the absolute evaluation method.It was the worst stage ever.\u201cWhat.\u201d\u201cMy leg hurts.\u201dNow there were even people sneaking out from behind.He was tired and his legs hurt, so he didn\u2019t even want to see the rest of the stages.In that distracting atmosphere, the MC exclaimed.\u201cThe first team battle is getting hotter and hotter, the next in line is\u2026 the participants who covered the song of VTIC from LeTi entertainment, a global trending group that recently won the grand prize!\u201dThe MC did not even put the words mallangdalkom on their lips.That showed that they were fishing for an audience.But the effect was great.\u201cVTIC?\u201dThe audience began rattling.VTIC was the hottest male idol at the moment.The person who was about to leave stopped for a moment when he heard that songs from idols who sold 1.2 million copies initially would be sung.In the atmosphere where some expectations were restored, the MC shouted cheerfully.\u201cThe first team to go on stage, October 31!\u201dIt was a team name that reminded her of the name of an ice cream specialty store.It wasn\u2019t a name that stuck to your ears after hearing it for the first time.Originally, it was common for participants to have a poor sense of their own, so everyone leaked the team name without much inspiration.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. What song of VTIC are they covering?\u201d\u201cThe song covered by the participants is\u2026\u2026 Oh, they debuted as flower fairies, right? It\u2019s \u2018Into the New World\u2019 by a girl group that was active as a national girl group, \u2018MallangDalkom\u2019.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!?\u201dThe people were taken aback.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The pitch was lowered and a desperate voice rose up in the MR mixed with the dreary noise.The lyrics were obviously soft and mournful, but it sounded like a trap because of the prelude and directing.If you heard someone crying at a closed school, instead of wanting to help wouldn\u2019t you be more scared instead?The stage was developing with such an eerie nuance.\u2013 One step, two stepThe sound of you comingIt\u2019s ringing in my earDon\u2019t hesitate, give me your handNow I\u2019m going into the new world~The high-pitched sound of \u2018Into the New World\u2019, singing the same lyrics as the song title, thrilled one\u2019s spine.He raised his note by half and created a cacophony, so it sounded strange and evil, even though it was clear and crisp.He was the best singer ever, and she became even more immersed in the stage itself than in his singing ability.\u2013Come to meCome to meIt\u2019s dazzling, a paradise by your sideIn the chorus, the same string of instruments as the original song came in, and it clashed with the altered sound of the synthesizer, making it creepy.Jiiing-, Screech-.The movement borrowed from ballet and added a few more violent movements made it feel inhuman.At that moment she realized.October 31, October 31\u2026\u2026 , it was Halloween. A night where evil beings come to life.-Come to meCome to meMelody of love for you (continues)This was a song sung by something that wasn\u2019t human to seduce people!\u2018Haa!\u2019Her head was full of explosions as she had her mouth shut.Of course, there were idols who used inhuman concepts.However, no one would have expected that a group amateurs would make such an adventurous attempt at an idol debut audition program using a song by a female senior with the opposite concept\u2026\u2026!Without even having the time to comment \u2018They have great guts\u2019, she became immersed in the stage in an instant.Eventually, after two verses that were deformed and cut, the song entered the bridge.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repostAnd once again something unexpected popped up.-Can\u2019t you feel me?The arrangement suddenly returned to the original song at the Bridge part!Even the vocal range was back. The clear boy\u2019s voice echoed in the same high note as the original song sung by the woman.-Your warm touchWakes me up, it\u2019s beautifulSpring gardenThe beautiful orchestra accompaniment and the lighting that changed colors to make it brighter, it felt sacred at first glance.-Ooh, Ooh\u2026\u2026But as the lights got brighter, other things became clearer. Such as the details of the outfit.The fabric-like shoulder strap, which she had thought was simply dark, was actually stained with the dark red dye on the same white fabric as the costume.There were even traces that made it seem like it flowed down from the neck towards the shoulder strap.\u2018It was a vampire\u2026\u2026!\u2019The moment it was imprinted in the minds of the audience, the bridge ended and the chorus of the altered sound continued.-Come to meCome to meIt\u2019s dazzling, a paradise by your sideHowever, this time, the dissonance with the orchestra had subsided and the noise had disappeared, revealing the sadness of the lyrics.The artificial expressionlessness that was there when it wasn\u2019t their part had disappeared, and the dreamy feeling overpowered the eerie feeling.The composition\u2019s sound also revived a sense of space like a dream pop instead of sharpness.-Come to meCome to meMelody of love for you (continues)The altered sound disappeared, and the sound ended with the violin.Unlike the original song, which ended with a ballet movement, the song ended with everyone collapsing as soon as the chorus ended.In that way, the stage ended with sadness rather than fear at the end. As if the non-human narrator of the song really fell in love with a person.\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah ah ah!!\u201dThe people who came to their senses after a moment cheered enthusiastically.It was a stage that stimulated the hearts of the viewers from shock to the sad ending.If the stage was done, neither could be done.However, the participants of this team did it right.\u2018Crazy, really!\u2019Among the screaming audience, many people caught on to the fact that this was only possible because the skills of the participants were above average and their appearance and style were also good.The voices of the excited audience could be heard here and there as if they had already made up their minds.The participants who got up patted each other on the back a few times, then nodded and smiled at the audience.\u201cThank you!\u201d\u201cT-Thank you.\u201dSomehow, it felt cuter compared to what the other teams did, since the gap between the stage and after-stage was really wide.\u201cCute\u2026\u2026\u201dShe, who was holding her camera, also muttered warmly. In particular, a member with a high-pitched bridge caught her eye.That reversal bridge would definitely stay in her mind even when she went home.He broke through the pronunciation and digested the high notes incredibly well, and his face was trendy and cute, and even with that excessive concept, he didn\u2019t flinch at all.\u2018When the time for voting comes, I should remember his name.\u2019As she continued to stare at Park Moondae who was leaving the stage and promised, she suddenly realized the camera in her hand.And she was astonished.\u2018I was so focused on the stage, I completely forgot about the camera\u2026\u2026!\u2019It was a shame that she couldn\u2019t take pictures, but at the same time, she felt grateful to be able to see this live without worrying about the camera!This was the first time since her former idol.A shudder passed.It was a sign of overindulgence.***When they came down from the stage, the team members either grabbed the wall or slumped down like their legs had given in.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repostI also leaned against the wall and thought.\u2018It was fun\u2026 more than I thought.\u2019It was strange.To be honest, I had never expected it to be this fun.I had no choice but to do it since I would suddenly die if I failed to debut.I had never danced or sang in front of anyone in my life. Even with makeup on.\u2026Obviously, when popcorn was released and when I sang, It just felt like I was doing it because I had to do it.\u2018I thought I would get a reality check\u2026 Why did I have fun?\u2019Even if it felt like my breath was about to come out of my throat.\u2018It\u2019s harder than practice.\u2019I think I had to put more energy into it since it was the real deal.And, from the looks of it, the guys who climbed who went up with me were all out of breath in the same way.\u2018They are all still panting right now.\u2019But their faces were bright.This was because the shouts were loud enough to rip off their ears.\u201cWow!!\u201d\u201cEncore! Encore!\u201dI could even hear some shouting for an encore from behind me.\u2018There weren\u2019t many people.\u2019More than expected\u2026 The result was good.It was a cheer that even the teams that placed 1st and 2nd didn\u2019t receive.Maybe this was why it was fun. Because all of the reactions poured out in front of us?\u201cEveryone really\u2026 you all did a great job! We did a good job! Really!\u201dAs the camera approached, Big Sejin opened his mouth right away.I can\u2019t say he wasn\u2019t conscious of the camera, but it seemed sincere anyways.Originally, it was said that if the result was good, it would be glorified, and the team members all started to thank each other while embracing each other.\u201cThank you for your hard work!\u201d\u201cT-Thank you so much\u2026\u201dI also had to say something.\u201cThanks\u2026 it was fun. Thank you.\u201d\u201cMoondae\u2026\u201d\u201cOh my God, even Moondae says things like this.\u201dWhat did they mean?I was moved by every word about how impressed these guys were.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repostEven that grumpy Lee Sejin was drunk on the atmosphere with a teary look.\u201c\u2026Great Job.\u201d\u201cHuh. Hyungnim.\u201d\u201cI am touched.\u201dThe team members rarely looked at Lee Sejin with warm eyes without being conscious of the camera.The atmosphere was very similar to the ending of a boy\u2019s manhwa.I thought of the last practice session.-Hyung! Let\u2019s strengthen the fear! Shouldn\u2019t we go strong? Don\u2019t be swayed by innocence!-Right? Hyung thought about it,what about a murderer!-Ooh~ Count!-\u2026It might overlap with a real person, so why not think of a fantasy creature?-G-Ghosts are\u2026\u2026-\u2026Ghost?-Uuh, I-If you move like this\u2026 It would look interesting\u2026\u2026-Hahaha! There are a lot of good opinions~ Let\u2019s decide by a majority voting!\u2026\u2026\u2026All I could think of was the painstaking process of euphemizing the absurd and exaggerated claims made by these talkative men.At that time I was grateful to Big Sejin. He made the public talking easier.In the end, most of the arrangement proceeded according to the wishes of me and Big Sejin. This was because he also tried to push the vampire option.Even so, it was more popular than ghosts and murderers.What if it was a ghost, or murderer? Were they thinking of getting cursed for sharing 10,000 units on SNS?Anyway, I was satisfied with the good results of properly arranging fear and innocence.And honestly\u2026\u2026It was fun.I can see why so many people wanted to do this job.As I took a breath and got up, my teammates surrounded me in an embrace.I shrugged. Without it, the atmosphere would not be lively.It was also necessary to show off teamwork on camera, so I didn\u2019t get out of it.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the next team match.\u201d\u201cOh, let\u2019s do it together next time!\u201d\u201cI-I-It\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cHonestly, our teamwork was the best.\u201dOnly read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repostThe congratulations continued, and only when there was no more repertoire, we were moved to the area to check the opposing team\u2019s stage according to the guidance of the staff.As soon as we arrived at the room where the monitor was installed, the opposing team\u2019s \u3008King of the mountains\u3009 stage began.\u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u201dThese guys were admiring out of courtesy, but they probably realized it.That there was a significant difference in the audience\u2019s cheers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the first place the team had Ryu Cheongwoo who suited the song well, and they were above average compared to the other teams stages.However, the audience wouldn\u2019t be comparing them with another team in their heads.But instead with VTIC.This was the problem that came with covering the latest hit songs from same gender groups. The original stage was imprinted in the minds of many brains.Even if there was one that was better than VTIC, it wouldn\u2019t easily be recognised. The fans of VTIC were all over the internet.In most cases, it would be buried under the opinions such as \u2018It cannot be compared with VTIC\u2019.Of course, putting all that aside\u2026\u2026 we still did a better job.The stage members seemed to have known that, since their faces were bright as we went back up to the stage for greeting before the voting.The MC introduced all the teams in order of performance.\u201cAh, our \u2018October 31\u2019 Team! The stage was so chilling and fun like Halloween! That\u2019s what the name of the team meant right?\u201d\u201cYeah! It means the cuties of halloween! And there is also another meaning.\u201dOnly read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repost\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cLike 31 flavors of ice cream, each of our team members has a variety of charms!\u201dBig Sejun looked back at the team members with a flower pose. The other members quickly posed for the introduction.I also\u2026\u2026 put my finger on my cheek moderately.In reality, it would be rare for people my age to do this unless they were drunk or trying to tease someone by making them feel disgusted, but I had no face left for the sake of survival.\u201cAaah!!\u201d\u201cCute!\u201dFortunately, there were no solemn responses. It was fortunate that I raised Park Moondae\u2019s visual stats.B- barely gave off a \u2018warm\u2019 or \u2018pretty\u2019 appearance.Then the team introductions continued with the opposing team.\u201cHello! I am\u2026\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t embarrassing but I could feel the other team\u2019s nervousness because of the difference in cheers.\u201cNice to meet you. I am Ryu Cheongwoo!\u201d\u201cKyaaa!!\u201dOne thing for sure was that the cheers for Ryu Cheongwoo were quite loud, but it wasn\u2019t enough to help their team win.\u201cShareholders! Please show us your wishes! Please vote for the team you think did it better! \u2018October 31st\u2019 is number 1! \u2018Mountain Hero\u2019* is number 2!\u201d(*Mountain Hero/ A hero deep in the mountains. Its a kid song(nursery rhyme?) in Korea.\u00a0Link Here)He pointed to each team and assigned them a number with his fingers.As soon as the audience pressed the buttons on the remote control, the voting ended and another voting method was announced.\u201cOkay, next, you have to pick the participant you liked the most from each team!\u201dThe MC emphasized once again.\u201cAgain, it\u2019s not across both teams! You just have to pick one person per team, a total of 2 people!\u201dThis was obviously a seed of uproar.Perhaps the production team wanted to create a stimulating development, but the reward for the individual voting within a team was better than the team reward.He even gave such explosive news before the stage rehearsal without notice in advance.-Everyone! The reward for the \u2018individual voting\u2019 of this team match is\u2026\u2026 an exemption from elimination!-\u2026\u2026What?!So there were lots of complaints from the other teams.Fortunately, this team didn\u2019t have much chance for conflicts. Seon Ahyun was a pushover, and Gold 1 and 2 did not have enough courage to speak out even if they did have complaints.Lee Sejin was already overwhelmed trying to sing his part, and Choi Wongil had already broken everyone\u2019s spirits once so he wouldn\u2019t speak out again.Big Sejin also wouldn\u2019t have many complaints since in the end he secured himself the role of the main dancer.Looking at it like this, didn\u2019t it seem like there weren\u2019t any conflicts because everyone was overwhelmed with their own problems and not because of our teamwork?That\u2019s right. But that didn\u2019t matter since it would look like it was because of teamwork on camera.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repostAnyways, the individual voting ended in a more ambiguous atmosphere than the first voting.\u201cThank you!\u201dAfter a short greeting, the participants started leaving the stage. Of course that included me as well.Oddly enough, I felt a small sense of sadness while going down.***Filming ended in middle of the night.\u201cGreat job everyone~\u201d\u201cLooks like we did a good job!\u201dEveryone was disappointed to hear that the results of the individual voting would be announced at the ranking announcement ceremony, but they quickly settled their minds.Because it was the same last season, it must have been half-anticipated, and some might have felt comfortable since we won the team match anyways.Yes. We won the team match.-For the team match\u2026 It\u2019s a victory for October 31! The score is a whopping 82 to 401!\u2013 My god!!With a crazy score of \u201982 to 401\u2032.When it was announced, everyone was astonished for 5 seconds before they started cheering.With the exception of Big Sejin, the others were on the verge of tears, so there was nothing more to say.But these guys quickly had no choice but to calm down quickly.\u2013 Ughhh\u2026\u2026.-\u2026 Dongyun-ah.-Good job, you did a good job.There were real cries coming from the participants of the other team.It was not easy for someone who was less sad than the ones crying to be the first to cry. Even more so if it were tears of joy.Thanks to this, the team members, who were conscious of the camera and the opposing team, were in a state of maintained and ambiguous joy, but as soon as the filming was over, they were in a state of extreme excitement.\u201cShall we set up a group chat? We worked so hard together~ we should have a group chat together!\u201d\u201cHey, that\u2019s great!\u201d\u201cI agree, leader.\u201dUnder Big Sejin\u2019s leadership, there was even a group chat created.Surprisingly, even Lee Sejin gave him his number without making a fuss as he was in the mood.\u201cCreated!\u201d\u201cWoah! Hyungnim!\u201d\u201cWow~ all our team members can talk like this!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEventually, I naturally exchanged numbers and entered the group chat.\u2026\u2026I should turn off the notifications.\u201cMoondae~ You\u2019ve worked hard!\u201d\u201cOh, you worked hard as a leader too.\u201dBig Sejin spoke to me as I was packing my luggage. After everything was finished, I was properly polite, so he ate it up.\u201cHaha, I was a good leader!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI didn\u2019t know that this guy was so humble\u2026\u2026\u201cI was joking, joking!\u201dBig Sejin smiled brightly. It didn\u2019t seem like it, so I hoped he would stop.\u201cLet\u2019s see each other often. Keep in touch often!\u201d\u201cUm, Okay.\u201dIt seems Big Sejin was thinking of putting me in his line.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repost\u2018It seems he is planning to break off from the other participants from the same agency since they are not that good.\u2019However, I did not forget that this guy was a drug lord candidate. I had no intention of taking any risk until my suspicions were completely resolved.\u2018I\u2019ll skip it and say later that my phone was broken.\u2019Just as I was thinking about it, another voice came in from the side.\u201cM-Me too! C-C-Contact\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cShall we call you?\u201dSeon Ahyun nodded vigorously. He was probably better than Big Sejin.I nodded, and Seon Ahyun\u2019s face brightened. Big Sejin said with a smile.\u201cShould the three of us create a separate group chat? It would be nice to have a group chat with someone of the same age line.\u201dDid he have to bring it up like this?However, thanks to Seon Ahyun\u2019s quick approval, another group chat was opened in an instant.An ominous feeling passed by.I was in a hurry to finish the stage right away, so I put it off, but it bothered me that there were quite a few cases last season where votes came in and the participants were tied up together from the first team match.Could it be that I would be tied up with these guys together as a set?(T/N: Yes)\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI didn\u2019t know. Anyway, the team match seems to have gone well, so it was likely that I would pass the first round.\u201cEveryone, go home safely~\u201d\u201cSee you again!\u201dAfter saying goodbye to the participants, they left the filming set. I also walked out and took the bus.When I get back to the temporary studio, I\u2019ll have to look for reviews of the Team match right away.***The audience usually signed a pledge not to leak contents of the stage until the show aired.However, it was rare for a spoiler ban to be properly followed anywhere.So, reviews came up one after another on anonymous sites where personal information were not revealed.It was roughly like this.========================[Review of RJC* from the audience]: The MallangDalkom group killed it(*= In Chapter 9 and 10 I put this as MJC, but RJC is a better translation, so it refers to the show as \u2018Ruin Joint-Stock Company\u2019 instead of IJC(Idol Joint-Stock Company))========================-Who the hell are these guys, they keep popping up\u221fFor Real?\u221fNono, how were they really awesome?\u221fNo, how can you make MallangDalkom awesome, did they also dance poppin popcorn.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repostIt was unexpected.No matter how much I thought about it, I assumed that the team with Cha Yujin who was the number 1 would have the most mentions, but it seems our team somehow got more mentions.Of course, it seemed that about half of them were not actual audience members, but rather people who wanted to jump onto the bandwagon of mocking \u3008Idol Joint-stock Company\u3009.However, it meant that we left an impression on quite a few people anyways.I picked some good reviews and read them.========================[First Team Match, writing what I remember]\u2026And the kids who sang the debut song of MallangDalkom did really well, they could debut as they are. They have good physical teamwork, the only one that was slightly off was Lee Sejin1, but he saved it with the atmosphere\u2026\u2026 I wonder who came up with the idea.Oh that\u2019s right, the high notes were great, I think we can get a main vocalist from here.+I will be attaching a proof picture to show I am not faking it. (blurred stage photo)========================\u221fSo who else was there besides Lee Sejin\u221fYou said they did a good job but you can\u2019t remember who the other members were hahaha, alright fake, next\u221fYeah it\u2019s not fake, come see the proof shots hahahaLooking at the member profiles now and matching the faces, Seon Ahyun was there. He was so f*cking good. If there was a center system he would 100% be the center.\u221fBut I\u2019m really curious as to how they did it\u3160\u3160 MallangDalkom\u2019s debut song was so cringy.\u221fThey did it with a occult theme, it gave me the goosebumps\u221f??\u221fNo it was a robot concept\u221fHahaha, ignore the agitation, it was a fairy concept\u221fNono it was a werewolf concept\u221fNo, it was a vampire\u221fWhich one is the right one, you crazy f*ckers\u3160\u3160\u221fThe fairy is right lol\u201cThe post is ruined.\u201dWhen I checked other posts, the same trolls from before intervened and it became a game.Only read this at europalation.wordpress.com, please do not repostIt would probably stay like this until the broadcast because of all the trolls, but it was better like this. Wouldn\u2019t it be more interesting if they didn\u2019t know the details?And since the producers would definitely look at the internet public opinion, there was a high probability that these overflowing mentions would be a good thing for the team.\u2018It\u2019s enough to just look at the reaction\u2026\u2026\u2019Now let\u2019s take a look at the next priority I have to deal with.I recalled the pop-up that came to mind as soon as the stage was over.[Successful stage!]You impressed the majority!-Number of audience: 582 (Updated!)-Impressed rate: 81% (Updated!): Rare Attribute Draw\u00a0\u00a0Click!The explanation was longer than before. Perhaps the ratio for number of audience to people impressed rate gave better characteristics each time there was a new record.Both of the characteristics I\u2019ve used so far have worked, so being able to draw a characteristic once per stage was a good reward.If I didn\u2019t debut in a year, I would die, so this was a good balance.\u2018\u2026\u2026Hmm, thinking about it like this makes me angry all of a sudden.\u2019Other than that, I leveled up one level because of achieving the achievement of 500 dance practices while preparing for the first team match.However, I waited before distributing it to a stat. This was because I was planning on investing it in the most efficient way according to the content of the next shoot.\u2018So, let\u2019s keep this one, and go back to drawing characteristics.\u2019When I clicked draw, a slot machine appeared as expected. It seems that I was slowly getting used to this shape.The slot machine turned as usual, then stopped at the brass letters.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was a bit disappointing that it missed the silver part which only had a few spaces and had a higher grade and stopped at the brass colored letters.\u2018You can\u2019t always be lucky.\u2019Moreover, content was more important than grade.I quickly cleared my mind and checked the effects of the winning characteristic.[Characteristic: \u2018Look at me! (D)\u2019 Acquired!]People will pay a little more attention to your actions.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI was at a loss for words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Keun (\ud070) means big/strong so in some places it will still be written as Big, however name wise I will use a full Korean version which is Keun Sejin.Of course, a talent that attracts attention in the entertainment industry would be considered important. After all, there were many cases where a brief moment on the stage changed someone\u2019s career.However, looking at both the title and its contents, erasing the impression that this characteristic only worked on those who were already interested was a bit hard to do.Especially since the exact amount of increase was not mentioned. It was simply \u2018A little more\u2019.\u201cCan I use this vague expression in the status window?\u201dIs that why this was a D-class characteristic?However, the miracle of the status window interacting with my complaints didn\u2019t happen.I finally accepted reality.Okay. A characteristic that attracted attention\u2026 It\u2019s good. It would be great if it helped me debut.Diiing!The moment I got rid of the status window, a vibration came from my phone. I quickly checked to see if it was someone contacting from the production team.But it wasn\u2019t.\u201cHuh.\u201dIt was a messenger talk.[Lee Sejin (Big): MoondaeMoondae, do you not check the group chat? Hahaha.][Lee Se-in (Big): You are so cold when you don\u2019t reply or read the messages that I am feeling cold.]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI should have turned off the notification for my personal messenger too, but I didn\u2019t think of it. I had already read the message, so ignoring it could end up with my collar being grabbed when we face each other in the future.[Me: I don\u2019t usually look at my phone. I\u2019m sorry][Lee Sejin (Big): Hey, what are you apologizing for? It\u2019s embarrassing hahaha][Lee Sejin (Big): Please check the group chat soon man!]Was there any special news?I checked the group chat. There were over 500 new messages in the group that had the members from the last team match.Of course, I didn\u2019t intend on reading them all. I scrolled all the way down and only looked at the most recent conversation.The team members were screenshotting and sharing comments from the last stage audition.From the looks of it, someone had said the words \u2018Everyone on this team is handsome~\u2019 and it seems that the social life here included everyone going back and forth saying how their hyungnim and aunim* were handsome.(T/N: Aunim = \uc544\uc6b0\ub2d8, a word that means younger brother and is used as a honorific to address people younger, though Nomdongsaeng ( \ub0a8\ub3d9\uc0dd) seems to be a more common way of saying that)Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost[Lee Sejin (Big): That\u2019s right, I see that Moondae also gets handsomer every time I see him on TV.][Lee Sejin (Big): Please think of our friendship and share your dermatologist]It\u2019s all thanks to leveling up, kid.Of course, I can\u2019t say that, so I just sent him saying I didn\u2019t go one.This guy who used words like \u2018requesting confirmation\u2019 to ask for a dermatologist\u2026\u2026.Maybe it\u2019s just me. I was very tired.At that moment, another vibration came.[Seon Ahyun: Moondae-ya, are you doing well? Thank you for always treating me well even in the first team match. I will definitely repay you next time\u2026\u2026(see more)]A lengthy message showed up in the group chat.Like a lie, suddenly everyone stopped posting a message.It was unbearably quiet.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAfter a short reply for human reasons, I immediately turned off the data.When I see them again during the next shoot\u2026 I must say that I can\u2019t see their messages because I don\u2019t have wifi at home.There were five days left until the production presentation, the next shooting.***Production presentation, a promotional event held before the 1st episode airs.In fact, the 77 participants had little to do as individuals. All we had to do was sing \u3008It\u2019s Me\u3009 and get some pictures taken of ourselves.Of course, the important thing here was the \u2018getting pictures taken\u2019 part.This is because it has already been proven that the photos taken at this production presentation could play a big role in preoccupying the early turnout.\u2018Thanks to you, I got paid and took some pictures.\u2019Instead of just taking pictures and selling them, I would take requests of what to take, so the pay was pretty good.Anyway, to express how I felt standing at such a production presentation\u2026\u2026. Yes.\u2018I\u2019ve seen all the faces here somewhere.\u2019I was familiar with the faces of the people who were holding their own cameras behind the reporters.I think I had sat next to the majority of them during an event at least once.To do some analysing\u2026 Let\u2019s see, first of all, I saw the guys selling pictures one by one across the street.Except for that, most of them were fans of existing idols. And besides that, half were looking for a new idol to be interested in while the other half were here just for fun.For that reason, there weren\u2019t that many people who only took pictures of one particular person.After taking a picture in a way that about three or so participants can fit into one shot, I could see the lens moving slightly, whether perhaps they were going to crop each one.Anyways, there were more people than expected.Slowly, the atmosphere of this program becoming successful by making the controversy a hot topic was secretly being created.\u2018Unfortunately, even if I use the remaining points on Park Moondae\u2019s appearance, I can\u2019t go higher than B.\u2019The benefits of the production presentation would most likely go to those who have A- or higher for their visual star, so I had to work hard on the \u2018It\u2019s me\u2019 performance..\u2018As expected, the face is the trend\u2026\u2026.\u2019The brief regret of not increasing the visual stats first passed by.\u201cWe\u2019ll start after the reporters enter!\u201dAs we lined up in the formation we rehearsed at dawn on the outdoor lawn, the staff shouted for us to wait a minute.As I was warming up my legs using the interlude, someone unexpectedly spoke to me.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u201cI saw your stage.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dIt was Cha Yujin who stood diagonally in front of me. If my memory is correct, this was the participant who would take first place this season.\u2018But what is he saying out of nowhere?\u2019I remembered that moment. It was like this last time.Sometime during the filming of the broadcast stage for \u3008It\u2019s Me\u3009, Cha Yujin suddenly asked me if I couldn\u2019t dance, and I answered that he could judge it by looking at the stage.Maybe this stage story was an extension of that conversation.If we talk about the stage between the participants now, there is a high probability that it will be the first team battle due to the timing.If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll just have to admit it. It was good to think for myself. But still, it was just as absurd.It\u2019s not even a boy\u2019s manhwa\u2026 Did he feel some sense of rivalry?And even more unexpectedly, Cha Yujin raised his thumb.\u201cYou did a great job!\u201d\u201cOh, thank you.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s team up next time.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s possible, then why not.\u201dNo matter what this guy is thinking, it was really good to team up together.I simply said okay without asking or questioning. Even if it was just empty words, there was no need to pay attention to it.The conversation with Cha Yujin ended there.\u201cT-this\u2026\u2026 would you like some?\u201d\u201cOh, thank you.\u201d\u201cGasp! Ahyun, don\u2019t you have anything for me?\u201d\u201cWow, after he quit being the leader Keun Sejin can barely feed his stomach.\u201d\u201cH-here.\u201dI took the jelly from Seon Ahyun who was nearby, chewed it, and finished warming up my legs.While I was listening to all the noise coming from the gold team members, the staff gave out the signal.\u201cGet ready~\u201dThe week before the tiring of the first week of filming soon flowed out.Anyway, this stage would definitely be on Youtube, so let\u2019s avoid choreography mistakes.***As soon as I safely finished the stage of \u3008It\u2019s Me\u3009 and left, I heard someone shout.\u201cMoondae-ya!\u201dWere they calling out for Park Moondae?When I turned my head to check it out, it was one of the people with a camera.The woman in the hoodie seemed to constantly press the shutter as soon as I turned around.\u2026\u2026Was she only taking pictures of me? When I inadvertently pointed my hand towards my face, the woman shouted again.\u201cMoondae-ya! Give me a heart!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI never thought a day where I heard those words would come.But opportunity was opportunity, so I somehow made a finger heart and lifted it up.It was a little\u2026\u2026 Embarrassing.\u201cPoke your cheek! Poke your cheek, too!\u201dOn the side, Seon Ahyun was trying to sneak out to the other side. He seems to have already suffered from the camera calling for him before the stage.I winked.\u2018You do it too.\u2019It would be less embarrassing if even one more person joined me.As if he properly received the signal, Seon Ahyun came back creaking. And in the meantime, Keun Sejin came in between us.\u201cWhat are you two doing? Ah, a photo~\u201dHe raised the spoon well.I was hoping I wouldn\u2019t have to put my arm on someone else\u2019s shoulders, but I decided to put up with it since there was a camera.So suddenly, the three of us put our arms around each other\u2019s shoulders and took a picture.\u2018In the end, we are taking pictures in three even before the first episode.\u2019It\u2019s been a while since we opened the group chat together.It was a bit uncomfortable, but I decided not to avoid it since it had already spilled water since the first team match.Anyway, as the woman slightly took her eyes off the camera to check if she got a decent shot, I could see her face.Uh\u2026\u2026.She was the one who bought me some data.When it was difficult to shoot an event in person due to the schedule, there were quite a few homepage masters who bought it, edited it, and uploaded it as if it were their own.Well, that person was also in demand.Let\u2019s see, I remember him being sarcastic saying that I had no conscience about my prices, maybe because I was a data seller.\u2026\u2026Still, I never took pictures of anything personal like airport trips.If the data did not sell, I would post it free of charge in the fan community or youtube.\u2018Well\u2026\u2026 Anyway, I didn\u2019t have much to say even if I was cursed at.\u2019Even if the companies left it alone for business purposes, it is true that this was an area that ignored their personal rights.Maybe it was because of that crime that I would suddenly die if I couldn\u2019t debut.As if someone was telling me to experience how the idols felt as they were being photographed.\u201cPark Moondae is really cute!!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dWow\u2026 I really was not used to it.Come to think of it, the male idol I was filming was involved in a drunk driving accident at the end of last year.\u2018He was the main vocalist\u2026\u2026.\u2019Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostMaybe Park Moondae\u2026 I guess it will change.I waved my hand as I was engrossed in this strange feeling.Anyway, the production presentation data was precious, so I hoped that they would work hard to film it.\u2018It would be better if they uploaded the photos before Friday.\u2019Because this friday, the first episode of \u3008Re-listed! Idol Joint-Stock company\u3009 would air.***Tnet Headquarters. The editing room located in the corner of the 9th floor was full of office workers who stayed up all night.Ryu Seorin, who recruited Park Moondae was one of them.\u201cSeorin, your eyes are red. Have some coffee.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have time. Just give me the coffee.\u201dIt was her 7th cup today.The faces of everyone who was looking at the video data while drinking coffee like water were exhausted.Ryu Seorin\u2019s shooter Jeon sighed.\u201cEditing the first episode is important.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes. You can see the direction of the program.\u201dWhat to show and what to cut.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s fun when there is a story for everything.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fun when people can immerse themselves in it even if they started watching without having an opinion for it.\u201dIt was fun when there was a narrative in an audition program. And if the narrative was easy to read, viewers would stick with it.This was almost considered orthodoxy.\u201cThat\u2019s right. So\u2026 Think up until the 4th episode, and then we can build there from the 1st episode.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The result of the first team fight will be the ending of the episode\u2026 We have to catch the flow of the story and the characters of the kids.\u201dOf course. Neither Ryu Seorin, or her shooter had the authority to decide that.\u2018After all, the most important thing is what the main producer thinks.\u2019She took her hands off the video for a moment.\u201cAre you going to rest?\u201d\u201c\u2026I want to make a suggestion.\u201d\u201cOh, editing?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHmm~ It\u2019s okay. You did that in season 1too\u2026\u2026 Was it Lee Go-yoon? PD Jung accepted what you said about editing that general participant.\u201dShould she give it a try too? At the words of shooter Jeon, Ryu Seorin snorted inwardly.\u2018I did it because the timing was good.\u2019Now was just that time.Fatigue-stricken people would sometimes forget their sense of authority because of their comradeship.\u201cThis time\u2026 well, I don\u2019t have any kids to push for, so it\u2019s a good suggestion.\u201d\u201cYes. You just need to think about the ratings.\u201dSince the previous season ended prematurely due to controversy, there were hardly any requests from powerful agencies.If so, what kind of participant should be shown so that viewers would feel catharsis when the teamfight is aired.\u201cIt\u2019s important to get a kid that people like, but you also need a kid they don\u2019t like. How about talking about that? You\u2019re good at it.\u201dThere were bones in the playful words. Ryu Seorin shrugged her shoulders.\u201cHey, what kind of production crew makes all those things? People are like that. I want to keep liking the kids I like, and keep hating the ones I hate.\u201dOnly read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u201cHmm.\u201dWhen tied up by the crew, the shooter Jeon bit her mouth.\u201cWe\u2019re just making it easier for viewers to immerse themselves.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dThe shooter Jeon gently lowered his tail. This was because Ryu Seorin definitely knew what she was doing.So, she changed the topic and started again as if she knew everything.\u201cIs that why you chose an underdog this time? That\u2019s because the editor has a lot to touch.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dUnderdog effect.Just as David defeated Goliath, it meant being enthusiastic about the thrilling reversal of the weak beating the strong.And it was one of the most interesting narratives an audition program could show.Of course, it took a lot of tweaking by the editor to get the right effect. It had to be well put together.\u201cAre you going to suggest them? He is attracting some attention.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 look.\u201dRyu Seorin shed a little, but she was virtually positive.\u2018No matter how much I think about it\u2026\u2026I have to give it to them.\u2019Ryu Seorin had already made up her mind as she recalled the video she watched.\u201cFighting~\u201dShe responded moderately to shooter Jeon who kept saying things she didn\u2019t even enjoy, and went to the main PD to talk to her.\u201cHere, PD-nim,\u201dAnd, she was half-sure that she was probably thinking the same thing as the main PD.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was just me too.Gold 1, 2, and Keun Sejin must have gotten tired of chatting among themselves, so they came all the way here and put up with it.\u201cMoondae-hyung, how do you feel about the first episode?\u201d\u201cAh~ you say you\u2019re ready to become an evaluation legend?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing! Moondae-ssi!\u201d\u201cStop\u2026\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t even ignore the nonsense where they said my life was a legend\u2026\u2026I want to drink something cold.\u2018\u2026\u2026Oh, there\u2019s a drink.\u2019Now that I looked at it, there was an ionized drink under each seat. Seeing that the brand is clearly visible, I think they finally got the PPL.It was a generic maker, but it was probably a brand. I took the drink and gulped it down.And I almost spit it out.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI can see why they put the PPL.It tasted horrible.\u201cThe countdown is coming up soon! Start shouting at 10!\u201dFollowing the staff\u2019s shout, the logo disappeared from the beam projector screen up front and a number appeared.\u201c10! 9! 8!\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen the countdown ended and the melody of the theme song \u3008It\u2019s me\u3009 started playing, cheers and applause erupted from all over the place.And with that, the long-awaited episode 1 aired.***The first episode was shown for 2 hours as a special program.This meant that the participants sat on iron chairs for 120 minutes and did not move except for broadcast reactions.But I don\u2019t think the participants were concerned about that.There was only one thing that mattered.\u2018How long did I show up on the TV?\u2019Of course, there must have been many more disappointed participants.How was I?Well, after the filming is over, let\u2019s review the contents with the reactions I find on the Internet.First of all, there were all kinds of reactions on the internet, including articles criticizing \u3008IJC\u3009 and best comments, were openly sent on the screen.And the subtitles appeared.[Many controversies!][Really, How did the actual shooting for \u3008Re-listed! Idol Joint-Stock Company\u3009 go?]Viewers reacted the same as before.In other words, they kept on watching the broadcast while cursing.\u2013 No, to show this kind of thing without skipping it, as expected of the cable class Ha-It feels like I am chewing on Mala flavored popcorn\u2013 This is so boring, just show the kids.Fortunately, the opening passed quickly, and the first participant appeared.[Ah~ I\u2019m so nervous!]\u2018Oh, Choi Wongil.\u2019Yes. The group evaluation that Choi Wongil belonged to was aired first. Choi Wongil received quite a bit of a portion since he was the typical youngest.\u2018I remember the first participant was someone else.\u2019And the first participant did not receive a portion after that.\u2018He won\u2019t show up in the future either.\u2019Overall, it was like that.It had been independently selected by the production team. Some participants didn\u2019t even get a proper reaction cut.Interestingly enough, the participants who were members of my previous group received quite a bit of portion.Starting with Choi Wongil, Keun Sejin, as well as Gold 1 and 2\u2019s evaluation was broadcasted before the first part was over.It felt good. When entering a team fight, it was good to start with a good team.\u2018Of course, the most important thing is that my portion is long.\u2019If my evaluation was not edited, it would be in the first episode in order.And luckily it came out.[Next participant, enter now!]My portion first appeared at the end of Part 1.It was a strange feeling to see Park Moondae walking up to the stage on the screen. It felt like I was watching someone imitate the actions I took.Behind me, Keun Sejin and Golds started hitting me on the back and holding my shoulder.They made it so I had no room for immersion.\u201cHey, hey, you\u2019re coming out! Can you see it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Uh, it\u2019s me.\u201dIf they shook me a bit more, I wouldn\u2019t be able to see even if I had eyes, so stop.I couldn\u2019t say that, so I gave a moderate response and focused on the screen again. There was a conversation with the judges.[Yes, participant. Please introduce yourself.][\u2026\u2026My name is Park Moondae. I look forward to your kind cooperation.]Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostAs soon as Park Moondae finished his greeting on stage, the interview was immediately inserted. It was a positive sign because it was proof that the ball went into editing.[Q: Is there anything you want to say?][Park Moondae: No. (silence)][Park Moondae: There is nothing special.]The BGM without laughter and low sound effects were a bonus.\u201c\u2026\u2026Well.\u201dLet\u2019s see\u2026\u2026 This must have been my answer to the question of whether I had any dissatisfaction with the team members.Why did they put it up here?It was an edit that made me take back the word positive within 7 seconds.\u2018This is cheap.\u2019The absurd reactions of the judges showed up more exaggeratedly on the screen.[No, that\u2019s all?][Yes. I do not have any experience to introduce.]As soon as the answer was finished, another interview cut appeared.[Park Moondae: (Before this show) I have no experience in the entertainment industry.][Q: Have you received any training?][Park Moondae: None.]I thought I was X\u2019ed here.I had deliberately mentioned it was difficult to adjust on purpose out of fear of my answer being cut out, but I didn\u2019t know it would turn into a short answer at all.At this time, the Internet reaction was also brutal.\u2013 The answer is so insincere.-Concept?-He doesn\u2019t seem motivated, but why are you crawling out as a newbie;;\u2013 It would be funny if he was like the king because he is not good at it.And all the absurd whispers of the judges on the screen came out with subtitles.[Ah, looking at the application form here, there really isn\u2019t anything.][Yeah.]The stiff facial expressions and whispering cuts of the participants who were previously judged passed in an instant. I was curious as to where those cuts were from.The next words of the judges had a screen effect as if they were saying something sarcastic.[Then let\u2019s check out your performance.][Yes]On the screen, Park Moondae grabbed the microphone and the accompaniment flowed out.And when the first verse started coming out[Ding ding! It\u2019s the sound of an ice purifier~]An advertisement came out.It was a cable privilege, a mid-advertisement.\u201cOMG!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much bro.\u201dExaggerated reactions and worries poured out around me.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u2018The guy who didn\u2019t have a single appearance yet is worried about me?\u2019The atmosphere was too burnt, I think it was the camera\u2019s fault.I answered bluntly.\u201cIt\u2019s okay as long as I show up on the TV.\u201dOf course it was bullshit. Whatever I actually did, it was over with the editing.However\u2026\u2026I laughed inwardly.\u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to kill me at all.\u2019The fact that the advertisement was placed in the middle of the evaluation meant that it was okay to cut off the flow once.In other words, what comes after the ad won\u2019t annoy viewers.The short interim advertisement soon ended, and the previous scene started flowing again.By this time, public opinion on the Internet was hitting the ground.\u2013 I\u2019m not really curious about it, but there\u2019s even an advertisement.\u2013 Ah, give the dose to the kids who are good, not the ones who aren\u2019t.\u2013 I don\u2019t accept someone with a normal concept\u2013 I don\u2019t want to see you in survival anymoreAnd the moment Park Moondae, who grabbed the microphone, started singing, the comments stopped for a moment.[I remember the me that I used to know\u2026\u2026][\u2026!!]Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostThe images of the judges who widened their eyes and the participants who suddenly raised their heads were cross edited in.-?\u2013 What\u2013 Eh\u2013 Why are you so good?\u2013 Hahahahaha, he is doing wellTo be honest, I was just as perplexed as the internet reaction.\u2018\u2026\u2026You\u2019re good.\u2019With the editing added, it came out as if some kind of hermit genius appeared in the audition.Even the vague hand movements that couldn\u2019t possibly be called choreography were cut off so well, it looked plausible.It was a much more favorable edit than I expected.\u2018I guess they were trying to create a fun reversal by killing expectations in the beginning and then showing a good stage.\u2019[As if everyday is a PARTY, ooh~]During the high note in the second half, there was even a cut of judge Mudy covering her mouth.\u2018I don\u2019t think that\u2019s from my evaluation?\u2019Did they cut it off from an interview and offset it like this?While I was shivering, the public opinion on the Internet turned around in an instant.\u2013 Wow, he is really good.\u2013 The feeling of wanting to escape from fully giving in\u2013 Wow, the high notes are amazing\u2013 His voice is so good hahahaha, I\u2019m embarrassed\u2013 It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019veseen someone who sings Party in me well \u3160\u3160 Is he called Park Moondae? I am going to buy his stocksThe production team even added a brief silence after the song ended.[Thank you for listening.][\u2026\u2026]The close-up of the other participants\u2019 reactions along with the silence turned the scene into a needlessly dramatic one.The explosive reactions of the judges that followed were also quickly illuminated one by one, and large subtitles were added to the words of the choreographer as if they were famous sayings.[You, You know that you did a good job right!?][\u2026I practiced hard to sing well.][No, this is just something you are born with. You have talent.]If there is a problem, it is that my reaction to those words was very boring since they edited it like that.And it was probably on purpose.[Then, you never had any special lessons before?][Yes.][None at all? Not even a cram school?][Yes.]It was like this just by looking at the internet reaction.\u2013 Haha, I don\u2019t think he practiced hard.\u2013 Moondae-ya, there is no soul in your answer\u2013 There was a time when Jae\u2019s soul sang, where were you?It was positive that they did not think that \u2018Park Moondae\u2019s reaction was malicious as jokes were mixed in the comments.Hmm. The strands were barely caught.\u2018Inconsiderate\u2026 Did they consider my character as a poker faced talented person?\u2019I would be criticised a little, but it wasn\u2019t a bad start.No, it was rather good.If the editing of the teamfight after that wasn\u2019t crazy, I think I might be able to easily pass the second round with this early recognition.\u2018If this is the flow, I might be able to wrap the dance appropriately and hand it over.\u2019The contents began to appear on the screen with a hopeful feeling. It was about Youngrin asking for a dance.The reaction on the Internet for this was ambiguous.\u2013 Right, I guess he can\u2019t dance\u2013 Wow, they are making him dance\u2013 It looks like I\u2019m going to be solemn \u3160\u3160\u2013 I\u2019m already embarrassed[Yes. So, is this song possible?][Uh\u2026\u2026?]Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostHowever, as soon as Park Moondae immediately asked for a song, and the staff who were shaken by his words, were shown in the broadcast, the comments began to get excited again.\u2013 What?\u2013 What, what did you request\u2013 Staff, why are your hands shaking like that hahaha\u2013 I can\u2019t even imagine what it is.And when the insanely lively \u3008POP\u2606 CON\u3009 started playing, both the editing and comments went crazy.[!!!!]Park Moondae, who danced to \u2018POP \u2606 CON\u2019 with a serious expression, was cross-edited with subtitles full of exclamation marks and the water-spouting judges, and the atmosphere went to another world.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAhahaha!!\u201dThe voices of the participants laughing came from all directions.Honestly\u2026 I was ashamed.\u2018No\u2026\u2026 I was just trying to make it look like I\u2019m working hard on an easy song.\u2019The way it came out made it seem like I was a crazy person serious about popcorn.I was worried that it might become an internet meme like this, but I didn\u2019t know until I looked at the score.\u2013 Hahahahahahahaha\u2013 What is this cute thing? Lolol\u2013 Even in stage he is serious, anyways of course\u2013 You are working really hard hahaha\u2018The reaction is\u2026\u2026 good?\u2019The reaction was better than when I sang.

It\u2019s good to see you.\u2013 No, he\u2019s a different person from the interview hahaha\u2013 You look so cute\u2018This is cute?\u2019It was true that I strategically prepared the song selection.However, I thought it would be at the level of \u2018I\u2019ve worked hard, so I\u2019ll pass\u2019, but it was an unexpected gain.Wasn\u2019t it the rule of audition program viewers to despise those who couldn\u2019t do it?It was a bit confusing, but I soon understood the situation.\u2018It\u2019s because I sang well before it.\u2019First of all, I was able to satisfy the traditional expectation that a singer should be able to sing well, so they were tolerant about the dancing even if it wasn\u2019t very good.However, it seems my character was more highlighted by taking care of the laughter.Such a character was a bit\u2026 embarrassing, though.\u2018I mean, it came out like this even though I deliberately chose only universal answers.\u2019Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostBasically, it was for the sake of not giving pods any room.In addition to that, in order to emphasize my position as a main vocalist, I had responded smoothly to everything.In the interview, I did not mention any personal opinions and only said objective words that would not go against the social consensus.\u2018However\u2026 I didn\u2019t know it would be interpreted as having no soul.\u2019Anyways, even if I went to Moro, I only had to go to Seoul. It was like even if I wanted to take the KTX, I wouldn\u2019t mind taking the express bus.\u2018The first step went well.\u2019It was clear that I had secured an early recognition. This was not a hunch, but a visible result.This is because a status window pop-up appeared while watching the broadcast.[The Beginning of Fame (2) !]10,000 people remembered your existence!: Point +1[Call of Fame!]50,000 people remembered your existence!: Rare Attribute Draw\u00a0\u00a0Click!Within one broadcast, the number jumped to 50,000.\u2018The sense of reality is disappearing.\u2019I decided to look at the rewards that appeared on the pop-up later, and instead opened the search box and entered the keywords.[Relisting! Idol Joint-Stock Company ratings]The results came out right away.[Average viewer rating: 3.7%, instantaneous highest viewer rating: 6.8%]Oh My God.\u2018\u2026\u2026Is this really the 1st episode of a ruined cable entertainment series?\u2019I guess they succeeded in properly dragging aggro.Of course, objectively speaking, it wasn\u2019t a crazy high rating.Even so, the fact that 100,000 people remembered Park Moondae meant that we left a considerable impression regardless of likes or dislikes.Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at the \u2018likes and dislikes\u2019 item.I immediately checked my evaluation video clip after checking the overall flow of public opinion in the first episode.[Pure 100% reversal of general participant! Park Moondae]I felt as if my hands and feet would disappear.\u2018\u2026\u2026Let\u2019s quickly erase it from our head.\u2019I started checking from the best comments.\u2013 Yes? Popcorn here? haha (7326 /\u00a0181)\u2013 I fell asleep watching it and then woke up. Moondae-ya, Noona will buy all your things until she gets sick of it (4522 /\u00a0294)\u2013 Yes, the main vocalist is Park Moondae (2061 /\u00a0372)\u201cHmm.\u201dFirst of all\u2026 It was a good sign that comments that enjoyed it enough to make me ticklish during the day were hanging at the top. It was a bit strange, but\u2026\u2026 I was grateful.However, a fairly high proportion of \u2018dislike\u2019 was a risk factor.Another participant who has been favorably edited\u2026 For example, compared to Cha Yujin, it seems to be roughly 1.5 times.It meant that there were quite a few people who had a sense of objection to \u2018Park Moondae\u2019 who appeared on the air. Maybe the problem was that he appeared anti-social.So, what is the most effective appeal I can make at this point?The negative image that is already created is unavoidable, but there are many idols who made people laugh by using this as a gimmick.Just thinking about it right now\u2026\u2026 Hmm, there is at least one such person for each popular idol group.So in the next shoot, there is only one thing I have to do.\u2018I have to look friendly.\u2019I immediately thought of the next search term.[Idol Joint-Stock Company PR video]The next shoot was PR video production.The remaining days are three days, and before that, let\u2019s find the most meaningful examples.***The PR video shooting of \u3008Idol Joint-Stock Company\u3009 was conducted live.However, the process of preparing the PR video was recorded like an entertainment show. It was scrap content used to kill time during the ranking announcement ceremony.\u201cEveryone! Are you ready?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dParticipants respond enthusiastically to the obvious voice of the host MC.\u2018\u2026I feel like I see this scene every time I film\u2026 Is it an illusion?\u2019Anyway, the important thing was that the participants became more desperate.\u201cI am happy that everyone seems to be doing well! Now, do you know what you\u2019re preparing for today?\u201d\u201cPR video!\u201d\u201cSelf-Introduction!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dEveryone must have seen the reactions from the first episode.So I am sure everyone realised. That no matter what you did in front of the camera, if it doesn\u2019t come out, it\u2019s like nothing happened.\u2018So, no matter what you do, you can\u2019t help but be desperate for the PR video that will be broadcasted live.\u2019In fact, it was never a fair competition.The live broadcast competition, which was held in a time where everyone\u2019s recognition was decided thanks to the 1st episode, already had it\u2019s results half-set.But even in the midst of that, every season there were always people who overturned their situation with PR videos, so it seemed like everyone was desperately preparing the video without hesitation.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostIt was a live broadcast of 77 amateurs, so of course all kinds of controversies followed, but\u2026 no one paid attention to it.The participants think that as long as it\u2019s not about them it was okay, and the production crew will like the increase in buzz.\u201cYou will be performing a live broadcast that features only yourself on Tnet\u2019s global Youtube channel at 8pm tonight!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really nervous.\u201dIn terms of layout, Keun Sejin, who was standing nearby, was a little quiet.There was no nervous expression on his face. There was no other deceit.\u201cOh, wait a minute. I think I said something wrong!\u201d\u201c?!?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just a live for you guys!\u201dAs if the MC enjoyed the reaction, he encouraged the response with his arms.Confused participants shouted.\u201cWhat do you think is the dream of a celebrity?\u201d\u201cDream\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an advertisement, everyone!\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe MC spread his arms wide.\u201cYou each have to pick a collaboration item to advertise, and promote yourself alongside the item!\u201d\u201cYes?!\u201dThese bastards were determined to eat raw.That collaboration item was a plausible thing to say, but it was a product of T1, which had Tnet as an affiliate, and I was able to hang it with my left hand.It doesn\u2019t matter if you get one or two and see it\u2019s viral effect or not.It was capitalist enough to be counted among the crazy tactics of \u3008Idol Joint-Stock Company\u3009.\u2018Isn\u2019t someone hastily poking from the top?\u2019The series, which had been neglected thinking that it was ruined, suddenly responded, so they put a spoon on it.Anyway, the MC\u2019s words were plausible.\u201cThis item may feel like a burden to promote, but please remember that it can also be used as a prop to show off your charm!\u201d\u201cOh~\u201dThe participants looked quite convinced. It was a wise attitude considering there was nothing that could be done just because they did not understand.\u201cThen how do you get these props that you will have?\u201d\u201cRunning?\u201d\u201cRock Paper Scissors?\u201d\u201cKaraoke?\u201dExamples of similar programs from the last season were popping up here and there. The MC shook his head with a sad expression and shouted the correct answer.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 a treasure hunt!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe production crew hid treasure balls that represent \u2018items\u2019 all over the dorm. You just have to find a treasure ball within the next 15 minutes!\u201dKeun Sejin nodded with a slightly admiring expression on his face.\u201cDon\u2019t you think it will be a bit fun?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dIt was true that the viewers who would be watching this would have fun. It\u2019s perfect for participants to have a dog fight.With 77 people rummaging through one building, there would definitely be something that hurt their feelings.Of course, the contents of the ranking announcement ceremony were used to relieve tension. So it didn\u2019t seem like it would get too serious.However, there were plenty of ways to shed subtle nuances.\u2018I can already see all kinds of speculations and rumors that will come up on the Internet.\u201d\u201cAh! Like an audition pro, the treasure ball also has grades. Please keep that in mind and take a close look at the balls!\u201dIt was probably painted with gold, silver, or bronze.\u201cOkay, get ready\u2026\u201dEveryone got ready to run.\u201cStart!\u201d\u201cWow!\u201dWith a shout, the 77 people rushed into the dormitory. I sneaked out and took a step back.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u2018Let\u2019s go through the back door.\u2019No matter how much I thought about it, there was a high chance that if I went in through the front door with everyone else, I wouldn\u2019t be able to get any.If I went back and went through the back door, I would have less competition with the other contestants.Then Keun Sejin and Gold 1 followed me.I could hear the grins of the cunning duo.\u201cThank you, Moondae-ya. The bus is comfortable.\u201d\u201cHyungnim is smart.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter if it was just two people, but\u2026 But somehow I was feeling hot.Gold 2 and Seon Ahyun, who were standing a little further away, seemed to have been swept away by the crowd and entered through the front door.After all, life was all about timing. How unfortunate.***\u201cOh, Moondae~ You found one right away.\u201dAs soon as I entered through the back door, I immediately found a ball on the threshold.It was silver\u2018As expected.\u2019Keun Sejin nodded his head as he looked at the opaque silver ball.\u201cIt seems to be divided into grades through Gold, Silver and Bronze*, right?\u201d(T/N: Here he actually used a korean slang that means Gold, Silver and Bronze)\u201cHey, let\u2019s use Korean words that are fair and beautiful! Gold, silver and bronze! How nice is that!\u201d\u201cAh, you\u2019re a patriot.\u201dIf you guys talk any more, I will throw you away.\u201c\u2026Why don\u2019t we search quickly? The other kids will be here soon.\u201d\u201cYes~\u201d\u201cSince Moondae-ya is realistic, hyungnim feels safe.\u201dI quickly moved on.The two surprisingly followed without making any noise.First, the storage.\u201cIt\u2019s easy if we think of this in reverse. A place where the production crew can hide\u2026 um, here?\u201dKeun Sejin smiled and took out a bronze ball from the pencil case in front of the camera.\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cHey~ it\u2019s actually bronze.\u201d\u201cOh, crap. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201dSurprisingly\u2026 It was useful.These guys were quick. Thanks to that, we divided the areas without saying much and searched the entire storage in an instant.\u201cOh, I found another silver one! Shall we move on now?\u201d\u201cAgreed.\u201d\u201cAgreed.\u201dThey were also quick to judge the situation. Without further ado, we quickly moved onto the next area.\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s start with the cafeteria. There is a camera there.\u201d\u201cMoondae, you have a good eye sight.\u201d\u201cAs expected of the man who found the back door.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt would have been better if they didn\u2019t say things like this, but\u2026 That is.We couldn\u2019t waste any more time in the cafeteria.All three of us began tacitly searching around the area where the cameras were located.It was when I opened the cutlery.\u201cFound it.\u201d\u201cOh my!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s gold.\u201dI got a gold ball.\u201cWhy do we all have gold rank, but Moondae is the first to find one?\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. Hyungnim. I think it\u2019s because Moondae has golden hands.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. After all, you can\u2019t beat someone who is born with it~\u201d\u201cThe others are coming.\u201d\u201cOoops.\u201dI finally figured out how to keep their mouths shut. I just had to give them jobs to do.Anyway, after hearing the footsteps rushing, we quickly left the restaurant.\u201cUpstairs?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201dThe same search was repeated upstairs as it was. It was efficient.\u201cHey~ it\u2019s good that the three of us came!\u201d\u201cI know right! Be honest, you agree with us right, Moondae?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cOh~\u201dI\u2019ll be honest.I\u2019ve benefited from these two guys. When the three of us searched together, the efficiency was high.Overall, it was comfortable to search and move quickly because of having to observe and move around less. His judgment was good.They were not oddly stubborn, so the distribution was over neatly.\u201cThen we\u2026 found 4 gold, 2 silver, and 4 bronze, didn\u2019t we?\u201dKeun Sejin easily divided the palm-sized plastic balls.Gold 1 spoke carefully.\u201cYes. Well\u2026 we each have one of each color, Moondae took us with him, so we can give him the extra gold in place of the missing silver. How about it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine with it~\u201dIt\u2019s good that it ended neatly, but I didn\u2019t want to leave any room for bad news.Once I finally realized the power of editing, I felt very uncomfortable.\u201cOh, then I won\u2019t accept bronze.

It\u2019s relentless.\u201dThese guys, their tension seems to have lessened, so their mouths were free again.At the meeting point, the participants who had already found one or two balls were opening their own.There had been no action to forcefully steal it yet.\u2018You\u2019ll notice that there are cameras all over the place.\u2019It seemed psychologically reluctant to openly steal the ball of an opponent.\u201cWow, shall we open it too?\u201d\u201cOkay~\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dOnce we returned to our seats, we began opening the balls.Keun Sejin and Gold 1 had lots of balls in their hands, so they had a lot of envious eyes.Still, two high grades were still better.

Idol Joint-Stock Company\u3009 starts.Related communities and social media on the Internet were full of opinions and excitement.\u2013 77 people are doing the same waste of a live broadcast again this season? Hahaha they already failed once but still didn\u2019t change haha\u2013 Are you guys that crazy about PPL that you advertise so openly? it\u2019s really stupid\u2013 \u2605\u2606Kim Raebin\u2606\u2605 is doing a live with this face.

There were lots of comments that only said what they wanted to say, and it was almost to the point of covering up malicious comments.It was then.-Eh, who is filming a mukbang?\u2514? What do you mean\u2514No, what are you eating seriously?\u2514What are you talking about, in the self-introduction video?\u2514No, it\u2019s real; (link)Some people who are interested, clicked the link and joined.\u201cHello.\u201dPark Moondae\u2019s face appeared on the screen.Holding a chicken\u2019s feet in his hands.Participants could not see the real-time comments, but Park Moondae\u2019s live comments were already exploding.\u2013 No, Moondae, why are you holding a chicken feet?\u2013 Hahahahahahahaha Moondae again\u2013 After popcorn*, boneless chicken feet appeared(*Referencing to the song he danced called Pop Con)\u2013 Wasn\u2019t this a self-introduction video, but suddenly it\u2019s chicken feet-Why the hell did you choose this, Is it a penalty hahaha-I really want to communicate, I am dying to ask hahahaIn contrast to his comment section, Park Moondae didn\u2019t mind the chicken feet in his hands.\u201cWell, the product I\u2019m going to promote today is\u2026 (jin) direct fire boneless chicken feet from T1 Food.\u201dPark Moondae was sitting in front of a table set up with an iron plate.The boneless chicken feet held with disposable gloved hands looked appetizing, but compared to the video thumbnails of other participants, it gave off a huge sense of disparity.\u201cFirst\u2026 I will eat and review.\u201dPark Moondae boldly took one bite off the chicken feet. Then he chewed hard, swallowed, and then opened his mouth again.\u201cIt tastes good, and it is not too spicy, so I think I can continue to eat it. There is no odor and the aftertaste is clean. The taste is also very good.\u201d\u2013 Is he a former youtuber who specialized in mukbang?\u2013 Tell me about you! It\u2019s okay for the public to talk about the food \u3160\u3160\u2013 Let\u2019s give up. We should have known from the beginning when he worked hard about popcorn\u2013 Hahahahahaha this is really funny\u2013 He doesn\u2019t have social skills, but he\u2019s a good kid.The comments were clamoring about Park Moondae\u2019s appearance, which was serious about the review. But after a while, the mood changed again.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostPark Moondae\u2019s mukbang was worth watching more than expected.\u2013 But he eats really well.\u2013 He doesn\u2019t spill it and puts it in his mouth in a snap.\u2013 Because he is cute, even his chewing is cute \u3160\u3160\u2013 I think he\u2019ll get points even if he just shuts his mouth and eats at the meeting-I wish you could eat chicken feet by wrapping it in perilla leaves Moondae-ya \u3160\u3160\u2514 Hahahaha Mission Complete\u2013 You eat so well without getting it in your mouth- As expected, it\u2019s good to see you eating well.\u2013 You eat so well without getting it in your mouth- As expected, it\u2019s good to see you eating well.And Park Moondae continued the review diligently.The comment section once again turned upside down when he pulled out a Tuna Mayo Triangle Kimbap saying it was good to eat it with chicken feetBy that time, articles were posted on social media and the community.[IJC participant doing mukbang in real time.jpg][Gosh Park Moondae is eating chicken feet][I thought he was the main vocalist, but he is actually a mukbang star on Youtube?][Park Moondae\u2019s PR video looks crazy haha]The number of viewers rose in a flash.The number of viewers of Park Moondae, which was originally quite high, was now entering the top 5.Participants could not see the comments, but they could see the number of viewers. Park Moondae blinked his eyes when he saw that the number of viewers had already surpassed 10,000.\u201cThe viewers\u2026 there is a lot, thank you. I will do my best.\u201d\u2013 That\u2019s not the case, Moondae, tell us about yourself now\u00a0 \u3160\u3160\u2013 Why, it\u2019s nice watching him eat\u2013 Are you a new mukbang BJ? Eat well\u2013 He is an idol audition participant!\u2013 He is a good singer lol\u2013 But why is he eating?\u2013 I don\u2019t know that hahahaha\u2013 We don\u2019t know that either hahaha\u2013 I never dreamed that he would be eating like this without even singing a single versePark Moondae was reviewing the taste of his triangular kimbap in detail.At that moment, the sound of an alarm ringing came from the clock in the corner of Park Moondae\u2019s desk.\u201cOh, the time is up.\u201dThe PR lives were basically 10 minutes.And by converting the number of viewers and the number of likes into numbers, only the top 33 received 5 minutes of extra time and a special gift.Park Moondae thought, \u2018These bastards are acting so shamelessly even while using advertisements\u2019, but of course he nodded his head without expressing himself.\u201cThis might be the end, so I\u2019ll greet you in advance. Thank you.\u201dPark Moondae bowed his head. And after thinking about it for a moment, he added.\u201c\u2026\u2026Please watch the 2nd episode of \u3008Relisting! Idol Joint-Stock Company\u3009.\u201d\u2013 I am betting 1,000 won that this is the example sentence given by the production team\u2013 He really can\u2019t talk much hahahaha\u2013 It\u2019s okay, Moondae-ya, you\u2019re cute.\u2013 Yes, cute\u2013 You\u2019re good at singing, but you\u2019re also good at eating. This little grandma is happy.\u2013 Hahahaha everyone got into it, it\u2019s really funny hahahahaAbout 10 seconds after Park Moondae\u2019s greetings, a bell suddenly sounded on the screen.\u201cAh, I think the results are out.\u201dPark Moondae pulled out a clunky smartphone from under the desk. It seemed that he received the results from the production team through a text message.However, the comments that already knew that Park Moondae was still in the top 33 were paying attention to something else.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u2013 That\u2019s a filial phone.\u2013 It\u2019s thrifty.\u2013 You are smart\u2013 If you don\u2019t use an apple phone, you\u2019ll be treated like a savage, so you\u2019re using a filial phone\u2026 Are you somehow attracted to it?\u2013 Hahahahahaha everyone must be crazy\u2013 Moondae-ya, noona will buy you an apple phone so let\u2019s debut our Moondae \u3160\u3160Park Moondae-ya chose a free phone to make a minimum living with his budget anyway, but unexpected synergy was coming out.Anyway, since Park Moondae also guessed his high rank, the results were announced without tension.\u201cAh, I\u2019m in the top 33 so I can continue broadcasting. Thank you for the next 5 minutes. I will work hard.\u201dPark Moondae nodded his head, and soon picked up the chicken feet again. And he took another savory bite.\u2013 Hahahaha are you asking us to take good care of you while eating?\u2013 For me, being serious is the funniest thing hahahaha\u2013 No, at least try to introduce yourself in the extra time haha\u2013 Ahhh \u3160\u3160 Moondae-ya please tell us your TMI, what\u2019s your favorite color, do you like cats or dogs, I can\u2019t do this. At least tell us your MBTI \u3160\u3160\u3160The speed at which comments were sent increased tremendously. Even if Park Moondae was watching, he wouldn\u2019t be able to read it.Then, Park Moondae\u2019s smartphone rang again. This time, it was the producers.\u2018What? Oh, is it a special gift or something?\u2019\u201cAnother notice has been sent from the producers. just a second\u2026 .\u201dPark Moondae confirmed the text. It was pretty lengthy.[A special gift for the participants! It is communication with viewers! Viewer donations are now available! Participants can check the donation pop-up above the threshold of <10,000 won>.Please tell the viewers. (\u203bAll donations must be given in full amount!)]The idea of giving the entire amount of the donation was to prevent any possible controversies.However, considering that donations will be received by participants and donations will be made in the name of the program, it was frankly annoying.\u2018I knew they\u2019d do this without spending any money.\u2019Park Moondae thought deeply, and then read the text aloud.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u2013 Donations??\u2013 I guess they set it at 10,000 won to block aggro.\u2013 Hey, what kind of a donation is donated? They are just trying to save face for the participants and staff;;\u2013 If you give it to the participants, you\u2019ll be sweared at for being shallow, but I just saved my mouth.\u2013 If I pay Moondae-ya for the chicken, will they give him a chicken mukbang?\u2013 RJC\u2019s level has gone down againMost of the comments were insulting to the production team, but it\u2019s not like there were no donationsImmediately, the first fanfare exploded on the screen. It was a donation notification.\u2013 You\u2019re crazy.\u2013 For the chicken?\u2013\u00a0 Haha someone quickly ask him, why is it chicken feet?\u201cOh, 123. thank you\u2026\u2026\u201dPark Moondae fought against the deep reality and read the donation text that appeared on the screen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

HahaPeople buzzed in the comments saying that it was a great question. Park Moondae thought for a bit and then answered honestly.\u201cWell actually, my keyword for the collaboration item was frozen food, not chicken feet.\u201d\u2013 Wow, how shady\u2013 Looking back at the chicken feet now, it looks like a fairy\u2013 Why would they put frozen food on an idol\u2019s PR\u2026\u2026?\u2013 Why would they put Mandu in the nominations when there is a T1 carbonated water hahahaPark Moondae, who could not read the comments, calmly continued.\u201cOut of all the frozen food I received as a sample, the chicken feet tasted the best. So I chose chicken feet.\u201d\u2013 !!\u2013 Samples\u2026\u2026 you tried all of them?\u2013 This participant is \u2018real\u2019\u2013 At this point on, I can\u2019t even laugh because he is working hard haha\u201cSince it\u2019s an advertisement\u2026 it would be hard to say that bad food tasted good.\u201dAs Park Moondae answered, he grabbed a chicken feet and put it back in his mouth. And immediately afterwards, a spam of donations flowed in.#What\u2019s your favorite food besides chicken feet?#Who are you the closest with?#Then what criteria did you use for choosing the triangular kimbap hahahaOnly read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u201cI am not picky about the food I eat. For the participant I am the closest to\u2026\u2026 If I say it, it will be a spoiler, so I will skip it.\u201d\u2013 He is so thorough hahaha\u2013 Then it\u2019s true that Moondae has someone he is close to? Grandma believes in Moondae!*^^\u2013 In the next broadcast over, Seon Ahyun said he was close to him hahahaha\u2013 Hahaha Okay, Moondae-ya, are you close with Ahyun?From Park Moondae\u2019s standpoint, he thought that speaking directly to someone could be a risk factor, so he was a bit evasive.However, the comments were playing with even that as a subject.And around the time Park Moondae was meticulously explaining why he chose the triangular kimbap, the delayed donations burst in succession.\u201cThe tuna mayonnaise is thick and goes well with chicken feet as a sauce\u2026 Ah.\u201d#Moondae-ya, please sing a song for me \u3160\u3160#Don\u2019t eat too much and introduce yourself hahaha#Do you have any secrets to being good at singing?\u201cWell, a song.\u201dPark Moondae put down the last chicken feet he was about to eat.-Fi na lly-Did his idol ego wake up?-He was revived when there was only one chicken foot left, is that meaningful\u2026\u2026\u2013 No, Moondae\u2019s song is great, I watched the team match and it was awesome \u3160\u3160-It was good on the show, but what about live?In the midst of a lot of comments, Park Moondae started singing.\u201cI\u2019m standing on the stage, you won\u2019t know it yet~\u201dIt was the show\u2019s theme song \u3008It\u2019s Me\u3009.Park Moondae only selected songs that had already been well-received by trainers without much thought, but from the viewers\u2019 point of view, it was nothing but solidifying the character.\u2013 Park Moondae, he is a pro\u2013 Isn\u2019t he the most sincere participant in the show?\u2013 It\u2019s really unpredictable, It\u2019s not the criminal\u2019s mindset.\u2013 This is so funny its driving me crazy ahahahaThe comments were overflowing with people joking around. But that wasn\u2019t all.\u2013 But he is a good singer.\u2013 Why is it so sweet even though there are chicken feet in the same cut?\u2013 It\u2019s good to listen to even without accompaniment\u2013 Good job Moondae-ya, now sing another song \u3160\u3160Despite the fact that 77 people were broadcasting live at the same time with low-cost equipment, Park Moondae\u2019s voice was clearly transmitted.Without equivocation or blurring parts, Park Moondae coolly carried on singing.It was a nice voice to listen to without a single unstable note.As if they were concentrating, the speed of the comments slowed down a bit. The reaction was occasionally mixed with exclamation.And past the last part of the pre-chorus, it was when the chorus began.\u201cNow on stage\u2026\u2026\u201dTirriririring!!An alarm rang loudly from the clock on the desk.It was an alarm to warn that there were 30 seconds left. Five minutes of extra time was over.\u201cAh, the time is up.\u201dPark Moondae Immediately stopped singing.It\u2019s because he didn\u2019t intend to create more room for controversy by wasting time and adding more songs.The problem was that he quit too abruptly.\u2013 No, you can\u2019t stop there.\u2013 Just before the chorus hahaha\u2013 Ahhh, it\u2019s frustrating, I\u2019ll just sing it instead.\u00a0The one who shines on this stage today is me!! Arghhh!!-Don\u2019t you know that this is the big picture to make you want to watch episode 2?

I will do my best. Well, come to think of it, the remaining donation questions\u2026\u2026\u201dPark Moondae quickly looked over the questions again, and his eye was caught on \u2018self-introduction\u2019 and \u2018secret to being good at singing\u2019. And he thought.\u2018I am lucky that I don\u2019t have enough time.\u2019In fact, Park\u00a0 Moondaewas delaying the answer for the next donation by wasting time with songs on purpose. Because he had a hard time answering.First, introduce yourself\u2026 There was nothing to say because he had entered someone else\u2019s body.He still did not fully understand the background of \u2018Park Moondae\u2019. Moreover, the background he had already grasped was quite dark.The secret to singing was even more difficult to say.\u2018Because the system window helped? That\u2019s crazy.\u2019Park Moondae made his decision in an instant and continued his speech.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u201cLet me introduce myself first.\u201dAt that moment, the screen went black.[Live is over.]The broadcast time was over.\u2013 ??\u2013 What\u2013 I think it\u2019s over?-The production team ended the broadcast.The remaining viewers were confused, but soon understood the situation and began to laugh.\u2013 Ahahahahahahaha\u2013 In the end, we didn\u2019t hear him say a single word about himself\u2026\u2026\u2013 I feel like I just watched the mukbang as an ad.\u2013 Oh, it\u2019s been a while since I had so much fun\u2013 No, Park Moondae is really funny hahahaPeople left one word at a time in the real-time comment box that was still going on.However, quite a number of people remained for quite a while, so they continued to leave comments.They were the people who became fond of Park Moondae.They had a lot of fun comparing Park Moondae from episode 1 with Park Moondae in the previous PR live.\u2013 But Moondae is really cute\u2026 With such a disinterested face, he eats well and sings well \u3160\u3160 He is the best even without using tricks\u2013 His face is trendy, so it\u2019s a hot spot. If he takes a little more care of it, he\u2019ll look really good\u2013 Okay, I need to open a fan account today\u2013 Where can I vote?\u2013 Idol Joint-Stock Company website -> This is the stock purchase window. If you purchase the Collaboration Bundle for 1 vote per day, you can gain additional votes\u2013 Upstairs is so clever\u2013 Since Moondae is so cute, I gave him one voteCriticism continued in the comments about the strong voting method, but soon the topic returned to Park Moondae\u2019s recent broadcast-In the meantime, he ate the chicken feet so deliciously \u3160\u3160 I ended up going to the link and bought it\u2013 I ordered delivery right now. Thank you, Moondae-ya, I broke my diet at night because of chicken feetThen, suddenly, a comment came out saying something out of the ordinary.\u2013 But why does Moondae\u2019s eating style feel so familiar? I think I saw it somewhere.\u2013 Really?\u2013 Did he film an advertisement for formula when he was a baby? (Badam)\u2013 Hahahaha I heard he doesn\u2019t have any experience in the entertainment industry\u2013 Oh, I found it. This is it. Identical (link)The link was linked to a video of a chicken foot mukbang.The appearance of putting chicken feet in one bite and chewing them was similar to the live broadcast they watched earlier.Only the species was different.[A country dog eating chicken feet!]In the video, a large dog of unknown origin was eating raw chicken feet.The channel name was \u2018Exploring the diet of countryside species\u2019.The prickly-eared, black-haired dog wagged its tail with a sullen-looking face and eagerly put the chicken feet into its mouth.On top of that figure, Park Moondae\u2019s indifferent mukbang suddenly overlapped.\u2013 Oh my godAt that moment, Park Moondae\u2019s first nickname was decided.* * *\u2013 Look at this, the two are the same. From today onwards, Park Moondae is Moon puppy (screenshot of countryside dogs eating stream) (screenshot of Park Moondae\u2019s live)The picture of me putting boneless chicken feet in my mouth in the form of \u2018Park Moondae\u2019 and a picture of a big dog biting chicken feet was shared in SNS over 4,000 times.I was a little confused.First of all, my goal of getting rid of the negative image by creating a sense of familiarity\u2026 seemed to have been a success.\u201cMoon Puppy\u2026\u2026\u201dI never thought I would have such an embarrassing nickname at 29 years old.I have been told several times in my life that I ate well.\u2018Maybe it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t leave food behind, and didn\u2019t care\u2026\u2026 \u2019It was simply because I couldn\u2019t afford to throw away food after my parents died.So, I never thought that I would get such a reaction just because I ate some chicken feet.\u201cIt\u2019s the fourth.\u201dA PR video was uploaded not long after the live ended, and the current number of views of my video was in my fingers.It was still on the rise. It seemed it would be able to go over Lee Sejin\u2019s, a former child actor, who was ranked third.I decided to adapt to the situation.\u2018It\u2019s embarrassing, but whatever, it\u2019s a good situation.\u2019I couldn\u2019t be picky when I was facing sudden death. Moreover, the excitement was greater than the embarrassment. A little\u2026 I was very thankful.\u2018Thanks to you, I am one step away from sudden death.\u2019I briefly thanked the people who posted the SNS post and the people who shared it, and started thinking about the next step.Now there was one near problem.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostHow will my editing come out in the second episode, which will air soon?In particular, I was worried about the part where I received platinum on the evaluation.\u2018Even if the editing is a bit poor, I think there will be a response like \u2018He should have received it, but Park Moondae received it instead\u2019.\u201dI turned on the on-air window on my smartphone with a little nervousness.Still, the 2nd episode was a bit more comfortable because I didn\u2019t have to film unnecessary reactions. Thanks to that, I was able to get a can of beer as well.[Relisting! Idol~ Joint-Stock Company!]Listening to Youngrin\u2019s voice inserted in the opening, I slowly drank the beer. And focused on the content.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBy the end of episode 2, there were two cans of beer next to my smartphone.I took the last sip of beer and thought.\u2018It was okay.\u2019The production team also put great effort into editing my evaluation.Through the mouths of the judges, the judges once again verified that the choreography was completely performed and that the pitch was correct, and stamped that it was good.Even the scene where I got the platinum rating did not shed much light. They just treated it with a nuance like \u2018Of course, the participants who do this much should get it~\u2019.They did not raise controversy over the judgment at all.\u201cWhat are they thinking?\u201dI feel like I\u2019ve been influenced by alcohol. I carefully recited the direction of my editing.\u2018The thing that bothers me is\u2026\u2026 is.\u2019They didn\u2019t show anything about how I practiced without sleeping for a week.They can\u2019t show all the circumstances of the 77 people, but even if that was the case, it was strange that they sent out the scene where I asked Seon Ahyun for the choreography.It also bothered me that it was edited in a way that made it seem like I watched the choreography once and copied it.\u2018Come to think of it, they put in an interview that made it seem like I wasn\u2019t interested even when receiving a grade.\u2019Well, after summarizing it so far, I had a feeling.The production team seemed to keep pushing the character of \u2018Park Moondae\u2019 in the first episode.To put it bluntly\u2026 the character of \u2018my-face talented ordinary person with no sense\u2019.Fortunately, thanks to the PR Live, the public opinion on the Internet had already given me the image of a chicken-feet puppy.\u2018I guess I can let it slide.\u2019I immediately turned on social media and checked it out. As expected, the people who treated Park Moondae in episode 2 like a clever puppy caught the public opinion first.That was a relief since I couldn\u2019t let my guard down. Because editing wins everything.\u2018Should I save more puppies?\u2019Diiing!While thinking, my smartphone rang.It was Keun Sejin. I felt the meticulousness from texting, not from the message app.[Moondae-ya, our team is going to watch episode 3 together, how about it?]Should I do that? I immediately started writing replies.\u2018I\u2019m sorry, but I have something to do\u2026\u2026\u2019\u00a0 The moment I was about to say no with a reasonable excuse, another text message arrived one after another.[No way\u2026 Don\u2019t sad things happen when only Moondae is missing ?\u315c\u315c Lee Sejin -yung said he was coming too!]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDid they all already reach an agreement?Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostThis guy was the guy who told the production team that we saw it together and sent a photo as proof.The editing direction was already suspicious, but I didn\u2019t know what would happen if I was the only one left out.I slowly corrected the text.[Oh yeah. I can come.]A reply came right away.[Hehe I knew Moondae would like it too~ I\u2019ll see you then!]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNo wonder\u2026 I felt like I lost.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Debut or DieCH 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI tried building up my stamina by exercising and practicing at the same time until the 3rd episode aired.Fortunately, Park Moondae\u2019s qualities were not that bad, so his body was able to follow my will quite well.The unfortunate thing was that most of the practice achievements had been filled up to 500 times.\u2018I think it will be difficult to quickly fill the stats by leveling up now.\u2019It was fortunate that the stat reward often appeared in pop-ups when I gained reputation and did successful stages.Anyway, after working hard for a week, it was Friday again.I headed to the meeting place at around 5pm.It was an officetel located quite far from the station outside Seoul, and it seemed like it was probably someone\u2019s house among the team members.And on the way out of the subway station, something amazing happened.\u201cExcuse me!\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cPerhaps\u2026 aren\u2019t you from Idol Joint-Stock Company?\u201dSomeone asked this.In fact, it was said in the form of a question, but the person\u2019s eyes were already gleaming with certainty.I thought for a moment, and nodded.I wasn\u2019t even wearing a mask. So if someone takes a picture, I can\u2019t take it off or put it on, So I wasn\u2019t in a situation where I could lie.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cAh, I knew it!\u201dThe woman who spoke to me was noticeably happy.\u201cI\u2019m really enjoying it. You\u2019re really good at singing too\u2026\u2026 Hey, can you take a picture for me?\u201dWhat do I do about this?I thought that Keun Sejin might take a verification shot, so I came out dressed appropriately. However, unlike in the filming, I had a bare face.I know because I took pictures before. Most idols needed corrections for bare-faced photos.\u2018\u2026That\u2019s why sometimes when I filmed rehearsals, I had to put in some full corrections for conscience before I sold it.\u2019But in the current situation, it was more important not to make noise.\u201cYes. Can I look here?\u201d\u201cAh! Yes yes, wait a minute\u2026!\u201dThe woman quickly turned on her camera correction app, and she took a picture of us together in selfie mode.It was fortunate that she was someone who knew Kang-ho\u2019s way of doing things.\u201cAh, thank you so much. I will definitely vote, no, I will buy stocks!\u201d\u201cOh, thank you.\u201dThere\u2019s a high probability that she wouldn\u2019t even remember Park Moondae\u2019s name, but let\u2019s say thank you for doing it.Anyway, maybe because of this person\u2019s reaction, people subtly began looking this way. It became increasingly burdensome when people passing by started glancing at me.I quickly nodded and gave my final words.\u201cI have something to do\u2026\u201d\u201cAh yes! Thanks for the photo\u2026\u2026\u201dI left quickly, since it seemed like at any moment she would say the words \u2018but what\u2019s going on?\u2019.And as soon as I left the station, I bought a mask at the convenience store.There was no point in calling it excessive self-consciousness, but since there has already been a case, I was going to be careful on the way back.But I couldn\u2019t believe that I was already recognised by someone on the streets. I already knew season 3 was going to do good, but this was amazing.\u2018It\u2019s going to be a big deal in the second half of the show.\u2019The place I\u2019m currently staying in was just a cheap room, so the security was poor. If Park Moondae continues to avoid editing like this, it may be necessary to take measures in the future.As I walked, thinking about various things, I soon arrived at the meeting place. Since it was an officetel, it was new, so it was clean and the security was good.I didn\u2019t know whose house it was, but they seem to be living well. I was envious.\u201cOh~ Moondae came so fast? Come on!\u201d\u201cOh, hello.\u201dWhen I rang the doorbell, Keun Sejin and Seon Ahyun came out.\u201cThis is the living room~\u201dAs Keun Sejin guided me, Seon Ahyun followed. Looks like this was a big house.Well, it\u2019s a natural picture for the group organiser to call people over to their house.As I looked around the interior of the pretty cool officetel, I admired it honestly.\u201cIt\u2019s a nice house.\u201d\u201cRight? I wish it was my house!\u201d\u201c\u2026..?\u201dDid that mean that he was not a monthly renter?The brief question ended with Seon Ahyun\u2019s words.\u201cOh, thank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThis\u2026 It was Seon Ahyun\u2019s house.In the meantime, Keun Sejin was almost lying on the sofa in the living room, and Seon Ahyun was sitting upright in the corner of the sofa.I stared at this bizarre situation in which the main character was inverted for a moment, then stopped thinking. Whatever the case was. Let\u2019s just hurry up and watch episode 3.* * *In the editing room on the 9th floor of the Tnet building, the production crew of \u3008Idol Joint-Stock company\u3009 was working overtime today.\u201cThe editing was delayed due to the live preparation of the PR video.\u201d\u201cThis is driving me crazy.\u201dIt was a close situation when the finished version was released only a few hours before the airing.Writer Ryu Seorin was annoyed and thought to herself.\u2018So, it would have been better if the PR was just outsourced.\u2019Even though the advertisement was pushed in, the production cost was raised as much as a rat\u2019s tail, so it was impossible to use outsourcing.Thanks to this, her schedule, which was barely spared from the youngest writer, was a series of all-nighters.Besides, the edited version she checked while working on the subtitles\u2026 It was so unexpected.\u2018Why did you kill them and push them away?\u2019Ryu Seorin\u2019s own suggestions were not properly reflected!She desperately wanted to grind her teeth, but she didn\u2019t have the energy to do so. Her eyes turned yellow from staying up for two nights.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u2018It\u2019s not like I have any power anyway.\u2019Still, it was suggested for the fun of the program, but it was disappointing.\u2018After seeing the editing direction for episodes 1 and 2, I was looking forward to it.\u2019She sighed and left the editing room.She was thinking of resting her eyes for an hour until the episode started airing.* * *\u201cStart!\u201d\u201cWhoa, whoa! Our team is in this episode! Please!\u201dThe former team members who gathered in Seon Ahyun\u2019s ordered food delivery and passed the time by chatting about their current situation.After episodes 1 and 2 were aired, each of them were excited about the reactions of their acquaintances, but there was no nutritional value.\u2013 Moondae-ya, should we order chicken feet?\u2026The most memorable part was that he asked that with a big grin.Anyway, after roughly listening through it, it was soon airtime.\u2018It\u2019s nice to see it on a big screen.\u2019I casually thought to myself as I looked at the huge TV attached to the wall that took up a quarter of the living room wall.\u201cAh, let\u2019s start.\u201dSeeing the others who were full and drooping on the sofa or on the floor were sitting holding each other, it seemed that monitoring would not be disturbed, and that was also very good.But such simple thinking was an illusion.[Since this is the first team match, there must be a participant that you all want to team up with?]As soon as the words of the MC were broadcasted, an interview was put in.[Cha Yujin: If I did it with Raebin!][Lee Sejin (B): Me? (edited) Oh, Moondae is good!][Park Moondae: (head lowered)]\u201cAhh, hyungs are here!!\u201d\u201cKeun Sejin-hyung\u2019s interview cut is well received.\u201d\u201cWow, I told you! It didn\u2019t come out.\u201dWhenever one of the team members appeared on the screen, everyone reacted arrogantly.I was going crazy because I had a hard time concentrating on the screen.In the meantime, Keun Sejin burst into laughter.It was good that he was put as Lee Sejin (B) since there was another person with the same name.\u201cPark Moondae, are you really like that? Hahahaha!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026No.\u201dThat couldn\u2019t be.That guy, Keun Sejin, actually named over 7 people, asking for atleast one, but it was clear that only my name was on the air.Anyway, let\u2019s try to stay focused on the screen.Despite the chatter, the broadcast continued.[Wow!!][Isn\u2019t our team good?]First of all, the moment this team was decided came out warmly.They mainly showed us hugging and circling, so it seemed fun to be with the participants who wanted to be innocent. What was unexpected was the editing direction of the opposing team, which had the former member of the national archery team Ryu Chungwoo.[Lee Dojun: Oh, a little\u2026\u2026][Park Jungseob: I guess this is how it goes.][Choi Sangjin: Really fun? (Edit) It doesn\u2019t feel that way.][Ryu Chungwoo: Oh man. (Laughs)]Although the atmosphere was relatively low, it was a team that quickly settled under the leadership of Ryu Chungwoo, but it came out as if the atmosphere was destroyed on air.\u201cUh\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dIt was difficult to comment, and an ambiguous exclamation came from the side.It was difficult to like and difficult to criticize.After passing through the formation process of other teams, the next stage was the selection process.Gold 1, who pressed the button on the panel with a scream without looking properly, came out as a solo cut.\u201cAhhh\u2026\u2026\u201dGold 1 looked at his black history in pain. On the screen, he was talking nonsense.[O-Oryunga?]And the edit that followed\u2026\u2026 It wasn\u2019t serious.An interview with the team members came out along with the BGM for gags.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostFor reference, Ha Iljun is Gold 1 and Kwon Heeseung is Gold 2.[Sejin Lee (B): Did you see our faces?? Just like this!][Kwon Heeseung: We\u2026 What to do? Uhh\u2026\u2026][Seon Ahyun: (Smiles and shrugs.)][Ha Iljun: \u2026 Sorry. Heh heh.][\u2661Into the new world / Mallangdalkom\u2661]The panel flashed in the background like a joke.\u2026And here, for some reason, an interview with Park Moondae appeared.[Park Moondae: I liked it. (Thumbs up)]A caption appeared.[Fan heart wins everything\u2026 !\u2606]The living room became a crucible of laughter.\u201cAhahaha!!\u201d\u201cHahak, haha, my stomach hurts from laughing so much\u2026!\u201dEven Lee Sejin\u2019s face turned red as he forced himself to hold back his laughter.\u201cHey, is that real? Did you really do that?\u201d\u201c\u2026I said I liked the group.\u201d\u201cHmhm, big, ah~ really? Thank you.\u201dKeun Sejin giggled and sank onto the sofa.I\u2026 Just put the chicken in my mouth.\u2018Let\u2019s not get involved.\u2019After that, even the choreography practice and trainer feedback trial and error were set in a way that was not too serious.[Let\u2019s do it like this!][Hmm, okay.]The moderately dark early practice was edited as if we were working hard without knowing what we were doing.The first tense background sound came out when the choreographer was venomous.[I don\u2019t see anyone\u2026 What are you going to do?]After that, a series of personal attacks were sent out as it was, with huge subtitles emphasizing every word.\u201cIt\u2019s really strong when you hear it again.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you now, but I was really scared.\u201d\u201cYes. I can see it.\u201d\u201cYeah. You also.\u201dWhen the team members with hardened expressions were projected on the screen, the sincerity went back and forth like a joke in the living room.Fortunately, the scene where Seon Ah-hyeon was stalked by the choreographer did not focus on me, but mainly showed Seon Ahyun, who was shocked.And at an unexpected time, an unexpected scene came out.[Are you tired?][Ah, no\u2026\u2026]There was a scene where I talked to Seon Ahyun, who was being edited as the \u2018Seon Ahyun, the participant who couldn\u2019t concentrate on practice\u2019 type.It was the conversation where I used the \u2018Now that I heard it, you are right\u2019 trait.Even the timing wasn\u2019t right. That was after we decided to arrange the arrangement.\u201cUh, huh?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dSeon Ahyun was embarrassed, so he dropped the chicken he was eating.I was a bit confused too.\u2018That\u2019s what I said when the main camera was gone and the only camera installed in the corner was turned around.\u2019I didn\u2019t think it was going to be used on TV.However, the camera was fixed, so it felt off record.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostThanks to that, the conversation sounded a little more sincere.[D-Do you, r-really think that\u2026 I can do well?][Why would I lie to you?][\u2026\u2026!!]With the touching editing added to it, it almost looked like a recruitment scene for a Shonen Manhwa colleague.I got confused.\u2018No, it\u2019s good that they edited it well\u2026\u2026 \u2019It was a random choice considering my character that the producers have been building up since the first episode.Did they decide to replace it because the spirit didn\u2019t come out?In the meantime, Park Moondae in the screen brought out \u2018that line\u2019 along with the wonderful BGM.[Just think \u2018I\u2019m going to do this\u2019.]And the living room rang in reaction.\u201cOoooh~\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 You can do this?\u201d\u201cMoondae-ssi, do you usually think like this, Kya~ Wise saying!\u201dJust\u2026 let\u2019s ignore it.In the midst of ridicule, whether it was booing or admiration, the broadcast showed a short interview with Seon Ahyun.[Seon Ahyun: T-T-Thank you very much\u2026 \u2026 .][Seon Ahyun: Working hard\u2026 (I have to.) That\u2019s what I thought. Do it. I had to do it.]Even though Seon Ahyun\u2019s mentality was a little weak, he was definitely loyal. I thanked him immediately.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cUh, uh\u2026 Oh no, thank you\u2026 \u201d\u201cOh, so heartwarming.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dWhile Seon Ahyun, who had been hijacked from the conversation, was even more embarrassed, the cut that showed Mudy\u2019s advice finally appeared on the TV screen.[Guys. You have to figure out the direction you want to head first.]Yes, this was important.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 23": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Debut or DieCH 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe arrangement meeting was led by Keun Sejin. And I received quite a bit of footage.[Kwon Heesung: It\u2019s a relief that Keun Sejin is the leader you know!][Ha Iljun: He is definitely a friend with leadership skills.]Judging from the interviews of Gold 1 and 2, the production team also seemed to be planning to push Keun Sejin\u2019s position as a leader.\u201cThank you, everyone~\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re thankful, talk about me in the next interview.\u201d\u201cMe too!\u201d\u201cAh, Of course~\u201dAnd one participant was looking at the screen in the living room with contrast to Keun Sejin who had a relaxed expression.I glanced at Choi Wongil.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dChoi Wongil, who was silent despite coming to the meeting today, now openly showed tension in his face.How did the production crew edit Choi Wongil\u2019s quarrel with me?From my point of view, as long as It didn\u2019t come out as a quarrel, frankly, I didn\u2019t care about it at all.However, the editing went in an unexpected direction.Choi Wongil\u2019s quarrel was completely edited.[The idea is good, but if it goes wrong, it might look like a mockery of the original song.]In addition, Keun Sejin\u2019s rebuttal to what I said was cut off.Instead, a Keun Sejin that seriously raised his head, was put in frame.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost[\u2019ve been thinking about it, but I think there\u2019s a way to go strong while preserving the original song\u2019s emotions\u2026.. And there seems to be one.]And immediately, they connected as if I gave my opinion.\u2018They must have thought that Choi Wongil didn\u2019t need the story\u2019In order to preserve the dramatic flow of arrangement, it was made into something that had no ambiguous dispute in the picture.\u2018Come to think of it, they also skipped the part where we changed parts in the beginning.\u2019Choi Wongil seemed relieved, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case.In the end, Choi Wongil did not receive any proper cuts until the end. Even his interview didn\u2019t come off well.Perhaps there was not much to use in interviews because he often said something about not liking his parts or arrangements.Anyway, that was probably good, and the important thing was my editing.Just in time, Park Moondae on the screen was finishing his speech with a faint smile.[Mixing it with fear.][\u2026\u2026!!]Then, one by one, the surprised faces of the team members showed in close-up.\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t that a bit extra?\u201dIt was an edit that made people who saw it think that it was a rare idea.There was even another interview.[Ha Iljun: Wow! (Moondae) what he says is right!][Kwon Heeseung: I thought this was it.][Lee Sejin(A): That\u2019s\u2026 He is talented]Child actor Lee Ahyun\u2019s words sounded somewhat bitter. But more than that, I couldn\u2019t believe that he had such an interview.Thanks to this, the living room was full of jokes and cheers, shooting at each other with cheesy interviews. Lee Sejin kept his mouth shut and firmly looked at the screen.And everything turned into laughter when Keun Sejin\u2019s interview came out.[Lee Sejin(B): Isn\u2019t Moondae so funny? (laughs) His expression was like a Tibetan fox and he exploded with ideas, it was seriously so funny!!]Against the backdrop of Keun Sejin\u2019s words, \u2018Park Moondae\u2019\u2019s response to all kinds of situations was edited.Seon Ahyun\u2019s ranking evaluation.[I\u2026 I-I\u2026 W-When I was young, I had an accident.\u2026.][Oh, my\u2026\u2026]The sad public opinion of the general public passed by, and Park Moondae was zoomed in.He looked like calmness itself.And the caption that was added.[Park Moondae: (No~D)]\u201cAh! That\u2019s right!!\u201d\u201cHe was really like that! (Laughs)\u201dAnd the trainer\u2019s harsh criticism scene.[This is the kind of evaluation you receive at a school talent show!][\u2026\u2026]Among the team members who were bowing their heads and biting their mouths, Park Moondae\u2019s peaceful expression could be seen.[Park Moondae: (Calm~ness)]That\u2019s right.All kinds of situations where the other participants were agitated.Park Moondae looked like a frozen pollack by himself.\u201cGasp!\u201d\u201cThat face! So funny!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOnly then did I admit my defeat.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostHe was alone among the participants who were overreacting, so he didn\u2019t look calm. But really\u2026\u2026 there seemed to be something wrong in his mind.\u2018I shouldn\u2019t have cursed at the production team.\u2019I laughed like crazy and reflected on myself, avoiding Keun Sejin\u2019s hand hitting my back saying sorry.Later, in the broadcast, the smooth arrangement process was not a short spoiler.[Lee Sejin (B): We\u2019ll do well!][Park Moondae: \u2026Fighting]I don\u2019t know why I shouted \u2018fighting\u2019 without any emotion\u2026\u2026And soon after, the stage began.The team members, who were talking about all sorts of things, quietly focused on watching at this moment.I looked at the unfamiliar face of \u2018Park Moondae\u2019 who wore make-up for the stage. I couldn\u2019t believe I was that guy.[Oooooooh-]Soon, a gloomy intro flowed with the introduction choreography, and the performance began in earnest.And the shocked faces of other participants who were waiting began to be inserted whenever the part changed. Oh my god.It was fortunate that the stage didn\u2019t feel cut off, perhaps thanks to the hard work that went into the editing.\u201cHmm.\u201dAnyway, the stage definitely came out well.In particular, I could see Seon Ahyun flying like a fish in water. The main dancer looked like Seon Ahyun, not Keun Sejin.\u2018I think Seon Ahyun\u2019s ranking will rise sharply.\u2019The next thing you could see well was Keun Sejin, and the rest of the parts were well played. Surprisingly, Lee Sejin also managed his expressions well, so he didn\u2019t look awkward.When Choi Wongil came to the center in the chorus, he seemed to have suffered some losses because the cut was distributed to Seon Ahyun due to the choreography.And for me\u2026 Fortunately, the bridge part came out properly.[Can\u2019t you feel me?]After this line, two or three reactions overlapped.\u2018\u2026Isn\u2019t it almost like a roundabout* song?\u201d(* T/N: Didn\u2019t know what to call it but basically it\u2019s a type of singing style where one person starts and the rest slowly join in after time)Thank you, but at the same time, the intentions were questionable.\u201cWhat if there\u2019s another senseless talent that goes into it?\u201dSo when the trainers\u2019 conversation was inserted in the bridge part reaction, they were staring at the screen with suspicious eyes.[Mudy: That was originally Wongil\u2019s part.][Jeogtaesong: Really?][Mudy: Yeah, but since Wongil said he couldn\u2019t do it, (Moondae) gave his chorus part and rearranged it by himself\u2026\u2026 (He did it).]But I didn\u2019t expect them to save the story for here.In addition, just listening to the trainer\u2019s conversation, it sounded like I did a good\u00a0 job and exchanged parts with Choi Wongil.Well, but in the end, it was true.Mudy even got an interview cut.[Mudy: Moondae is surprisingly soft-hearted][Mudy: But, the song is strong!]Thank you.Even the character of \u2018ignorant but a good boy\u2019 was better than \u2018I am ignorant and unaware\u2019.If I manage to avoid sudden death, I will be sure to send her a red packet to repay her kindness.The stage ended with enthusiastic responses from the audience shouting for encore.[Encore! Encore!]And the image of the team hugging and rejoicing was successfully broadcasted.\u201cWe were awesome.\u201d\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s my stage, but it was good to watch it.\u201d\u201cAgreed.\u201dWith meaningless applause, the conversation of all team members who were satisfied echoed through the living room.I was focused on myself so I only talked about my portion, but in fact, my teammates received a pretty even amount.Thanks to this, the atmosphere of the living room was still harmonious.I don\u2019t know, but there were probably many participants who were portraits.For example, Ryu Chungwoo\u2019s team that came out next was\u2026 It was at a level of wanting to pay silent tribute.Let me tell some of the captions.[They got the best song?][Ho-we-ver.][Members can\u2019t focus on practice.][Leader Ryu Chungwoo\u2019s struggle.]The finishing touch was an interview with Ryu Chungwoo, who had a difficult expression.[Ryu Chungwoo: \u2026We have to do it]Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u201cWow, they sent it properly.\u201d\u2019I already knew it wasn\u2019t that bad, but I felt bad watching it.Even the guys here talked casually and sympathetically while watching, so I said everything.\u201cHey, what should we do with them?\u201d\u201cChungwoo-hyung had a hard time. Huh, but still\u2026\u201dTo summarize roughly, it was a picture where Ryu Chungwoo endured the time of hardship to complete the stage with the rest of the team members who had no skills but many complaints.\u201cChungwoo has a good personality\u2026 Hey! Looking at it like this, you\u2019re a saint.\u201dGold 1\u2019s disheartening remarks accurately explained the editing composition.Anyway, the broadcast even showed us easily winning against Ryu Chungwoo\u2019s team.[The score is\u2026 82 against 401!][Woooo!!]It was a particularly good cut.Regarding the individual voting, it ended with a strange editing that made Ryu Chungwoo cheer for his individual voting.[Ryu Chungwoo: I think I lacked a lot of things.][Park Jungseob: Honestly, (individual voting) we shouldn\u2019t win it.][Lee Dojun: The person\u00a0 who led the team is responsible\u2026\u2026]Well, it was neat and good that our team didn\u2019t mention the individual voting at all.It was a complete victory for our team, both on the field and in the broadcast.At the end of the third episode, all the team members fell to the floor and sofa.\u201cWow, this is so exciting.\u201d\u201cI was so nervous that I thought I was going to die!\u201d\u201cI-I was scared.\u201d\u201dEven Seon Ahyun spoke about it.Everyone seemed to have used a lot of their hearts.Keun Sejin lied down on the sofa and said,\u201cAh, that\u2019s a strange thing to say\u2026 Everyone worked really hard. Hey, everyone looked so good on the show!\u201d\u201cKeun Sejin, you did a great job~\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad it came out well.\u201dGold 2 raised his eyes with anticipation and left this comment.\u201cWe\u2019ll get great responses, right?\u201dAnd as if someone had granted a wish, the words came true.***The first reaction that showed as an indicator was on youtubeThe stage video of \u2018October 31\u2019 the team that Park Moondae belonged to, was ranked 9th in real time popular videos.The comments were crazy.\u2013 From the arrangement to the stage, everything is amazing.\u2013 Such a precious stage in a shabby place like RJC;;\u2013 Everyone, this is stock you want to eat.\u2013 What? Vampire? Wait for me.

So cute \u3160\u3160 Is this real?Immediately after the broadcast, similar recommendations or appreciative articles were posted one after another and shared on a 10,000 a day basis.[IJC stage reinterpreted the female debut song][Participant team who created art with MallanDalkom][IJC Episode 2, Ranking is likely to change]Even after encountering \u3008Idol Joint-Stock company\u3009 with this stage, the viewers were slowly starting to warm up to it.\u2013 I saw the vampire concept stage. Is it IJC\u2019s new season?\u2013 I thought they would be ruined, but what is with this stage quality?\u2013 I never liked idols. But how can I vote for this?\u3160\u3160Perhaps that\u2019s why I was able to see the article of people tying the team together.\u2013 I wish they could debut like this!\u2013 The members are taking turns voting.\u3160\u3160 Ah, why aren\u2019t they a group already?Several fast-paced KPOP reaction channels also moved.They posted a reaction comparing the original song of MallangDalkom with the stage arrangement of October 31.[WOW! It\u2019s like, one of a kind, right?]The video was reuploaded on the reaction translation channel with subtitles, constantly reproducing domestic and overseas inflows.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostIn the process, the frequency of the team members being mentioned in places like SNS also increased overwhelmingly.It was truly a tectonic shift.The finishing touch took place when the group posted a video of them reacting to the stage on Youtube.[IJC popular performance!

October 31\u2019s \u2018Into The New World\u2019 reaction video]The members of MallangDalkom, who had completed their group activities after their heyday, were continuing their lives in a position of a celebrity on SNS, except for one member who succeeded as an actor.Among them, two members joined forces to jump on the trend and opened a YouTube channel.And just in time, they didn\u2019t miss out on the interesting content related to them.Thus, except for one member who was busy with her acting schedule, all the other members sat together and watched the arrangement stage of October 31.\u201cWow.\u201d\u201cOh, this is a difficult part.\u201d\u201cYueun\u2019s part, Seon Ahyun-ssi? He is my stock now.\u201d\u201cOh, the main vocalist is our fan!

Wow\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very delicate.\u201dOf course, when the bridge came out, everyone was shocked.\u201cThey raised the high note like this?\u201d\u201cOne-kin?!\u201d\u201cWow, they are so cool\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHe must really be our fan.\u201dAnd at the end, it ended in tears.\u201cOh, no. Why am I crying? Why am I crying?\u201d\u201cAh~ They did so well. I guess we were really touched.\u201dThe members, who were crying and fanning their faces with their hands, slowly opened their mouths.\u201cWe\u2026 received a lot of love with a fun B-class concept. But originally, our debut song was like this.\u201dAfter debuting as a flower fairy, the MallangDalkom made a comeback with the so-called \u2018ridiculous\u2019 concept.So at that time, there were memes that became famous on the Internet and other places.\u2013 From Flower Fairy to flowerX on their headOnly read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostIt was the day when all of them wore a hairpin symbolizing a flower for the stage of \u3008POP\u2606CON\u3009 .Someone left that comment comparing the screenshotted picture with a picture from the first album stage.\u201cActually, we\u2026 It\u2019s true that we were loved more because they liked our debut song and gap, but it\u2019s a bit\u2026 It was a bummer.\u201dSince that comment became famous, It was true that POP\u2606CON as a song became more of a hot topic.They also had good feelings rather than bad memories about the concept of ridiculous-flavored cutie that brought them back to their heyday.But that didn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t sad at all.\u201cWe were able to do various concepts\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was no one who would not be offended by the subtle ridicule.So, they were very moved by the participants who approached their debut song seriously, which was not very popular.\u201cThank you so much. MallangDalkom\u2026 Well, thank you for properly conveying the concept of innocence!\u201d\u201cYes. I loved your reinterpretation. Vampire\u2026 I want to try it too! If we ever get the chance.\u201dIt was also impressive that they liked the stage where the original song was reinterpreted beautifully without harming it too much.They wrapped up with a slightly teary voice.\u201cIt was a great performance.

Now that I realized the power of editing, I should be more careful.So let\u2019s look into things that will help with the next shoot.I put a new search term in the search box.[Park Moondae solo fancam]When I searched, the first video was the official video with the posting date marked as \u20181 Day Ago\u2019.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostI waited a day to watch it so that I could objectively look at the feedback.Then. The number was more than expected.[Views: 320,000]Considering that dancing was not my strength but instead just an addition, the figure was higher than expected.I saw the videos of the other participants showing up in the recommended videos below.\u201c30,000, 120,000, 7,000, 20,000, 60,000\u2026\u2026 Hmm.\u201dThere were only a few who had higher numbers than me. No, in the first place, most didn\u2019t even exceed 50,000.In terms of number of views, it was likely to be within the top 12.Considering that the stage had already been released, it was an even better result.\u2018But the actual content is more important.\u2019I looked through the video comments in order of recommendation.\u2013 Look at Park Moondae\u2019s expression in all his parts. He was born to be a genius idol \u3160\u3160\u2013 I\u2019m surprised at how this concept is also perfect\u2013 Popcorn, chicken feet, and now even horror. Park Moondae. Are you a god?\u2013 My ears thank you for that bridge\u2013 Moondae-ya is a fan of MallangDalkom, so when their song got picked he got a little excited, that\u2019s so cute!The last comment was a bit\u2026 There seems to be a misunderstanding, but It seems to be taken in well, so let\u2019s think of it as a compliment.Besides that, there were mostly compliments.When sorted by the latest order, I could see a few abusive comments here and there, but even those disappeared as they were being swept away by the late English comments.This time, I searched my name on SNS. \u2018Park Moondae\u2019 and \u2018Moondae\u2019.The screen was immediately filled with posts with images and videos.\u2013 Moondae is so cute. (Solo fancam gif)\u2013 How did you come up with horror from that? \u3160\u3160 Our Moondae\u2019s skills, personality, and sense are a trinity idol \u3160\u3160\u2013 Park Moondae is good at singing, but I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s that special, though his face is my type (Photo from Production Presentation)\u2013 Moon Puppy, eat well. Please be nice \u2661 (Photo of photoshopped puppy Mukban)I was a little embarrassed because it was overflowing with appreciation for all sorts of things.Face, voice, facial expression, shoulders, eating behavior\u2026. There was even an article saying that they liked a cute habit of mine that I didn\u2019t even know about.I rubbed the back of my neck with my hand.It\u2019s a bit embarrassing but\u2026 I didn\u2019t feel bad. I was grateful, and I felt strangely motivated, which was very good.Of course, this wouldn\u2019t be all of the Internet opinion.I was lost in thought.Let\u2019s see. If you transform \u201cMoondae\u201d in a way it won\u2019t be caught up in the search\u2026\u2026.\u201cHmm.\u201dI put in a search word without having to think much.[Gommeo (\uacf0\uba38)]It was a simple modification by turning \u2018Moon (\ubb38)\u2019 upside down and changing \u2018Dae (\ub300)\u2019 into a similar notation.Things like this were the standard while I was selling data, so my guess was probably right.And as expected, the results poured out.-Gommeo is so damn ugly, can\u2019t even dance to Pop Con F*ck, Where is the editing hahaha, I really hate it, diediedie\u2013 To be honest, IJ1C doesn\u2019t have any good main vocal, so it looks like they are clenching their fists and pushing Gommeo. The sound is so;; typically that cleanliness\u2026 Whew.\u2013 Being a fan of Gommeo and MallangSweet also shows a lot of concept.\u223c\u2013 I want to see Gommeo\u2019s chest. He should expose it the next stage.\u2013 Commoner hahaha Gommeo? He must have washed dishes while in the trainee camp~ I can bet my account, It\u2019s so fake that I can\u2019t even look at itOnly read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostThere were a lot of malicious comments without batting lines.Oh, even though I prepared my heart, it was still shocking.There was something weird in the middle.. It might seem like sexual harassment, so I guess they didn\u2019t want it to get caught up on the search.Interestingly, quite a few of the accounts that posted malicious comments had Cha Yujin as their profile pictures.It was probably because he was the most popular participant, so it was set up to check, but there were probably real ones also.And it seemed to create a strange tension.The atmosphere where the participants who performed together in the first team match, being attacked by the participants of other teams.It was not particularly surprising because it was a type of trend that was always observed in this type of audition program.It was also something I experienced myself when I sold data.The person who wants to discard the latter by buying the audition data for the participant they push and the data for the participant they check together.And so to speak, Cha Yujin and Park Moondae seemed to belong to opposing camps.\u201cShould I just say it\u2019s a side effect because the team match went extremely well?\u201dAnyway, it was something I could handle, so I just passed it off.Rather, I had to see if there was anything to extract from the malicious comments.\u2018For now there is no need to talk about the songs.\u2019Since it had an objective stat for it, it could be verified as the broadcast progresses.The next thing that was mentioned a lot was\u2026 my character.The biggest reaction was that it was contrived and unlucky, and those who criticised Park Moondae\u2019s face had a similar reaction to \u2018That sort of concept with that face? Haha\u2019.No, if I don\u2019t have a face, I can\u2019t have a character\u2026I\u2019ve never liked the direction of editing, but it was a little bitter.But soon I realized that it was an unnecessary feeling.\u201cIf it\u2019s my face. I can make it.\u201d\u2019The next shoot was the ranking announcement ceremony.Compared to the upcoming 4th episode, the filming time was about a month later.This meant that it would do so even if my appearance changed a little.\u201cStatus window.\u201dI focused on my visual stat without hesitation.And after thinking for a while, I took out my smartphone, opened the group chat, and sent a message.[Anyone know of a good shop?]Since we\u2019re doing it, let\u2019s do it properly.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost***A few days before the 5th episode, the ranking announcement ceremony aired, there were all kinds of rumors in the related communities on the Internet claiming to be ranking spoilers.=========================[\u3147\u3148\u3145 Ranking Spoilers]: This is from a staff (Unclear picture)1st place Cha \u3147jin.2nd place Ryu Chung\u3147.5th place Kim Raeb\u31476th place Seon \u3147hyun.Child actor s\u3147in is out of the top 10 because during the shooting, he has been dragging his feet and struggling while filming.=========================-It seems fabricated, but I wish Lee Sejin was quicker Ha.

It\u2019s disgusting.\u2514 There\u2019s a proof shot, so isn\u2019t it real?\u2514 Here you go. It\u2019s stolen from another behind-the-scenes picture that was uploaded last year.\u2514 Oh my\u2026And so, the manipulation was exposed and eventually the post was deleted.The production team did their best to block the spoilers, and the effort was half-lucky and successful.Thanks to this, just before the 5th episode with the ranking announcement ceremony started, viewers sat in front of the screen full of excitement.Here, the woman sitting in front of her desktop felt the same way.She was praying with her hands together.\u2018Please Moondae\u2019s stocks\u2026\u2026\u2019In the minimised tab of her desktop, there was a Park Moondae fancam from the production presentation being uploaded.Yes, she was the owner of the cannon camera, who was hooked on Park Moondae while watching the first team match as a spectator.She had completely transferred to Park Moondae through the PR broadcast and the main program.She even settled down as a home master by posting the pictures she took.And today was the long-awaited day of the ranking announcement. She thought nervously.\u2018There\u2019s no way that Moondae will fall. However, once he gets a high rank here, his recognition as a top rank will definitely be solidified.\u201dThe reality was that the latecomers were beaten everywhere, and it was difficult to climb through the already hardened concrete layer.\u2018So the first ranking announcement is important.\u2019She thought so, and with one hand, she wrote to her account through her smartphone.=========================FullMoon Baby: I uploaded a fancam of Park Moondae\u2019s production presentation.

Anyway thenPark Moondae\u2019s fans continued to pour out painful comments.In fact, Park Moondae\u2019s cheerful investment in his visual stats played a big role in getting the compliments.However, everyone naturally believed that the change in hairstyle had brought about a change in appearance.Because that one cut came out so well, their runaway went on for quite some time.[Creating a PR show]Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostIt was at the time when all the small behind-the-scenes productions were over and the PR broadcast preparation filming started just before the ranking announcement.On the screen, the participants were astonished by the MC\u2019s announcement.[You guys have the next 15 minutes! Just find the treasure ball!][What?!]\u2018I was curious about this.\u2019She came to her senses and refocused on the broadcast.She wondered if they would shed some light on how Moondae got to pick the chicken feet.[Hey!][Oh yeah! gold!]However, on the screen, it only showed the participants who rushed around for a long time to find and steal the balls.\u2018What. There is not enough screen time for Moondae.\u2019Park Moondae\u2019s fans complained that the producers had no sense.Even the viewers unexpectedly made similar remarks.\u2013 The story of the chicken feet doesn\u2019t come until the end?\u2013 It\u2019s like he just screwed up and did chicken feet\u2013 HahahaHowever, these reactions changed quickly.Because Park Moondae suddenly appeared in a quiet restaurant where there were no people.\u2013 ??\u2013 What, why is there no one here?\u2013 Why is Park Moondae alone?Park Moondae, who entered the restaurant, gestured behind his back.Then the others\u2019 heads crept out from behind the door.[Lee Sejin (B): There is no one here right?][Park Moondae: Yeah.

She imagined Park Moondae sitting on the pavilion on top of a rice paddy, wearing a straw hat and with an indifferent expression.\u2018It suits him\u2026\u2026!\u2019Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostOriginally, in the early days of becoming a fan, there was a symptom where it felt like a painting no matter where she imagined him.In the meantime, various participants were being shown preparing for their PR live in the broadcast.From Kim Ra-bin, who picked an electric piano and did the theme song for Idol Joint-Stock Company, to Keun Sejin, who promoted sneakers and performed random play dance for an idol hit song.There were a lot of pretty funny scenes.Focusing on some of the top participants, it briefly highlighted the circumstances of the players who could not find a ball at all.[For those who do not have a collaboration item, It\u2019s our program! Please promote\u3008Relisted! Idol Joint-Stock Company\u3009!]Of course, most of them did not make it to the top 33 and barely managed to continue the broadcast for 10 minutes.There was no way it would be fun to have a dozen people running the same boring content at the same time.And they briefly shed light to the participants who promoted unusual collaboration items, and of course, Park Moondae came out here.The scene where Park Moondae sets down the chicken feet and sits was even properly subtitled.[Park Moondae (Chicken feet lover) A.K.A Mukbang Star][Cha Yujin: It was really great]Cha Yujin\u2019s, who watched with his mouth open, passed briefly.Her timeline was once again covered with the word \u2018cute\u2019. She also included her own writings.\u2013 Moondae is so cute, sprinkle chicken feet \u3160\u3160The PR broadcast preparation process ended mostly warmly, as if the live had ended well.It was as if the events of some participants accidentally exposing the secrets of other participants or talking about sensitive issues that occurred during filming had never happened.Even though they were harassed on the Internet and the two of them left voluntarily.As long as the program was on track for popularity, there was no need to recreate the controversy of the participants in the main broadcast.Since they had already guessed that it would, the majority of viewers were sarcastic or criticized once or twice before focusing on what\u2019s next.It was the long-awaited announcement ceremony for each team\u2019s individual competition.[Everyone! Do you remember the reward for the first place in the individual voting for the first team match?][Ah\u2026\u2026][1st ranking announcement ceremony, these people passed!]On the screen, several participants who were muttering, \u2018I wish I could be you\u2019 could be seen.And after the MC cut off the time by adding useless words with flamboyant skill, each team called out a winner.Of course, most of the participants tried to pretend they were celebrating.[Wow][Congratulations!]In particular, Ryu Chungwoo\u2019s team members, who were portrayed as controversial, tried to not look bad at all when Ryu Chungwoo\u2019s 1st place was announced.However, in the broadcast, it was put in a strange atmosphere again.[\u2026\u2026][\u2026\u2026Ah.][Congratulations.][Yes, thank you. You\u2019ve been through a lot\u2026 Sorry.][\u2026no.

Ahh \u3160\u3160 I\u2019m so happy\u2013 Everyone did well, so no matter who received it, it isn\u2019t strange \u3160\u3160\u2013 Moon Puppy, you did a good job~Perhaps if she did a more blatant search\u2026\u2026 She might be able to find this kind of reaction quickly.\u2013 He had to get help arranging and mental help, but Seon Ahyun eats raw* everyday haha, ah humanity is destroyed~(*Eating raw is basically eating without effort)Of course, there were some malicious individual fans.Fortunately, thanks to Moondae\u2019s new visual while he congratulated on the screen, the topic quickly changed.She quickly took a close-up shot of Moondae and uploaded it.\u2013 I don\u2019t know who did it, but thank you so much for the blonde Moondae\u2026 (Screenshot)In the broadcast, the MC was also making a meaningful sound.[By the way, what would happen if a participant who originally failed passed?][\u2026Huh!][Oh, maybe.][Everyone, the participant with the lowest score will be eliminated!]For reference, she was not interested at all while watching.\u2018Please don\u2019t call Moondae quickly\u2026!\u2019She was just nervous, hoping that Park Moondae would be called in the second half.[Then we will announce the 47th participant.]She was thinking of making a sales video for youtube while the lower rankings went by, but she couldn\u2019t get her mouse to work properly.\u2018What is this and why am I nervous\u2026\u2026!\u2019When she couldn\u2019t stand it and brought her soda and sat down, the announcement finally entered the top 30.It was after it cut up again in the middle and proceeded with the boring drink PPL content.\u2018Not even a single cut of Moondae came out\u2026 !\u2019It was because he hadn\u2019t touched the drink since he almost spit it out, but that was something that viewers could not understand.It was only around the time when the 31st place was announced that she saw a scene that interested her.[31st place\u2026 Participant Kwon Heeseung!]A participant in October 31alongside Moondae, who was referred to as Gold 2 in his heart.Among the people who came out to the podium to greet him, there was Park Moondae.[Congratulations.]It was very cute as he gave an awkward high-five with a serious expression.Meanwhile, the MC made a joke that didn\u2019t even make sense.[This is the first member of October 31 to advance to the next broadcast! Is that why it\u2019s number 31?][Looks like it!]Starting with Kwon Heeseung, the members of the October 31 team began to be called out to the podium sporadically.Choi Wongil and Ha Iljun (Gold 1) were not called for a while after they were announced in the mid-20s.Then came the 13th.[Congratulations. 13th place\u2026 Participant Lee Sejin!

It\u2019s just like our team. It seems like fate.]Keun Sejin made a joke according to the situation.And he climbed up after neatly finishing his thanking and encouraging words that looked serious and sincere.Moondae is in top 12!She swallowed her saliva and waited for the next announcement.Since Park Moondae did not have a pre-formed awareness before the first episode aired, this alone was a tremendous achievement.[The contestant who ranked 11th\u2026 is Seo Hyuncheol!]And until the 11th place, Moondae\u2019s name was not called.It finally reached a number that she could count with her fingers.10th, 9th\u2026\u2026[The contestant who placed in 8th place\u2026\u2026Ah, the participant who sang the MallangDalkom song in the first team fight.]\u2018Done\u2026!\u2019She relaxed her shoulders and exhaled her breath.She would probably call Moondae. She thought it was almost a fact.First of all, child actor Lee Sejin had overwhelming recognition in the beginning, and Seon Ahyun had a very good index thanks to his last stage.So she thought those two would be called after Moondae.[This participant showed an unexpected charm\u2026\u2026]After taking turns illuminating the three remaining October 31 participants for quite some time, the MC continued.[Participant Lee Sejin!][\u2026!]Lee Sejin stood up with a stiff face.Seon Ahyun and Park Moondae, who were still present, gave congratulations like it was a habit.[Congratulations.][C-Congratulations\u2026\u2026][\u2026Thanks.]Lee Sejin smiled faintly and greeted back awkwardly.And she shouted with her voice.\u201cHuuuuuh!\u201dThe reaction of the related community was also overflowing.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u2013 OMG\u2013 Huh, Lee Sejin\u2013 I thought he would be in top 5\u2013 8th place?\u2013 Although we talked about personality, I thought he would come out as a hard worker and maintain his rank.\u2013 Pah, It\u2019s pretty close, how interesting;;\u2013 Is it possible that the other contestants were pushed out of the rankings?Lee Sejin bowed his head and left the stage, leaving short and bold words, \u2018Thank you, I will do my best\u2019.She grabbed the mouse.\u2018Then, what\u2019s Moondae\u2019s rank?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I will show you how I progress so as to not go against the shareholders expectations. Please take a good care of me]He then bowed his head.It was a standard testimonial, but perhaps because of the choice of words, it reminded people of a corporate fair rather than an idol.When words like \u2018Are you Moon Puppy\u2019 appeared on social media, the MC asked a pre-prepared question.[You got a lot of attention from your PR with chicken feet, what kind of mukbang would you like to do again if you were to debut?][Hmmm\u2026 Steamed tripe?]The MC burst into laughter at the unusually accurate product name.[Is there a reason?][It was the most delicious after chicken feet.]At Park Moondae\u2019s calm reply, laughter erupted from everywhere.The MC wrapped it up in a humorous way.[Ah, this time also, a PPL-related product! He is a participant who really cares about the Idol Joint-Stock Company. ~ And he gains 5th place like this! Participant Park Moondae.][Thank you.]Park Moondae just smiled faintly and bowed his head once again as a farewell.He then went up to the position that matched his rank.It was moderately sensible, and it was an editing of impressions that did not leave any room for controversy.As she watched, she sighed in relief.She was worried because there was always some editing that gave a strange feeling about Park Moondae.\u2018I guess they are giving it to other participants.\u2019Sure enough, Kim Raebin, who was announced for fourth place, received an awkward edit.He had a conflict with the 7th place participant in a team fight, which seemed to be the aftermath.Anyway, she watched the rest of the presentation with more ease.In fact, it didn\u2019t matter who it was.\u2018If it\u2019s possible, I want Seon Ahyun to be saved also. Oh, and I wish Cha Yujin would fail a little.\u2019She was so angry about Cha Yujin\u2019s fans calling Park Moondae names and posting bullshit about him on SNS that she wanted to sue.However, \u3008Idol Joint-Stock Company\u3009 usually prefers participants who leave the agency, so it has traditionally been difficult to silence public opinion through accusations from the agency.\u2018They even used Moondae who is an ordinary person\u2026\u2026 \u2019She was just worried that he might have been hurt while searching.\u2018Once he debuts, I will have to send PDFs to the agency as soon as possible.\u2019With firm determination she went back to watching the broadcast.Seon Ahyun was third.\u201cT-T\u2026 Thank you. Uuu,\u201dSeon Ahyun cried profusely as he said his thanks.The reaction cuts of several team members of October 31 who had tears in their eyes were put in along with a moving BGM.\u201cI-I could d-do it.\u2026 I-I didn\u2019t think like that.

She wanted to see more.Next time, she hopes to be able to go take pictures of him on her way to work, and she wished for Park Moondae\u2019s protection.After the ranking announcement ceremony was over, filming for the next team match continued.\u2018Won\u2019t either Keun Sejin or Seon Ahyun be on the same team again?\u2019As she made a series of speculations, she longed deeply in her heart.\u2018Whoever it is, I hope Moondae can make a wonderful stage at ease!\u2019***I felt like something would break.What kind of a situation was this?\u201cAh! He has named the participant Park Moondae!\u201dThe excited voice of the MC and the surprised exclamations of the participants resounded everywhere.\u201cOh my!\u201d\u201cMoondae-hyung?\u201dEven though the size was reduced from 77 to 49, it was still a size that made my ear ache.Are they surprised? I was surprised too.Why did he name me?\u201cAnd with that, Participant Park Moondae\u2026 Will be joining Kim Raebin\u2019s team.\u201dIt was an expected routine for us to start filming for the second team fight right after the ranking announcement ceremony.-This team\u2026 will be decided by lots!-The 7 participants I choose will become the leaders, and they will select their team members by taking a quiz!I thought this rule would come out at least once.But I didn\u2019t think he would choose me.Kim Raebin.A participant from the same agency as Cha Yujin, currently in 4th place. As far as I know he goes to the finals in 2nd place.By the way, we never even said hello to each other.\u201cThen Participant Park Moondae, please go!\u201dI trudged and stood next to Kim Raebin.\u2018I can\u2019t ask why he chose me out of everyone.\u2019If I did, I didn\u2019t know how it would be edited. First, let\u2019s nod our heads as if we\u2019ve met a business partner.\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d\u201cYes. I look forward to your kind cooperation.\u201dFortunately, he gave a good greeting without a harsh impression.\u2018I guess he didn\u2019t have bad intentions.\u2019I guess I had some prejudice because he gave the image of a handsome bully that the teenagers seem to prefer these days.\u2018Then, did he really choose Park Moondae because he seemed useful?\u2019Kim Raebin was a participant who focused on rapping, so there was nothing strange if he didn\u2019t check the main vocal part.In the first place, If I was chosen by a low ranking participant I would have guessed I was chosen as the main vocalist.But obviously\u2026 In Kim Raebin\u2019s former team, there was a participant who was originally going to debut in the main vocal position.Yet he skipped him?Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u2018Ah, the last team member is uncomfortable.\u2019Thinking about it, I figured it was better to skip them.That\u2019s because Kim Raebin\u2019s former team had their atmosphere ruined because of the individual voting rewards.Well. I remember the last broadcast.\u2013 Didn\u2019t you give me this part on purpose?\u2013 No. It\u2019s so everyone can perform their best on the stage\u2026\u2026\u2013 So you thought I could only do thisIt didn\u2019t appear on the show, but after the individual voting reward was announced, I heard that there was a guy who grabbed him by the collar.\u2018The brutality was used very well on the broadcast.\u2019Thanks to this, Cha Yujin was the only one who survived the broadcast with good editing.The team\u2019s main vocal didn\u2019t have a lot of volume, but it\u2019s not strange to say that they seperated each other because it felt uncomfortable.And out of the remaining vocals, it made sense for him to choose Park Moondae, the most verified vocalist.\u2018But it\u2019s a bit strange that I was the first one he chose.\u2019It\u2019s not something to worry about right now.I quickly organized my thoughts and grasped the situation.\u201cNext quiz~ Five words that start with \u2018Park\u2019!\u201d\u201cMuseum, Applause, Bat, Park Hyeokgeose, Park Goji.\u201d*(T/N: In order \u2013 \ubc15\ubb3c\uad00 (Parkmulgwan), \ubc15\uc218(Parksu), \ubc15\uc950(Parkjwi), \ubc15\ud601\uac70\uc138 (Park Hyeokgeose), \ubc15\uace0\uc9c0 (Park Goji), the Park in the first 3 can be said as Pak/Bag)Kim Raebin immediately raised his hand and got the right answer. His momentum was resolute.\u201cWow! Participant Kim Raebin got all the right answers in a row\u201d\u201cAhhh!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this too advantageous for rappers?\u201dWith the rich reactions of the participants who grasped the broadcast system, Kim Raebin immediately pointed to the next participant.\u201cCha Yujin\u2026 I will pick this participant.\u201dEven if he was from his previous team, he was in first place. I would have done the same.It was surprisingly clever.Looking at the last team fight, it seemed that he was more social than Lee Sejin, but was that just the power of rumors and editing?However, I don\u2019t know what effect it will have on me if we formed a team like this.\u2018I think it will be very different from the first one.\u2019\u201cGood choice!\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs soon as he was pointed out, Cha Yujin ran quickly and pretended to know Kim Raebin.And then he gave me a thumbs up.\u201cWe are together!\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re good on stage!\u201d\u201cYes.

Just in time, I had one point left.Of course, it was a waste.\u201cHowever\u2026. unlike other stats, if my visual changes rapidly, they will suspect it of being plastic surgery, not growth.\u201d\u2019This was especially true if the level of the alphabet changed.I raised it from C+ to B- in the beginning, thanks to the fact that I started it while preparing for the broadcast. However there was no excuse to raise it from B- to A- right away.Going up to B+ from B- was barely possible because of the month-long break and changing my hairstyle.\u2018Well\u2026 I wanted to strengthen my image as a puppy, so it helped.\u2019Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostAfter searching up their rankings, among all the dog breeds golden retrievers seemed to be the trend these days, so I wanted to remind people of that.Well, the chatter got a bit long. Let\u2019s hurry up and pick a characteristic from the pop-up.\u2018I hope I get something I can use.\u2019In the new pop-up, the familiar roulette machine spinned around and stopped. It was a brass square.I couldn\u2019t get the silver square which appeared to be high grade once again. Just as I was thinking how it was a pity I saw the name of the characteristic.[Characteristic: \u2018Look at me!

It used to be a characteristic like chicken ribs*, but now it was revived as a knight.(*T/N: Chicken ribs refers to something that has no worth but is also not worth throwing away)That\u2019s how it felt.But it was the \u2018Talent\u2019 stat. A very strange ability had risen.To be honest, it\u2019s an ability that makes it so you have a presence in front of a camera, and to put it simply\u2026 I think it was star-like.Just in time, the participant with the highest stats was next to me.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u201cWith that! The teams have been decided~\u201d\u201cWow!\u201dOnce the team recruitment was over, I heard the MC\u2019s comment signaling it.I responded appropriately with an applause and checked Cha Yujin\u2019s status window.[Name: Cha Yujin]Vocals: C+ (B+)(Rap: B)Dance: A+ (S+)Visual: A (S)Talent: A+ (EX)Characteristic: Black hole (A)It was a terrifying status window just looking at it.The triple A stat in a row made me think that this was the type of people who were idols.In particular, Cha Yujin had the highest stats and potential among the participants.It was higher than the judge Youngrin, which meant that it was higher than most active idols.And one of the lowest abilities in my current status window was the \u2018Talent\u2019 skill that I just managed to fix.It would be good if I could get some hint during the current team match about whether to focus on Talent or Dancing First.\u201cEveryone, please start saying hello to your team members! I will introduce the 2nd team match as soon as you\u2019re done with the greeting!For now, the problem was whether the team match would end well.I thought silently as I looked around the faces of the team members who quietly sat down following the MC\u2019s words.\u2018Let\u2019s not get involved no matter what kind of mess might happen.\u2019***\u201cOh, nice to meet you\u201d.Ryu Chungwoo, the leader of the team, smiled and greeted the team members over the strange power struggle of other participants.Everyone hit their palms, but I could feel the tension underneath them.\u2018This\u2026 I think I\u2019ll get caught even if they don\u2019t edit it.\u2019The production crew caught this kind of check perfectly.\u201cDid you all say hello?\u201d\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s nice to see everyone being so warm-hearted~ Shall we announce the 2nd team project?\u201d\u201cUh-huh!\u201dEven when the participants shouted at the MC\u2019s words, the participants of this team had a relatively respectful attitude\u2018It feels like I\u2019m taking care of myself while being in the same group with other students in liberal arts.\u2019Anyway, it wasn\u2019t a problem that I could solve, so let\u2019s just focus on what the MC says.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u201cThere is some content that \u2018Idol Joint-Stock Company\u2019 has been working on for the 2nd team match. Do you know what it is? Oh! That\u2019s right. It\u2019s the \u2018Rediscovery of Hidden Masterpieces\u2019 project!They were doing it again this season.\u201cOn the website\u2026 They voted out of 50 songs, right?\u201cYes.\u201dThere were murmurs around me. Other participants were just giving conventional reactions to see if they already knew everything.\u201cThe masterpieces that couldn\u2019t shine for many reasons! It\u2019s a project where they will be reinterpreted by \u2018Idol Joint-Stock Company\u2019 and introduced to the public once again. This year, our shareholders have selected various idol masterpieces!\u201dTo put it bluntly, they weren\u2019t successful but the song was okay, so they wanted to remake it and use it as their own song.\u2018Since there is no creation economy the cost of composition will also lessen.\u2019While admiring the production team\u2019s amazing cost-cutting ability, someone suddenly spoke to me from the side.Surprisingly, it was Lee Sejin.\u201c\u2026Is there a song you want to do?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dHe looked like he regretted saying that, but anyway, the question was a question, so I answered.\u201cI hope it\u2019s a catchy song.\u201dWhich meant that I did not want to do a song that wouldn\u2019t do well.\u201cWhat about you?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I wanted to do \u2018Base\u2019.\u201dIt was a good choice. \u2018Base\u2019 was the title song of a popular idol group during an unknown period, just like MallangDalkom\u2019s debut song from the last team.I actually saw the stage, and I remember that the concept was strong and the melody was addictive.\u201cThat song is good. I think it\u2019d be good to make it into a stage.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.Right.\u201dLee Sejin nodded in affirmation.The moment when I thought that I had finally begun to take care of my social skills, Cha Yujin suddenly intervened in the conversation.\u201cI like that song, too. \u2018Base~ Uh, Ringing Beat~\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah, yes.\u201dLee Sejin closed his mouth with an uncomfortable look.\u2018This guy is always like this.\u2019If he was going to keep being like this, I wanted to ask why he was here.Anyway, it was better not to have silence since there was a camera. Let\u2019s just roughly patch things up\u201cI see. I hope we can do it this time.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dCha Yujin brightly affirmed with a blank look.\u2018He doesn\u2019t have any no sense or context, but still, he is a positive guy.\u2019As the evaluation was being raised in it\u2019s own way, the MC finally announced the selection method.\u201cThere are 7 items on the table in front of you.\u201dJust like she said, I could see a table quite a distance away from the participants.\u201cThese items belong to the original artists of different \u2018Hidden masterpieces\u2019~ You have to try and use your intuition and reasoning to choose one of these belongings! You can choose one.\u201d\u201cGasp.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m not good at this!\u201d\u201cThe method is~ Oh, it\u2019s a traditional. It\u2019s running! Leaders, please get ready!\u201cRunning?\u201dRyu Chungwoo, who was good at sports, could benefit as the leader.Of course, it would only be effective if he can guess the song by looking at the items.However, this kind of approach was possible.\u201cThat pouch! Looks like it belongs to a girl!\u201d\u201cThe baseball\u2026 Are they a baseball fan?\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s a skull pencil. Somewhat unique?\u201dOnly read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostThere were loud noises everywhere. Everyone seemed to be thinking in their own way.Ah, this team reached an agreement in an instant.\u201cI want you to bring the item that looks the most expensive when seen from a close distance.\u201d\u201cUm, Okay!\u201dLooks like his reasoning was that someone who puts out expensive things has a high chance of being a successful entertainer, it sounded plausible enough.It was probably the judgement he came up with considering the selection of songs as well as the amount of broadcasting.Ryu Chungwoo nodded and agreed to Kim Raebin\u2019s words.Soon after, the MC called the leaders again.\u201cOkay, leaders. Are you ready?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cWell then\u2026 let\u2019s go!\u201dThe leaders ran violently and threw their hands all over the table.\u2018No matter how much I look, I don\u2019t think there is enough time to pick anything properly.\u2019If so, wasn\u2019t this song selection completely up to luck?\u201cGood, I got it!\u201dHowever, Ryu Chungwoo snatched something and returned with a smile.And he held out the object with a confident face.It was a baseball.\u201cThis is Ryu Wanbeom\u2019s autographed ball!\u201d\u201cWow.\u201dEveryone widened their eyes in surprise. Ryu Wanbeom was a famous hitter who made it to the Major League.Cha Yujin immediately asked.\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\u201cI also watch some baseball. So I recognized it right away.\u201dRyu Chungwoo smiled and threw and caught the baseball. The energy of things going well temporarily eased tension in the team, creating a comfortable atmosphere.But it didn\u2019t last long.\u201cThe owner of the baseball is\u2026 Oh, It\u2019s Lee Chanwoo, the vocalist of the idol band \u2018Solar Island\u2019!The owner of the baseball was\u2026 a stranger that no one knew.\u201cWho is he?\u201dNo one in the team could give an answer to Cha Yujin\u2019s question.\u201cWow!\u201dRight next to us, Choi Wongil\u2019s team was excited and making a fuss.\u201cHello, I am Jeong Ha, a movie star.\u201d\u201cU-huh\u2026\u201dThe owner of the pouch chosen by the team\u2019s leader, Keun Sejin, was a famous female actor.Perhaps it was because of the first team match, but there was a strange sense of deja vu.I shrugged my shoulders.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u2018Well, this can happen.\u2019Anyway, the most important thing was the song.Of course, it was advantageous to secure airtime if a famous celebrity appeared.In addition, the advantage was that it could block reactions such as \u2018Stealing songs from poor unknown idols\u2019.However, in the end, it was overwhelmingly advantageous to have a good song. Because in an audition program, the stage had to be good.So if I check the song\u2026\u2026\u201cThe song I\u2019m going to leave to you is\u2026 \u3008Burning like the sun\u3009!Oh.Oh\u2026 This\u2026 What should I do?\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cI know!\u201dThe other team members exclaimed.\u201cI\u2019m glad I know this song\u2026\u201d\u201cSunbaenim, I\u2019m listening well!\u201dThe team was full of relief.It managed to regain vitality since the song was good and well known.The original singer was also excited to introduce the song.\u201c\u3008Burning like the sun\u3009 was released seven years ago, but it is still loved as a cheering song. I am sure any baseball fan has heard the chorus at least once.\u201d\u201cOh, I know it well. It\u2019s a great song.\u201dWhen Ryu Chungwoo answered in a friendly manner, the original singer smiled happily. Cha Yujin opened his eyes wide and asked a question.\u201cWhat about the chorus? I don\u2019t know baseball well!\u201dThe original singer cleared his throat as if he was waiting for this question.\u201cAh, hmm. \u2018Now, wake up~ Like the burning sun~\u2019 Like that.\u201d\u201cAha. That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cHaha!\u201dThe team members laughed warmly at Cha Yujin\u2019s poor grammar.Creating a warm atmosphere with the original singer looked very good compared to before.The problem was that\u2026\u2026 the outlook was not good.That\u2019s right. After this cut, I think they will probably put in subtitles that say \u20182 days later\u2019 and show the team\u2019s atmosphere as a preview.Because this song wasn\u2019t suitable for an idol survival show at all\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 28": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Debut or DieCH 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI\u2019ll be honest.If someone asked if \u2018Burning like the Sun\u2019 was a good song, I would be able to answer that it was.However, if they asked if it was a good song for an idol stage, I would answer by telling them to quickly give up on the idea.Because this song had typical 2000s rock band-style lyrics and sounds.\u2026.You can trust me. I used to listen to this song whenever I went to shoot the idols throwing the first pitch.It was just a fun band song that didn\u2019t fit the cheerleaders choreography. One advantage was the coolness of the high notes.In conclusion\u2026 The difficulty of the arrangement was ridiculously high.Couldn\u2019t I just get a characteristic that was related to composition? I really needed it right now.Regardless of my unanswered feelings, the conversation between the original singer and the participants was hopeful.The other team members seemed to know only one or two addictive lines of the song\u2019s addictive chorus.\u201cWe haven\u2019t been active for that long, so we couldn\u2019t sing this song that much. I hope that you guys do a great job this time.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll do our best to create a great performance!\u201dHow?Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u2026No. Let\u2019s stop being stressed for no reason, and if I wasn\u2019t hit by the editing of this team match, let\u2019s just think of it as a normal hit to save myself.Even if I continued like this, I think I would still be able to do a quick debut at a small or medium sized agency.\u2018But the performance\u2026 I thought I would pick a certain number.\u2019Strangely, I was disappointed. I don\u2019t know why I was so concerned about the stage when I wasn\u2019t doing this voluntarily in the first place.\u2018No matter who teases me for being too immersed, I have nothing to say.\u2019\u2026Still, it was fun.All right. Let\u2019s be a little more careful when discussing. Maybe the other participants can come up with good ideas.The original singer soon left the set. He said he would practice with the trainer during the mid-term evaluation a few days later.And the team members sat around, finally the story of the stage composition came out.***For now, Ryu Chungwoo came up with a concept to use as an example answer.\u201cWouldn\u2019t the concept of a cheering squad fit the best?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019ll go well with the song, and it would be good when including a difficult choreography.\u201d\u201cCheering? Hmm\u2026\u2026 Experience is a good thing.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cIt will be fun.\u201dSeveral people, including Cha Yujin, responded positively. The overall response was okay.\u201cWhat do you think? Raebin, Moondae, Sejin.\u201dRyu Chungwoo quickly looked through the team members\u2019 reactions and took note of the three silent participants. Including me.Rather than being the first to open my mouth, it worked better to observe the situation and choose the words afterwards.So let\u2019s naturally look in the direction where the other two were sitting.\u201cLet\u2019s hear Sejin\u2019s opinion first.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I think the cheering squad will look tacky.\u201dHe was saying facts.So far, there weren\u2019t any malicious edits, so Lee Sejin\u2019s uncooperative attitude was rarely highlighted in the broadcast.Remembering what I saw while looking up Park Moondae, Lee Sejin\u2019s fans believed him to be a \u2018sensitive and shy hard worker.\u2019However, Ryu Chungwoo was edited really well, so Lee Sejin may be hit with the editing this time.Anyway, Ryu Chungwoo was not very upset. He just calmly asked back.\u201cDo you have any other ideas?\u201d\u201cBecause I don\u2019t have any\u2026 I wasn\u2019t going to say anything.\u201d\u201cHmm, alright. Once you have one.\u201dRyu Chungwoo immediately asked Kim Raebin the same thing again.\u201cWhat do you think, Raebin?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know this song very well, so I think we should listen to it first.\u201d\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s play it first.\u201dWhen we opened the smart pad we were provided with, the chorus melody played with an electric guitar starting with the classic drum introduction.After everyone listened to the song with their mouths closed, Kim Raebin first muttered with a pale face.\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u201dFinally, someone noticed the disaster of this song selection.First of all, the lyrics were a youthful love melody that were popular during our childhood. In a good way, it means retro, in a bad way, it means old-fashioned.Naturally, there wasn\u2019t any noticeable concept like flower fairy or vampire, and it was also difficult to give it one.And since it was made based on a person who sings well standing up and singing alone, the octave of the chorus was so high that the neck was torn.What if we adjusted the octave? Then the charm of the song would disappear.Because the charm of the song was it\u2019s cheerful high notes that pierced the vocal cords.\u201cHmm, the note is very high. Did you find any other difficulties?\u201dKim Raebin breathed in as if he wanted to pour out words, but looked at the camera and shut his mouth.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostHe seemed to be wary since when the last team match aired he was beaten over by a personality controversy.\u201cSo\u2026 Yes. The song is good, but I think it\u2019s going to be hard to arrange it.\u201d\u201cReally? It really will be hard if you are saying it.\u201dRyu Chungwoo readily accepted. It seemed to be because although Kim Raebin\u2019s last team match failed, he was the one who led the arrangement and chose the right song.\u2018He changed a mass produced EDM song from the late 2000s to a well loved EDM trap, leaving only the sample beat.\u2019\u201cThen what about Moondae?\u201dIn the end, my turn came.\u201cI think we should decide on something before starting the arrangement.\u201d\u201cLike what?\u201d\u201cPart distribution.\u201dCan\u2019t see the answer from the song? Then, this should not be the focus of what is good.It should be in a place that doesn\u2019t break.I assure you, as of right now, I was the only one in the team who would be able to properly sing the chorus of this song.In order to digest this right away, one would need to have their vocal stat at atleast A, however I was the only one in the team with that.\u2018But I can\u2019t sing the whole chorus by myself.\u2019So we had to start by cutting and practicing parts so that our voice wouldn\u2019t crack right away.We can\u2019t decide on the arrangement right now no matter what we put on the table, so it was best to put it off for now.Now was not the time to paint the big picture. It\u2019s an emergency.If I had to convey this reasoning as mildly as possible, it would be like this.\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult song to sing, so I think we need to practice first.\u201d\u201cPart distribution\u2026 Of course it\u2019s important.\u201dRyu Chungwoo looked surprised.\u201cBut it\u2019s surprising. I heard that in the last team match, you decided to arrange the song first.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dIt didn\u2019t appear on the broadcast, so I didn\u2019t know how he knew.\u201cOh, I heard it from Keun Sejin.\u201d\u2018When did he even start talking with Ryu Chungwoo?\u2019As expected, he wasn\u2019t an ordinary man.\u201cRaebin, I\u2019m asking because you\u2019re the best at arranging the song. What do you think?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes. It\u2019s okay. I also made many decisions while practicing\u2026 I\u2019ll think about it.\u201dKim Raebin easily agreed. Although he was like a person who observed that a meteorite would fall on Earth tomorrow.\u201cWell, then, since we\u2019ve heard everyone\u2019s opinions, we\u2019ll move on with a show of hands until a better idea comes out.\u201dRyu Chungwoo immediately organized the situation without wasting time.\u201cRaise your hand if you agree to practice using the cheering squad concept.\u201dThe majority raised their hands. I heard it for now.Ryu Chungwoo did not give special notice to Lee Sejin, who did not raise his hand, and immediately moved on to the next agenda.\u201cThen, raise your hand if you want to distribute the parts first.\u201dFortunately, this also gained a majority vote. Seeing that even Lee Sejin raised his hand, my explanation must have made sense.Just before our eyes met, Lee Sejin quickly lowered his hand and averted his eyes.Did he want to show that he agreed with the opinion but not with me? But why?Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s start by distributing the parts.\u201dThe part distribution looked like it was progressing step by step, and soon we faced an expected difficulty.\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this area.\u201d\u201cUh, me too\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is too high.\u201dThe high-pitched melody in the chorus came out four times, accounting for about half of the song.However, all the team members except Park Moondae either failed or grabbed his neck and became awkward.A team member who had very good singing skills with his stat being B+ was anxious about his voice cracking, and eventually expressed his opinion.\u201cI think it\u2019s better to arrange it and lower the notes before doing it. Since there are two members who rap, how about adding some rapping?\u201dThat meant that we should arrange the song first. Damn it.\u201cLowering the notes\u2026\u2026.\u201dKim Raebin\u2019s expression became dark. The bad impression actually got worse.However, the trend was already tilted.\u201cI think it\u2019s right to lower it.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201d\u201cHmm, first of all, the team members should be able to digest it. Why don\u2019t we lower the key and arrange it accordingly?\u201dKim Raebin glanced around and eventually nodded.\u201cYes\u2026 Then I\u2019ll do that.\u201dIf he said he wouldn\u2019t do it here, he seemed to be afraid that he would lose it all and be crushed by the editing again.In the end, the arrangement was carried out reflecting all of the unifying opinions of \u2018lowering the notes\u2019, \u2018additional rap parts,\u2019 and \u2018an accompaniment suitable for a cheering squad concept\u2019.\u201dI think it\u2019s because clueless people end up smoothly when their voices are loud.The stage was as if it had already been ruined.I didn\u2019t bother to object during the process. Even if I said something, I was pushed out of the page.Even if luckily, \u2018Now that I heard it, you are right\u2019 activated itself, if I said something without a proper alternative, I would only seem like a dissatisfied personIn addition, there was no answer when the sound, \u2018You want to go as it is because you can sing,\u2019 began to come out.It was difficult to even look selfish when he appeared on the show like a person without social skills.So, I needed someone outside to tell me honestly that this was acting terribly.\u201cIn the end, is staying still and doing nothing the answer?\u201dThe midterm evaluation, which only judged the first verse, was three days later, and if the judges had ears, at least one of them would tell how bad it was.Until then, I should think of an alternative.\u201cLet\u2019s make the choreography now!\u201dHowever, the choreography Cha Yujin made that day along with that shout, was the move from \u3008It\u2019s me\u3009 with a sudden difficulty.Thanks to this, I had to resist the urge to put the remaining stat points into the dance, regardless of the alternative.As my stamina slowly melted, three days had passed.And, finally, the midterm evaluation began.***\u201cThis team\u2019s ranking is so fancy~\u201d\u201cRaebin sharpened his knife!\u201d\u201cEveryone got good results at the ranking ceremony.\u201dThe judges talked about our rankings first.The production team may have told them to mention it in advance, but it was the truth anyways, so it would serve as a way to set up expectations.\u201cAh, the demo song already came out?\u201dOnly read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u201cYeah!\u201dThis was thanks to Kim Raebin\u2019s direct conversation with the arranger.\u201cYou\u2019re amazing~\u201d\u201cYeah. This team is the only team! They are showing their arrangement already insead of the original song.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a team of talented people\u201d.The judges were already satisfied.But\u201cHmm\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter the stage, the reaction was lukewarm.The judges, who were shrugging their shoulders and exchanging glances, eventually grabbed the microphones one by one.\u201cTo be honest, your performance itself doesn\u2019t feel that bad. But it\u2019s not attractive.\u201d\u201cRight, the choreography you created was well done. I can see your wit. Um, cheering squad concept\u2026 I think it should go well with the song, but why does it feel so gloomy?\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that the rap feels like it comes out of the blue. You touched a lot of the original song, but it feels worse than the original song.\u201dAs the reviews piled up, the problem began to materialize.Finally, as soon as Judge Youngrin grabbed the microphone, she asked a question.\u201cWho rearranged the song?\u201dI purposely didn\u2019t look at Kim Raebin. Because the problem was the one who brought it up rather than the one who made it.But when I looked around, everyone else was looking at Kim Raebin, so it didn\u2019t mean much.\u201cWe discussed it together and did it.\u201dRyu Chungwoo quickly grasped the situation and turned it into joint responsibility. He also tried to neutralise the situation by saying he misled the team as the leader.That was a good judgment.But there were trolls everywhere.\u201cYes. And\u2026 Raebin did the arrangement.\u201dYou are going to cut your tail off like this?\u2018Are you crazy?\u2019How can you do something so silly when the camera is on?Looking at it, he also looked embarrassed out of fear of being criticized, so he seemed to have named the person out of reflex.\u201cF****ck\u2026\u201dIf I do something wrong, it will be edited as bullying.Just in case it created a wholesale effect, I opened my mouth first.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Raebin\u2026\u2026He could create an arrangement, so we discussed it with the composer, and we all agreed on the direction of the arrangement\u00a0 by sharing our own opinions.\u201dKim Raebin flinched.\u2018He can\u2019t open his mouth.\u2019Fortunately, Ryu Chungwoo came right in.\u201cThat\u2019s right. We\u2019ll talk about the issues you told us and fix it. So that on the day of the team match we will try and make it so we can give you the best stage.\u201dWe\u00a0 saved it.Ryu Chungwoo and I didn\u2019t add anything else.The judges looked like they were thinking deeply, but soon nodded.\u2018They probably thought that the opportunity to reprimand him already passed.\u2019It was a relief.\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to rearrange the song again, however that means being behind all the other teams. Can you do it?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll do it. We can do it, right?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cWe can do it!\u201dIf only it wasn\u2019t for the guy who threw his senses to the trash can and brought us all the way here, hopefully, he wouldn\u2019t miss the answer either.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostFortunately, this time, the troller also came to his senses and responded vigorously.Judge Youngrin nodded.\u201cOkay, but you have to know that this may be a reckless challenge under this time constraint and that you have to deal with the consequences.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Changing doesn\u2019t guarantee that the results will be better than now.\u201dBut if we didn\u2019t change it and the stage turned out bad, their reaction would be like \u2018Why didn\u2019t you change it despite receiving feedback?\u2019And since it would include something like \u2018there is no challenge spirit\u2019 it was meaningless.After all, no matter what we did, the process would be edited and evaluated according to the results.That was something all the participants tacitly knew, so there was a sense of discipline and tension in the team.\u201cYes. We\u2019ll keep that in mind and challenge ourselves.\u201dAt the time when Ryu Chungwoo\u2019s answer seemed to end the situation, his voice snapped in.\u201cCan I say something?\u201dHe was the original singer with a microphone.\u201cOh, yes\u2026\u2026Go ahead.\u201dThe judges answered a little shyly to the original singer who suddenly intervened, and the original singer lifted the microphone with deep eyes.\u201cOn your stage\u2026\u2026I couldn\u2019t feel the power of the song \u3008Burning like the sun\u3009.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhat were you saying so out of the blue after the story was already over?The original singer continued to run his mouth over the subtle bewildered people.\u201cAren\u2019t songs supposed to inspire courage and passion in people\u2019s hearts? But you guys, just because you are handsome and good at dancing doesn\u2019t mean you can properly deliver that message.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dAh, yes\u2026\u2026\u201cWhen we were promoting, we tried to give off that feeling. You can\u2019t forget the courtesy of a song just because you are a bit famous now.\u201dWasn\u2019t it embarrassing to say that to audition participants who hadn\u2019t even debuted yet?He seemed to mistake the old-fashioned remarks of children for advice. I think his ego was also a little biG.However, it was a painful point to pay attention to his reaction otherwise it would be edited.We had to come up with an alternative arrangement, but also keep that nonsense in mind?It was annoying, but if we had refuted it, I could already see the image of a \u2018Poor unknown idol original songwriter\u2019 coming up, so everyone answered smoothly.\u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201dWell\u2026\u2026It\u2019s all about social life.***After all the other teams finished their midterm evaluation, we were about to start talking about the re-arrangement.The troller hesitated and spoke to Kim Raebin.\u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u2026\u201dCan I let him apologize in front of the camera?Well, we had already covered for the team, so it was his job to cover his mistakes.Kim Raebin remained silent for a while but soon nodded.\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s true that I was in charge of the arrangement.\u201dIn fact, it wouldn\u2019t be strange even if he answered \u2018No you said we should do that\u2019.Anyway, Ryu Chungwoo finished talking by tapping both of them on the back.\u201cGreat job, guys. Let\u2019s talk about the arrangement as soon as we\u2019re prepared.\u201dFor reference, \u2018prepared\u2019 here was the camera setting of the production team.\u201cYes!\u201dDuring the interlude, the participants briefly scattered with shouts.The midterm evaluation was close so our expressions didn\u2019t look too good, but there still seemed to be some hope, perhaps because it was settled at the end.\u2018But that hope is only useful if we can come up with an alternative.\u2019Just by glancing at the situation, no one was saying anything, it looks like they were expecting something to just come out.Which meant they were turning to happiness without having anything.\u2018The future isn\u2019t very bright.\u2019\u201cHey, Park Moondae-hyung.\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201dWhile sitting in the corner and thinking alone, Kim Raebin spoke to me.\u2018It\u2019s surprising.\u2019He hadn\u2019t talked much in the past three days.\u2026Come to think of it, I rarely talked to anyone for three days in the first place.It was so hard trying to practice that I couldn\u2019t afford to chat.Anyway, Kim Raebin knelt down next to me and spoke solemnly.\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201d\u201cNo. What?\u201dHe was probably thanking me for cutting off the troller earlier.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time someone else helped me in that situation\u2026\u2026\u201dAs expected, I roughly understood the situation.Kim Raebin was also worried.If he can\u2019t get used to the team again and the team keeps on fighting, he will be marked unrecoverable by public opinion.\u2018No wonder he was being so low-key.\u2019Sure enough, he slowly started saying out his story.\u201cI was worried that I would be criticized for lack of teamwork following the first round, but thanks to Park Moondae-Hyung I was able to overcome the crisis. As expected, it was wise to recruit someone who has good teamwork first.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dLooks like he was trying to say that the reason he picked Park Moondae was because of \u2018teamwork\u2019.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostWhen I asked whether that was the case, he nodded.\u201cYes. I saw you treating your team members in a reasonable way. Of course, your singing skills were also great.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, yeah. Thank you.\u201dHe was very unique in the fact that he believed the contents of the broadcast despite he himself getting smashed by the contents of the said broadcast.To believe in Park Moondae\u2019s teamwork ability even though he was edited as unsocial in the beginning\u2026It was really amazing. I would have understood better if he had chosen Keun Sejin.\u2018Ah, I think he didn\u2019t choose him since he and Ryu Chungwoo\u2019s leader position overlapped.\u2019I guess he had his own standards.Seeing me thinking, Kim Raebin spoke again.\u201cAh, Hyung. You can speak comfortably.\u201d\u201c\u2026Well, okay.\u201dWell, there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with talking to a high-ranking guy.After meekly answering, I realized that I had a question I wanted to ask him in the current situation.\u201cCome to think of it, do you have any arrangement in mind?\u201d\u201c\u2026Actually, it\u2019s a little difficult.\u201dKim Raebin\u2019s popular gangster-like impression softened and changed to a more depressed one.\u201cEven if we start arranging it again, it\u2019s a matter of where and how much we have to fix it.\u201dSo basically he didn\u2019t know how many touches he had to do in order to meet the deadline, because he already practiced everything.\u201cI don\u2019t think we should fix it too much\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t know what to do because there\u2019s no unity in the corrections we have right now.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dSo there were no particular ideas and he couldn\u2019t decide what to fix.It was the same as me.Kim Raebin started murmuring his worries as if he couldn\u2019t stop once he started.\u201cThe original artist\u2019s advice should also be reflected in the song, but in fact, I am not sure what it means to \u2018instate courage and passion\u2019.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yeah.\u201dThat\u2026\u2026really was true.It was hard to see it as advice.\u2018How can idols inspire courage and passion when they\u2019re not some sort of American superhero from the 1980s?\u2019\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dWait. Just now\u2026\u2026I think I realized something.While reviewing my previous thoughts, I realized that I had a strange idea.But the more I thought about it, the more the idea\u2026\u2026fitted perfectly with the situation.A concept idea that can be arranged so that we can digest it even if we used the original notes.We didn\u2019t have to change the choreography of the cheering squad concept that we already practiced, and we can even catch \u2018Courage\u2019 and \u2018Passion\u2019.Perhaps it was an amazing solution. But the problem is\u2026\u2026.\u2018It\u2019s too much.\u2019It was. The only problem wasn\u2019t the fact that it was excessive, but that it could also be childish. Then I couldn\u2019t just fix it. It was clear that even if only one person made a mistake on the stage, it would be ruined.Huh?\u201c\u2026\u2026No.\u201d\u201cMe, Hyung?\u201cWait a minute.\u201dI ignored Kim Raebin\u2019s question for now.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostInstead, I shouted to myself as I saw the team members slowly returning after the break time.\u2018Status Window.\u2019And quickly looked through the stats of the team members.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dI didn\u2019t know about the other stats, but all of their \u2018talent\u2019 stats were above B-.For reference, entering the B grade meant that they had a level of ability that could be used for the main position.Indeed, this was truly a team made up only of high-ranking people.\u2018This\u2026\u2026I think it\u2019ll work.\u2019Somehow, the judges didn\u2019t really care about the concept of the old cheering squad.\u201cRaebin-ah, it\u2019s about the arrangement.\u201d\u201cW-What?\u201dI spat out the idea I had to Kim Raebin who seemed a bit bewildered.\u201cYes\u2026\u2026?\u201dKim Raebin seemed more embarrassed at first. However, as I kept on explaining, he became calmer, and soon a flash came onto his eyes.The response was better than expected.\u201cWell, wait a minute.\u201dKim Raebin ran to the keyboard installed on one side of the practice room and began to tap something out.I thought back to Kim Raebin\u2019s status window that I saw earlier.[Characteristic: Maestro (A)]: What you need is just a small opportunityWhen inspired, creative speed 120%.Similar to Seon Ahyun, he had a golden spoon within his status window.\u201cThe ability to copy other people\u2019s characteristics\u2026\u2026\u2026Is there none? It happens a lot in web novels.\u2019I wanted to lament, but first, I had to do what I had to do. I quickly brought up the status window.And I invested the remaining points in \u2018Talent\u2019.With this, I also entered B-.\u2018Okay. I got the numbers right.\u2019\u201cMoondae, why did Raebin suddenly go to the keyboard?\u201dRyu Chungwoo, who came in couldn\u2019t talk to Kim Raebin who was busy with the keyboard, so instead spoke to Park MoondaeI shrugged my shoulders.\u201cI came up with a concept idea, and I guess he liked it.\u201d\u201cWhat idea?\u201dOnly read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u201cTransformation hero.\u201d\u201c\u2026?!\u201dBehind the confused Ryu Chungwoo, Cha Yujin whispered to the person next to him.\u201cWhat\u2019s transformation water in tongue*?\u201d(*= Yujin is foreign, so he understands the word for hero wrongWhat it is = \ud788\uc5b4\ub85c\ubb3c, what he says = \ud600\ub85c\ubb3c)There were five days left until the day of the contest.* * *And five days later, on the day of the contest.The front of the stage set building, where the second team match for the \u3008Idol Joint-Stock Company\u3009 would be held, was crowded.The number of audiences hadn\u2019t increased much. But thanks to the soaring popularity index and viewership ratings, the number of people just wandering around to try and hear the sound had increased.People had already started handing out slogans and photo cards despite it not even being the last broadcast, making it feel a bit unusual.\u2018Wow, it\u2019s no joke.\u2019A woman stood in the line to wait for her entry, trying to avoid the crowd with clumsy gestures.After being asked by a friend, both of them had applied to be part of the audience, however, she was the only one who managed to get in, so she finally canceled her class thinking \u2018Shouldn\u2019t I just go?\u2019.\u2018Because it\u2019s so famous these days.\u2019Of course, this choice was also greatly influenced by her friend who pleaded to her with tears and rice saying \u2018Please just tell me how Moondae does\u2019.Still, she had this one thought in her heart.\u2018Is it that good?\u2019She too had seen a picture of Park Moondae with his golden-brown hair on social media.It was quite attractive, but she didn\u2019t think it was handsome enough to be liked that much.After she finished her meal, she finally entered the building, thinking that she should keep an eye on him.When doing so, she had never imagined a future where she would be begging her friend for a picture of Park Moondae after the audience was over.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Oh\u2026\u2026Park Moondae?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dThe seat next to her holding a slogan that said \u3008Kim Raebin Debut\u3009 in one hand looked up and down, and soon turned her head away and started looking at her phone.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dSomehow she felt strangely bad.Feeling her mood souring and wasting time for no reason, the girl began watching the first stage in a grim mood.\u201cThe first performance\u2026\u2026\u2026It\u2019s \u3008Fingerprint\u3009 by \u2018RollingCouple\u2019!With MC\u2019s loud introduction, the stage of \u2018Rolling Couple,\u2019 a mixed idol who failed after two activities, was briefly screened on the screen.It was composed under the pretext of \u2018Considering the audience who aren\u2019t familiar with the song because it\u2019s a hidden masterpiece\u2019 and \u2018Respect for the original artist\u2019.However, in fact, it was intended to contrast the rustic stage of an old idol that did not appear and the stage of the current participants.\u201cAnd the participants who reinterpreted this performance are\u2026\u2026Ha Iljun, Ji Taewoo, Lee Sejin, Seon Ahyun, Choi Nahoon, Seok Heekang, and Choi Wongil.~ \u2018Gigantic\u2019 team! Please enter!\u201dThe stage screen of the original song turned off, and the profile pictures of the participants filled the screen one by one according to the MC\u2019s call.Then the screen gradually turned off, and the stage was illuminated.-The feel when you put your hands together~Keun Sejin\u2019s smile filled the screen.Da dan daAnd with the fast-beat electro-house accompaniment, a spectacular group dance unfolded on the stage.\u2018Wow\u2026\u2026\u2019Unlike watching it from a screen, the presence of the choreography felt more powerful on the spot because it was live.It was especially shocking for a girl who was watching an idol stage live for the first time.\u2018Should I have gone to a dance singer concert instead of a ballad singer?\u2019She inadvertently regretted it, and enjoyed watching the stage in front of her eyes.\u201cThank you!\u201dSo by the time she was applauding the participants leaving after the stage was over, she felt completely excited.\u2018This is kind of fun.\u2019It was boring to wait for the preparation in middle of the stages, but being able to watch the performances of celebrities while the broadcasting equipment had a completely different taste.What was disappointing was that the team\u2019s skills were uneven depending on the participants.\u201cThis team is a little\u2026\u2026\u2026That\u2019s right.\u201dThe second team was disappointing, and the third and fourth teams were quite fun.Since she had never done the so-called \u2018fangirling\u2019, she forgot about it, leaving only a lumpy feeling rather than a detailed appreciation of each stage.First of all, the first team did the best so far, and that was what remained in her head.\u2018Did they tell us to vote for our 2 favorite teams once we went out?\u2019Once she saved a spot for the first team, she continued watching the stages.The next teams also had their own concepts and were fun, but none of the teams had a better impression than the first team.\u2018Hmm, I\u2019m a little tired.\u2019In fact, the skills of the team in the second half were not inferior to the first half.It\u2019s just that when you keep watching songs you don\u2019t know one after another, the freshness starts disappearing and you start feeling bored instead.In addition, the participant her friend asked her to watch hadn\u2019t appeared yet.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u2018Isn\u2019t it the last team now?\u2019Resisting the urge to turn on her smartphone, she barely listened to the introduction of the next\u00a0 team.\u201cThis performance\u2026\u2026It\u2019s \u3008Burning like the sun\u3009 by the band \u2018Solar Island\u2019.And a video that looked like a music show from about 10 years ago appeared on the screen.\u2018Ah, this song.\u2019It was a cheering song she heard at the baseball stadium when she went with a friend who likes baseball.\u2018It was originally sung like this\u2026\u2026\u2019Somehow, it wasn\u2019t as exciting as it was at the baseball stadium.

Ryu Chungwoo, Lee Sejin, Kim Yujun, Park Moondae, Yoo Jiho, Kim Raebin, and Cha Yujin!\u201d\u2018They just said Park Moondae, right?\u2019She hurriedly stared back at the screen. On the screen, the profile pictures of the participants started appearing.\u2018Oh, I know everyone.\u2019It was the last team since there were many famous participants.She settled down in her seat as her anticipation started rising again. The cheers that were several times louder than before caught her ears.\u201c\u2019Oh my gosh, it\u2019s really popular.\u2019\u201cThe \u2018Hero\u2019 team! They\u2019re coming in now!\u201dBefore she even had the chance to think that the name was tacky, the stage became dark.It was a black stage where the screen light disappeared.The moment a ray of blue spotlight hit the stage.A participant was seen raising his index finger into the sky like a gun.A bright black jumpsuit with a racing suit-like pattern absorbed the intense blue lights.In that hand, a red finger suit flickered along the lights.And then a low-pitched voice came in.-Yah, yah\u2026\u2026Hero Time[HERO TIME!]At that moment, the same letters filled the screen.Squeaaaak!The intense bass began to tear the speaker with an explicit glitch sound.All the lights on the stage came back as if they were exploding. And the seven people began moving in unison.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dTheir stretched arms and legs hit the floor , bending their bodies and unfolding a knife-like elaborate group dance.They were all dressed in black jumpsuits with different patterns.Cha Yujin, located in the middle, started singing.\u2013My heart is burning upBrightly like the sun.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostA participant who got up took over and started singing.-It reaches high in the sky far awaySo that I can fly farther and catch youIn the accompaniment where the typical band sound should flow, there was a heavy and intense dubstep sound, leaving only a rocking feeling.WOB- WOB- WOB- WEEEB-!BRMMMM\u2013!And then the group danced again.Participants stretched out one hand and moved as if they were doing martial arts.She opened her mouth and looked at the stage. Moving more intensely in the part that caught her eye.The choreography consisted only of large and solid movements without any small movements.The composition which might seem monotonous and excessive, only became stronger thanks to the changing movement in the blink of an eye.-There\u2019s one thing that saves the worldFiery passionRyu Chungwoo, wearing a navy hairband, sang the pre-chorus.The moment when she thought there was a mixture of strange and wonderful choreography like shooting something, the chorus burst out.-Fly! I\u2019ll go all the way~Until the day I shine like the sun!The hair color of the participant who kicked his leg forward and stretched out a cool high note was shiny blonde.The bright yellow glossy choker matched it as if it was made of his own hair.While making that high note, the participant was smiling.\u2018Crazy.\u2019Was he Moondae? The woman covered her mouth out of reflex.\u2018Y-You\u2019re so bad at taking pictures\u2026\u2026!\u2019He looked nothing like the picture her friend showed her!Shouldn\u2019t you take pictures of someone who\u2019s that good and cute!!It held tremendous destructive power to beat the already formed low expectations.In addition, there was no business that won over taste.\u2018I had similar tastes to her\u2026!\u2019As she gained new enlightenment, the stage entered a new phase.Kim Raebin came into the spot where Park Moondae sat and stepped out.Goggles with purple lenses shook near his biceps.-Rising like a starShining like the sunOnly read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u2018Huh?\u2019A rap was inserted in the place where in the original song, the chorus with high notes continuedHowever, the remaining chorus melody did not disappear.Instead, it was treated as a synthesizer like a sampler, adding a bright sound to the hip dubstep accompaniment.When the rap was placed on top of it, the momentum of the previous high notes did not die. Rather, it felt more comfortable to listen to.In addition, since the lyrics of that part were old, the rap lyrics directly translated into English made the song sound more modern.-It\u2019s flying! At this moment~It\u2019s burning like the sun, Time!-Take your wingsand fly upLet\u2019s catch upto the moon!\u2018Wow\u2026\u2019Since the girl wasn\u2019t familiar with the original song, she only felt that \u2018this is much better\u2019 but still, she could hear that the arrangement was much better than other teams.And most of all, the stage was just awesome.By the time the last chorus came out, she was almost possessed and leaned her back towards the stage.\u2013Fly! Till the end~This time, Park Moondae and Kim Raebin sang the chorus as if they were exchanging at the end of the formation.The wave of choreography moved as if it were a single body.Under the blue-violet laser light, the black jumpsuits doubled the feeling of a Sci-Fi comic character.And the last chorus of the ultra-high note.\u2013I will save your world!\u2018Gasp.\u2019She swallowed the groan that was about to come out of her mouth.Park Moondae, who raised his head in the white pinpoint light, seemed to save the world right away.No, it was clear that he was saving himself\u2026!Cha Yujin jumped out of the stage with a back flip along the last dance break.The body that cut through the air landed on the floor like a sequence in an action movie.Tuck.It was a very symbolic superhero landing.Narrations such as glitch-mixed announcements flowed over the remaining accompaniment of the top line.\u2013Thank you for flying with Hero Air today\u2026The boys on the stage slowly turned back.And as they all raised one thumb together, the song ended.At that moment, the first thing she realised were the surroundings filled with tremendous noise.\u201cAaahhh!\u201d\u201cWoaaah!\u201dAll kinds of cheers and screams that she had unconsciously ignored while watching the stage rang in her ears.What was even more surprising was that she was also screaming.\u201cCrazy!! Crazy!!\u201dThe person next to her who talked to her earlier was screaming almost as if she was about to jump out of her seat.The slogan in her hand was already wrinkled and shaking recklessly, so she was unable to fulfill her original role.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostIn her head, images of Park Moondae smiling, Park Moondae pushing the high note all the way, and Park Moondae turning his back were playing endlessly.At the same time, in order not to miss a single cut of Park Moondae leaving in front of her eyes, she thought with her eyes wide open.\u2018Vote! I have to vote!\u2019And above all, she was convinced of one thing.\u20181st place no matter what!! Definitely 1st place!\u2019This team was the winner!***After the stage was over, the ranking announcement immediately began in front of the empty audience where the audience left.In front of the participants of each team lined up in a row, the MC announced the next ranking.\u201cThe 3rd place is\u2026\u2026the \u2018Hero\u2019 team that reinterpreted \u3008Burning like the sun\u3009!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201dAs soon as the MC\u2019s presentation was over, there were murmurs everywhere.I looked at the screen with cold eyes.\u2018I knew this would happen.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Among them, there was the \u2018team similar to their first team\u2019 gathered by Choi Wongil.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u201cThen shareholder-nims!\u00a0 \u3008Re-listed! Idol Joint-Stock Company\u3009\u00a0 We\u2019ll see you again at the ranking announcement ceremony with the announcement of the 1st place in the team match!\u201dFor some reason, after the MC\u2019s closing remarks, Choi Wongil glanced at this side with a proud look.\u201cWhat an idiot\u2026\u2026\u201dHe was always like this.Was it because he hadn\u2019t tasted the spice of editing?Anyway, this team was too out of mind to notice that. Ryu Chungwoo patted each of the team members who applauded in a depressed state on the shoulder.\u201cGreat job. We did our best and looked good. Let\u2019s not worry.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cRight, we did a great job!\u201dWell, just like Cha Yujin said, it was clear we did well on the stage.So if I get a sympathy vote for this, I wouldn\u2019t be offended.No one in this team was likely to be eliminated during the next ranking announcement anyway, which was the best result.The problem was the editing, but unless there was another edit where they only highlighted Ryu Chungwoo and blackened everyone else, then it was fine. Since the stage came out well.We all had our own fandoms so a lot of bad news would be wiped out in public opinion.Kim Raebin, who gained a bad image through the first team fight broadcast but settled in the road rankings through persistent public opinion fights from his fans was a great example of that.Oh, he was talking to me.\u201cHey\u2026\u2026Park Moondae-hyung.\u201d\u201cOh, why.\u201dKim Raebin bowed his head.\u201cI am really grateful to you in many ways. Can we exchange phone numbers?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dI gave him my number without hesitation.He was a participant who would cause me no harm if we got close to each other. Thanks to his characteristics of changing lyrics and composing, I was even able to eat raw.In addition, looking at his personality, unlike Keun Sejin who contacted me all the time, he seemed like the type to quickly do things with his phone when needed.Kim Raebin bowed his head again after receiving my number.\u201cI\u2019ll say hello from time to time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026That\u2019s nice.\u201dI didn\u2019t know if I was talking to an aspiring idol or a successor.\u2018Oh, come to think of it\u2026\u2019Could this be an opportunity to change the so-called \u2018tied group of participants\u2019?Since this team match ended successfully, there was a possibility that the fandom would reorganize itself on its own as long as a few eyewitnesses leaked relationships in time for the next episode airing.Those who were tied up with \u2018Park Moondae\u2019 had many risk factors from drugs to the final ranking in the future. In addition\u2026\u2018Wouldn\u2019t my survival rate be higher if I got tied up with someone who has a higher final rank?\u2019The possibility of my reputation with Cha Yujin getting less hostile if I get tied up with Kim Raebin couldn\u2019t be ignored.\u2018Great.\u2019To make such a calculation, reality hit me hard, but who cares about face when it comes to sudden death?\u201cThank you for your hard work~\u201d\u201cGood Job everyone!\u201dAs I was packing my things and getting ready to leave while occasionally shaking my head, someone touched my back from behind.\u201cH-hey.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dWhen I turned my head, I saw Seon Ahyun with a sad expression on his face.The guy who had been too busy the past week to even say hello suddenly came up to me with a sad face?\u2018Is there a bad rumor going around?\u2019Seon Ahyun looked around, confirmed that people were not looking, and soon opened his eyes wide and whispered.\u201cChoi, you know Choi Wongil.\u201d\u201c\u2026? Oh, what\u2019s wrong with Choi Wongil?\u201dWhy was he suddenly talking about Choi Wongil?\u2018Did he come here to curse because he said he would eat the part again?\u2019Surprisingly, the idea that I just threw was half right.\u201cH-H-H-He is so mean\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dSeon Ahyun was almost buffering.No, what kind of personality did one need to have to make this pushover so angry?\u201cWhy? Did something happen?\u201d\u201d\u201cUh, yes!!\u201dOnly read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostSeon Ahyun nodded vigorously, and began to carefully explain what happened during the last team match.\u201cA-At the beginning\u2026\u2026While asking for his part he said.\u201dOh, my prediction was completely right.\u201cH-He kept talking about you! Like s-sarcastically\u2026\u2026.\u201dTo summarize Choi Wongil\u2019s actions, it was roughly like this.\u2018I didn\u2019t get the camera footage in the first round, so It\u2019s right for me to get some this time. I also set up the team. Shouldn\u2019t you be thankful?\u2019\u2018You gave all your parts to Moondae-hyung before, but now that I became the main vocalist why aren\u2019t you giving it to me? It seems you are discriminating because of your friendship.\u2019It seems the latter even cried while talking in an interview with the production crew.\u2018He must have learned that the first punch wins in the last team match.\u2019It is said that when the team members who were stabbed in the back were struggling during the night, Keun Sejin gently soothed Choi Wongil and settled the situation.\u201cIt\u2019s a wise choice considering the broadcast.\u201d\u2019But thanks to that, the frustration of the team members who couldn\u2019t speak properly disappeared.Seon Ahyun\u2019s cautious attitude changed to a completely turbulent state by the end of his sentences.He seemed to be so angry that he started stuttering.\u201cY-You have to be careful\u2026! I-Im scared that he will make your story strange so\u2026\u2026I-I wanted to tell you.\u201dSeon Ahyun, whose cheeks turned red, was worried about Park Moondae while everything was happening, and eventually acted on his concerns.Maybe the main point he wanted to make was this.The situation is funny, but this is\u2026\u2026\u2026That\u2019s right.\u2018I\u2019m kind of grateful too.\u2019In this survival audition, where everyone was busy trying to deal with themselves, he was treating me like a real friend and not just a connection.I feel like an idiot who used to divide the group rankings with my children.\u2018This isn\u2019t a middle school class.\u2019\u2019My future knowledge was already being divided since my team got in trouble during the first team match, but I wonder if I was being paranoid.I smiled and answered.\u201cOh, okay. Thank you.\u201d\u201cN-no\u2026\u2026\u201dSeon Ahyun was startled, then hurriedly waved his hands and returned to his usual timid appearance.During that time, Keun Sejin, who appeared out of nowhere, put his arms around our shoulder.He really seemed to have a strange ability to join anywhere in the conversation.\u201cYeah~ friends. What are you doing?\u201d\u201d\u201cT-that\u2026\u2026I was telling him.\u201d\u201cWhat? Oh\u2026\u2026Him.\u201dKeun Sejin shrugged.Looks like Choi Wongil was labeled as a troll so much to the point that he was referred to by his pronoun instead of name.\u201cWe don\u2019t have to do it together next time. The stressed side loses. Look at this. It\u2019s a busy world to see good things.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dKeun Sejin naturally passed the topic, then he clicked on something on his phone screen and showed it to Seon Ahyun.It was an SNS post that posted photos of subway station billboards.Oh, the time for this had already come.Putting advertisements on public facilities was one of the most popular support for idol fans. I remember the pictures since I had also taken them many times.\u2018Of course, it was uploaded under a fan account name that I bought.\u2019Anyway, I thought Keun Sejin was trying to show his own billboard being seen, but that wasn\u2019t all.\u201cTa-da! It\u2019s the 3 of us\u201d.\u201cHmm?\u201dLooking at it again, it was certainly all of our billboards being near each other and facing each other.Below the picture, I saw the registered article.=========================[It\u2019s at Hongik University Station, it\u2019s the same age line from October 31! So cute \u3160\u3160 I put a post it on it!]=========================Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostKeun Sejin smiled and said.\u201cHey, isn\u2019t it amazing? How did they put up an ad like this? Did they discuss it beforehand?\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dNo.I\u2019m sure they fought for the seat.When I thought about the time and money they must have spent to try and catch a large billboard at a popular station, I couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit sorry for it.\u2018Well, Park Moondae\u2019s chances of survival\u2026\u2026Thank you for investing in it.\u2019I had a new concern. Even if I was able to debut and avoid sudden death, I would be able to avoid going to hell only when the contract period is filled with sincerity.When I was confused by the strange sense of debt, Keun Sejin got to the point.\u201cDo you want to go see this? The fans even put on messages, so isn\u2019t the right thing to go and see~\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dOn the contrary, can\u2019t we protect our own?However, Seon Ahyun blinked and shouted okay at once.\u201cO-Okay.\u201d\u201cGood, good. Moondae you are going too, right? When do you guys want to go?\u201dBeing tricked into going together like this felt familiar to back when we watched the third episode together.Still\u2026\u2026Anyway, as Keun Sejin said, I had to go see the billboard once. Even if people recognised me, it would be easier to deal with it together rather than alone.I took turns looking at the two for a moment, and just nodded.\u201cIf we are going, we\u2019d better go within this week.\u201d\u201cThe sooner, the better!\u201d\u201cG-Good!\u201dListening to the two excitedly setting a date, I went back to packing my bag.Well, I didn\u2019t feel bad.***And two days later.I took out the black cotton mask that I bought at the convenience store last time and put it on.The destination was Hongik University Station.I mostly stayed in my house whenever I wasn\u2019t filming, so it had been a while since I went out like this.[Seon Ahyun: Why don\u2019t we have lunch after seeing the billboard? I found some good looking restaurants, so if it\u2019s okay with you guys\u2026(See more)]A message came from Seon Ahyun.\u2018It\u2019s still long.\u2019While looking through Keun Sejin\u2019s reactions that contained too many emoticons, I went out and got on the bass.Because I was staying in a cheap room, there wasn\u2019t any subway station within a 20-minute-walk distance.\u201cLike this, I can move quietly from the bus stop near Hongik University Station.\u2019Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u2026However, thinking something like this was a mistake.\u201cGasp.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that Park Moondae?\u201d\u201cOh my god\u2026\u2026\u2026H-Hey there!\u201dBecause as soon as I got off the bus and crossed the crosswalk, this happened.I hadn\u2019t even reached the meeting point yet when people started gathering around.There were only a few people who recognized me right away, but a crowd was gathering due to the busy street.\u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cIs he a celebrity or an idol\u201d?\u2018I don\u2019t think I can do this.\u2019I thought for a moment, bowed down and ran.I wanted to respond more if possible, but the atmosphere was unusual. At this point, the ripple effect of the most popular audition program was amazing.It was a point in time where when you turn on the Hagiya Entertainment News, you would see at least one news related to \u3008Idol Joint-Stock Company\u3009 in the rankings. I was just relieved because I normally didn\u2019t go outside.\u2018Now that this happened, I just have to quickly look at the billboard and disappear.\u2019While quickly running down into the subway station, my smartphone vibrated, but I was going to check it once I was out of the crowd.And\u2026\u2026As soon as I arrived at the location where the three billboards were hung, I noticed the situation.Because the two people who had already arrived at the billboard were surrounded by smartphones.\u2018It must have been a call saying, \u2018I\u2019ve already arrived, but this is the case.\u2019\u2019These idiots came out without even wearing masks.In the meantime, people who recognized Park Moondae cheered.\u201cMoondae!\u201d\u201cMoondae is here too!\u201dIt was awkward, but I was thankful. That was true.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I turned on the camera of the smartphone that was handed to me.People reacted immediately.\u201cAh, pictures!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s get out of the way~\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s take a picture of the kids!\u201dSurprisingly, the passionate crowd began to voluntarily distance themselves from us and retreat.\u2026\u2026Maybe it was because I saw a lot of people risking their lives to get a picture, but I was a little worried.\u201cStraighten your shoulders.\u201d\u201cUh-huh!\u201d\u201cAhyun-ah, you are so handsome!\u201dThe last words were not spoken by me, but by someone who seemed to be a fan of Seon Ahyun.Seon Ahyun\u2019s face became red as if it was broken.\u201cN-N-No\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter stuttering several times, Seon Ahyun creaked out.Anyway, I took a picture by composing it mechanically, and the moment I put down the smartphone, Keun Sejin shouted next to me.\u201cMoondae! Me too, me too!\u201dI turned around as I held Seon Ahyun\u2019s smartphone and took a photo of Keun Sejin.Because he kept changing his pose, it was annoying to take pictures of Keun Sejin.But people were filming the scene with their smartphones.\u201cCute\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDo other poses too~\u201d\u2018\u2026\u2026In this case, wouldn\u2019t it be fine even if I didn\u2019t take a proof shot?\u2019I would just have to go and download something that shows up on the internet.\u201cMoondae, you too!\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dIt would be strange if I was the only one who didn\u2019t take pictures, so I moved in front of my billboard.When I saw the billboard fully exposed after all the people backed down, I felt a sense of intimidation due to its size.The photo used for Park Moondae\u2019s billboard was taken during the production presentation.Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t a picture with a cheek poke or a finger heart, but I was a bit embarrassed to see my face looking so big.\u2018\u2026\u2026Let\u2019s not make eye contact.\u2019As I turned my head, I saw the text written in the background.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost[Park Moondae][A blue chip appears like a comet!]At the bottom, it also said \u2018Please buy a lot\u2661\u2019.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThat phrase was very impactful\u2026\u2026I can\u2019t deny that.\u2018They must have worked hard.\u2019I silently took a proof photo. I had to show at least this much sincerity.And as soon as I took the picture and got away from the billboard, people started pouring in again.\u201cDid you come to see the advertisement?\u201d\u201cAh, what should I do\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDid you have a good shot?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m voting!\u201dSlowly, the number of people around us started increasing enough to interfere with traffic. It was definitely worse than when I got off the bus by myself. All 3 of us coming together was a disadvantage.If I do this wrong, would I be called a nuisance?I wanted to do something and leave, but it looks like it will be difficult.\u2018I should take advantage of all 3 of our strengths.\u2019I winked at the other two. Fortunately, they showed an expression that said they understood the signal.We bowed our heads.\u201cThank you!\u201d\u201cI will do my best!\u201dThen we ran straight to the nearest exit.When three tall men ran at once, the road naturally opened.\u201cWe are going inside~ Thank you!\u201dKeun Sejin turned around, waved his hand and shouted. As I followed closely, I heard several voices answering.\u201cHuh? Guys!\u201d\u201cGo home safely!\u201d\u201cFighting!!\u201dFortunately, no one felt that it was rude, and their voices were bright.It was my first time running while listening to so many cheers.I felt very\u2026\u2026It was odd.I caught a taxi straight from the exit that popped out.\u201cAh! It was really good!\u201dAs soon as the taxi departed, Keun Sejin said with a smirk.Seon Ahyun nodded his head, showing a very excited look.\u2018Was it that good?\u2019Of course, I felt a sense of debt because I couldn\u2019t properly thank them. But the fact that many people recognized me didn\u2019t make me particularly moody.Was it a matter of temperament? Or\u2026\u2026\u2018\u2026\u2026It could be an age issue.\u2019They\u2019re all 21 years old.While I was thinking to myself, Keun Sejin suddenly took out his smartphone and exclaimed \u2018Ah!\u2019And immediately my phone vibrated.[(Photo) (Photo)]It was a picture of me taken in front of Park Moondae\u2019s billboard.My face, which had been ruined from all the shaking, was floating on the billboard, which had all the colors flying out of the wrong exposure value.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThis bastard couldn\u2019t take any good pictures.\u201cHey, doesn\u2019t the shaking give a sense of realism?\u201dYes, the picture was so realistic that you couldn\u2019t recognise anything except for that sense of realism.When I looked at him without saying a word, Keun Sejin laughed and spoke to Seon Ahyun, pretending not to notice.\u201cHaha\u2026\u2026Right, Ahyun! Do you have my proof shot on your phone?\u201d\u201cYes! Come on, wait.\u201dSeon Ahyun turned on his smartphone, and posted the pictures in the group chat.These were photos of Keun Sejin and Seon Ahyun that I took.\u2018Why are you sending your picture?\u2019Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostPerhaps he was confused and uploaded it all at once.\u201cOh, the picture Moondae took\u2026\u2026\u201dKeun Sejin, who looked at the screen pretending to be happy, stopped talking as if he was speechless for a moment.And with a slightly bewildered face, this time he began exclaiming honestly.\u201cUh, ah\u2026\u2026\u2026You are really good at taking pictures.\u201dThat was only natural, I made a living from it for years.I glanced at the screen too.The horizontal composition was perfect, the body proportions weren\u2019t awkward, and there were four or five photos per person that captured their expressions and poses well.It seems my skills didn\u2019t get rusty.I was a little proud, Keun Sejin added with a shy tone.\u201c\u2026\u2026Um, next time I\u2019ll take better pictures too. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dThis also seemed sincere.A Keun Sejin without a sense of business, I was seeing all kinds of things today. I just shrugged.\u201cWell\u2026\u2026 A photo with a sense of realism is fine.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dKeun Sejin had a shocked expression for a moment, then he quickly smiled and changed the topic.\u201cRight? Oh, come to think of it,\u00a0 are all the restaurants Seon Ahyun recommended well known like this? That\u2019s too bad.\u201d\u201cI-It\u2019s okay. N-Next time we can come together\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Hmm.\u201dYeah. I was talking about that too.Going to the restaurants recommended by Seon Ahyun would be too much now.He had only chosen restaurants that were popular on social media, If we ate at such a place other people would broadcast it on their social media.In addition, it was possible that Seon Ahyun wasn\u2019t good at looking up stuff, so the cost-effectiveness was not good due to it being a place that smelt like viral marketing.After thinking for a while, I checked the navigation system while passing through the Ewha Womans University station.\u201cSir, could you please turn us to Yeonhui-dong?\u201d\u201cThat would work~\u201d\u201cYes, then\u2026\u2026\u201dI looked at the two in the back seat.\u201cThere is a quiet house I know, would you like to go there?\u201d\u201cWow~ Of course I will agree!\u201d\u201cT-That\u2019s fine!\u201dThat\u2019s fine. I asked the driver for permission and changed the navigation to the restaurant\u2019s location.And only after the meal was over, I realized that I had voluntarily done something I didn\u2019t need to do.Oh god. We were getting closer!***\u201cHmmmm\u201dThe woman who was looking at her phone\u2019s screen continued to sound out her worries with a pained voice.On her screen, it showed an option that left her in a swamp of anguish.[Idol Joint-Stock Company stock discount package! ~80%]Under the large banner, there were all kinds of services and stocks bundled with Tnet\u2019s group companies, the channel where \u3008IJC\u3009 was being aired.For example, if you buy Tnet\u2019s music site package here, you will also receive a 50% discount on 3-month streaming subscription and the right to purchase 20 stocks for \u3008IJC\u3009.In short, she could give 20 more votes to Moondae.The broadcasting station sold all the stocks with packages like this, except for the monthly pack, which gave you one more vote every day!The scary thing was that this package has a high discount rate, so it has a chance of creating a double effect where previous users buy those with a\u00a0 discount but end up falling into \u3008IJC\u3009.\u2018It\u2019s really horrendous\u2026\u2026\u2019The woman sighed as she scrolled through the page, and saw the message that just popped up.It was a message from her friend, who fed Park Moondae into her own mouth by applying to the audience[Yeonju: Crazy Crazy \u3160\u3160 Someone sighted Moondae! (Link)]\u2018Huh.\u2019She quickly clicked the link that led to a social media post.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost============================[Oh, I just went out to eat with my family and saw an IJC participant. They seem to be those kids who sang MallangDalkom? (Photo)]============================In the attached photo, Park Moondae, Seon Ahyun, and Keun Sejin were seen receiving a ttukbaegi* with samgyetang** at a table with sagging partitions.(Ttukbaegi is a pot used to serve korean dishes, Samgyetang is ginseng chicken food)A long response followed the photo.\u2013 Look at his eyes on the Samgyetang, they are about to pop out hahaha\u2013 After all, K-samgyetang is better than chicken feet. You know something.\u2514 Please stop discrimination against chicken.\u2013 I agree with the three of them being friendly.-Ah, they must have gone there to eat after seeing the billboard \u3160\u3160 I love these cute guys \u3160\u3160\u2018Billboard?\u2019The woman searched for \u2018Park Moondae billboard\u2019 just in case.And immediately, she saw an article from a few hours ago that thousands of people had shared.============================Moondae went to take a proof shot at his billboard \u3160\u3160 There were so many people so he couldn\u2019t stay for a long time, but he was so cute and kind, that my heart smashed into pieces. He had a handsome face even when wearing a mask (short video)============================When she played the attached video, there was Park Moondae, wearing jeans, a black hood, and a black baseball cap in front of his billboard.[You are handsome!][I will buy you lots of stocks Moondae-ya!][Um, thank you\u2026\u2026]Park Moondae responded with a bit of embarrassment to people\u2019s pouring words.And the video ended with him happily running with the other two participants and disappearing.\u2013 So cute\u2013 Doesn\u2019t Moondae seem more sociable than I thought-\u3160\u3160 As expected, Moon Puppy is not a brain teaser, he is an official one \u3160\u3160 What, Tibetan fox? Heresy!\u2013 The PD who edited with a glance, please die, our kid was just being calm.\u2013 Even if he wore a blonde hat it would match\u2018Cute\u2026\u2026! So cute!!\u2019As she stomped her feet, she suddenly realized that she was familiar with Park Moondae\u2019s billboard picture. It was the picture her friend showed her after she had taken it!She quickly wrote her a message.[Minso: Wow, isn\u2019t this yours? Congrats, Moondae saw it! (link)][Yeonju: I fainted after seeing that, but now I have come to my senses\u2026 I didn\u2019t do it, it was done by the fan union, but I\u2019m still so excited\u2026 so overwhelmed\u2026 ]When she asked, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you tell me about this first?\u2019, she replied, \u2018I couldn\u2019t type because my heart was shaking so much.\u2019The woman giggled and sent a congratulatory emoticon. And she thought.\u2018I want to do something too.\u2019Park Moondae did well, so she wanted to see lots of great performances.Eventually, she went back to her previous purchase page and purchased the music package.After happily buying Moondae\u2019s stock, she checked to see if there were any other details.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u2013 Please take down the picture. Stalking is a crime.\u2514 No, I just happened to see it by chance. What stalking;; Just an eyewitness account\u2514 Is an eyewitness account a man eating rice? Say something that makes sense with common sense.\u2514 Yeah I blocked them, good jobAfter this conversation, the reactions of the people who were on fire started awkwardly fading.Because hearing stuff about Park Moondae was hard they got excited out of reflex, but realized that it could be an invasion of privacy.The woman was also embarrassed and turned off the window. She had forgotten that Moondae hadn\u2019t even debuted yet.\u2018That\u2019s\u2026 Because he was so good\u2026 !\u2019As she recalled her experience of listening to him just before her mind went blank even when she thought about it again, she suddenly remembered something she had forgotten.\u201cUgh! \u3008IJC\u3009 live!\u201dYes. In the first place, she was using the waiting time to browse through the stock purchase page while waiting for Idol Joint-Stock Company to air.She hurriedly turned on the channel, and luckily was able to see the logo of the show that was just starting out.\u201cPhew\u2026\u2026\u201dIt took her a while to get rid of the relief in her heart, and suddenly the MC\u2019s meaningful face appeared on the air.\u201c\u2026?\u201d[Everyone, do you remember \u3008Idol Joint-Stock Company\u3009\u2019s promise?]As if speaking while sitting at the desk in the discussion room, the MC hit the desk seriously.[We promised you that everything will go your way. So even now, numerous votes are being held on our website, such as the number of final debuts, evaluation selection, and more.]For reference, there were people crying, saying \u2018I voted for a small final number of debut members in the beginning\u2019.[And today, we are going to fulfill that promise one more time. Everyone. Have there been any participants you don\u2019t want to see while watching?]\u2018What\u2026?\u2019As soon as the broadcast started, the production team threw a huge piece of shit in front of the viewers who were suddenly confused about what this was.[Then sell that participant\u2019s stock! With the newly introduced \u3008Selling Stocks\u3009, shareholders can reduce the stocks of the participants they do not want to see in the future!]\u201c\u2026?!?!\u201d[The \u2018stock purchase right\u2019 purchased by shareholders can also be used as a \u2018stock sale right\u2019 in the future.

Hahaha is the staff crazy?The internet became a mess.\u2013 They really are out of their minds, why would they make a hate vote for people with bad hearts\u2013 This is not spicy anymore, it\u2019s a hell of fire\u2013 Ah really, I don\u2019t think I will be able to watch the next ranking announcement due to pain, you bastards, what are you doing to these kids?\u2013 Aren\u2019t we supposed to boycott at this point?In the beginning, posts criticizing the production team and the staff covered the communities.It was a natural reaction, but after this criticism became a basic sentiment, and articles like these started appearing;-Summary of participants who will benefit from this negative vote and those who will lose.jpgIt was a participant evaluation.And once you dig deeper than that, you would start seeing hate for participants people are not pushing for.\u201cHmm.\u201dI skimmed through the article on the best bulletin board in 7 minutes.As I slowly scrolled down, I saw the name I was looking for.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost============================[Park Moondae\u2019s rank drop risk \u2605\u2605]: When it comes to talking about him, there are dog fights everyday about whether he is evil or good. There are kids who are biting to the level of sickly diseases. His numbers might drop quite a bit.============================\u2018Two stars is good.\u2019I honestly thought this would be the case. Because Park Moondae was an extreme character in the broadcast who people have no choice but to like or dislike.\u2018The PR live or the first team fight editing was well done, so I guess that made up for it.\u2019In addition, the participants of October 31, who appeared in the first team match, were all latecomers at this point. Meaning it was inevitable that we would have malicious fans from the existing strong participants.When I scrolled down, I noticed that everyone had a risk of falling except for Keun Sejin.\u2018Of course, I can\u2019t believe this one article alone.\u2019First of all, the mere fact that this article became popular without being ignored by people meant that it was somewhat similar to popular opinion.But of course, there were still dog fights in the comments.\u2013 You sure wrote a long post, pretending to be a master of IJC and dominating public opinion on the Internet, right? hahaha\u2013 I\u2019m already tired. I wish we could just stop doing stuff like this\u2026\u2013 Hahahaha this is so transparent, why try licking onto someone who is being so criticized? lol\u2013 Is this roughly correct? Admit reality hahaAnd among these comments, there were also people talking about the participants who were mentioned in the article.They were mainly enjoying chewing, biting, and tasting the participants who were likely to decline.\u2013 Hahahaha Lee sejin is going to shoot down~\u2013 What about Raebin? He will fall further\u2026 I think the fans should be strong!Of course, there were also quite a few who attempted to attract the public opinion by mentioning \u2018I don\u2019t know why you wrote this person as stable\u2019.\u2013 Ryu Chungwoo who was a member of the National team should be more than average, aren\u2019t many people selling his stocks because they are annoyed by how he is getting fans even during the broadcast\u2018They are already creating excuses.\u2019Of course, there were quite a few stories about Park Moondae.\u2013 I hope those who bring down Moondae choose one route. They say they can\u2019t trust his skills due to the editing, but then bring up the edited version of his personality.\u2514 Yeah, let\u2019s not believe those people who believe in the broadcast\u2019s editing and say his personality is bad~ That\u2019s all.\u2514 I\u2019m going crazy, listen to Moondae singing in the PR live without background sound, it\u2019s better than the broadcast. And why do you believe the edited version of the interview and pretend not to see the video of Moondae helping the other participants?\u2514 You guys are going back and forth between yourselves; Ugh, don\u2019t risk your life on idols, Ahjumma!\u2514 Reported, bye bye\u2018This\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u2019I was speechless to see how people were suffering from Park Moondae\u2019s stocks.Just because I was better at something didn\u2019t mean that I could change the direction of the broadcast.\u2018Actually\u2026 I already knew.\u2019The introduction of this negative vote was controversial, so I, as a public servant, knew about it.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostThere were around two or three cases where \u3008Re-listed! Idol Joint-Stock Company\u3009 was on a tightrope between crazy topics and Xnet, and this was the first case.Anyway, looking at the current trend, at first I didn\u2019t really care because I figured I wouldn\u2019t be eliminated even if my votes dropped. But now, when it actually happened\u2026\u2026 It bothered me.Those who support \u2018Park Moondae\u2019.\u2018I hope they don\u2019t get too stressed out.\u2019I hesitated, and then turned the window off.Actually, I was going to look at the reaction of the newly aired episode 6 rather than \u3008Selling Stocks\u3009, but because it got buried by these there wasn\u2019t that much.\u2018In the first place, I don\u2019t have a lot of footage in episode 6.\u2019The stage of the team I belonged to was assigned to the next episode.The team formation and song selection scenes were only partially shown, so there was no reaction at all.\u2013 Ugh gommeo, why are you on the same team as Rae1Bin \u3160\u3160 Kim Rae1bin, please stop doing charity work. Your last team was like a beggar too, There is nothing to see except for face. Ugh, how did you catch this\u2026\u2013 Moondae-ya, don\u2019t stick to Yujin, just die.Mostly, the only remaining reactions were the ones from malicious fans like these. No, I don\u2019t know if I could call this a fan.\u2018\u2026 If you look closely, they are also cursing Kim Raebin, right?\u2019It was a case I saw often even when I was selling data.I didn\u2019t know why they were cursing and claiming to be fans\u2026\u2026 The important thing was that there were more reactions of them saying they hated him being in the same team as Park Moondae than those who said it\u2019s good.Even viewers who enjoyed \u2018Park Moondae\u2019 said it\u2019s a pity that he couldn\u2019t be with the team members from the first team battle.\u201cHmm.\u201dI crossed my arms and smiled. I was wondering how the public opinion would change once episode 7 was aired.The stage was definitely good, and there was a limit to what they could touch with editing.\u2018Then, until then, let\u2019s organize the status window pop-ups and achievements\u2026\u2026\u2019Ding.As I was thinking, my phone rang.It was probably from the same-age group room. I inadvertently opened my smartphone.Whether it was copied and pasted, two messages arrived at almost the same time.[Kim Raebin: Hyung, how are you? I\u2019m participant Kim Raebin. The reason I\u2019m contacting you this way is because I have something to ask you.][Kim Raebin: Me and Cha Yujin are going to Gangnam Station tomorrow to check the advertisements posted by the fans, does hyung want to join us to see the advertisements\u2026 (see more)]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDid my advertisement appear at Gangnam Station too?When I searched it up I saw a SNS post mentioning it starting today. Amazingly, Kim Raebin was good at searching.But the timing was not good.\u2018The system of decreasing the votes of people was just introduced, there is no need to stand out.\u2019If there was a happy eyewitness account here for no reason, there would always be bullshit like \u2018Park Moondae seems confident?\u2019Besides, going with Kim Raebin and Cha Yujin? I could already imagine the curses in my head.\u2013 I guess he is scared of the negative votes, so he is pretending to be close to the popular participants.There was no reason to create this kind of trouble. Let\u2019s try to protect the people who support Park Moondae as much as possible.It would be better to wait until episode 7 aired.I typed a reply right away.[Park Moondae: It might be difficult because I have work. See you next time.][Kim Raebin: Yes\u2026 Then we will contact you again.]I\u2019ll see them at the shoot.With that assumption, I started stretching before starting to work out.\u2018Let\u2019s build stamina.\u2019Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostAt this time, I never dreamed that Kim Raebin would send me greetings every day until the next shooting.It wasn\u2019t just a greeting, it was an image file of colorful greetings like those made by the elderly.[Kim Raebin: (If you smile^^ blessings will come your way~ Let\u2019s make today good by having a pleasant morning~)]\u201c\u2026\u2026 ?\u201dMaybe it\u2019s because the field is arts and sports, but every young person I meet recently has a truly unique sensibility.***And finally, it was Friday night again.[Kim Raebin: (Happy Friday @->\u2014 With all my heart in these roses^^ Sharing happiness and health)]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHow come the old man\u2019s meme was getting upgraded. Now there was even a glitter effect.[Park Moondae: Yes, you too][Kim Raebin: Thank you.]Anyway, in order to have a \u2018happy and healthy\u2019 friday like Kim Raebin\u2019s image said, I should have missed episode 7 today.I drank beer and started watching episode 7.My part was more likely to come out towards the end of episode 7.Because the production team probably postponed the team with the highest average rank to the very end of the airtime.As expected, the other teams came out one after another. I wasn\u2019t that interested in it, but I had to check to see if anyone was hit, so I watched it carefully.\u2018There\u2019s nothing special.\u2019There were no particularly visibly friendly or hostile edits. It was just a storyline where people overcome after wandering due to ordinary part conflicts and lack of skills.Then, in the mid-late half, Choi Wongil\u2019s team came out.It was a team that had a lot of participants from his previous team from the first team match, including Seon Ahyun and Keun Sejin.The editing potential exploded here.[Choi Wongil: I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re only doing this to me\u2026\u2026][Ha Iljun: What\u2026\u2026 ?]Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostThey put in an interview of Choi Wongil and the bewildered team members.[Choi Wongil: (Looking at him) Isn\u2019t Moondae-hyung doing too much?]Choi Wongil was completely overthrown.\u201cWow\u2026\u2026\u201dThey were putting it in like this.This was where the production team exploded Choi Wongil\u2019s uncooperative attitude from the first round.To be honest, it bothered me quite a bit in the first round, but I didn\u2019t think it would explode like this after piling up.But it wasn\u2019t just me who built this karma stack.[Kwon Heeseung: \u2026Because I don\u2019t accept his words.]Gold 2 seems to have been a bit scornful since the 1st time. When there was no camera, he didn\u2019t speak properly .[Kwon Heeseung: Maybe it\u2019s because I am the youngest\u2026 and lowest (rank).]Of course, the crew who caught it with a fixed cam and sent it were also disgusting guys. Another participant spoke to bring up the ratings.[Keun Sejin: Now, now! Wongil-ah. I understand how you feel. Please have a seat here.]Just as I heard from Seon Ahyun, the conflict being broadcasted was stopped and settled by Kein Sejin.[Choi Wongil: It is true that I was a little emotional.]With that interview, the team continued to practice hard and ended with a good stage, but there was no one who covered their eyes and played around.The Internet pages were already covered with swear words.\u2013\u00a0 Is Choi Wongil\u2019s personality for real?\u2013 He is a bit emotional hahaha What he did was like an anger control disorder\u2514 But I feel like it\u2019s even worse because he seems to be only doing this to people who are easy\u2013 Did you see him ignoring Heeseung? I almost had PTSD because it reminded me of my hard times from school\u2026\u2013 Park Moondae needs to be reevaluated, he was a bodhisattva who willingly gave his part.\u2018Well, it\u2019s hard for Park Moondae to be mentioned.\u2019They change the personality to their own accords, and if there is anything suspicious, the swearing doubles for slander.Fortunately, this team\u2019s stage was okay, so the topic about Choi Wongil was slightly pushed back and appreciation for the stage took its place.When the story comes up again, it will probably focus only on criticizing Choi Wongil.He doesn\u2019t have a good mentality, he must have had a hard time.\u2019I clicked my tongue and turned off the comments.Now there were two teams left.

He is my 1st choice for a team member.]Shortly after, the scene of Kim Raebin quickly winning the mini-game and pointing out \u2018Park Moondae\u2019 was shown.And an interview with Park Moondae with a blank expression came out.[Park Moondae: \u2026\u2026?][Park Moondae: Thank you, but\u2026 (Why?)]Thanks to the BGM and additional captions, Park Moondae, who joined Kim Raebin and bowed his head, seemed very embarrassed.And another scene of Kim Raebin clenching his fists and expressing a small sense of victory was shown.It was like a YouTube skit.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThis wasn\u2019t the first time the production team created reactions like this, but it was the first time where they were able to accurately guess my heart.[Kim Raebin: Next is Cha Yujin][Kim Raebin: And Ryu Chungwoo]Without hesitation, Kim Raebin chose his teammates in his own logic, and the team members continued to be confused.It was a production with a cute taste in its own way.\u2018They must be trying to save Kim Raebin.\u2019During the first round, they edited him in a way that openly ridiculed him.However, the atmosphere did not last long.Once the red caption \u2018However\u2019 appeared on the screen, a breathtaking atmosphere full of only white noise was broadcasted.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost[Midterm evaluation a few days later][Youngrin: Who rearranged the song?]Several team members looked back at Kim Raebin and Kim Raebin dropped his head.A large caption popped up again.[What happened?]And\u2026An intermediate advertisement.\u201c\u2026Hmm.\u201dI poured the remaining beer down my throat.They were trying to pull the ratings\u2026 Now I was amazed. Truly Amazing, producers of \u3008IJC\u3009.When I checked the internet during the break, there were all kinds of speculations roaming around.The majority opinion was, \u2018Kim Raebin might have failed a team match again\u2019.\u2013 Since the moment I saw him choose Park Moondae, I have been thinking that maybe he doesn\u2019t have an eye for people\u201cNo\u2026\u2026\u201dPark Moondae was being mentioned first.The beer made me more relaxed, so I was more angry than usual.I turned off the screen and turned on Tnet again. The ad was just ending.As expected, after the song was decided, the scene of discussion was shown on the screen.[Ryu Chungwoo: Shall we hear Sejin\u2019s opinion first?]In general, it was an edit that highlighted Ryu Chungwoo, who took good care of his team members with less social skills.In particular, him calmly responding to Lee Sejin\u2019s nervous reactions were shown on the screen as it was\u201cLee Sejin opened a path.\u201dWas this a case of Ryu Chungwoo eating everything again?There were a few scenes that charmingly highlighted Cha Yujin as a choreography genius, and a few scenes of Kim Raebin spent time arranging the song, but the victory still belonged to Ryu Chungwoo\u2019s decision.It was during the midterm evaluation that the situation changed.[You touched a lot of the original song, but it feels worse than the original song.]The review was edited more seriously than the original lukewarm atmosphere.It was an effect that was inserted in the middle of the review due to the sudden belated remarks of the original composer.[On your stage\u2026\u2026I couldn\u2019t feel the power of the song \u3008Burning like the sun\u3009.]I didn\u2019t know that this bullshit would appear on the broadcast like a village murder.Anyway, in a serious atmosphere, a team member pointed to Kim Raebin as the person involved in the arrangement.[(Right away) Raebin arranged it.]It was broadcasted because it explicitly emphasized that the team members made fun of Kim Raebin.It was a spine-wrenching edit.\u2018I\u2019m damned\u2026\u2026\u2019I had put on a show just to avoid this, would we be able to go out together?At that moment, the screen suddenly began to zoom in on \u2018Park Moondae\u2019.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u2018No way.\u2019Park Moondae on the screen had a thoughtful expression, and suddenly a flashback cut was put in.[I think it\u2019d be better to lower the key first.][How about adding some rap?][We have to arrange it so it fits the cheering squad concept.][\u2026Yes]It was a scene where some team members told Kim Raebin to add elements of arrangement that didn\u2019t suit them.Just as Park Moondae observed it carefully, his gaze was directed.And the screen of the midterm evaluation came back again.Park Moondae casually opened his mouth.[Yes. Since Raebin could create an arrangement, we discussed it with the composer, and we all agreed on the direction of the arrangement\u00a0 by sharing our own opinions.]They zoomed in on Kim Raebin\u2019s surprised expression.And Park Moondae\u2019s interview went in.[Q: Why did you defend Raebin?][Park Moondae: I was just telling the truth.]This\u2026 was a cut from an interview about arrangement that was done during the first team match.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u201c\u2026Huh.\u201d\u2018I was talking calmly on purpose to try and naturally change the subject.\u2019After going through the magic of editing, Park Moondae, who doesn\u2019t care about others, appeared on the broadcast as if he had just told the truth.\u2018No matter how much I think about it, it\u2019s absurd.\u2019Regardless of me being so nervous or not, the broadcast continued.[Sincere message][Kim Yujun: I\u2019m sorry\u2026.]After the team member apologized to Kim Raebin, the atmosphere quickly changed into something hopeful and warm, and the focus was on Kim Raebin\u2019s touching interview.[Kim Raebin: I think I was able to gather the team members well]Unexpectedly, Kim Raebin\u2019s face that smiled slightly as he said that, didn\u2019t look that bad.And the new arrangement was\u2026 Oddly enough, Kim Raebin and Park Moondae suddenly appeared as if they were having fun with each other during a small chat.[Ryu Chungwoo: I saw the two talking during break time][Ryu Chungwoo: But when I went back\u2026Raebin was already on the keyboard, and Moondae was excited saying we would (beep-)]The process of discussing the arrangement, where Ryu Chungwoo\u2019s interview was narrated and distributed, really looked like that, so it was even more ridiculous.[Ryu Chungwoo: Are geniuses like that? Haha]After that, short cuts kept on coming as if Ryu Chungwoo adored the two non-social geniuses and the team had good fusion, and the preparation for the stage ended.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI really didn\u2019t expect it to be solved this way.Anyway, I wasn\u2019t shown as a bad person, so I would have to settle for this much.In addition, I originally thought that the stage was the best part of it, but I was very satisfied with how the production crew openly cared about it and edited it.The ending was good, too.[3rd place?][A situation nobody expected]Because our team getting third place was put in middle of a advertisement and highlighted as if it was very strange and shocking.You can say that they had pulled everything they could pull.It was a clean gain.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dI immediately straightened my bedding. Once the tension eased, fatigue started setting in.\u2018I can monitor the internet tomorrow.\u2019Since I chose not to immediately look at the reaction this time, it was around lunch time the next day that I noticed the aftermath of my appearance during episode 7 was greater than expected.***\u2013 I decided to embrace Park Moondae. Compared to the groundless ones from the first team, he is a fairy.\u2013 Looking at Moondae again, he has a good-looking face. Looks like you and Raebin are doing fine. Keep working together as a team.\u2013 Rabbits and puppies are a fantastic combination, but the fact that they are medieval rabbits and mixed bread countryside dog is a icing on the cake \u3160\u3160\u2013 Ohoh, did you ever imagine a day where this combination would do bad? (Shrug)\u2013 How unexpected, I thought they would fight, but they got close instead;;\u201c\u2026\u2026Oh.\u201dSurprisingly, as soon as episode 7 aired, Park Moondae\u2019s public opinion had a huge change among Kim Raebin\u2019s fans.Most of them were normal fan accounts that did not slander other participants, but some of them were giggling as they called \u2018Park Moondae\u2019 an anonymity until yesterday.The change of attitude was amazing.Park Moondae\u2019s fan accounts seemed to feel relieved by relieving their concerns about the negative voting, but there were also few angry people.\u2013 Whenever you guys curse like this, you wipe your mouth at any time, it really\u2026 It makes me speechless. In the meantime, I hate myself for feeling relieved \u3160\u3160\u2013 I sigh thinking that I could be a fan of both if they debuted\u2026 I\u2019ll just look at Moondae once and go\u2026\u2013 Moondae showed a great attitude, came up with great ideas, and performed well on stage, so why should I pay attention to something else? lol\u2018I hope they don\u2019t get too stressed out.\u2019People should have fun while spending money, but these kids seemed to not be able to do that, so I wasn\u2019t very happy.Even if we debut as a professional and become a team, all the participants currently auditioning were competing, so it may be inevitable.Still, most of them seemed to be happy that the stage was well selected.Immediately after the main broadcast, from midnight to this morning and lunch, episode 7 was organized on the broadcast schedule, so I could see the inflow effect.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostThe stage video immediately entered the real-time popularity ranking on YouTube.\u2013 How can they pull off such a crazy concept so well;;;\u2013 They\u2019re heroes who came to ruin my scores, but I love them\u2013 How could you change the cheering song for the baseball stadium into a hero theme song? Not only the stage, but also the idea and arrangement ability are all extraordinary.\u2013 Aaaaah, the kids must have matched the colors. They are wearing items in each color! My heart beats for\u00a0 these details \u3160\u3160\u2013 This performance is third? Aren\u2019t you guys embarrassed to keep them in check*? Lol lol(* = referring to the people who used their second votes for other teams just to make sure they favorites win like Moondae mentioned)\u2013 Summary of the appearances. 0:06 Cha Yujin (Red), 0:16 Min Jeonghoon (Green), 0:24 Ryu Chungwoo (Blue) \u2026 [See more]The individual fancams released at dawn were also increasing in number of views at a terrifying rate.Even taking into account that the show was bigger compared to the first team match, the number of views on \u2018Park Moondae\u2019s fancam was increasing rapidly for a main vocal.The comments were also more favorable than the first round, and the ratio of \u2018dislike\u2019 got lower.\u2013 I can\u2019t deny that I\u2019m a genius.\u2013 Moondae-ya, thanks for doing blonde hair. Thanks to you, Unni worked hard and put up her resignation letter. I\u2019ll buy you lots of stocks \u3160\u3160 Let\u2019s debut and do silver and pink hair \u3160\u3160\u2013 I can\u2019t believe he came up with a hero concept after a horror movie. He\u2019s amazing! I support him a lot. I hope he can debut! Haha\u2013 How do you get more handsome and talented everytime I see you? What will happen if I end up ascending once you debut? \u3160\u3160I was embarrassed but also proud.Although this was something I had to do, I couldn\u2019t deny that I felt a sense of accomplishment.As I thought so, the final best comment caught my eye.\u2013 The main vocalist who is young, has cute appearance, and can even dance well is like a left-handed fireballer. I need to catch him even from hell, but thank you so much for walking into the stone plate with your own feet. Moondae-ya, you can\u2019t leave anymore ^^\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHonestly, it was a little scary.\u2018I won\u2019t suffer from a condition like \u2018can\u2019t retire\u2019 once I debut right?\u2019I quickly shook off the ominous delusions that had no benefit and cleared my mind.Anyway, at this rate, there seemed to be nothing to worry about during the next ranking announcement.\u2018Are there only 2 levels left now?\u2019After two more team matches in the future, the program would come to an end.I felt strange at the thought that we had already entered the mid-to-late stages of the show.I thought it would be cool when the day where I could get rid of this trashy condition came, but it wasn\u2019t necessarily like that.Maybe it\u2019s because the results were much better than I expected.The taste of such success was quite stimulating because I had been stuck in the corner of my room as a test-taker for the past few years and had not felt any sense of accomplishment.\u2018Of course, I am also tired because I was sucked in.\u2019Avoiding sudden death\u2026 If I looked back at it few years later I might think that it was a meaningful experience.Of course, that was a story for when I wasn\u2019t falling behind, so let\u2019s just think about survival first.Diing.The moment I made a resolution, a message came in.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost[Keun Sejin: MoondaeMoondae, are you doing well?

You have to go in!\u201d\u201cW-What?\u201dThe participant who started off mechanically went to the end and almost did a contest to determine the winner,After about 12 songs, the winner came out.\u201cAh, thank you~\u201dIt was Keun Sejin.\u201cNo one asked, but I\u2019ll tell you how I feel.

Even the staff covered their mouths and smiled, but there was no angle to show a serious side towards Keun Sejin, who winked towards this side.\u2018How long will this chicken feet image last?\u2019I had a feeling that if it continued being mentioned like this, it would follow me until I retire.Anyway, the atmosphere became even more relaxed after Keun Sejin let out a big laugh.\u201cGive me the next one, please!\u201d\u201cThis is amusing, really.\u201dAfter four or five more matches like this, most of the participants became sincere about the talent show.And there were still some expensive home appliances remaining as a prize.And the sixth talent show appeared on the screen.[Talent Show: Random Karaoke][Whoever sings verse 1 is the winner!]\u201cThis is an event for me.\u201d\u201cWow, I really want to go out, but didn\u2019t I already win? What to do?\u201dI ignored Keun Sejin, and after hesitating for a bit I stepped forward.\u201cOh~~ Moondae are you confident?\u201dActually, I wasn\u2019t that confident. I didn\u2019t even want to do it that much.I just wanted to defend against the possibility of showing a passive appearance after having my rank rise, looking arrogant.\u2026If possible, it would be better to win and take the dryer.There were 7 products left, so chances of getting it was 14%, which was a good enough chance to have hope.Along with the 4 participants who were facing each other I waited for the countdown to end. The production crew quietly left the microphone on the floor.[Start!]As soon as the screen changed, the intro immediately started.Boom Clap Boom Clap Boom Shake Boom Clap~The addictive boom clap melody resounded in the auditorium.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dThe faces of the participants who were expecting KPOP turned blank.Yes. What came out was a K-trot karaoke accompaniment.\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d\u201cWait, wait.\u201dThe participants listened intently to the intro with confused expressions, but they couldn\u2019t figure out what the song was from just listening to the intro.Because the number of trot songs that started with an exciting pounding rhythm wasn\u2019t just one or two.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI was conflicted, but I eventually slipped forward and picked up the microphone.\u201c\u2026!!\u201d\u201cMoondae trot\u2026 ?\u201dGold 1\u2019s murmur was heard all the way up here.\u201cCould it be that he just caught it?\u201d\u201cHyung, do you really know that song?\u201dI chose not to answer the numerous shouts, and just started singing in time for the ending of the intro.\u201cIt\u2019s raining on Namdaemun street in Seoul~ But there\u2019s no one looking for me~\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!!\u201dThe participants were whispering.\u201cOh my god.\u201d\u201cHow did he know?\u201dHow did I know, I knew it because I had seen it a lot.When I went to the event shoots a few times, I often saw the stage of a trot singer.In particular, it often took place right before an idol stage, so I listened to quite a few songs that were popular among the elderly enough to show up in the second half of the event.I had also heard this song on the stage of the original singer\u2026 Hmm, the times when I had heard it a lot, it was about two times a day.Later, the singer recognized me and winked at the camera.Out of conscience, I remembered uploading the fancams on youtube. Well, it was helpful.\u201cAh~ The you that I was looking for~ The you that I wanted~\u201dIt was a pretty famous song, so as soon as we entered the chorus, the participants started singing along. I wonder if that singer felt like this during the event.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u201cI left Seoul~\u201d\u201cOh oh.\u201dAfter I finished singing the first verse following the mood, the participants applauded with exclamations.Rather than cheering\u2026\u2026 It felt like they were reacting to something strange they saw at a magic show.It was a bit embarrassing, but in the end it was successful, so I decided to focus on the prize draw.I greeted the participants a few times, put down the mic and grabbed the lottery box.When I opened the note I pulled, I saw a frozen silver body in the picture.\u2018Maybe it\u2019s the dryer\u2026!\u2019[Kimchi Refrigerator]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dCrazy.\u201cHey!

I looked at the note with a bewildered feeling, and suddenly realized the reality.\u2018\u2026 Don\u2019t they give out goods after tax?\u2019I had no money to pay in taxes.As soon as I received the product, I would have to sell it as a second-hand transaction, pay the tax, and fill up my bankbook.Anyway, it felt good to catch something expensive.Keun Sejin, who was celebrating next to me, softly whispered.\u201cMoondae, let\u2019s exchange our products\u2026\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dJust eat your chicken feet.***After the final chicken fight, the talent show ended splendidly, and the shooting for the team match began with a relaxed atmosphere.Although it might have been difficult because of the changed shooting schedule, the MC surprisingly announced a new team match.\u201cIt\u2019s already the 3rd team match for \u3008Re-listed! Idol Joint-Stock company\u3009 . Participants, I hope you will praise yourself for being able to hold on until there are only 33 people left even though we started with 77.\u201dAlthough it wasn\u2019t the MC\u2019s usual lively voice, Youngrin handled the situation calmly and seriously.Above all, it seemed that the participants seemed to take what she said more meaningfully, because they were words from an idol who had already become successful.Right next to me, Gold 2 smiled and patted his own head. It was a spectacle.\u201cThis 3rd team match has a rather unique way of forming a team.\u201dLet\u2019s see, up until now, the teams were formed by what the participants decided on, so it was time for other factors to intervene.But the element was a bit peculiar.\u201cIt is a big data algorithm.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cBig data?\u201dWhen the concept of watching suddenly appeared on the IT news, the participants looked at Youngrin with bewildered expressions.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostYoungrin smiled and continued her words.\u201c\u3008 Idol Joint-Stock company\u3009 analyzed the patterns in which shareholders bought your stocks. So, the teams were formed based on the stocks bought by a large number of shareholders around the same time.\u201dIn other words, it meant that the viewers who spent money tied us together to form a team of participants they liked.\u201cFor a more detailed analysis, check the data on\u3008Re-listed!

Sure enough, even Seon Ahyun\u2019s slightly waved at me with shining eyes.Keun Sejin took it a step forward and came to hit me in the back and said.\u201cHey, please take good care of me.\u201d\u201cHuh. okay.\u201dAt my blunt response, Keun Sejin laughed. He might have thought I talked like that to tease him.\u201cLooks like you\u2019re ready. Then come out in order and pick up a box.\u201dBehind Youngrin there was a table set with black boxes on it.\u201cThere are badges inside the box. After receiving the box, go down the hallway and enter the room marked with the badge.\u201dThen, Youngrin called out the participants in alphabetical order and started handing out the boxes to them.Naturally, \u2018Park Moondae\u2019 was mentioned quite early.\u201cParticipant Park Moondae. Please take your box.\u201dI went out of the door while holding a box that had the name \u2018Park Moondae\u2019 on itOf course, in the hallway there was a staff member waiting with a camera. When I opened the box in front of them, a badge shaped like a rabbit\u2019s head appeared.\u201c\u2026Rabbit?\u201dI muttered a bit in confusion, but then quickly closed my mouth after being conscious of the camera.Then I looked up and checked the rooms lined up in the hallway. Each room had a nameplate.\u3008Chick\u3009\u3008Cat\u3009\u3008Deer\u3009\u3008Dog\u3009\u3008Bear\u3009And I saw the name I was looking for in the last room.\u3008Rabbit\u3009\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOverall\u2026 The naming sense that felt like a kindergarten classroom stood out.\u2018Well, we are just dividing into teams.\u2019I assumed it was meant to be humorous and immediately opened the door.I wasn\u2019t too nervous because all the participants who could be on the same team would be called later than me.\u2018I am probably the first.\u2019Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostBut as soon as I opened the door and walked in, the person sitting on the floor suddenly raised his head and looked at me.\u201c\u2026?\u201dIt was Kim Raebin.Why are you here\u2026?\u201cPark Moondae hyung.\u201dKim Raebin jumped to his feet with a happy face, then slowly moved his seat and stepped aside.He seemed to be trying to be considerate by letting me sit in the middle.But, there were only two of us\u2026?\u201cI never thought we would be on the same team again. It\u2019s really nice to see you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah. I look forward to your kind cooperation.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe conversation went on calmly, but I was creating complex guesses in my head.\u2018Why is Kim Raebin on the same team as me?\u2019The only time I talked with Kim Raebin was during the 7th episode that had just aired recently.So, did that mean that the percentage of votes after episode 7 was large enough to affect this \u2018big data algorithm\u2019?\u2018Of course, it would be possible if they only looked at the stocks bought during the previous ranking announcement, but\u2026\u2026 \u2019As I weighed the possibilities, I realized a simple fact.\u2018Aha.\u2019It\u2019s because there were few participants involved with Kim Raebin.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostI didn\u2019t know how much weight that had, but it was quite convincing that the reason we ended up on the same team was because the only participants close to Kim Raebin were me and Cha Yujin.\u2018Well, it\u2019s nice to have a high-ranking participant.\u2019I neatly organized my thoughts and sat down on the room\u2019s floor. Kim Raebin immediately spoke again.\u201cHyung, the song you just sang at the talent show, it\u2019s my favorite song too.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201dI wonder if it was really necessary to know whether Kim Raebin liked trot or not, but we roughly spent time chatting until the next team member came in.And after quite some time, the next team member opened the door and came inside.My school finally started winter break, I\u2019ll try to get bunch of updates!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 37": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Debut or DieCH 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe participant who entered the \u3008Rabbit\u3009 room after me was Seon Ahyun.\u201c\u2026Ah!\u201dSeon Ahyun quietly looked into the room with a nervous expression, and as soon as our eyes met, his expression brightened and he quickly ran inside.And he smiled broadly.\u201cI-It\u2019s good that we are on the same team t-this time.\u201d\u201cOh, I look forward to it.\u201d\u201cUh-huh, I-I\u2019ll work hard\u2026\u2026\u201dThen, at that moment Seon Ahyun who had been excited and immediately opened his mouth, made eye contact with Kim Raebin, who was looking this way.\u201c\u2026!!\u201dSeon Ahyun got shocked and stiffened when he realized Kim Raebin\u2019s existence only at that point.\u2018Come to think of it, these two have no connection.\u2019Their grades were different, and they had also never met in a team fight.Seon Ahyun hurriedly came out and started looking between me and Kim Raebin, then swallowed his saliva and greeted Kim Raebin.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u201cI-I-I look forward to your kind cooperation\u2026\u2026\u201dHe was so serious.\u201cYes. I am the one who should be looking forward to your cooperation.\u201d\u201cO-Oh no, I am the one\u2026\u2026\u201dKim Raebin also bowed his head with a serious expression. Seeing that, Seon Ahyun also hurriedly bowed his head towards the floor.It was a strange scene that I had only seen happen in internet humor.\u2018The conversation will never continue if we leave these two alone.\u2019While watching the greeting battle between Kim Raebin and Seon Ahyun, which seemed to last forever, the fourth team member vigorously opened the door and entered the room.\u201cWho is the rabbit?!\u201dIt was Keun Sejin. I don\u2019t know why, but it seemed like he was completely immersed with the room concept as he waved the rabbit-shaped badge with one hand.Keun Sejin quickly confirmed Seon Ahyun and Kim Raebin. But when he looked at me he burst out laughing.Why again?\u201cWhat, why are you here?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dWhen I looked at him with a look that asked what nonsense he was saying, Keun Sejin continued slowly speaking.\u201cNo, there was a \u2018Dog room, so of course I thought you would be there. I thought we wouldn\u2019t be able to work together this time\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWere the Tibetan fox interviews not enough? I tried taking on a dog image because of the composition, but reality was a different issue, so I wanted to squeeze this one.Keun Sejin slowly approached the people and turned around.\u201cAnyway, isn\u2019t it good that we are doing it together? We got good teammates again this time! Let\u2019s try our best! Is there one left now?\u201dThere were a total of 6 rooms with nameplates. Considering that there were currently 30 participants active, It was quite likely that we would be assigned 5 per room.\u2018Then since we have 4 people so far, there is only one left.\u2019But I didn\u2019t know who would come.\u2018For now, the rankings and positions are set in place.\u2019The team members were evenly distributed without overlapping images, and both the rankings and the skills were good.Kim Raebin would arrange the song, and the leader role was likely to be chosen by Keun Sejin, so that was enough. The stage composition was also comfortable thanks to Seon Ahyun, an all-rounder, being there.In fact, it wouldn\u2019t matter if we had to do it with just us 4.\u2018As long as a troller doesn\u2019t come.\u2019I remembered a few other annoyances including Choi Wongil. As long as it wasn\u2019t them, it didn\u2019t matter who came.The problem was that until now, the team members had never been smoothly organized.I assessed the situation.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u2018From here\u2026 We can cross Lee Sejin.\u2019He was uncooperative, but not the type to bombard others for profit.Still, there was a possibility that his mentality went down because of this ranking ceremony, so if possible, it would be better to not team up.So, if it\u2019s hoping for the last team member\u2026 Well, going in alphabetical order, there was only one left, except for the ones that were already crossed out.\u2018Gold 1 is the most comfortable.\u2019When thinking of the participant with the highest possibility, Keun Sejin made a proposal with a smile.\u201cHow about hiding behind the door? It\u2019s the last one, so it would be nice to welcome them with all our heart and soul.\u201dIt was an obvious idea, but it was also a joke that would come out well on TV if the last team member\u2019s reaction was okay.The problem was that if Choi Wongil came in while we were doing this, the atmosphere would be weird, but the other three had already gone behind the door so I just gave up and followed.If I backed out here, I would be the one who looks weird in front of the camera.As the team members were whispering with one ear behind the door, Keun Sejin, who was attached to the wall, shouted softly.\u201cHere they come!\u201dThen he made a hush by raising his index finger and putting it to his lips. I was silent anyways, so I just stayed like that.Soon the door opened with the sound of footsteps.\u201cExcuse me\u2026 Eh?\u201d\u201cTa dah!\u201dAfter a while, a head popped out from behind the door.\u201cArghhh!!\u201dThe participant, who opened the door and looked inside, jumped into the sky and did funny body movements. It was more than I expected.\u2018Congratulations on the broadcast volume.\u2019The last team member rolled around with a strange scream had a familiar face.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. Hyung!\u201dGold 1, who I hadn\u2019t expected, joined.\u2018\u2026It\u2019s okay.\u2019For the first time, I gave a positive evaluation after seeing the team.***\u201cPlease take good care of our rabbit class~\u201d\u201cWow!!\u201dClap clap. The discussion began with a common topic without any sullenness.The atmosphere around was the most friendly in this team than any other team projects I had been in, even if I included college life.There was no abusive language and no one was doing anything else because of the camera.\u2018It\u2019s like a real kindergarten.\u2019Of course, not all the teams were experiencing a desirable outcome for the team project like the \u3008Rabbit Class\u3009.For example, two or three teams consisting only of lower ranks due to the concentration of the rankings looked like they had already given up halfway.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, let\u2019s do well\u2026 .\u201d\u201c\u2026so it became like this.\u201dHowever, unexpectedly, the Despaired reaction came from another team that consisted of high ranking trainees. Choi Wongil and Lee Sejin joined Ryu Chungwoo and Cha Yujin\u2019s team. In addition, the troller who grabbed Kim Raebin by the neck was also in that team.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostSome participants muttered.\u201cCan they be tied like that?\u201d\u201cThe combination is amazing.\u201dI could hear Ryu Chungwoo\u2019s stomach melting all the way from here.\u2018It\u2019s unfortunate, but it\u2019s better for me.\u2019It would be convenient if that side took all the bad editing to themselves.As I was drawing a brief conclusion, Keun Sejin was conducting a discussion.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s talk about the song first! Does anyone have a song they want to sing?\u201dA number of team members raised their hands with their eyes shining. Even Seon Ahyun quietly lifted his hand up.It was understandable. After all, the long awaited \u2018Free Song Selection Team Match\u2019 finally appeared for the first timeI remembered MC\u2019s announcement that I had just heard.\u2018You can choose all the details including songs, choreography, and concepts that suit your team and create a stage as you want! It will be called \u3008Self-Produced Stage\u3009!In other words, the production team would try to eat raw.\u2018Last season, I think they were able to pick something through a mini-game.\u2019This meant that the production team prepared about ten concepts in advance, including the costumes and stage equipment. It was a structure in which the participants could choose what they wanted from among them.But in this season, there was no such thing, they were telling us to make do on our own without it.Perhaps, while they were planning this season they couldn\u2019t plan ahead due to a lack of budget.One of the advantages of that was that there were very few budget restrictions now, probably thanks to the program gaining a lot of additional budget.\u2018So they must all be excited.\u2019I listened to the opinions of other team members one by one.The order of speaking went in a clockwise direction, and Seon Ahyun, who got the right to speak first, shouted quietly.\u201cH-How about \u3008I Like This Waiting\u3009\u2026 !\u201d\u3008I like this waiting\u3009 . Its characteristic was the choreography with high notes and musical compositions.The refreshing and sophisticated teen sensibility hit the target audience well.As of this point, it was a song by a 9-member male idol released five years ago, and it gave the group glory with their very first win.Looking back on the past activities, it was a song that Seon Ahyun would definitely like.\u201cOh, the first nominations are great songs.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. We are all such young people! Refreshing! We never showed a concept like that before.\u201dI also added a word.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cUh huh!!\u201dSeon Ahyun nodded with a bright smile. Even if it wasn\u2019t chosen, he had a face that looked like he would die just by getting a positive reaction.\u2018How the hell do you live with a face like that?\u2019I thought that it was really pathetically absurd.\u201cNext is Raebin!\u201d\u201cConsidering the composition of the members, I think VTIC sunbaenims \u2019s \u3008Hone\u3009 is the most effective choice.\u201dAs if he was prepared for it, he immediately started pouring out comments.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u201cSince we used a lot of oriental sound samples, the concept is characteristic and the range is appropriate. It\u2019s a song with a difficult choreography, so it\u2019s easy to show performance elements, and it\u2019s also easy to insert some dance breaks. I can also make a draft for the arrangement within a day!\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2018You must really want to do it.\u2019Perhaps I wasn\u2019t the only one who thought so, and the other team members responded slowly with bewildered expressions.Only then did Kim Raebin look around and hesitated, not knowing if we wanted to be a part of it.\u201cO-Of course\u2026 If you guys have any other suggestions, that would be fine too.\u201d\u201cOkioki, Raebin\u2019s song was good too, let\u2019s slowly listen to the other opinions~\u201dKeun Sejin just shrugged it off.\u2018But it would be better to listen to the opinion of the person who will arrange the song in detail.\u2019It seems Keun Sejin didn\u2019t plan on hearing the rest of Raebin\u2019s words, perhaps he also had a song he wanted to push.\u2018Shall I bring some?\u2019I opened my mouth.\u201cAmong what you said, which part do you like the most?\u201d\u201cYes? \u2026Ah, well, rather than liking a particular element, I took into account what was best for the whole task.\u201dIt meant that he focused on the overall stage perfection. I nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s a point to keep in mind.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I was surprised.\u201d\u201cRaebin has a plan for everything!\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201dAs the team members praised him, Kim Raebin bowed his head and muttered.After a brief atmosphere of warmly watching Kim Raebin, who was awkward, was created, Keun Sejin finally expressed his opinion.\u201cNow is the time.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cWe came all the way here, and the time has come for a sexy concept\u2026 !\u201d\u201cS-S-Sexy\u2026\u201d\u201cArgh!\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dA shuddering response followed. Keun Sejin laughed out loud.\u201cHahaha! Honestly, can you deny it? You can\u2019t, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was so cheeky to say it so openly and shamelessly like that, but\u2026\u2026\u2018\u2026It makes sense.\u2019Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostThere was no denying that it was a good idea.\u2018As long as we can properly pull it off, there is no concept stronger than this.\u2019The sexy concept has traditionally been a proven route to success if you can make it look great while maintaining a sophisticated level of sophistication.I folded my arms and asked Keun Sejin.\u201cWhat kind of song do you want to do?\u201d\u201cHuh? Moondae has a good eye. Actually, I don\u2019t really want to push one song in particular, but while comparing several songs\u2026 I want to discuss and decide on a song that will showcase the sexy concept the best, what do you think?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was all right.But the other two opinions were also good.I turned my head and looked at Gold 1, who had not yet spoken.Gold 1 looked white and burned.\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I was just trying to save some rabbits\u2026 But everybody\u2026 has a\u2026 very clear vision?\u201dThe other opinions looked so firm that he lost his combat power. It was understandable. I shrugged my shoulders.\u201cM-Moondae\u2026 W-What do you want to do?\u201d\u201cMe? I haven\u2019t decided anything in particular.\u201dAs soon as I answered Seon Ahyun\u2019s question, Keun Sejin\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cOh, then I\u2019d love to hear about Moondae\u2019s choice! Out of the options given so far, which do you like the best?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dKeun Sejin\u2019s words caught the rest of the team\u2019s attention.\u2026It was very burdensome. However, it was a situation I couldn\u2019t ignore.\u201cWhich do you like best?\u201dI was lost in thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So I hoped that the listener would also respond appropriately.But Cha Yujin put the chocolate bar in his mouth, and started crying even more.I was going to go crazy\u2026I didn\u2019t know if it\u2019s because everyone was sensitive because they\u2019re in the entertainment field, or if it\u2019s because survival was brutally hard, but I think I have seen a few too many crying people these days.\u201cEveryone is fighting\u2026\u2026 If I say no, it gets scary, sniff.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Well.\u201dCha Yujin looked completely discouraged. There was no trace of the bright person from a few days ago.I guess because his team was a mess since day 1?\u2018It\u2019s called <Dog Room> following after my name.\u2019Those guys, if it aired like this, I could see the future where I got ridiculed by being tied up with the room name.However, it was funny for \u2018Park Moondae\u2019 to give any kind of advice to Cha Yujin.No matter what I said, if I made one mistake, I would be bombarded with posts like \u2018am I the only one who feels something is wrong with Park Moondae?\u2019 because I belong to a different team.\u2018I\u2019ll have to send him back once he calms down.\u2019I just seriously said something different .\u201cDo you want more chocolate bars?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOnly read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostCha Yujin nodded his head. I took another handful of chocolate bars from my bag and handed them to him.\u2018\u2026I\u2019m glad I brought a lot.\u2019It\u2019s fortunate that I still had one more bag left. If it seemed like I would waste them, it would ruin everything.Like that, I spent a few minutes silently with Cha Yujin, who was munching on a chocolate bar against the background sound of water running in the bathroom.Not long after, Cha Yujin got up from his seat with his head down, holding the chocolate bar in both hands.\u201cThank you.\u201dLooked like he managed to calm down a bit and was ready to go back. I couldn\u2019t thank him enough for not telling me details of what happened.I didn\u2019t really want to, but let\u2019s just say something appropriate for the situation.\u201cIs it okay to not see Raebin?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026 It will be fine.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dCha Yujin looked a little braver than earlier, he had stopped crying and was slowly coming back to his senses.\u2018Is it a sugar rush?\u2019I was doubting whether or not he would start crying again once he ran out of sugar, but the priority was to send this bomb away.I watched Cha Yujin walking down the hallway for a bit, then closed the door.And breathed a sigh of relief.\u2018I\u2019m busy, but there are landmines everywhere.\u2019Now that we were in the second half, I had to be more careful not to get caught in the broadcast. Because if things started going down, I might not have the chance to recover.The problem was that I couldn\u2019t control everything just by being careful.\u2018Just, let\u2019s not stand out\u2026 If I can keep going forward like this, I can reach the finals.\u2019I sighed one more time and stretched out before going to bed. And fell asleep instantly.It was the next morning that I realized I slept without washing up.***While the participants were struggling with preparing the stage and suffering from planning and creating everything from the ground.The 8th episode of \u3008Relisted! Idol Joint-Stock Company\u3009 aired outside the filming site-Omg\u2013\u00a0What\u2019s wrong?\u2013 Awesome haha\u2013 ??As we went up to the top, unexpected rankings were rampant, and the real-time viewers were shocked but the most intense reaction was the reward for winning the last team match.[Negative Votes will not be counted]Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostIt made people outraged that they could avoid some of the brutal voting method that reflected \u2018how much they are hated\u2019.\u2013 Haha, needless to say, the large number is awesome\u2013 I am an idiot who spent money on this kind of program.-The winning team has a contestant pushed by the production team hahaha you are going to let him avoid it like thisThe irony was that the anger was directed at the participants rather than the production team who created the system and planned the winners prize.As the one who benefited the most from this reward, Choi Wongil, who was originally supposed to be eliminated, was naturally being criticized by the public powder.But the viewer\u2019s anger did not end there.Among the participants from the winning team, the public opinion of the participants who faced a rise in their ranks dropped significantly\u2013 Huh Seon Ahyun pushed Cha Yujin to 2nd place\u2026\u2013 Is he crying again? I\u2019m tired of squeezing the juice\u2013\u00a0It would be nice if the ticket wasn\u2019t cut. My child is smiling and saying thank you even when he got pushed back, but I hate the look of his stuttering face \u3160\u3160\u2013 Wow. Seon Ahyun got second place when he can\u2019t even speak properly lololol The idiots who give sympathy tokens to people with disabilities who will not be able to express their feelings if they debut, calm down kekekeke\u2514 Is this commenter crazy? Aren\u2019t we supposed to at least stay in line?\u2514 Hahahaha, the crazy female fans of the stutterer are coming\u2514 You guys are really beyond imagination, it\u2019s disgusting.\u2514 I can\u2019t refute it so I have to swear haha, Y-Y-You don\u2019t think he deserves second place, do you? hahaEven raw criticism that normally didn\u2019t appear on the surface out of consideration for the bare minimum of morality, started showing up.There were many people who were astonished or tried stopping it, but if the number of people who originally thought the same was similar, the aggressive public opinion was bound to gain power.However, thanks to the reaction, favorable public opinion was formed for the participants were able to show a determined appearance even though their rank was pushed back due to negative voting and compensation for the winning team.\u2013\u00a0Guys, you worked hard \u3160\u3160\u2013 Where there is light, there is a shadow. Don\u2019t worry too much about the odd losers who cut tickets~ I support you^^\u2013\u00a0You must have felt sad, but thank you for showing us your courageThanks to this, Park Moondae, who had a higher rank before the correction, was fortunate enough to avoid a huge amount of criticism even after his rank rose.Instead, there was a slight change in the fan base.As the people who liked Moondae\u2019s team from the first team match were pushed behind, the fans who preferred Park Moondae\u2019s appearance from the second team match became the popular opinion.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u2013 Moondae-ya, congratulations on 4th place, you worked hard \u3160\u3160 (Video of receiving compliments from the 2nd team members)-\u2018Hyung, what are you doing?\u2019 He has the same expression on his face for three consecutive shots hahaha \u2018Why is a cat doing this to a dog\u2026 ?\u2019 (Screenshotted from a video clip with Cha Yujin) (Humorous photo of a cat and a dog)-It\u2019s so funny that Moondae couldn\u2019t win against the other kids this time, so he was half-forced to become an insider haha-If you look around the corner, he is handing out snacks \u3160\u3160\u3160 Oh, an angel\u2026 Angel Puppy\u2026 (short video)The fans of the other two participants, who didn\u2019t have strong relation groups, were also excited and sneaked into the trend.They were the fans of Cha Yujin and Kim Raebin.\u2013 Moon Puppy, Kim Rabbit, Cha Kitty, puppy rabbit and cat, isn\u2019t it a heart-pounding combination?

(fan art)Even a combination that included Ryu Chungwoo sometimes popped up on social media.As the second team match aired, people who were newly immersed in the program and those who poured out anger and checks on the participants mixed, the atmosphere overheated even more.Because of this over-immersion that crossed between fire hell and ondol rooms, the internet was a real chaos.It was even worse because the program was going on a road of successful performances.Even beyond the entertainment-related industries, you could now find articles about \u3008IJC\u3009 in any online community.And in every article, there were people who were battling with people who were stressed.============================[Survival Pro participant who is popular these days]: (Picture) A participant named Cha Yujin. Do women these days like these kinds of handsome feminine idols? tsk\u2026 an end of a century============================\u2013 Eye glitter\u2026 Something like a stinging wildcat\u2026 No luck\u2026 Impression\u2026\u2013 Ugly middle aged man haha.\u2013 Why? He\u2019s a handsome young man ^^ My daughter says she likes it.\u2013 This show is popular among young kids these days~ Some of them are really good at singing, if they make it to the finals I\u2019ll give them a vote~\u2514 You mean Park Moondae. Lol, he looks like he doesn\u2019t have much to offer, but\u2026 Aren\u2019t singers supposed to be good at singing?\u2013 Get a hold of yourself, what if I am old and have no eyesight? Cha Yujin is very smart. The young man who used to do archery is also very good. I support these two.\u2514 Ahjumma is the only one who has lost her mind, what is with that attitude of talkingWhen the comments caught fire like this, someone captured it on social media, and dozens of fights emerged in the articles per day.============================[IJC Latte* Community Reaction.jpg]: (Capture) Hahaha A crazy collaboration between an ahjae** who is being dealt with and a kkondae** who is going crazy hahaha============================(* \u2013 Latte community is a community for older/middle aged people, ** \u2013 ahjae is an old man/middle aged person, *** \u2013 kkondae is someone who is grumpy/acting in an old mannered fashion)Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost-Hahahaha Cha Yujin superstar, all of my peers saved pictures of Cha Yujin, the 180cm tall baby Kitty~\u2013 It\u2019s ridiculous that Seon Ahyun, who is not mentioned here, is in second place, really\u2026\u2514 This article does not represent every netizen\u2019s opinions, so why does your thoughts flow that way;;\u2514 Lol Just by mentioning Seon Ahyun I get labeled as a bastard by the fans rushing in, so I shouldn\u2019t mention him\u2514 Then what are you doing right now if it is not criticism, of course it\u2019s criticism.. What did Seon Ahyun do wrong?\u2514 Look at this, they are rushing again hahahaAnd at this time, the participants were able to access this rush of Internet opinion in real time.***To be honest, my first thought was this,\u2018I survived.\u2019Luckily, I was able to avoid major criticism, and I was in a good state of not rising high enough to receive backlash for it.I even got secretly grouped with the top-ranked participants who were thinking about changing.But there was nothing more rewarding than a sense of relief.I rubbed the screen with my thumb. The scroll appeared on the side, and all kinds of abusive comments swiped through.\u2018Somehow\u2026 It\u2019s bittersweet.\u2019To be honest, none of the contestants who were being criticized right now had shown bad personality except for Choi Wongil.Most of them were just kids who were working hard, so did they have to get beaten up like this?It had nothing to do with me, and to be blunt, I would benefit from other people falling, but even when this gave me benefit for survival, it left a bad aftertaste.\u2018Besides, this timing\u2026\u2019\u2013 We will distribute equipment for data search~Since this team match was self-produced, our phones were returned for a while to help us search for data for the specific concepts.It was originally forbidden to have a smartphone while filming.Thanks to this, the participants were able to isolate themselves from public opinion, but in this team match, that rule was broken.Moreover, because the program was so successful, as long as you could access the internet it was impossible to avoid the public opinion.Thanks to this, I ended up looking through all sorts of posts regardless of who they were for.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe dorm rooms were quiet as each of the team members were looking at their phones without saying a thing.I am pretty sure the other rooms were in a similar situation as wellMoreover, apparently, this team had a participant who was currently facing heavy blows from the internet.Seon Ahyun.\u2018Isn\u2019t he crying?\u2019Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostI felt like I should check up at Seon Ahyun\u2019s side under the bunk bed, but I couldn\u2019t help but sweat.It\u2019s because I had this ominous feeling\u2018Would this tire out his mentality and cause the characteristic to deactivate again\u2026?\u2019If Seon Ahyun\u2019s \u2018will\u2019 characteristic deactivated again, his \u2018self-esteem deficiency\u2019 status abnormality would come back.Then, would Seon Ahyun, who would receive a crazy penalty that drops his overall ability by two grades, be able to perform properly on the stage?It wouldn\u2019t be strange if both the stage completion and editing of the team match would go bad.I sighed silently.\u2018\u2026The team members were lucky too.\u2019There was never a day where I could comfortably go through a single team match.\u2018I\u2019ll have to check his status first.\u2019\u201cSeon Ahyun.\u201dI stuck my face out of the bed and lowered my head. Seon Ahyun, who was sitting on his bed, turned his head.\u201cY-Yes!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dWhy was he okay?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Rather, it felt like he went into military discipline.He wasn\u2019t even holding his smartphone.When I called out to him and didn\u2019t say anything, Seon Ahyun asked with a frightened expression.\u201cW-Why\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cNo, um\u2026\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t have to scrape around it. I just blurred my words and took out a chocolate bar from my bagThis was something I learned thanks to the Cha Yujin incident.\u201cDo you want to eat some?\u201d\u201cUh huh! Thanks\u2026\u2026\u201dSeon Ahyun took the chocolate bar with both hands as if he was making an offering to his dead ancestors, and then put it in his bag.\u201c\u2026?\u201dWasn\u2019t he going to eat it?As if he knew what I wanted to ask, Seon Ahyun hesitated.\u201cI have to take care of my body and weight\u2026\u2026 W-When my body gets heavy, my dancing gets weird. S-So I shouldn\u2019t get used to late night food.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dHe came from\u00a0 a different dance major. I roughly understood the situation and was going to move on, until I found a contradiction.\u201cDidn\u2019t you give me a chocolate bar past midnight during the evaluation?\u201d\u201cM-Mondae is fine! You were too skinny back then\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was a story like this?To my surprise, I heard a laugh from the bed next to us.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Park Moondae was really thin back then, so I thought you were over-managing yourself.\u201d\u201cBut your body? Wow, when I see you eat\u2026\u2026 Your body weight is nothing compared to what goes to your mouth. If it were me, I would have become a pig ages ago.\u201dKeun Sejin and Gold 1 added in one word at a time. Oh man.\u2018I purposely ate a lot to increase my physical strength, but it seems I was getting misunderstood.\u2019I was nervous, but thanks to this nonsense, the atmosphere in the room looked like it slightly eased up.Seon Ahyun also smiled a little from underneath, and when his eyes met my cold eyes, he got startled and coughed.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dReally\u2026\u2026 What a weird guy.I silently threw a bottle of water by his bedside.Seon Ahyun took the bottle and drank a little from it without saying anything else.And he murmured a little.\u201cI-I want to do better. Even more this time.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201dHearing that remark, it seems Seon Ahyun checked the public opinion on the Internet. But I figured he didn\u2019t look too closely and was able to maintain his composure.After thinking about it, I started to sneak in some words.\u201c\u2026 It could be that I\u2019m just worrying about it, but don\u2019t look for anything else on the Internet, just research the data.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dSeon Ahyun exclaimed with a mysterious face, and then suddenly responded with enthusiasm.\u201cI-I already knew that, it\u2019s okay. I-I\u2019m ready.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u2018What is he talking about again?\u2019Seon Ahyun muttered with an embarrassed expression.\u201cI-I\u2019ve already seen all the comments before the shooting. A-As I kept looking for it, it kept showing up\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWas that why he looked so out of it when we met on the day of the shoot?At that time, public opinion wasn\u2019t as bad as it is now, but isn\u2019t it the internet where normally all such posts were kept under water?Perhaps Seon Ahyun wasn\u2019t very familiar with the Internet, so he looked into everything without knowing the extent.\u2018How far did he search?\u2019I feel like he could have even looked at communities where only posts that cursed idols were posted all day longSeon Ahyun kept talking like he was making an excuse.\u201cI- I knew it would be like this someday. S-So I prepared my heart. I-It\u2019s ok, I am used to this.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cY-Yes!\u201dSeon Ahyun quickly nodded his head, but I was slightly disturbed.\u2018I think he is saying he is used to being criticized for his stuttering.\u2019I thought about it for a long time, but it was clear that he had experienced hell among peer relationships. Teenagers these days were scary.I clicked my tongue inward.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t last long. If you do well on stage, they will disappear again.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah. This is a survival program.\u201dThat was also the case for any cheap person or someone in the corner of the room, even if they were really criticized. Reality was like X, so it was fun to bite someone who could scream on the internet.If another celebrity became a hot topic, they would move onto them.I shrugged.\u201cFrom tomorrow onwards, I might get cursed.\u201d\u201cHuh? N-No\u2026 ! Y-You didn\u2019t do anything wrong\u2026..\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong either.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen Seon Ahyun closed his mouth out of embarrassment, Keun Sejin answered instead.\u201cSo, what you really want to tell Ahyun is to \u2018not take it for granted\u2019? Kya~ Our Moondae is so cool. If I were a viewer, I would have already bought his stocks.\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201d\u201cWow. This doesn\u2019t work anymore?\u201dKeun Sejin laughed and rolled around the bed. Gold 1, who was using the lower bunk, freaked out but spared no words of encouragement to the team members.\u201cStop it, you idiot, your bed will fall!\u2026 Okay, Let\u2019s just work hard. Let\u2019s do well on this stage!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dThe constant effort to somehow sublimate the situation into motivation raised the room\u2019s mood. The lively atmosphere was friendly.And Kim Raebin, who had been silent all this time, muttered in a low voice.\u201cYes. In that sense, I found and organized example materials for costumes and patterns for props, is it alright to post them in the group chat\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201dYes. That was the purpose of the phones.I think he had found them a while ago but just couldn\u2019t bring it up because of the atmosphere.From Kim Raebin\u2019s perspective, he had received all kinds of curses during the first team match, so the internet for him right now must be like a fairy. He would have no problem exploring around.\u201c\u2026\u2026O-Of course.\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll send them.\u201dThe same time that Gold 1\u2019s coughing rang across the room, vibrations sounded from the phones all around.I checked the data sent by Kim Raebin.[Colors_materials_patterns list__cloth base.xlsx][Accessory pattern_details list_no base.xlsx]When I clicked it, it wasn\u2019t just ordinary skills to organize them by categories. Perhaps the production team did not expect to reach this level.\u2018It\u2019s good.\u2019As if everyone had similar thoughts, exclamations and simple compliments came and went. Keun Sejin even blew a whistle.\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201dAfter Kim Raebin\u2019s shy thanks, the team members continued discussing the costumes and stage props until 3 a.m.The determination to make the stage come out well was expressed by the action of \u2018I will sleep when I die\u2019.I had a status window, but even so, these guys were really amazing.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost***After two more days of hard labor and practice from dawn to dawn, the time for the midterm evaluation had arrived once again.This time, the stage director, music director, and even the costume team sat down and evaluated with the trainers.First of all, if I were to self-evaluate, even if I think about it as objectively as possible, the current direction of this team was fine.Still, I wasn\u2019t expecting much. Because up until now I had never received good feedback from the midterm evaluations,But this result\u2026 It was honestly good.\u201cI really like it a lot.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s just do it like this!\u201dThe feedback started with these sentences.Watching the smiling trainers and the admiring judges, the team members realized the situation with a gradation.First, the choreographer.\u201cWho made this choreography? Did you all do it together? No, there must be someone who took the initiative\u2026 Wow, you guys got it right? Did you really do it all together? \u2026\u2026Okay. Whoever did it will show up on the show. Anyway, I have nothing to say, you did well.\u201dNext up was the vocal trainer Mudy.\u201cFirst of all, I am very proud that everyone managed to move like that without their notes shaking! Also, it\u2019s attractive how you changed the way the original song is sung, and the way you sing according to the newly interpreted parts. Let\u2019s sing the whole song with this vibe!\u201dEven Youngrin who rarely praised people openly.\u201cI know it\u2019s a stage with a lot of thought and practice, but the best thing is that it doesn\u2019t feel like an amateur. Even though it\u2019s the midterm evaluation, it\u2019s already complete. I can\u2019t wait to see you on stage soon.\u201dUp to this point, the team members had become \u2018thank you\u2019 bots and only thanked them one after another.In the middle of the series of favorable reviews to the point no one would be surprised if someone shed a tear of emotion, the director and the costume team did not spare their praise.\u201cLooking at the draft you wrote here, we can immediately feel that you paid a lot of attention to the details. Seeing what you have prepared for now, I think it will suit you well on stage.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a team that arranged the song very easily. We already have a lot of information, and it seems you had fun organizing and picking out the things you wanted without talking about anything today. Seeing it today, the stage is just as wonderful as our expectations.\u201d\u201cThis team\u2019s outfits also entered the production stage very quickly. The concept is clear, and there aren\u2019t that many vague parts. I can\u2019t wait to see you guys perform on stage wearing the clothes we made~\u201dAfter this whirlwind of praises, the faces of the team members were really worth seeing.Everyone looked so happy that they couldn\u2019t believe it, simply nodding with foolish expressions.Even Keun Sejin couldn\u2019t properly say something in the end.\u201cTeam, no, uh\u2026 Thank you. We will work harder!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t hurt yourself by working too hard!\u201dClap clap clap. Then, with the sound of applause from the judges, our group bid our farewells and returned to our seats.The team members, who were completely blown away, watched the rest of the team\u2019s stage and only reflexively reacted according to the trend. There was no audience.I was stunned too.\u2018Things are working out this well?\u2019I hadn\u2019t slept properly for a few days and had been immersed in just completing this, so I wasn\u2019t sure how good this would look.At best, \u2018it would be okay\u2019 was the end.\u2018\u2026Anyway, I feel good.\u2019I felt a little high at the sense of accomplishment.I just stared at the performances of other team members and enjoyed that sense of accomplishment for a while.It was close to midnight when the midterm evaluations completely ended.\u201cIt was so good.\u201d\u201cMe too.\u201d\u201cSame.\u201dThe team members mumbled in bed. It was only after it ended that they started coming back to their senses, the voices filled with happiness like never seen before flowed through one after another.\u201cI think we can do really well.\u201d\u201cT-That\u2019s right.\u201dThe pattern of saying things like this continued several more times.\u2018Are we going to be able to go to bed like this today?\u2019It had been a while since I got to slept for more than 4 hours.I closed my eyes quickly. But at that moment, another talk of work came out.\u201cOh, I haven\u2019t decided on the color of the sleeves for my outfit.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s right.\u201dThese guys were really tough. I forced myself to open my eyes. Damn it.\u201cI\u2019ve seen a few things, wait a minute.\u201dThe sound of a Keun Sejin manipulating the Talk Talk screen with his phone ran quietly\u201cI saw it here\u2026\u2026\u201dHowever, the rest of his words did not come. Keun Sejin just stiffened with his phone up.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dKeun Sejin, whose face was white, was looking at a screen.The smartphone screen shining in the dark bedroom clearly showed its color even though the distance was quite far away.\u2018It\u2019s a bulletin board for gossip.\u2019As a place linked to the portal site, it was a bulletin board famous as a hotbed for all kinds of conflict topics, rumors, and controversial articles.Without having Keun Sejin say anything else, I accessed the bulletin board with my own phone.And I saw a post that was already in the rankings even though it was posted 30 minutes ago.=========================3rd place!

The data accumulated from all the past incidents regarding that proved this.Especially when bullying or physical violence was involved. I had never seen any way to get past it aside from resigning or leaving for the military.But, for it to happen to a participant from the same team?\u2018\u2026 Let\u2019s check it first.\u2019I clicked on the post first. In the meantime, more comments were added.============================[3rd place! IJC\u2019s Keun Sejin accused of school violence.\u00a0 (491)]: Hold on, hold on, I\u2019m writing this because I feel like I will die if I hold this in.Participant Lee Sejin who goes by \u2018Keun Sejin\u2019 from \u3008Re-listed! Idol Joint-Stock company\u3009 harassed people all through Cheongsol high school.I couldn\u2019t sleep from crying over how unfair it was when I kept seeing articles on the internet making him seem like a good exemplary student, saying things like he probably ran for the student president election in high school.Lee Sejin has been drinking and smoking since middle school, and he bullied me by hanging out with a group of people who pretended not to be kind.\u2026\u2026============================The long article that followed insisted on Keun Sejin\u2019s clever behavior in school violence.The description of the one-on-one bullying was detailed and even included detailed examples. At first glance, it felt convincing even for me.\u2018This is not just a rumor that will be used once.\u2019Whether it\u2019s real or not, it was a deliberate post. They even attached a photo at the bottom.The author\u2019s own high school graduation album.And there was a picture of Keun Sejin with a cigarette on his finger.Below the picture was this text.============================[I have a lot of other pictures. If you understand the situation even a little, resign now. I don\u2019t know anything else, but I can\u2019t stand a kid like you becoming an idol]============================\u2018\u2026 Even if it\u2019s not real, once the label is attached, it\u2019s hard to get rid of it, but they even uploaded a photo.\u201dIn an audition program, this was almost a death sentence. And it was a huge negative impact for this team.Even if Keun Sejin survived, the editing of the team was over, and even if he resigned, it was hell. We would have to practice everything again from part distribution to movement.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI sighed and shook my head.\u2018Let\u2019s confirm it first.\u2019\u201cI just saw the article.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA heavy silence passed.No one asked what was going on.\u2018It seems like everyone else saw it too.\u2019Keun Sejin was silently lowering his head on the phone screen.\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s you in this picture?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201dKeun Sejin muttered in a dazed voice.\u201cI\u2019ve never filmed anything like this\u2026\u2026\u201dBut he couldn\u2019t say no for sure.I asked again.\u201cDid you smoke?\u201d\u201cWait, when I was in high school\u2026\u2026 I had some for a few days\u2026\u2026 But, I stopped right away. And I\u2019ve never done anything like this. Seriously, why would I do it at school\u2026\u2026\u201dKeun Sejin, whose voice grew louder and louder, closed his mouth as if he was suffocating. And he looked down at his phone again.\u2018He is reading the comments.\u2019It was obvious that they would be terrifying to look at. Gold 1 noticed the situation and quickly stopped it.\u201cHey, don\u2019t you look at that. Just turn it off. Turn it off.\u201d\u201c\u2026I have to see it to respond. But\u2026 Yes, it is already over.\u201dKeun Sejin put down her smartphone. His lower hand was trembling.\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d believe it either? I smoked, but I never took a picture, and if I say that everything except the cigarette is a lie\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s not convincing.\u201dAs he spoke, Sejin was becoming more and more calm. No, rather than getting calmer\u2026\u2026 he was giving up.\u201c\u2026People\u00a0 won\u2019t believe me, will they?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt seemed difficult to turn over a situation that involved pictures.Apart from that, It was really unfair for Keun Sejin. The actions described in the accusation were quite different from those of Keun Sejin.\u2018Because of his personality\u2026 I don\u2019t think it will leave a scar even if he tormented someone.\u2019Unless they tried manipulating the situation so he didn\u2019t even know he was bothering them and making them suffer from their own interest.He wasn\u2019t the kind of guy who would use this type of gossiping.But this was just a speculation. It hadn\u2019t been long since we met, so I couldn\u2019t reach hasty conclusions. Because human beings had many different sides to them.There were many cases of someone being a trashy boss, yet being a reliable father to his son.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter thinking for a while, I turned on the phone screen again. And I started carefully reading the article accusing Keun Sejin from the beginning again.Meanwhile, Keun Sejin and the other team members began struggling with despair and sadness.Keun Sejin muttered in a low voice.\u201cI\u2026\u2026 I will resign tomorrow.\u201d\u201c\u2026!!\u201d\u201cHey, wait a minute.\u201d\u201cT-T-Think, C-Calmly\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already done enough. It\u2019s true that I smoked\u2026\u2026 If I continue here, I think the controversy will only increase.\u201dKeun Sejin looked like he was struggling to make his voice go back to normal.\u201cAfter it calms down a little, if I explain it well, wouldn\u2019t it be possible to debut in a year or so? And it\u2019s a little\u2026 I really don\u2019t remember taking pictures, but it was posted anyway, so it\u2019s a bit scary.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dKeun Sejin, who always had time to spare, spoke like that, and the other team members didn\u2019t seem to be able to make any other sounds.I responded while still looking at my phone.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Why?\u201d\u201cThe person who wrote this said \u2018If you understand the situation, resign now\u2019. If you resign now, their words will become the truth.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t any of my business, but as I kept listening to their words, Keun Sejin\u2019s fever seemed to be gradually rising.\u201cStop. If you keep this up it\u2019ll only make me feel bad. Even if I refute the situation, the results are the same.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s important to have good rebuttal material.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI picked up my phone and turned the screen towards Keun Sejin.The screen had a zoomed in picture of the accusation photo.\u201cThis is photoshopped.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!!\u201dHe was so surprised that it looked like his eyes would pop out.Actually, if he thought about it calmly in the first place, he would have been able to guess that it was photoshopped, but I guess he couldn\u2019t out of fear.I handed my phone to Keun Sejin. And I pointed at a part of the picture with my index finger.First, the hand holding a cigarette.\u201cHere, if you zoom in on the design program\u2026 The pixels are a bit broken. I guess they lowered the picture quality on purpose, but there are still a few points.\u201dand the cigarettes.\u201cCigarettes by itself wouldn\u2019t shine this much. The exposure of the photo should be brighter than this, but it looks too white, so they lowered it a bit too much while they were doing it.\u201dIt was an easy mistake to make for beginners trying to put in a white object in the picture. It\u2019s true that the white stood out, but it looks awkward, so it\u2019s crushed.My phone\u2019s performance was so poor that it cut off a little, but there was no problem with confirming it.\u2018\u2026I didn\u2019t expect to benefit like this from my work as a data collector.\u2019I briefly recalled my past where I would receive an extra fee to grant requests like \u2018Please erase that crazy pattern on the clothes \u315c\u315c\u2019.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost\u201cH-How do you know this? Are you sure?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dKeun Sejin looked at the phone without saying a word.At the sight of a glimmer of hope, Gold 1 cried out.\u201cHey!! Then post an explanation now! That it\u2019s photoshopped!\u201d\u201cO-Oh\u2026 right! I have to post it\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, wait.\u201dIt seems because he was a good guy in real life, he didn\u2019t know much about internet physiology. I explained bluntly.\u201cI also looked into it, but I\u2019m sure there were some people among your fans who realized that it was photoshopped.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cT-Then if you wait, the fans\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, I mean\u2026\u2026 Even if there is a part that can be considered photoshopped because it\u2019s fun to curse, they won\u2019t believe it. They would be sarcastic for saying they like Keun Sejin.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201dBefore the atmosphere in the room got destroyed, I had to add an extra explanation right away.\u201cSo find it.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThe original photo. If you post it along with the original, they can\u2019t refute you when you say it\u2019s photoshopped.\u201dSeeing Keun Sejin in the photo staring at the lens meant that he knew the existence of a camera.If so, it was highly likely that this picture was taken by one of his acquaintances.\u2018But in this situation, it\u2019s dangerous to call all your acquaintances.\u2019Maybe a friend posted it.\u2018Seeing that the person who posted the accusation confidently uploaded the photo, they seem convinced that not many people will be able to find the original photo, but\u2026\u2026\u2019No, wait. Since this is easy to specify, it seems unlikely.\u2018Hmm, otherwise\u2026\u2026\u2019I was deep in thought and asked Keun Sejin.\u201cWhen you take pictures with other people, do you tend to save them all?\u201d\u201cThe ones I am in, yes.\u201d\u201cThen first\u2026\u2026 Why don\u2019t we look at your album from the day you took a lot of photos for an event or gathering?\u201dIf they cropped Keun Sejin from several group photos and then changed the background, they would not be able to find the original photo.\u201cMoondae, what were you doing before? Are you actually an NIS employee?\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dI quickly pushed away Gold 1\u2019s nonsense.The other team members were already sitting next to Keun Sejin, looking for pictures together with beaked eyes.\u201cLook at the group photos, not the individual photos. It could be enlarged.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dKeun Sejin, who barely returned to his usual tone, quickly opened his phone gallery.And the time of painful search continued.How many pictures did this guy take? His high school pictures kept on going endlessly.Half an hour passed, and we didn\u2019t even finish the 1st year yet.\u201cSe-Sejin, you have a lot of friends.\u201d\u201c\u2026haha.\u201dTo the point that Seon Ahyun mumbled something like this in a tired voice. Keun Sejin let out an embarrassing laugh and flipped through the photos.And around the time when the pictures from the first semester of his 2nd year started showing\u201cHyung, this!\u201d\u201c\u2026 !\u201dKim Raebin pointed to a picture passing through with his fingers. Keun Sejin quickly checked the picture.It was a picture of five or six people standing together and smiling at the camera. There were several pictures taken at the same place before and after this one was taken, only in different poses.Keun Sejin was a little away in the corner. And when we zoomed in on the upper body, we could clearly see it.It was the picture in the accusation.\u201c\u2026Ha.\u201dKeun Sejin bowed his head and let out a long sigh of relief.And somehow, he muttered in a dejected voice.\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s a picture from the election campaign.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dCome to think of it, at the beginning of the accusation, it mentioned something about running for the student president. I don\u2019t know who it is, but they must have been very close.\u2018Maybe I should have told him to look at the pictures from then.\u2019But anyway, we found it, so it\u2019s fine.\u201cWhat\u2026\u201dKeun Sejin stretched back as if the tension had been relieved. He almost hit his head on the wall behind his bed, but it\u2019s clear that he wouldn\u2019t care even if that had happened.\u201cThank god. It was in my photo album.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dI nodded my head.Gold 1 spoke vigorously from the side.\u201cGood! You had an agency, right? Send it away! Ask them to make a counterargument!\u201dIt was advice with common sense. Since things had already grown big, it would be better to respond officially with evidence.However, a disheartening reaction came back.\u201cTo my agency?\u201dKeun Sejin rubbed the back of his neck with a mysterious expression.\u201cHmm\u2026 That\u2019s a little\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dIt was the agency\u2019s job to do this, and yet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

    "Chapter 43": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Debut or DieCH 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNovel InfoNovel InfoA+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayT/N: This chapter has lots of references, please refer to the end notes for pictures and more detailed explanations(POV of Kim Raebin\u2019s fan, the one who sat next to the Moondae fan during the 2nd team match)Outside the Music Bomb stage, where the 3rd team match would be held, was crowded.And the majority of the crowd weren\u2019t the actual members of the audition, and instead people who came in to see if they can hear the sounds from outside.A college student who squeezed through the crowd and entered the line felt dissatisfied.\u201cWhy are they all crowding together when they can\u2019t even go in?\u201dShe couldn\u2019t understand why they were so excited to be here when they couldn\u2019t even see them.\u2018They did this in the second round too, but now it\u2019s even more crowded.\u2019She stood in the line for entrance, all fed up. Just looking at how long it was, it felt like it would take a month for her to be able to go inside.\u2018How annoying.\u2019All around her there were people holding shared slogans and snacks. At the same time, the names on the slogans were the same.[Park Moondae \u2661 Debut]\u2018\u2026\u2026He has become really popular.\u2019She pouted as she recalled the last team match.She felt bad because the person sitting next to her was a Park Moondae fan, but Kim Raebin, who was her favorite, even ended up on the same team as Park Moondae.\u2018Why do they like that concept bug*?\u2019(*= used to mock someone who is deeply stuck in whose own created character)She grumbled.However, she was still in denial about how she went crazy once the stage was over in the last team match.Still, she couldn\u2019t laugh at Park Moondae on the Internet.\u2018\u2026\u2026Well, he did fine on the stage, so I\u2019m letting it slide.\u2019She took her eyes off the slogan of Park Moondae while trying to deny it. She didn\u2019t know who had chosen it, but it being pretty made things even more annoying.\u201cPlease keep the order!\u201d\u201cDo not push!\u201dShe lined up according to the number she received in advance and entered the room, but from the middle, there were a number of people who started running. The area was a place where everyone had to stand without a single seat, so the earlier you stood in place, the more advantage you had.She grabbed the fence right in front of the stage.\u201cI did it!!!\u201dShe had no choice but to praise himself for succeeding in applying to be a part of the audience for the 18th time.It was a great achievement considering the number of audience applicants was flooded, and the production team changed the application again to a first-come, first-serve basis.\u2018I\u2019ll see him right in front of me.\u2019Her heart was pounding. However, barely before that expectation turned into discomfort, the MC entered.\u201cWelcome to the stage for the 3rd team match of \u3008Re-listed! Idol Joint-Stock company\u3009!\u201dAn explosive cheer rang out with a mixture of relief, joy, and irritation about how it was finally starting.\u2018Hurry up and start!\u2019She shouted inwardly, and held onto the fence.\u201cThe theme of this team match is \u3008Self-made\u3009! From selection to the stage setting, all elements of the stage were selected and created by the participants themselves!\u201d\u2018Kim Raebin would definitely have done this well!\u2019Thinking of his stock, the one thing he couldn\u2019t do was political action. She cheered like all the other members of the audience in excitement.\u201cIn addition, by analyzing shareholders\u2019 past buying trends with big data algorithms, the participants that shareholders liked together have become a team!\u201dAt the MC\u2019s words, the audience whispered all over the place, asking what nonsense it was.It\u2019s not that they didn\u2019t understand what she said, but more like why they did such a thing in vain instead of doing separate votings.Anyway, the MC naturally finished the opening.\u201cIt seems you guys are looking forward to it, then, right now! The opening stage will be revealed!\u201cWoah!\u201d\u201cThe song chosen by these participants is\u2026\u00a0 \u3008I like this waiting\u3009 by the sentimental idols Maximite!\u201dThe audience immediately turned their attention to the stage.Their eyes pointed at the stage were filled with expectation in case their favorite participant would appear now.\u2018It\u2019s better to come out later\u2026 Ah, I don\u2019t know! Come out right away!\u2019As if to repay that thought, light erupted from the stage.Piiiing.\u2018Gosh!\u2019But it wasn\u2019t completely bright.Strands of thick yellow beam lights soared from below the stage. The beams of lights dizzyingly illuminated the dark stage.At first glance, there was only one gigantic wooden stump on the stage.And the sound of wind instruments ringing.Whoo~ Whoohoo~ Hoo~ Hooo~It was the sound of Daegeum played at the beginning of Korean traditional music Suyeonjangjigok. An elegant and mournful note roamed the stage by itself.And one shadow jumped out of the left corner of the stage.It was a neatly done somersault.The tall man, wearing a wooden rabbit mask, ran out, spun through the air, and turned back.\u201c\u2026!!\u201dThe sound of the daugeum stopped.Following Inyoung\u2019s movement as he landed on one leg, the durumagi over his body fluttered, revealing the Western dress he wore underneath.At that moment, the beam lights that shined through the stage completely disappeared.On the completely dark stage, instead of the sound of daegeum, a voice sounded out.-My wait is longBecause it\u2019s always fun.Even though there was no accompaniment backing him up, the voice was perfect as if it was a recording.And now the audience knew whose voice it was.\u2018Park Moondae\u2026\u2019Light returned to the stage along with the deep sound of drums.Bong \u2013 bongbongbong! Bong \u2013 Bongbongbong!On the stage, five shadows stood in a circle wearing wooden rabbit masks.Behind them, a dazzling Milky Way appeared as if pouring into the black stage background.And the group dance.Sliide.*(*= sound of something softly dragging on the floor)The movements that began as slow and sensuous started becoming faster and more complex as the beat broke.It was almost like a natural phenomenon.The speed changed continuously and the timing wasn\u2019t always right, but no one missed the beat or movement.The outline of the heavy drum sound became sharp according to the dance, and after that, the modern bass line heavily balanced it.And the daegeum as well as the corrected piano notes began playing one after another.Uhwi- Wiwiwi-\u00a0Uhwiuhwi- Wi~~As soon as the drum sound completely became one with the pitch composition, the five of them moved their rabbit masks to the side of their heads in unison with the choreography.At the same time, the person on the right started singing. It was Park Moondae.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repost-On every street I wait for youMy heart is always flutteringKeun Sejin, who completely turned from the left to the stage with the choreography, smiled.\u2013 There\u2019s no room for anxiety to comeBecause I already know, that you\u2019llLike performing martial arts, the formation split and Kim Raebin jumped out from behind.-Definitely show up hereWe will meetMy heart is sure of itEverywhere my feelings overflowing like this\u2018Raebin!!\u2019The college student holding the fence cried inside. She wanted to scream, but she was able to somehow endure it.And there was something that not only her but also the majority of the audience noticed when his rap part came in.\u2018They changed all the lyrics to Korean\u2026\u2026.\u2019Yes. All the English words mixed in were changed to Korean to match the stage\u2019s atmosphere.\u2018As expected, my child is a genius!\u2019She cried inside, saying that they had changed it perfectly. She didn\u2019t even think of the possibility that the other team members might have changed it.However, as she was immersed in the stage, that feeling of appreciation also disappeared into the back of her head in an instant.-It\u2019s only naturalI know youAnd you\u2019ll get to know meWith Gold 1, Ha Iljun\u2019s voice backing him, Keun Sejin completed the pre-chorus.-The answer has long been decidedIt\u2019s an unavoidable fate that will come~Seon Ahyun came out to the center. His rabbit mask was moved clumsily, and covered his temples.Even then, his face shined.\u2018He\u2019s handsome.\u2019The college student who saw Seon Ahyun from a close distance was mad that she couldn\u2019t come up with a negative impression.Seon Ahyun started singing while standing upright and gracefully.-I like this waitingMy wait is longBecause it\u2019s always fun\u201cHuh?\u201dWith that very chorus, familiar movements began mixing in.It was a hand gesture, the point choreography of the original song.However, a new foot movement was added in with the hand gestures to create a strong feeling.Hwak!The choreography that consisted of much bigger body movements than the original was captivating as it matched the flying durumagi.\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019The stage was being done in a historical drama style with a romantic and overwhelming feeling rather than the emotional and light original song.-When this wait is over,I know you I\u2019ll meet youMy feelings are already shining brightlyPark Moondae sang the high note at the end of the chorus.Perhaps the color faded during the filming, but the hair that was now closer to blonde, swept over the mask and fell over.\u2018\u2026\u2026What\u2019s with that hair\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s okay.\u2019She struggled to hide her nice impressions today, making excuses saying that it was probably because the stylist created their life\u2019s masterpiece with this stage makeup.And as soon as the note was over, Park Moondae turned completely backwards.\u2018What is it?\u2019The audience, who were focusing on the participants\u2019 movements and facial expressions, reflexively turned their eyes towards the back.A huge dark blue trajectory was drawn over the starry sky flowing behind the stage.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dBefore she knew it, only the string and wind instruments remained.With it as the background sound, the dark blue trajectory drew a huge circle.The circle, completed with traces of ink paintings as if drawing with ink, soon shone blue.A round blue light source between the starry sky. It was the earth seen from the moon.Uhuuu- Uhuuu- Uhu, Uuu\u2013The participants fell gently on the floor and naturally took off their durumagi and threw it far away as they got back up in line with the melody tune.-A light daydream like a dreamOn my way to meet youBefore she knew it, the participants stood in full western dressTheir bodies made short and intense group dance.It was a full body movement that felt like it was a dance, and their body curved gently and smoothly. It felt very strange.Only read this at europalation (dot) wordpress (dot) com, please do not repostAt this point, the accompaniment without percussion instruments sounded somewhat sensual.\u2018Kim Raebin is crazy\u2026\u2026.\u2019\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe college student was surprised at the sound she made, but soon realized that she could hear it everywhere.-You said you have been waiting for me tooSaying, A clear sense of deja vuBy changing the lyrics from \u2018Deja Vu\u2019 to \u2018Gisigam*\u2019 the sound became more bizarre as if swallowing it.(*= both mean the same thing, but one is pronounced in english while other is in Korean)-Facing this moment of fateNever hesitate!Bang!At that moment, the percussion instruments were added back into the accompaniment.The slightly blatant feeling of sensuality quickly disappeared.-I like this waitingMy wait is longBecause it\u2019s always funIn the chorus that sounded again, Keun Sejin came out to the center and took the center stage of a complex group dance.The choreography became more colorful.-When this wait is over,I know you I\u2019ll meet youMy feelings are already shining brightlyAnd the low humming that followed.-Hum hu hu hum- huhu DDu-ru Du-ru Du DuIt was the melody of the chorus.With a foot-moving choreography, it felt like they were waiting for someone and singing in anticipation.The drum sound from the accompaniment sounded like a heart beating.The college student belatedly realized that Park Moondae was singing an octave higher note on top of the humming by himself.It gave her goosebumps.\u2018\u2026\u2026I thought it was an instrument.\u2019She swallowed her saliva. On the stage, the introductory choreography changed once again.The formation constantly changed, and the five people naturally stood around the single prop on the stage.\u2018Huh?\u2019A huge wooden stump.It was the stump of a Gyesu tree.Sitting around the stump naturally, they immediately took off the blazers of their Western dress and threw them down.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dUnderneath it revealed a Jeogori like shirt, Keun Sejin looked straight ahead and smiled.He turned the rabbit mask back to his face and sang the last verse.-Wait for me .The blue light representing the earth fell over the moon rabbits who fell asleep leaning on each other while sitting on the stump of Gyesu tree, and the stage ended.And cheers burst out loud enough to break the roof of the filming site.\u201cWoaah!\u201cKyaaah!\u201d\u201cUuuaaa!\u201dBelow the stage, all kinds of reactions were overflowing, from reactions that involved shouting to covering their mouth.This was because everyone was excited by the unexpected combination of high ranking participants, and the stage that was at a high level of perfection.In addition, this tremendously conceptual stage had something that stimulated the hearts of fans.Since she couldn\u2019t interpret everything at once, she wanted to watch it multiple times to find the hidden elements.Obviously, there would be many audiences who were already struggling while counting the days left until the broadcast.\u2018It\u2019s all over.\u2019The college student, who let go of the fence, mumbled proudly for no reason. She had barely come to her senses from screaming so much after the stage light went out.With the opening cut off like this, the next guys automatically set the stage.She hesitated, and eventually admitted her excitement.\u2018\u2026Well, the October kids are good, too.\u2019The irritation she felt when she first entered disappeared as she commented, \u2018They can make their debut with Ryu Chungwoo and Cha Yujin\u2019.List of all the references/explanations;The outfit they are wearing in this stage (you can also see the blue light circle in the back!)Daegeum (A large bamboo flute often used in Korean traditional music);Durumagi;Jeogori;Moon Rabit/Gyesu tree: It was mentioned in earlier chapters that they would reinterpret this theme for the stage. Basically the version they used is the Korean retelling of the story. It\u2019s basically a rabbit who lives in the moon and pounds rice cake under a Gyesu tree!\u00a0Read more on it herePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNovel InfoNovel Info",
