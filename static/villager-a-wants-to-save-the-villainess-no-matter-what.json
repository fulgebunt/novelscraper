At the height of the Royal Academy\u2019s end-of-the-year celebration.The owner of the voice was His Royal Highness Prince Karlheinz Bartille von Centraren. He had the Centraren Royal Family\u2019s traits, their fiery red hair and blue eyes. His body was also thin, yet muscular. Truly, his handsomeness was befitting that of a prince.Beside him was a cute girl of short stature with pink hair and green eyes. She had an air around her that would make people unwittingly want to protect her. This was the baron\u2019s daughter, Amy von Brayes, who hid behind the prince with an uneasy face.As if to protect her, aside from the prince, 4 other men gathered around herStarting from the right, the first person was a handsome youth with dark hair and brown eyes who wore a pair of glasses and gave off an intelligent air. This was Markus von Beinz, the heir to the count and eldest son of the court magician.The second was Leonardo von Jukes. A brown haired, muscular and handsome youth who had a look of strength behind his blue eyes. He was the heir to the Viscount and eldest son of the Chief of the Imperial KnightsNext was a handsome youth with long wavy golden hair and emerald green eyes who had a beautiful effeminate face that could be mistaken for a woman\u2019s. His name was Oscar von Wimlet, heir to the Marquis and Firstborn to the Richest Man in the Kingdom.Lastly, was the wild and handsome black-haired, black-eyed and brown-skinned youth, Claude Justine de Westerdale. The 3rd\u00a0Prince of the western neighboring country, Westerdale.And the one who was on the other end of the broken engagement, the ex-fianc\u00e9e, was Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett. Her long hair was pale gold, reminiscent of the soft glow of the moon in the night sky and her eyes were of a beautiful ice blue. This dignified and strong-willed girl was the daughter of the Duke of Ramslett. One of the three most prestigious dukes of the country.\u201cYour Highness, I don\u2019t understand what you mean by that.\u201d\u201cHmm. As per usual, you are a woman with little understanding. Rather than a rotten woman like you, a kind and gentle person like Amy is much more appropriate as my fianc\u00e9e.\u201dAnastasia\u2019s eyebrows momentarily twitched. But without any change in her expression, she argued.\u201cThis woman who knows nothing of Etiquette, Noble mannerisms, and feudal law is more appropriate?\u00a0 Does Your Highness truly believe this woman is an appropriate Queen for the state?\u201dWithout a change in her expression, Anastasia sent Amy a cold glare.Meeting her gaze, Amy shrunk back with a jerk where she was softly embraced by the Prince.\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous!\u00a0 It is exactly her kindness that the country needs. There is no place here for you to keep spinning up your foolish theories. In the first place, we know about the many bouts of harassment you\u2019ve made Amy face! A person like you is not fit to be Queen!\u201dAnd so His Highness the Prince denounced Anastasia with fiery rage in his eyes, joined in by the mockery of the other four youths.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aAnd so the story I remembered went something like that.My name is Allen. I am an ordinary 8-year-old boy Living in the Centraren Kingdom\u2019s Capital, Lurden. My only family member is my mother. We\u2019re pretty poor, but somehow we still get by.But what was unusual, was from the moment I sneezed a moment ago, Memories from my previous life, like me being an aerospace engineer, came flooding back.It\u2019s alright. My memories have returned, but I\u2019m still Allen. I\u2019m sure about that.I\u2019ve acted largely the same as I would have in my previous life, and so, though my previous life\u2019s memories have returned, I\u2019m feeling really confused but nothing else feels different.Alright, it was kind of sudden but I know this situation is bad. Like, really bad.First, I\u2019ll explain. This world is most likely the same one in the hit smartphone dating sim [Magical\u2606Fantasy\uff5eLove\u2019s Heart-Racing\u2661School Life].\u2026For now, let\u2019s not talk about the game\u2019s\u2026 unfortunate naming sense.Now, what\u2019s bad about this situation is that if things stay this way, me, my mother, and everyone in this town will die in 8 years.I realized this because of the name of the country I live in, and the news of a certain 8-year-old Prince Karlheinz\u2019 engagement with the Duke\u2019s daughter Anastasia, reminded me of something.So anyway,Oops, I may have gotten carried away.First, let\u2019s finish talking about the game.After this, Anastasia who couldn\u2019t bear the one-sided mockery took of her glove and threw it at Amy, challenging her to a duel.Anastasia was a girl many would consider abnormally calm and rational but all she really was, was a strong-willed girl who knew how to keep her emotions in check. But because of this course of actions, her anger overwhelmed her self-restraint and so she acted the way she did.And so, as Amy\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, the prince stepped up to fight as Amy\u2019s representative.As expected, there was no one who would have wanted to fight against the Prince, and so Anastasia was made to fight for herself and lost.Defeated, Anastasia couldn\u2019t bear to show herself again at the academy and so she was sent off to a Provincial Convent. On the way there, her carriage was then attacked by bandits, and from then on she disappeared.Up until here, it was pretty much the story of a pretty shitty ga\u2014 *cough* I mean, it was truly a lamentable development but the story didn\u2019t end there.First, what was really disgusting was that those bandits were all hired by the Prince and his group.This wasn\u2019t exactly explicitly said in the game, but it was definitely implied.It was this event that led to an imbalance in political power which eventually spiraled down into a civil war that sent the kingdom into chaos. Taking advantage of the chaos, the neighboring Est Empire to the east declared war. With their lightning-fast march, the kingdom consumed by internal strife had no time to react, and before we knew it, the capital Lurden was already razed to the ground.This is the really bad situation I was talking about. I just want to tell them straight to their faces.\u2018Don\u2019t drag us into your bullshit!\u2019 Or something like that.And so, my goal right now is to keep my Mom safe.To do that, I need to create a situation where we won\u2019t have to be invaded by the empire.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgI also can\u2019t just abandon Lurden altogether and flee south. It\u2019s not just because I\u2019m kind of attached to the town I was born and raised in but the concept of \u201cmoving to another tow\u201d doesn\u2019t exist in the first place. Because in this strict hierarchal feudal system, the amount of people in the fief directly increases the influence of the local lord. So unless there was a valid reason like marriage, it was really hard to just move to another town.Now, I could think of a couple ways to solve this problem but what I want to go with is overturning the punishment of the Villainess Anastasia.I have two reasons for this. The first reason is that if this world is really going to follow the game\u2019s event progression, then I already have an idea of how to do it. And the other reason is simply wanting to save her.Anastasia was the only character I really liked in the game. I don\u2019t want her to die.The \u201cVillain Anastasia\u201d is what she was called but thinking about it, she\u2019s decent in every way.\u201cWe have a place in society, so mind your actions.\u201d\u201cKeep your manners, whether it\u2019s during ceremonies or eating.\u201d\u201cYou have a fianc\u00e9e, so you can\u2019t do anything that might lead to misunderstandings, you mustn\u2019t!\u201d\u201cYou live off of the taxes of the people. Think about what this political marriage will do and do your best for the country and the people!\u201d\u201cThe Prince has his. The nobles have theirs. You yourself must fulfill your own duties as well!\u201dThere might have been a few differences in words and nuances, but this was what Anastasia believed.Those who were told this, bullied her. Told her she was condescending and annoying. Petty and uptight. Because love and peace were the best, right?But look at how things that turned out. The destruction of the royal capital, huh?Not only that, Anastasia was just 8 when the marriage was decided. Ever since then she\u2019s worked herself to the ground to be suited to become Queen.Not only did she show manners appropriate to her position as the Duke\u2019s daughter and future Queen but she was also an incredibly hard worker who never let her abilities get to her head and developed her talents in her studies, magic, arts, and even her sword skills.Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s unfair that, after all that, this is how it would end?What\u2019s more, after being having her carriage attacked by the bandits Anastasia didn\u2019t die. Instead she was turned into the bandits\u2019 plaything and sold to the Est Empire after being exhausted both physically and mentally.After that, she was given a cursed sword and became the empire\u2019s Black Knight who spearheaded the war against the Centraren Kingdom.In the end, Amy awakens to the power of a Saint(lol) due to her compassionate heart that only desired peace. Along with the prince and the aforementioned youths, they were 6 in all. Together, they joined their powers in order to defeat the Empire and Anastasia who had fallen into darkness, as well as reclaim the lost kingdom, and finally, Tie the knot. That was the ending plot of the story.By the way, Anastasia\u2019s parents who had maintained a neutral position during the civil war for political reasons, were still framed by their own family and accused of being the ringleaders of the event. Naturally, they were executed. This was another of the reasons why Anastasia fell into darkness.Just\u2026wow.I can\u2019t help but think the development team had some sort of agenda.So. The reason why I know this is because of my shitty sister. One time when she got dumped by her boyfriend she kept coming to my room drunk and bothering me every night. She then brought this game and forced me to complete it and unlock every single event picture. \u2018If it makes me feel better, I\u2019ll leave.\u2019 she said.She made the excuse \u2018You\u2019re good with games right? So just do something and beat it.\u2019I couldn\u2019t just throw her out of the room. And if I didn\u2019t then she would just keep bothering me so I reluctantly did it. Well, I was pretty good at the game anyway. And at the end of the day, even if she\u2019s a shitty sister, she\u2019s still my sister.But what was especially painful was for a guy like me, to try so hard to increase some bastard\u2019s affection level. It just kept going on and on and on until I just felt empty and stopped thinking about it.Ah. Just thinking about it gets me mad.But even though it\u2019s a dating sim, it had some absurdly difficult RTS-style battle parts. The reverse harem route felt almost impossible to complete without paying for micro transactions. Because of that, I had to say goodbye to quite a few of my precious \u00a510,000 friends.Ah\u2026Ugh\u2026Let\u2019s stop thinking about it. This was something from my previous life. Let\u2019s bury it deep within my memory. No, if we could remove it altogether, that would be even better.Yeah, so to sum it up, I\u2019m going with the plan that lets me save Anastasia.This is my own personal choice. Of course, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m not thinking I have a chance with her. I mean she is really pretty. And I think she has a really cool personality\u2026It\u2019s just that realistically speaking, what are the odds of a Duke\u2019s daughter getting together with a completely random townsman?In the first place, I\u2019m not even part of the game. Nowhere in the game does a character like me appear. And so without even appearing in the game, I\u2019m less than even a mob character.If I had to say, the closest anything related to me appears in the game is when the screen shows the message \u2018After that, the townsmen of Lurden were never seen again\u2019 during the \u2018Surrender of Lurden\u2019 event.So. 8 years until destruction. I\u2019ll do the best I can.I\u2019ll definitely break through this fate, save my mother, the townsmen, and Anastasia!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

If I can be sure of that then I can be sure that the things that will happen will largely be according to the game\u2019s scenario.And the other goal is to find a way to make money.\u00a0 The only way to save Anastasia is to stop her from being punished, that is, to win as her representative in the duel. That means I need to enroll into the Royal Academy. For that purpose, I need money.By the way, though I think the easiest way to solve this entire problem is to prevent them breaking up in the first place but no matter what you did in the game, the marriage was still called off so I\u2019ll chalk this option up to wishful thinking.Now, first step to accomplish those things is to get the [Scroll of Concealment]. This thing, in the game, was found in a small room in the secret passage that leads from the academy to the underground sewers of the royal capital. It\u2019s an area that had been left unused for years and was only found out during the time when the Empire\u2019s army had overrun the royal capital.It was an item that was supposed to be discovered accidentally when Amy and the others walked through the sewers to escape from the Academy.If we really find it there, then we can confirm that events that happened in the game can be related the current world. And with the scroll, we can move around much more freely.In other words, whether the scroll is there or not would be a huge factor in making sure how this world and the game are related. If this scroll and a few other things could be confirmed, then we can safely assume that the world is exactly the same as in the game.And that\u2019s why I came to the Adventurer\u2019s Guild with my mother.\u201cExcuse me, please let me clean out the ditches!\u201d\u201cO-oh! Sure kid, good luck with that! Here, let your mom fill this one out.The old man at the reception desk gave my mom the application form he explained the guild system while she filled it out.The Adventurer\u2019s Guild starts accepting registrations for kids at the age of 8 where they would help them find random chores, like cleaning ditches, that they could do around town. Actually, not too long ago, my mom encouraged me to apply but I refused, saying I didn\u2019t like the stench of it.But last night when I told her I changed my mind, she was very happy. And so that leads us here.By the way, the adventurer\u2019s system is like this: A kid like me starts off as a G-ranked adventurer. Once you become 12-years-old, you can become F rank and can advance onwards until the highest S-rank.\u201cAlright, then drop a little bit of blood on this guild card.\u201dI did as the old man said, and pricked my finger with a needle. The card flashed a bit when the blood came into contact with the card.\u201cAlright, that completes the registration. If you lose your guild card, it\u2019ll cost you money to get another one so be careful. Also, this thing can also function as a wallet. Convenient, right?\u201dI was surprised at how much more convenient it was than in Japan.Anyway, just like that I became a G-level adventurer and continued to clean ditches every day.By the way, I was also paid 1,000 cents a day for cleaning ditches. It\u2019s the currency for the Centraren Kingdom, so it\u2019s a cent. Comparing it, I think the conversion rate is roughly around 1 cent being equal to 1 yen.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aAnd so, after a month of hardships and stink and filth, the receptionist old man called out to me.\u201cHey, Allen! Today onwards you can take care of the underground sewer system. It stinks is a lot worse than those ditches outside but you can get double the pay. What do you think?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201dOf course, I immediately agreed. I mean, this was the reason I was doing this in the first place, you know?I accepted the request and entered the underground sewers from the stairs behind the guild and lit a lantern I borrowed.I don\u2019t know how to get to the scroll\u2019s location from here, but I had a few ideas. I headed downstream to the underground sewers, marking my path so I don\u2019t get lost.So after walking for a while, I entered a large brick-domed sewer area.That\u2019s good. Now I was in the main sewers. And the red bricks around me meant that I was downstream from where the scroll was.I marked the sewer back to the guild so that I didn\u2019t get lost on the way back, and then I started walking upstream.And after walking for quite some time, the walls and ceiling changed from red bricks to a gray stone structure.It was a sign that I was getting closer and so I continued on.After around 5 minutes of walking, suddenly I arrived at a place with a picture of a bird on the wall.If this was exactly like the game, then there should be a hidden door in front of the place where this picture of a bird was written.I checked the walls around it and found something that looked like a button.\"\"Without hesitation I tried pushing it in but maybe because it was old, it was harder than I thought. I put my whole body weight against the button until I heard something softly click into place.Then, with a rumbling sound, a section of the wall opened up. I had brought something like a crowbar just in case, but luckily I didn\u2019t need it.I went through the entrance. There should be a room with a desk a bit further in\u2026Ah. Here it is.When I looked inside, I saw a battered, rotten desk and a chair with its seat missing. What in the world was this room used for?This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgI walked to the desk thinking\u2026Please, please be there.A little bit underneath the desk there was something on the floor.I tried to reach out and take it but it was farther than my arms could reach.Damn. To think I\u2019d be held up by a trap like this!But not all was lost, I had brought a crowbar-like thing just in case, and this was its time to shine. I nudged and hooked the thing and brought it towards me.Now, the moment of truth, was this the scroll I was looking for?I unfolded the scroll.There I saw the symbols for \u201cConcealment\u201d written on it. Yes! This was it!In the game, using it was easy. All you had to do was open the scroll and put your palm on it.I immediately laid it flat on the ground and put my right hand on it.The scroll flashed brightly, and in the next moment it was gone.\u201cAll according to plan!\u201dFor a moment, I felt imaginary glasses light up like some sort of anime villain.I felt like I was on cloud 9, but it was a bit too early to celebrate.I took out my guild card and checked my personal information.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Name: Allen.Rank: GAge: 8Blessings:Skill: \u3010Concealment\u3011Residence: LurdenMoney: 3,348\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Yes!This. Is. Great!It\u2019s perfect!In the small little basement with no one else in it. Elated cries of celebration echoed out.\u2026That was kind of embarrassing.I regained my composure and went back to the guild with great enthusiasm.Huh? What about cleaning up the sewer? Of course, I did it on my way out.What can I say? I\u2019m a man who gets the job done.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The more proficient you become, the less likely you are to be noticed and the more sophisticated your concealment becomes.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500This was my new skill. Pretty useful, huh? Now there were two main ways you could use this.The first way was so you could get in and out of places without anyone noticing.After all, it was an overpowered skill prepared by the game so that Amy and the others could escape from the Pursuers of the Imperial Army.Without this, there\u2019s no way they could have sneaked in out of town and go to dangerous places unnoticed.The next thing really cool thing it can do is obscure the contents of the guild card. After all, with an overpowered skill like this, it could lead to some problems.If people knew about this, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there were some people who would want to kidnap me to raise me as an assassin or something like that.After testing the skill, I found out that when I used \u3010Concealment\u3011I\u2019d become nearly imperceptible. Something like that feeling when a rock suddenly falls around you.I know this because last night when I got home, I tried it out with my mother.The experiment was simple: I just used \u3010Concealment\u3011at home and sat upright on a chair in the room and waited for my mother to come home.When she did\u2026\u201cAllen, I\u2019m home! Time for dinner.\u201dOur house was on the fifth floor of a run-down apartment that was illegally extended. It was just a small studio room with a kitchen and a shared bathroom. I should have been immediately seen when she came in.\u201cAllen? Where are you? I can\u2019t believe him. Leaving the lamp on and suddenly going out like this.\u201dShe mumbled while putting down the scrap vegetable soup, hard bread, and dry meat she bought for dinner.Then she tried to pull on the chair I was sitting on\u2014\u201cHuh? Was the chair always this heavy?\u201dConfused, she went around the table and pulled a seat on that side.\u201cMom?\u201dShe looked around the area, startled. but no matter what she did she couldn\u2019t find me.Even though I was sitting right in front of her, she still couldn\u2019t notice me.I hop off the chair I was sitting on and go around to her side of the table and lightly tap on her shoulder.\u201cOh, huh? Allen? How long have you been there?\u201dSo the skill works something like that.\u201cHehe. I was here since you entered! Anyway, here\u2019s what I got today.\u201dI gave my mother some of the money I earned from cleaning up random ditches.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgAs you could see, we were really poor. So I wanted to help my mom even if by just a bit. After all, she was my one and only family.\u201cThank you. But you don\u2019t have to push yourself so hard, you know? Just as long as you study properly, okay?\u201d\u201cYeah, I know. The lessons are easy to understand, though, so it\u2019s fine!\u201dBy the way, the school I was going to was a place where you could learn how to read, write, do basic arithmetic, and learn this world\u2019s history three times per week for free. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday morning you could take classes for 2 hours.Since I had memories of my past life, I didn\u2019t need to take any classes other than for subjects unique to this world like history. But I couldn\u2019t relax on my studies either because I needed to enter the Royal Academy in the future.Now, time for my next goal. This time, I needed to go out of town. There was said to be an ancient labyrinth near the outskirts of Lurden, there, I need to enter and find the\u300eScroll of Appraisal\u300f.Of course, an eight-year-old child wasn\u2019t simply allowed to waltz in and out of town. Especially since it was out of town, there was a chance for demons to appear. We were close to the Royal Capital though, so it was highly unlikely, but other things like getting mugged by bandits and thieves could still happen.This is where \u3010Concealment\u3011comes into play. Using this, we sneak out of town, stealthily enter the ruins, and get what we want all without anyone noticing.Incidentally, this \u300eScroll of Appraisal\u300fwas supposed to be an item that the game\u2019s protagonist, Amy was supposed to obtain.She got it by chance during her first year\u2019s summer vacation when she visited the ruins as a research project with the person you were aiming to date. So if we can find the scroll there, we can then again confirm that this world and the game\u2019s are one and the same.Don\u2019t make light of it though, this\u3010Appraisal\u3011skill doesn\u2019t just appraise items. To put it simply, this thing was also really overpowered.As the name suggests, this skill could be used to appraise items. That in and of itself is already really good, but where it really shined was when you paid real money for \u2018magic stones.\u2019Using those you could identify the names and skills of those weaker than you, detect treasure chests in dungeons, detect traps, find out enemy weaknesses, anticipate enemy actions in battle, and even find the correct thing to say in a conversation and the right answer to a final exam.Magic stones drop from defeated monsters, but in the game, there was a really limited amount of magic stones you could get so in order to show off its really overpowered features, you had to pay real money. Basically, this was the game\u2019s micro transaction system. But in this world it\u2019s an indispensable part of the plan to break through the future scenario.Now, let\u2019s get back on topic. So I came to the town\u2019s entrance while hiding with the \u3010Concealment\u3011skill\u2026As expected, no one seems to notice me. I joined a group of people heading out, but no one said anything.The guards don\u2019t seem to have noticed my presence either.Now let\u2019s try entering the town again. Ordinary people use the gate I just came out of, but there were two other gates besides that. One for the merchants and one for the nobility. I went around to try and enter the merchant\u2019s gate.I wasn\u2019t even going to try entering the noble\u2019s gate. If I was found out, let\u2019s not even talk about 8 years from now. I wouldn\u2019t even live to see tomorrow.I walked a bit further and reached the gate where a few merchants were lined up. They were handing some sort of paperwork to the guards and were having their cargo inspected.I walked straight through the gate. No one said anything. They didn\u2019t notice me at all!As expected of an overpowered skill for a hero. Excellent.Though, after testing for a bit more, I found out that if I activated the \u3010Concealment\u3011skill while someone saw me, the skill would activate, but they would still be able to recognize me. However, if I was able to escape their line of sight, the skill would then take effect and the wouldn\u2019t be able to notice me anymore.Feeling better after making sure the skill worked, I left town and walked towards the ruins.From here on out, there will be demons. Let\u2019s brace ourselves.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So although I know the general direction of where I need to go, I quickly found out that moving my character from an aerial view and actually navigating through the forest myself, were completely different experiences.This area was supposed to be the tutorial for the battle part and I cleared it by mindlessly following the game\u2019s instructions but reality was way different from the game.By now, it should have been around two hours of me searching the area, but I just can\u2019t find the ruins. Thankfully, \u3010Concealment\u3011had been working the whole time so although I saw a few demons here and there, none of them came and attacked me.The most common demonic species here was a type of horned rabbit. To put it simply, it was just a rabbit with horns that was more aggressive than normal. It would have been a piece of cake for adults to deal with but I was still an 8-year-old boy so I would have been in trouble if they attacked me.Though, after searching for a bit more, it was starting to get late and I still had to do work for the guild, so I thought to end the search for today.******A few days later, I finally had an idea of where to look. By now, this was my fifth time coming here to look for the ruins, so I had more or less found out the general geography of the area.Today, I was going to go deeper into the forest than usual, and that\u2019s because I remembered a key area from the game.In the game, the ruins were located around the upper right of the map but there was also a certain tree diagonal to it at the lower left. In other words, if we can find that tree and go directly north east of it, we can find the ruins.I continue sneaking around the forest with \u3010Concealment\u3011activated.I combed the forest for around half an hour when I found it. A slight opening to the greenery and\u2026\u2018There we go!\u2019 Here\u2019s the tree I was looking for.It was a tall and sturdy tree that stood at the middle of the clearing, but what was interesting about it was that it had another tree snaking around it. This was what was called the \u2018strangling tree\u2019 in the game. Now all I had to do was go directly northeast from here.In the game, this forest was the home of the horned rabbits and the inside of the ruins was the home of the Blue Slimes. Neither of them were particularly strong demons, but they were more than enough to kill me if they found me.Relying on my memory of the game, I proceeded cautiously so as not to make any noise. And after 10 minutes of walking, I arrived at the entrance to the ruins.I\u2019m sure that that was the same entrance to the ruins I saw in the game\u2019s background during the dialogue part of the game.That was definitely it\u2026 but something unexpected was standing guard in front of it.A bipedal demon with green skin and a hideous face was patrolling the area.Instead of the blue slimes that were supposed to be there, there was a goblin.Because I walked straight towards the entrance of the ruins I walked right in front of the goblin but thankfully there were still no signs I was noticed. If it wasn\u2019t for \u3010Concealment\u3011I would have been dead by now.\u2018Wh-what should I do? Should I just give up and go back?\u2019No. I can\u2019t do that. Goblins were known to be a race that multiplied rapidly. There doesn\u2019t seem to be as many right now, but if I waited longer, entering the ruins would become impossible. It would become even worse when they started attacking people because then an extermination party would be sent out. Worst case scenario, someone from that party would find the scroll.Why did the setting change? No, that doesn\u2019t matter. They still couldn\u2019t see through the \u3010Concealment\u3011skill and so I still had a shot at breaking in.\u2018Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll be fine\u2019 I tell myself.I\u2019ll believe in the overpowered skill meant for the heroine of the game******The insides of the ruins were damp, but strangely enough, the ceiling and walls were glowing faintly.If I remember correctly, the game explained that this was because of a special type of glowing moss that grew in ruins and caves.I knew this, so I didn\u2019t bring a torch with me, but that was definitely the right decision because no matter how good the \u3010Concealment\u3011skill was, even a fool would notice torchlight in a dimly lit cave.I slowly crept deeper, making sure not to make a sound.The\u300eScroll of Appraisal\u300fwas supposed to be found on the first level at the end of the corridor I was currently walking down.Whenever I see the occasional goblin pass by, I pressed myself against the wall and held my breath. Even when they\u2019d passed, I still walked as quietly as I could.My heart was beating so hard I thought it would leap out of my chest. I was extremely nervous until I finally reached the end of the hall. There was a small room to the left and a passage to the right that led even deeper.Without hesitation, I entered the small room to the left. The\u300eScroll of Appraisal\u300fshould be around the back right corner of this room, covered in dirt. But when I entered, there was a pile of random stuff piled up on the floor.There were copper and silver coins, rusty daggers, bags containing random things, and even a stack of wooden boxes.\u2018So that\u2019s what this was!\u2019This must have been the room where the goblins hoarded their treasures. I tried opening a box to check inside but\u2014*Creeak*My blood ran cold when I heard footsteps rushing towards the room. I tried to hide in the corner as fast as I could, just as a group of goblins entered the room.\u2018Oh no! did they see me?\u2019\u201cGiu giu giu.\u201dThe goblin game into the room making some sort of weird, disgusting sound. It sniffed and rummaged around the room as if it were looking for something.\u2018Please don\u2019t notice me!\u2019 I prayed as my heart beat wildly in my chest.I tried to calm myself and held my breath so I wouldn\u2019t make any noise.The goblin passed just by where I was and I was hit with a strong urge to vomit as its animalistic smell entered my nose, but I did my best to hold it in. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s really bad but it\u2019s still a lot better than the sewers.\u30fbThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u30fb\"\"\u30fbHow much time had passed? It felt like an eternity, but the goblins finally left.\u2018Thank goodness.\u2019 We seemed to have gotten through unscathed.I try to look around for the scroll again. I slowly open each box and checked inside but there was nothing. I couldn\u2019t find it!\u2018Where was it?\u2019I checked inside the scattered bags, but I couldn\u2019t find anything resembling a scroll. I tried moving the boxes as quietly as I could but there still wasn\u2019t anything behind them.\u2018Did the setting change because I got the\u300eScroll of Concealment\u300f?\u2019No, it was still too early to give up. I know the scroll was supposed to be covered in dirt, so maybe it was somewhere in the ground.I moved the box above where I thought the scroll should have been and checked underneath it.\u2018There it is!\u2019 Below it was something that looked like a scroll buried in the dirt. When I dusted the dirt off and checked the scroll\u2019s contents, sure enough, the symbol for \u201cAppraisal\u201d was written on it.I hastily tucked the scroll into my bag and turned towards the entrance. I\u2019m tempted to just run out of the room and to the entrance, but I can\u2019t do that. I need to be cautious until the end.I did what I did before. When goblins passed by, I hugged the wall and held my breath. My entire life was depending on\u3010Concealment\u3011to work.\u2018It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay, calm down.\u2019I mustered up the courage in my heart to push down my fears and continue out of the ruins.\u2018Was this corridor always this long?\u2019 I thought creeping through, until I finally managed to escape the ruins.I checked my surroundings to make sure there weren\u2019t any goblins nearby then I retraced my steps back to town. I was about to just break into a sprint but I couldn\u2019t let my guard down. It would really suck if I was found by demons now.Yeah, it\u2019s an adventure through and through until you get back home.Just as I thought that, the trees finally give way to open fields and the walls of the town comes into view.\u2018I can\u2019t believe I made it out alive!\u2019After making sure I was reasonably safe, I immediately open the \u300eScroll of Appraisal\u300fand placed it on the ground and put my right hand on it.There was a bright flash, then the scroll suddenly disappeared just like the \u300eScroll of Concealment\u300f.I checked my status card.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Name: Allen.Rank: GAge: 8Blessings:Skills: [Concealment] [Appraisal]Place of residence: LurdenMoney: 3,911\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u201cHell yeah!\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but say that aloud. I was kind of embarrassed, but there wasn\u2019t anyone around to hear me, anyway.I\u2019m was pretty sure I was safe, but you never know, so I hurriedly went back into town. Anyway, I still had to work for the guild. I can\u2019t skip out on that.And that was the story of how I got \u3010Appraisal\u3011.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Like usual, I came to the guild today to do some more sewer cleaning, but there was definitely more activity in the guild today compared to usual.\u201cUncle, what\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked the old man at the reception desk.\u201cOh, why if it isn\u2019t Allen.\u201d He said \u201cApparently they found a goblin\u2019s nest in the ruins northeast of here.\u201dOh huh, it seems like they already found the goblins.\u201cYou see; goblins are a species that rapidly increases in numbers. So if we left them alone, they\u2019d start to cause bigger problems, so the guild decided to form a subjugation party. And if we found the goblin\u2019s hoard, we\u2019d also make a decent profit.\u2018Was that why there were no goblins in the game?\u2019 Maybe in the game\u2019s scenario, the scroll was the only thing left unfound, so Amy got it many years later.\u201cWell, it\u2019s still a bit too early for you to join, kid.\u201d\u201cYeah, I know.\u201dAnyway, that place didn\u2019t concern me anymore. I was more than satisfied with getting the\u3010Appraisal\u3011skill.Speaking of which, I also hid the\u3010Appraisal\u3011skill since it would be really suspicious if the number of skills on an 8-year-old\u2019s guild card suddenly increased.Now, for my next goal, I needed money. Specifically, I needed to make 15 million cents.\u2018Why does he need that much money?\u2019 you might ask. Well, to enlighten you, it\u2019s so I could buy another extremely broken skill called using the\u300eScroll of Alchemy\u300f. This thing was completely broken, but as for explaining why\u2026 I\u2019ll leave that for another day.To begin with,\u300eScroll of Alchemy\u300fis a so-called premium item that can only be bought by paying for it, and can be bought at a suspicious store called the Lurden Store. By the way, this shop was where you bought premium items in the game. You can buy all types premium items, from the\u300eScroll of Alchemy\u300fto magic stones, at this store.And the\u300eScroll of Alchemy\u300fwas priced at an amazing 13 million cents! The price changed depending on how far you were into the game, but the highest price I paid was 15 million cents.I just couldn\u2019t beat the reverse harem route, so I gave up and cried rivers of blood as I said goodbye to my beloved \u00a510,000 friends to exchange for cents so I could get something more important! CG Pictures of\u2026 pretty\u2026 boys.No\u2026 I\u2019m remembering it again. *hic*Well, anyway, the key to my plan is this\u3010Alchemy\u3011skill. Using this cheat skill, I could overcome the future scenario.In order to do that, the first thing I need is money. I have to get more and more money!After finishing the guild chores in the morning, I changed into the best clothes I could find and went to the area where the traveling merchants set up their stalls.In the game, this district is where you came to date your favorite character, and if you raised a flag, you\u2019d get an exotic accessory or something as a gift, but today I\u2019m not looking for accessories or dates, I\u2019m looking for bargains.Right now I only have a little over 5,000 cents in my pocket, but I\u2019m looking for a something cheap that I can buy with this.I didn\u2019t have any magic stones yet, so it\u2019s not the completely overpowered\u3010Appraise\u3011skill, but it was still great to be able to figure out exactly what I saw and how much it was worth.I took a quick look at the cheap accessory shops.Some accessories were selling for as little as 1,000 cents!And then my eye was caught by a pair of dirty earrings in the 2,000 cent section.\u3010Appraisal\u3011\u2500\u2500Name: Earrings of StrengthEffect: The power of the wearer of these earrings is increased slightly.Grade: RarePrice: 300,000 cents\u2500\u2500\u201cUncle, these earrings\u2026\u201d\u201cOh those ones? Yeah, those won\u2019t do, there\u2019s only one of them after all. You\u2019ve got to give a girl a proper one or else she\u2019ll hate you, okay?\u201d\u201cO-oh. No, I\u2019m just asking about the earing\u201d\u2018I mean, in the first place, I\u2019m just 8 dude. What are you expecting me to do?\u2019\u201cOh, so that\u2019s what you wanted. This was sold by the wife of a merchant I used to do business with to get out of debt. Well, rather than that, tell me more about the girl you\u2019re giving these earrings to.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what this is for, but I\u2019d like these earrings please.\u201cHuh? Okay, sure! That\u2019ll be 2,000 cents.\u201d\u201cCan I pay using the guild card?\u201d\u201cNo problem!\u201dI touch my guild card with his.\u300e You will pay 2,000 cents. Is that correct? \u300fA screen suddenly appeared in front of me, and I touched \u2018Yes\u2019. That completes the payment.I got a really good deal out of that. I\u2019d be satisfied if I could sell this thing for even half its price. I could probably do that if I sold it to some adventurer or shop that specializes in selling to them.While looking for more bargains, I came across a tattered and dirty glove for 1,000 cents.\u3010Appraisal\u3011\u2500\u2500Name: Fireproof GlovesDescription: Magical powers protect the wearer from flames. It is very hard to burn.Grade: RarePrice: 70,000 centsNote: Soiled, but washable.\u2500\u2500\u2018I see. So if I washed them, would the price increase?\u2019This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cMister, I\u2019ll take these gloves, please.\u201d\u201cSure! Will you be using them?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dI paid him 1,000 cents from my guild card.Not even 30 minutes have passed, but I\u2019ve already gotten some really good stuffWith a little over 2,000 cents, I went back home.When I got home, I washed the dirty gloves in the communal washroom. While I was there, I also did the laundry since it was still early in the day and the sun was still high.After around two hours of washing the dirty gloves and laundry, I hung them out to dry by the window. The dirt on the gloves was more stubborn than I thought so it was a pain to wash them, but with this weather they\u2019d be clean and dry by eveningAnd with the stubborn stains removed, the value of the fireproof gloves had risen to 100,000 cents.* * * * *.The next day, after finishing school, I came to the Adventurer\u2019s Guild with the goods I bought yesterday.\u201dOld man,\u201d\u201cHey, kid. So what will it be today? More chores?\u201d\u201cWell, yeah, but that\u2019s not all I came here for. I got some stuff I want to sell, could you check them out?\u201d\u201cOho. Well, let\u2019s see them.\u201dI decided to talk to the usual old man at the reception desk about it. This old man was actually a former adventurer who got injured and retired to become an employee of the guild. It was a bit late now, but apparently his name was Rudolph.Apparently I had started getting attention as the only kid who kept cleaning the ditches and sewers. The other kids couldn\u2019t stand the smelly, disgusting, and difficult job so they quickly gave up.\u2018Yep. The job kinda sucks. I know how you guys felt\u2019But that\u2019s why I think the receptionist old man and the other older guild members who like me so much, since I had the guts to keep doing it, won\u2019t take advantage of me.\u201dI want to sell this\u300eEarring of Power\u300fand \u300eGloves of Fire-Protection\u300f\u201d\u201cWhat? Where did you get such a treasure?\u201d\u201cI bought it at the market for 3,000 cents.\u201dHearing this, the old man looks at me with a slightly pitying look.\u201cOh. I hope it\u2019s not a fake. Let me see.\u201dThat was definitely a normal reaction. Even I\u2019d feel suspicious if I heard that story.I handed him the items.And at that moment, the old man\u2019s expression changed.\u201cHey kid, I\u2019m going to go into the back to examine this in more detail so just wait a bit here.\u201dThe old man ran to the back room of the counter with the items.\"\"I could hear the old man and someone else talking in the back room. Every now and then, you can hear a surprised voice saying, \u201cWhat!?\u201dAnd after a while, the old man came back.\u201cKid, if you just sell this in the streets, there\u2019s a possibility that dangerous people would come and target you. Would you mind selling it to the guild at a fair price?\u201d\u201cSure!\u201d\u201cThen, we\u2019ll buy the earrings for 250,000 and the gloves for 60,000 for a total of 310,000 cents. They glove are in slightly bad condition. If they were good as new, you could sell them for 500,000. Sorry, about that.\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve never seen so much money in my life before.\u201dFor now, it would be best to agree. We could still get a lot more money in the future, so let\u2019s take a loss to day to turn a profit tomorrow.\u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll transfer the money to your guild card.\u201dThen the old man processed the transaction.\u201cListen here, you just got lucky this time. If you get carried away, you\u2019ll get scammed or even worse, okay?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThis old man is really kind.After this, I cleaned the ditches for the guild and went home.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Could it be that you want to be an adventurer in the future?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet, but I want to do something to help my mother out! In order to do that I need to be strong. Old man, you were an adventurer, so you must be strong, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. As a man, you can\u2019t protect a woman unless you\u2019re strong\u201dThe old man had a slightly distant look in his eyes and\u2026 did I imagine a tinge of regret in his voice?\u201cSure, kid. I\u2019ll train you once my shift is over.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201dAnd this is how I started learning swordsmanship from the old man.Yes, this was the reason why I continued to do chores for the guild even though I could earn way more money by trading.Originally, I was planning to learn it for self-defense, but it became even more important when I found out that it was necessary for the royal academy\u2019s entrance exam.In order to take the entrance examination, a commoner needed to pay the entrance examination fee, admission fee, and school donations for a total of about 10 million cents. In addition, the tuition fee for two years is about 10 million cents, all of which must be paid in advance.In addition, they had to pass the exams in the department you were studying, magic and, in the case of men, swordsmanship. Of course, if you fail the exam, you\u2019ll lose all the money you paid.Well, the bottom line is that no one but the richest are allowed into the academy. But still, I\u2019m going to walk through those gates with pride and get enrolled into the school.Because that\u2019s an absolute must in order to change the future scenario.******\u201cAll right, then, kid. I have something to tell you first.\u201dAs soon as we arrived at the guild\u2019s training room, the old man cut us off. The atmosphere is different from the usual jovial old man, and I can\u2019t help but straighten my posture.\u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea to think that you\u2019ve become strong even if you\u2019ve got a weapon. You can only become powerful when you master the weapon. For example, if there was the strongest magic sword that could cut anything, would you say that you became stronger if you held it?\u201dI shook my head.The old man was right.I\u2019ve always only been thinking about using my overpowered skills, but take that away from me, then I was just a weakling.It\u2019s a sobering thought.\u201cRemember this. The No matter how strong of a weapon you have, the one using the weapon is you yourself. Don\u2019t just wave it around, but use it well. And for that reason, you train with it. Only once you\u2019ve mastered the weapon can you say that you\u2019ve become stronger.\u201d\"\"\u201cOkay! I mean, Yes, teacher!\u201dI start talking to him more respectfully.\u201cGood. Well for now, imagine you\u2019re fighting with an enemy\u201d\u201cYes, teacher!\u201dI tried swinging the sword he lent me, but swinging a meter-long wooden sword around was really difficult. It felt like it was going to fly out of my hands.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. Hold the sword properly! Don\u2019t dangle your torso!\u201dThe relentless criticisms come flying in. I tried desperately to respond to them, but I couldn\u2019t handle the wooden sword good enough.\u201cOi! Hold it firmly! Give more weight to your slashes! No, not like that!\u201d\u201cYes, teacher!\u201dIt was only for a few minutes, but I was already drenched in sweat and my hands were shaking.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cNext! Focus on your waist! Do it 100 times\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dI did my best to try and remember how to swing a sword from the time I did kendo in my previous life, but I could only manage a pathetic swing.After 100 swings, my arms were completely shaking and I could barely move them.\u201cGood, you did a good job. Now swing down diagonal from the top right corner, then swing up from the bottom left corner 100 times each.\u201cGuh\u2014 Okay!\u201dIt was hard but they wouldn\u2019t let me take a break at all.With that said, I grit my teeth and did it. I couldn\u2019t just pathetically give up even though I was the one who asked for this.And so I continuously swung my sword.In the meantime, my arm started to continuously suffer cramps. I don\u2019t know how many times I tried to shake them off.\u201dOkay, that\u2019s a hundred times. Good job\u201dI-I did it\u2026!\u201cOkay, next! Swing down diagonal from the top left corner, then swing up from the bottom right corner 100 times each.\u201cNooooooo!\u201dThis demon. I didn\u2019t expect him to go this far on day one.What\u2019s going on? You can\u2019t protect what you want to protect by giving up! If you\u2019re a man, show some guts!I got psyched up after he said that. If I can\u2019t even do something at this level\u2026 I won\u2019t be able to save anyone!\u201dYes, teacher!\u201dI grasped the wooden sword with my trembling arms and started swinging the sword.Yeah, this is no big deal.If I don\u2019t do my best here, me, my mother, and everyone here will end up getting trampled by the Imperial Army and Anastasia will end up with a disastrous fate.After this we did 100 more side slashes from either side. Then we went back to the beginning for another set of swings.When it was all over, I collapsed on the training ground.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get stronger like this! At this rate you can\u2019t even beat a horned rabbit!\u201d\u201cY-yes\u2026\u201dAll right, that\u2019s it for today. There\u2019s a shower in the back, get cleaned up and go home. We\u2019ll do it again tomorrow.\u201cThank you very much!\u201dThe first time I trained in swordsmanship was a major setback for me, and a major obstacle to overcome\u2026Like hell, I\u2019d lose to this!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I spent my days like this, until finally, I became 11-years-old.Then one day, my guild card savings finally reached 15 million cents.With this amount saved, I headed to the hidden Lurden Store. By this point, I had already found out where the store was located.From the Guild, I cut through the downtown area on Central Avenue and then walked through the residential area towards the Academy. Then there is a small shopping street, and when you enter the alleyway, you will find a suspicious looking spot.A dark staircase leading to the basement in the alley behind that district, this is the entrance to the Lurden Store.Of course, I didn\u2019t worry about having any problems with suspicious people since I was using\u3010Concealment\u3011.The Lurden Store only opened for two hours, from 5pm to 7pm.I arrived at the entrance at exactly 5pm.Suspicious.That was what I first thought when I saw the entranceIn a secluded back alley where you could barely see, there was a staircase off to the far side, hidden from the main streets. There was not enough light to show you what was inside. \u2018There couldn\u2019t be a shop here\u2019 is what most people would think.It was a really unsettling feeling.But if I didn\u2019t proceed, I wouldn\u2019t get anything, so I go onwards, down the stairs, and into the darkness.The passage didn\u2019t lead straight down. There were two times when the stairs levelled off to a landing, and when I continued, there was a door.\u2018The Lurden Store.\u2019That\u2019s what was written on the sign on the door, but it didn\u2019t seem like they were welcoming visitors.I deactivate\u3010Concealment\u3011and knock on the door.After a bit, I heard an old woman\u2019s voice from the inside.\u201dWho is it?\u201dI use the [Appraisal] skill on the door. To enter the Lurden Store, I needed a code that changed every day. If I didn\u2019t answer the correct code, I wouldn\u2019t be able to enter. In the game, I never had to do anything to go in so I wasn\u2019t really curious. But in reality, it\u2019s pretty annoying, huh?I answer back the exact words the I got from the\u3010Appraisal\u3011skill.\u201dA rabbit jumped in the east forest today. Tomorrow we\u2019ll move south, but before that I want to make a meal of it.\u201d*Gacha*And with that, the door opened and I entered. In it, was the same Lurden Store that you saw in game.The small six-mat shop was crammed with questionable items. Skeletons, lizard tails, books, dried flowers and plants, all of which I had no idea what they were used for.And a wrinkled old woman sat at the back counter.\u201cWelcome. What can I do for you?\u201d\u201cI want the \u300eScroll of Alchemy\u300f.\u201dThe old woman\u2019s eyebrows twitch. Then she lets out a muffled laugh.\u201cGood. I like you, how about 14 million for it?\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cThen, please wait while I get it.\u201dThe old woman grinned as she walked to the back of the store.And after a while, she returned with a scroll and few small stones.\u201dThis one is the\u300eScroll of Alchemy\u300fand these ones are magic stones from goblins. I\u2019ll give you three as a service.\u201dI immediately used my \u3010Appraisal\u3011 skill to appraise the scroll.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Name: Just a scroll.Description: a scroll labeled alchemy. It can be used for a variety of purposes, such as memo taking and calligraphy.Grade: CommonPrice: 1,000 cents\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500I clicked my tongue and returned the scroll.\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me. Do you have the scroll or not?\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgThe old woman then gave him a surprised look and then grinned.\u201cYou pass. You have a good eye, kid, here\u2019s the real one.\u201dWith that, she took a scroll out from under the counter.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Name: Scroll of AlchemyDescription: a scroll that allows you to learn the [Alchemy] skill. Once used, it disappears.Grade: Epic.Price: 13,000,000 cents\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500This time it seemed to be the real thing. But just in case, I also used\u3010Appraisal\u3011on the magic stones.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Name: Goblin Magic Stone (Large)Description: the magical stone of a mature goblinGrade: UncommonPrice: 30,000 cents\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Okay, this time it\u2019s the real thing. The scroll\u2019s price is a bit high, which is annoying, but it\u2019s still within budget. Let\u2019s go with this.\u201cAll right, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll pay for it with the guild card.\u201dSo I pay with my guild card and receive a scroll and the magic stones.I unfold the scroll on the shop counter and put my right hand on it.The scroll glows brightly for a moment, and then disappears in the next.I check the status from my guild card.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Name: Allen.Rank: GAge: 11Blessing:Skills:\u3010Concealment\u3011\u3010Appraisal\u3011\u3010Alchemy\u3011.Place of residence: LurdenCash on hand: 1,028,005\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u201cThat was definitely the\u300eScroll of Alchemy\u300f.\u201dI confirmed it once again and headed out of the store\u201cCome again soon.\u201dThe old woman laughed mysteriously as she said waved goodbye.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I have memories of my past life, and so I graduated from elementary school when I was 9 years old.And today is the graduation exam of my junior high school. Many children don\u2019t attend this level of school, since it\u2019s basically a preparation for entering a higher school. They are taught the classic arts, advanced arithmetic, the names and coats of arms of royalty and aristocrats, the specialties of each territory, international affairs, and the etiquette of politicians, all of which are necessary to get involved in politics.However, it\u2019s basically memorization and not much in the way of comprehension so if you study hard enough, you should be able to get a perfect score at this level.Besides, the science content that everyone dislikes is only on the level of arithmetic and isn\u2019t difficult at all. Even fractions were called \u201cadvanced calculations\u201d, so it wasn\u2019t hard if you were educated in the modern world.Furthermore, I even had the cheat called the \u201cappraisal\u201d skill, so there was no way I could fail.I didn\u2019t really cheat, though.I went into the small room and took a seat, then the teacher came over and handed me the test sheet.\u201dGood luck, Allen-kun. Do your best.\u201dIt seemed like I was the very first person to have skipped grades and graduated this young in the history of the school, so they were regarding me as a boy genius. But to be honest, I think that even most Japanese elementary school students can do this much.\u201cAnd so, you have 3 hours to finish the test. Begin.\u201dAt the teacher\u2019s signal, I start answering the questions. It\u2019s the same no matter which one you start with, so filled in the answers from the top of the first page.Q: What is the full name of His Majesty the King?Answer: Bartille Manfred von CentrarenQ: What is the full name of the current Crown Prince?Answer: Karlheinz Bartille von CentrarenQ: Name all three major dukes.Answer: the Innoburg Family, the Ramslett Family, and the Schlestein Family.It was just simple rote memorization.Q: Calculate 22.3 \u00d7 11.8Answer: 263.14Show 3/4 as a decimal.Answer: 0.75Well, any Japanese person could do this.It took me a while to learn geography, but I\u2019ve managed to study it perfectly.Which territory was the largest producer of wheat in the last fiscal year?Answer: The Duke of RamslettQ: Which territory produced the most iron ore in the last fiscal year?Answer: The Marquis of WimletThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgWell, something like that. Once you read it, it was pretty easy to memorize these facts. There were probably more things you could learn in a standard Japanese elementary social studies class.And so, like that, I finished answering everything in about an hour and a half.\u201cTeacher, I\u2019m done.\u201d\u201cGood work, Allen, you did a really good job. I\u2019ll let you know the results in a week.\u201dWith that, the teacher left. If you just want to graduate, you can just score 60 points in each subject, so it\u2019s not a problem.But I was aiming for a score of 90 or higher in all subjects. With this, I could be recommended to a high school and exempted from the departmental exams.Though it really was a strange system. Even if you had already graduated from skipping grades, you still had to be 15-years-old to attend high school.This is my guess, but I think that the system of skipping grades is designed to make it easier for ordinary people to get a job, and to get talented people out into the world faster.In contrast, high schools are for the aristocracy and the rich, so I think they don\u2019t expect some students to skip a grade.But that system works in my favor. I still had 3 years before I entered high school, and in that time, I could move around as an adventurer in order to get a specific item. I also needed time to practice for the sword and magic entrance exams. I also needed time to get enough money to pay for the entrance exam fee and the tuition.******And a week later, I went up to school to see my teacher to hear the results.\u201cCongratulations, Allen! Perfect scores across the board! Even graduating at the age of 11 was already groundbreaking, but you\u2019ve also completed a feat no one else has done since the beginning of this kingdom\u2019s education system.\u201dIt felt like an exaggeration, but I won\u2019t say it doesn\u2019t make me happy. Of course, I never used the\u3010Appraisal\u3011skill, so even if the content was easy, I still felt proud.But I can\u2019t forget to express my gratitude.\u201dThank you. But owe all of it to you, the teachers who taught me.And so I expressed my gratitude and a slight smile appeared on their face.\u201dWell, Allen, your grades are such that I can recommend your admission to the High School without a problem. What would you like to do?\u201d\u201cPlease give me a recommendation. I\u2019ll do my best to prepare until I\u2019m 15.\u201d\u201cI was hoping you would say that. Then I\u2019ll submit my recommendation to my superiors. How should I contact you?\u201d\u201cPlease go to the Adventurer\u2019s Guild. My mother is often away from home for work, so there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll miss each other.\u201d\u201cAll right. Then I will let you know the results through the Adventurer\u2019s Guild. Congratulations on your graduation, Allen!\u201dThe teacher started to celebrate and the next thing I knew there was already a party with the other teachers.\u201cThank you, teacher! I\u2019m going to do my best to enroll and thrive at the academy.\u201dThus, I skipped all the stages up to middle school and graduated.Shortly thereafter, the Adventurer\u2019s Guild was notified that I would be allowed to participate in the high school entrance exam and that I would be exempt from the written exam.There was only a bit more than three years left before I would need to step on the game stage. Just you wait, I\u2019ll definitely change the future!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I was wondering why I couldn\u2019t see them before, but I heard it was specifically made so that the G-ranked children couldn\u2019t see them.In addition, the simple status screen was an intentional design of the game. It might have been intended to be that way in order to streamline this section of the game, but ironically it made it harder to play since you couldn\u2019t accurately tell your own strengths.\u201cSo you\u2019re finally F-ranked, kid? We\u2019re going to be short on hands to clean the sewers.\u201d\u201cOh! Congratulations, Allen!\u201d\u201cYou did it, kid!\u201dSince teacher said it out loud, the adventurers around me started congratulating me too. In the past four years, I\u2019ve become quite close with the people of the guild.\u201dOh, so you\u2019re finally F-rank, aren\u2019t you? Congratulations.\u201d\u201cThanks, Monica.\u201dMonica, a waitress at the tavern attached to the guild, congratulated me from the side. She hugged me tightly as usual. Monica was a pretty woman with large breasts, but she\u2019s always been a bit too touchy for my tastes. She was hugging me and squeezing my face against her chest, which was both painful and delightful.Well, I was also a man, so it wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201cHa-ha. You\u2019ll always be Monica\u2019s favorite little brother.\u201dAnd then Teacher and our seniors would laugh off the side. This is how it usually wasI managed to escape Monica\u2019s hug attack, and said back.\u201cTeacher and everyone! Please stop calling me a kid! I\u2019m already 12 years old, you know.\u201d\u201cHaha! Anyone who can\u2019t even beat me with my injury is still just a kid.\u201dThe surrounding adventurers seemed to agree as they laughed.\u201cAh, damn it\u2026\u201dYeah. To this day, I still haven\u2019t beaten Teacher.\u201dBut not many people can do that without the blessing of a swordsman or knight.\u201dThe master would comfort me by saying that, but the difference between having blessings and not having blessings was still quite large.Blessings were like a blessing given by God, which allows you to accelerate your mastery of certain skills or use special abilities.In the game, the heroine, Amy, had the blessing of\u3010Healing Magic\u3011, learned more and more recovery magic, and the crown prince, who had the two blessings of \u3010Flame Magic\u3011 and \u3010Hero\u3011, showed the strength of a hero, using both magic and swordsmanship to manipulate flames, as well as the ability to inspire his friends and buff them in a difficult situation.Teacher had received the blessing of the\u3010Swordsman\u3011, so his level of skill is quite high when it comes to swords.And then, on the other hand, was me without any blessings.It wasn\u2019t like I was cursed by the gods or anything, almost all the commoners didn\u2019t have any blessings.And so, I need to do something about this handicap before I entered High School. To do that, there were a few places we could go.But definitely the most important one among them is the Valley of the Flying Dragon. There is an item called the \u2018Book of the Wind God\u2019 there, and by using it, you could acquire the\u3010Wind Magic\u3011blessing afterwards.This was the only item in the game that gave you a blessing, so this was a must-have.If I couldn\u2019t get it, there was a possibility that I couldn\u2019t enter the Academy because I\u2019d fail in the magical aptitude test. For that reason, I need to raise my adventurer rank to E as fast as I can and move to another city.I\u2019ve got a lot of points in my four years of doing chores, so I\u2019ll be able to move up to E rank as soon as I complete an F-rank request, collecting permanent medicinal plants and defeating horned rabbits.\u201cSo now, I\u2019m going to go collect medicinal herbs and hunt horned rabbits.\u201d\u201cOh, go ahead. It\u2019s your first time out of town, right? Take care of yourself.\u201d\u201cOkay! I\u2019ll be going!\u201dTeacher sent me off like that, but of course, he didn\u2019t know it wasn\u2019t my first time.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgDefinitely no one would believe me if I had told them that the first time I went outside was when I was 8-years-old and sneaked out of town to steal the\u300eScroll of Appraisal\u300ffrom the goblin\u2019s dungeon.******Well, I\u2019ve come out of the town and into the forest, but still, there aren\u2019t any medicinal plants growing nearby. It seemed like all the herbs had already been harvested. So I decided to go to the north-eastern ruins where the goblins used to live. If I go in that direction, the horned rabbits will probably be there too.So I used my \u3010Covert\u3011 skill as usual to erase my presence and walked through the forest.Every once in a while I would see a horned rabbit, but the most important part, the medicinal herbs, were nowhere to be found. I could hunt them down, but the blood from hunting horned rabbits could attract unwanted attention so if possible, I\u2019d like to collect the herbs first.I walked further into the forest, and then I reached the front of the ruins.The goblins that were using this as a base had long since been defeated by the adventurers, so there was none of them here.As I recall, in the game, this was supposed to be the home of the blue slime and there was a rare medicinal herb growing in the back. The goblins being here was unexpected, but the world should still more or less follow the game\u2019s setting.\u2018Okay, let\u2019s go.\u2019I walk through the ruins. It was still bright enough inside thanks to the glowing moss, so thankfully there was no need for a torch.When I reached the end of the familiar corridor, I checked out the room to the left again. This was where the goblins kept their treasure, but now there wasn\u2019t anything here.Of course, not even the\u300eScroll of Appraisal\u300fin the game was here since, well, I took it, you know?I check the opposite corner of this room and I found a silver coin, or 10,000 cents.In the game, the amount of money dropped varies depending on the game mode: 100,000 cents in easy mode, 10,000 cents in normal mode, and nothing in hard mode.In other words, the world seems to be around the normal mode difficulty. I picked up the silver coin and headed straight for the depths of the ruins.And so I went to the second level. There was finally the occasional blue slime, but I didn\u2019t take them on. I couldn\u2019t just slash them with a sword since I needed to crush their nucleus or else they regenerated, so we were a pretty bad match.And so, I relied on the\u3010Concealment\u3011skill to advance to the end of the second floor where I found the medicinal herb I was looking for.This ruins were already explored and there were no treasure chests or anything else. That\u2019s why there\u2019s no need to go to the deepest parts, and since the goblin\u2019s hoard wasn\u2019t here anymore, there\u2019s nothing of value except for the herbs. By the way, the blue slimes living here weren\u2019t rare at all, since you could easily find them in dark and damp places.So, after collecting all the medicinal herbs I left the ruins, I started walking back to the town.On the way, I saw a lone horned rabbit eating grass, so I sneaked up on it with my\u3010Concealment\u3011skill and killed it with a single thrust with the sword I brought.As expected it was really easy doing it like that. I don\u2019t want to, but I feel like I could be a really good assassin.You could sell the horned rabbits\u2019 horns, meat and fur, so I quickly bled them out and dismantled their parts. I had helped do this at the guild during the time I was a G-rank so I can more or less dismantle the animals living around here.I only collected the magic stones and asked the guild to take back the rest of the materials. There were many uses for the magical stones in the future, so having more definitely wasn\u2019t a bad thing.After assassinating two more horned rabbits on my way back to town, I returned to the guild and delivered the materials I had collected.\u201cGood job, kid! You did good. With this you\u2019re one of the fastest ever to rise up to E-rank.\"\"\u201cThank you!\u201dAnd so this was how I rose to E-rank, the same day I became F-ranked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I had finally arrived at Frissen, the village closest to the Valley of the Flying Dragons. This place was, ironically, not inhabited by dragons, but by wyverns.To be precise, wyverns aren\u2019t dragons, but they look the part, which is why they called it the Valley of the Flying Dragons anyway.And the reason I came here was, of course, to get to the Temple of the Wind and obtain the\u300eBook of the Wind God\u300fthat was supposed to be enshrined there.And the strategy was also, of course, to use\u3010Concealment\u3011and sneak in as usual. This is what they call \u2018simple is best\u2019.\u2018I mean hey, it\u2019s worked so far.\u2019In the game, you could come here in the summer of your sophomore year to try and beat it. But I distinctly remember that the difficulty here was incredibly high, and that some of the events were clearly in bad taste.The event went like this: First you\u2019d have to enter the valley and kill over 100 wyverns, and then you\u2019d have to defeat the black wyvern lord that lead them to get to the entrance of the temple.After a quick dialogue segment, you\u2019d enter the temple where you\u2019d find the wyvern lord\u2019s nest.In the nest, there was a white wyvern lord with a ribbon around its tail and their children. Then it gets revealed that they were the wife and children of the wyvern lord that you had just beaten, and so they come at you furious that you just killed their husband and father.Amy tried to persuade them, but naturally, she fails and it then goes to the battle segment. After defeating the white wyvern lord and their children, she finally gets the\u300eBook of the Wind God\u300fAmy does regret the fact that she couldn\u2019t persuade the white wyvern lord, but as she\u2019s doing this, the dude you were aiming to date then comforts her and they share a moment together and increase their affection.To be honest, considering they just broke into the black wyvern lord\u2019s nest, killed him and his family, and stole their stuff, I think it was just a complete robbery. And even in the real world, while I was looking at some forums about this, I don\u2019t think I was the only one who thought Amy\u2019s persuasion was hollow and insincere.Now, game aside, I set off with a week\u2019s worth of food. It\u2019s two days to go one way from Frissen to the Valley of the Flying Dragon by mountain road, but I decided to take a little extra just in case. But if I couldn\u2019t reach the valley in two days, I decided to turn back.There wasn\u2019t any reason for me to push myself yet.So I used\u3010Concealment\u3011as usual to continue on the mountain path. It\u2019s not just the familiar horned rabbits in the royal capital, but also ferocious demons such as Big Boa, Blood Deer and Great Bear.I\u2019m kind of curious about them, but I want to avoid unnecessary battles. Aiming for the mountain where I was headed, I proceeded carefully so as to not suddenly cut off\u3010Concealment\u3011.And in the evening of the second day after leaving Frissen, I arrived at the Valley of the Flying Dragon.Indeed, it was a sight to behold. There were huge winged lizards in the sky. If I saw them without any prior knowledge, I\u2019d definitely think they were dragons, too. But in reality, they were a sub-dragon species that weren\u2019t as strong as true dragons. The difference between a dragon species and a sub-dragon species is simple: a dragon species has a breath and roar attack, while a sub-dragon species does not. I\u2019ve heard that the difference between having a long range breath attack and a roar that grants a substantial debuff, was quite large, and the difficulty of defeating them is was completely different.Well, since it was already getting dark, I\u2019m wasn\u2019t going to enter the valley today and camped in the valley. And even in this camp, the \u3010Alchemy\u3011 skill is playing a big role.In the game, it\u2019s mainly used to make weapons and armor, potions, and to strengthen weapons using magic stones. However, towards the end of the game, you were able to use it as an overpowered skill to build carriages and huge forts. You were even be able to make a magical tool to temporarily weaken Anastasia, who had fallen into darkness as the final boss of the game.Now, the ability to build huge forts means that it\u2019s easy to build small, half-basement campsites. We can dig down into the ground in the shade of the trees to avoid disturbing the wyverns and make a ceiling with dirt.All we had to do was drill a hole in the ground to prevent myself from suffocating, make a place for the fire, build a chimney to let the smoke and carbon dioxide escape, and we were done.This way, I wouldn\u2019t be attacked so easily because I dug a hole and almost completely burried it.Well then, I was alone, but good night anyway.******The next morning, after dismantling the encampment after making sure there was nothing around, I headed towards the Temple of the Wind.Of course, I used my\u3010Concealment\u3011skill and brazenly walked in.For some reason, there was a single path that conveniently went down to the bottom of the cliff, and so I just went down it. In the game, the wyverns incessantly attacked me and held me down, but fortunately, there wasn\u2019t a single wyvern that noticed me.After 30 minutes of descending to the bottom of the valley, we climbed the stairs to the Temple of the Wind. And when I reached the top of the stairs, I found a plaza where a black wyvern lord was curled up in the sun.He seemed to be sleeping very comfortably, so I slipped in carefully so as to not wake him up and stepped into the temple.Hm? There wasn\u2019t a white wyvern lord?Come to think of it, he had kids in the game, so maybe he wasn\u2019t married yet.Although I was quite curious as to how he found his wife, what mattered more was my safety, so this worked out in my favor.And so I continued onwards up to the altar where the Book of the Wind God was supposed to be enshrined in.I walked a bit further but\u2026\u2018What..?\u2019The book wasn\u2019t here.It\u2019s just like the time with the goblins. Was there an event that hadn\u2019t occured yet?While I was starting to panic, I felt a light tap on my shoulder.\u201cHey, human. You got a minute?\u201d\u2018Huh?\u2019 Bewildered, I looked around to try and see anyone else in the room.\u201cNo, no. I\u2019m talking to you. Even if you covered yourself up with\u3010Concealment\u3011, I can still see you.\u201d\u201c!?\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgIn my shock, I accidentally deactivated\u3010Concealment\u3011. But when I hurriedly tried to cast it again, someone stopped me.\u201dDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s safe here.\u201dAnd that\u2019s when I saw him. Standing beneath a halo of sunlight, before the altar, stood a stunningly handsome man with green hair and golden eyes.\u201cI am the God of the Wind and I have a little favor to ask.\u201dA man who called himself a god had appeared, but there\u2019s no doubt that he has form divine power judging by the way he appeared and the how he discovered the\u3010Concealment\u3011skill. If I didn\u2019t do as he wanted, he might kill me\u2026 As long as I couldn\u2019t use\u3010Concealment\u3011I had no hope of escape\u2026 What do I do?\u201cNo, no, I won\u2019t go that far. If you don\u2019t listen, you just won\u2019t get what you want.\u201dHuh? Could it be that he can read minds?\u201cYeah. I\u2019m a god. I can at least read human minds, and the skills humans use are just as ineffective.\u201d\u201cO-okay, God. What do you want me to do?\u201d\u201cGood. But first we have to wake up that damn lizard sleeping in front of the temple.\u201d\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u201cWhaaaa\u2013 wait a minute, God. If you do that\u2013\u201d\u2018The wyvern would definitely kill me.\u2019 I tried to stop him, but it was too late.The god who ran with tremendous momentum hit the wyvern lord with a good punch.With a comedic sounding \u2018whoosh\u2019 like the ones you could hear in cartoons, the wyvern lord was sent flying and crashed into a cliff on the far side of the valley. With his head stuck in the cliff, his body dangled lifelessly.\u2018Huh? Was that really okay? Didn\u2019t he just die?\u2019With that thought in mind, the god flew up to the wyvern lord, pulled its tail, and dragged it back to the plaza in front of the temple.It was a really surreal sight, seeing a flying man drag a lifeless dragon-looking thing across the sky.What a fearsome god. Should I pray to him or something?\u201dUm, God, what in the world are you\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, I just needed a little bit of help with this kid. Come on now, introduce yourself.\u201dAfter being told that, the Wyvern Road reluctantly turned its head towards me.Thank goodness. The wyvern lord seemed to be alive and well.\u201cI\u2019m.. uh. uh, well, uh. I-I\u2019m\u2026 my name is, uh, Je-Jerome. The, uh, uh, wyvern lord\u2026\u201dHis voice kept getting quieter and quieter until I could barely hear what he was saying at the end.\u201cI\u2019m Allen. Nice to meet you.\u201dFor now, I held out my right hand. Then the Wyvern Road, whose name is Jerome, ran behind god in a flash.Well\u2026 I mean, he tried to. I could still see him plain as day.\u201cCome on, shake his hand. Where are your manners?\u201dAfter he was told that, he shakily lifted his right leg up to me, but as expected, they were way too big. So I gripped the very end of his fingernails and tried to move them up and down lightly.\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d\"\"When I said that, as if his previous shy self was a lie, a smile bloomed on his face and his tail started shaking around.What are you\u2026 a dog..?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Let me show you.\u201dAs God said this, a screen appeared in front of me. In it was a lone white wyvern lord flying gracefully in the sky. It had a familiar ribbon wrapped around its tail.Oh, so this really was how it was.I entered the scenario too early. I\u2019m sure that if I hadn\u2019t come at this point, the God of Wind will have gotten bored and left the\u300eBook of the Wind God\u300fin this temple and returned to the divine realm.But Jerome will do his best to win Melissa anyway, and become a married couple. And when they had just become husband and wife, had a child, and were about to reach the peak of their happiness, was when Amy and the others came in and destroyed everything.\"\"Yeah, that\u2019s rough, buddy.\u201cHm? Allen, why do you think of the future as a fact? Well, that\u2019s okay, Allen, you\u2019ve already promised to help, so you can\u2019t wait for me to go away, okay?

That. Clear?\u201d\u201cH-hiiiii\u201d****.We got God to take us closer to where Melissa was resting her wings.\u201cOkay, you got this. First greet her like this: \u2018Hello. My name is Jerome. That\u2019s a nice and stylish ribbon. May I sit next to you?\u2019 And then you talk to her. Then while you\u2019re talking to her, randomly ask her about her hobbies and favorite food and whatnot, and then you compliment her on it and after awhile, ask her if she wants to go out with you sometime. Go on, you can do this.\u201dJerome flaps his huge body into the air and flies to Melissa.I watch Melissa from a distance with God.Jerome landed at Melissa\u2019s side and he shuffles on closer to her.Melissa raises her head and glances at Jerome.\u201cWho the hell are you? You want something?\u201d\u201cH-h-h-he\u2026\u201dMelissa made a face like she was looking at trash and then she just flew away.******\u201cAll right, so here\u2019s our next move. If you can\u2019t talk to her, then let\u2019s give her a gift. What\u2019s something wyvern girls like?\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah, uh, uh, uh, meat?\u201d\u201cAll right, let\u2019s go with that. Are you ready?\u201d\u201cY-y-yes!\u201dThen Jerome flew off into the distance.\"\"And so here I was with god, watching Melissa from a distance.After a while, Jerome, with blood all over his face, flew in with a huge worm in his mouth.As soon as Melissa saw Jerome, she let out a scream and flew away.******\u2018Okay, if you can\u2019t talk or give a gift, you\u2019ll have wow her with fashion. What do wyvern girls think looks cool?\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah, um, um, a crown of flowers?\u201d\u201cWell, if you say so. Let\u2019s go with that. Are you ready?\u201d\u201cY-y-yes!\u201dAnd so Jerome flew off into the distance.And so here I was with god, watching Melissa from a distance.After a while, some kind of huge clump of trees and grass comes flying by.When that strange object landed on Melissa\u2019s side, she let out a scream and flew away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I didn\u2019t think it was this bad.\u201dJerome was curled up in the corner fiddling with his claws. I wanted to tell him \u2018If you have the time to be lazing around like that, why don\u2019t you just try harder?\u2019 but stopped myself at the last second.\u201cWell, Allen, do you have any other plans?\u201d\u201cThe straightforward way to do it would be to just dress up and talk to them properly.\u201d\u201cOh, err\u2026 Umm\u2026 H-h-how do I do that..?\u201d\u201cHow would I know?

If you have a clear image of what you want to do, the skill will guide you on how to finish it.Then I put the Hornrabbit magic stone in the center of the magic circle.\u201dRefine!\u201dI could feel my magic power get drained into the magic stone. The magic circle flashed, and a large white tie appeared wrapped around Jerome\u2019s neck.The process left me completely exhausted and I fell to the ground panting.\u201dW-well, I guess it\u2019s something like this?\u201d\u201cOh, oh, thank you!\u201dJerome was so moved that he tried to shake hands, but I hurriedly avoided it.\u201cYou idiot!

Attacking a single girl with a group!\u201cGet away from Melissa!\u201dJerome charges at the wyverns that have gathered around Melissa and tries to shake them off one by one.Despite being outnumbered 1 to 30, Jerome was trying his best to beat the wyverns.\u201cI won\u2019t allow anyone to hurt Melissa!\u201dAnd so Jerome tried to bite down on another wyvern even when he started to droop down from the sky and was covered in wounds, he fought to protect Melissa.Meanwhile Melissa was there, her eyes glued onto Jerome\u2019s figure.Eventually, after barely fending off the wyverns, Jerome finally fell to the ground listless.With his body slamming onto the ground, a loud thud resounded out and dust rose to the air.\u201dGod!\u201d\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s go.\u201dAnd so god lifted me onto the collapsed Jerome\u2019s side.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cJerome!\u201dGradually, the dust cloud cleared. There, was the sight of Melissa supporting Jerome from under him.\u201cUgh\u2026 Huh? Me?\u201dI could hear Jerome\u2019s voice\u201cJerome, You\u2019re okay!\u201d\u201cAllen? I guess so\u2026 Huh!? Me-Me-Me-Melissa!?\u201dJerome, realizing that he was on top of Melissa, turned red and tried to jump away.But Melissa caught him with her tail, and wouldn\u2019t let it happen.\u201cSo your name is Jerome. Thanks for saving me. You know, you were kinda cool back there.\u201dMelissa lifts her head as she says this and gently kisses Jerome\u2019s cheek.Oh huh. It seems like I just completed God\u2019s request.I didn\u2019t do anything, though!?****\u201cAll right, then I will give you my blessing, Mr. Allen, as I promised.\u201dAs he said this, God put his hand on my head and I felt as if something had entered my body.\u201cIt is done. I\u2019ll give Jerome and Melissa a blessing when the time is right for them to get married. I hope to see you again then.\u201dWith that, god disappeared in a scatter of light, and with him gone, there was no\u300eBook of the Wind God\u300fleft behind.\u201dAh, ah, um. A-Allen. Thank you so much!\u201d\u201cNo, I really didn\u2019t do anything. It was all because of your hard work, Jerome.\u201d\u201cB-but, I don\u2019t think I could have gotten the courage to do it if it weren\u2019t for you!\u201d\u201cLike I said, It\u2019s fine. Oh, wait. How about this, 4 years from now, in the summer, I want you to take a trip away from here. There might be something bad that\u2019ll happen to you.\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, well, if you say so\u2026\u201d\u201cFufu. So, your name was Allen? I also want to thank you. For before, and for this cloth you gave Jerry for his wedding dress.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201dApparently, Melissa already had a nickname for Jerome.\u201cSo, when you really need our help, just once, We\u2019ll help you no matter what. How\u2019s that for our thanks?\u201d\u2018Hmm, yeah, I\u2019ll help you Allen!\u201d\u201cI think that\u2019s a pretty great deal! Thanks a lot!\u201d\u201cJerome, you better not make Melissa cry, alright?\u201d\u201cA-ah, th-that\u2019s.\u201d\u201cCome on, say it straight!\u201dMelissa smacked Jerome\u2019s head with her tail. She may have thought she was tapping him lightly, but the heavy thud made him shudder.\u201cI-I know. I will! Ah, Allen. Thank you! And see you later!\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll see you later!\u201dAfter this strange experience, I set out to go back to the village of Frissen.By the way, Jerome also gave me the extra magical stones that he got from the other wyvern\u2019s corpse. What a deal.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Moreover, even though I haven\u2019t done anything, my magic power had gone up two levels from F to D.I\u2019m not too sure about the\u3010Wind God\u3011 blessing, but if we\u2019re talking about a D level in magic power, If I recall correctly, I think even Markus only had around this much when they were condemning Anastasia at the academy. Ah, just in case you forgot, Markus was the son of the kingdom\u2019s court magician.Well, anyway, since it\u2019s a god\u2019s blessing, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s amazing. And thanks to the addition of the \u3010Wind Magic\u3011skill, I can now use the wind magic I wanted.With that said, I\u2019d like to move on to the next plan to change the future scenario. My next goal is to secure a means of transportation.You may be wondering what I\u2019m talking about, but I want you to think about it like this.The fastest means of transportation in this world is by horse.Even if you keep changing horses and ride all day, at best, you can only travel hundreds of kilometers a day.An ordinary horse-drawn carriage would only be able to travel a few dozen kilometers a day.But what if there was a way to travel at a speed of several hundred kilometers per hour in this world?Yeah, that\u2019s something I want to do.So, the goal of this mission is to create a glider. But rather than a normal glider, I want to make one powered by wind magic.To put it simply, a glider is like an airplane that is insanely light and can fly without an engine.I\u2019ve been an aeronautical engineer in my past life, and I know enough about the technical aspects of a plane so of course I can fly one.And so I started making a blueprint of the plane.The fuselage is cylindrical in shape but I changed it a bit so it could shoot out wind magic to propel itself. I also used a wyvern magic stone as a catalyst to activate the magic.I set up three wheels at the bottom so I could take off smoothly\u2026 And hopefully also land back down.I flattened the front part of the fuselage so I could operate the glider from there. I\u2019m planning on using my right hand to supply the engines with magic power, and use my left hand to manipulate magic to control the tail rudders.The airfoil shape of the main wings will be orthodox and streamlined.The material will be mainly wyvern bones membranes.Then, using the \u3010Alchemy\u3011 skill, I put the blueprint I made into a magic circle and gathered the necessary materials to refine the glider.But really, this \u3010Alchemy\u3011skill is so overpowered.In the game, Amy could quickly create a \u201ccomfortable carriage that doesn\u2019t shake\u201d, so I expected to be able to do something like this, but I didn\u2019t expect it could completely recreate a blueprint\u2019s design by using a magic circle this easily. I thought it was possible, but I still couldn\u2019t help but be surprised.Now, the magic circle is done. The shape of the glider, with the exception of the wind magic engine, is something that has been proven to fly in my memory in my previous life, so there should be no problem.So, I came to an open area some distance from the village.The grass is overgrown, so I use the wind magic I just learned to cut down the grass at once.\u201cMana, the root of all things, gather in my hands and be the wind that cuts down my enemies. Wind Cutter!\u201dBecause of the\u3010Wind Magic\u3011skill, the chant magically appeared in my head.After cutting down the grass, I used\u3010Alchemy\u3011to flatten the ground and make a 500-meter-long runway.Thanks to my magic power being raised to D, I didn\u2019t feel tired at all even after using this much. This was amazing!Now, when the runway is finished, I take out the magic circle I wrote on a piece of paper.Then, I placed two wyvern magic stones, a membrane and one femur to activate the magic circle.\u201dRefine!\u201dWhen I activated the skill, the magic circle started to emit light. The light gradually molded itself in the air and when the light disappeared, it created a glider just as the blueprint says.Thanks to my cheat skills, I hopped inside the cockpit and fastened my seatbelt.Then I grab the handle with my right hand and activate the wind magic engine.\u201cMana, the source of all things. Gather in my hands and become the wind.\u201d\u3010Wind Magic\u3011activates and the magic circle carved into the magic stone blows out a powerful gust of wind.*Fwoooooo*A tremendous gust of wind blows out of the engine and the glider begins to accelerate rapidly.\u201cUgh, I\u2019m going to throw up\u2026\u201dThe g-force was so intense that I felt like my body was being crushed.And yet, the next thing I knew was that the glider was flying through the air.\u201cWhoaa! It worked!\u201dThe glider was gaining altitude very quickly.The trees in the forest were getting smaller and smaller, and we were getting higher than even the mountains around us.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgThis feels good. I haven\u2019t been up in the sky in so long.Using my left hand, I used\u3010Alchemy\u3011 to make the horizontal tail rudder return to a level position, the glider balanced off to a stable flight.Since there was no such thing as a GPS, I flew towards the royal capital, Lurden, relying only on the street roads that looked like small lines drawn on the ground.This was definitely way faster than a carriage.And it felt really, really good. With me onboard, the glider went over city after city.\u201cOh, isn\u2019t that the castle of Lurden?\u201dI muttered to myself, pleased to see a small, familiar castle in the distance.The distance I had travelled by carriage for days had been returned to in just a few hours.Technology is also overpowered, huh?It was time to prepare for the landing, when I realized something important.\u201cWait, where am I supposed to land this thing?There were no seas or rivers big enough to make an emergency landing near Lurden. The streets weren\u2019t wide enough either, and there were people passing by the plains.Then I realized something even more important.\u2018Oh damn.\u2019\"\"I didn\u2019t even have a parachute.I flew around the area trying to find a suitable spot, and just when my mana was starting to run low, I found a lake deep within the northeast forest where the ruins were.You couldn\u2019t get to this area in the game, but the northeast forest was a pretty low-levelled area with only horned rabbits and, though rarely seen, goblins, so it shouldn\u2019t be too dangerous.\u2018Okay, let\u2019s make an emergency landing here.\u2019And so I circled around and gradually lost altitude. I had already stopped using magic so the engines were essentially off and I was just gliding.The glider was gradually losing speed and altitude.The lake was kind of elliptical in shape, so I adjusted my flight path to enter the lake from the longer side.\u201cDamn. I\u2019ve never done an emergency landing before, not even at training!\u201dI swore unintentionally, but this was all my mistake. Be that as it may, it would be really embarrassing to die here after focusing on the future scenario this much.I focused all my attention on controlling the glider and aimed to make the water a landing track.The glider skimmed over the trees and descended into the lake.The entry angle wasn\u2019t something I was used to, but I did my best to adjust the horizontal tail rudder. I also pushed against the force of the glider with my wind magic.I should have put flaps on the wings if this was going to happen. I could have slowed it down more!The glider landed on the water and a large splash of water burst out.But the lake wasn\u2019t long enough and the glider flew across the lake and off to the other side. The glider\u2019s tail bumped into the terrain causing the glider to point up.With a loud boom, the glider\u2019s belly crashed straight into a tree.Thankfully, the water had taken off a lot of the momentum and so the tree had, though violently, stopped the glider.I didn\u2019t get thrown out of the plane because of my seatbelt, but every single part of me hurt.It wasn\u2019t anything fatal, at least, but using this glider again was going to be impossible.As I was thinking that, the glider turned into something like fine sand and disappeared. Apparently, things made with the \u3010Alchemy\u3011 skill are like this when they break.\u201dAh, I failed.\u201dAfter muttering that, I used my\u3010Concealment\u3011skill to walk towards the town of Lurden.Although I had successfully flown with my glider, I had lost a lot of precious material and gained a lot of scrapes and bruises.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You\u2019re all soaked. What the hell did you do?\u201dWhen I who crash-landed on the lake came to the guild for a hot shower to warm my body, I was found out by master.\u201cWell, I made a small mistake and fell into the water, so I was wondering if I could borrow the hot shower.\u201d\u201cOh, yeah. Be careful. Newbies like you are the ones who easily die first. You can\u2019t just leave your mother and die first, can you?\u201d\u201cOkay\u201dI answered so, but this time Monika-san found me and started complaining to master.\u201cOh?

There was no practice today.\u201dWhen Monika-san heard that, she looked at master with scornful eyes and smiled at me.\u201cIs that so, well, that\u2019s fine. Allen-kun, if you stand all soaked in a place like this, you\u2019ll catch a cold. Come now, onee-san will wash it\u2013\u201c\u201cI, I can wash it myself, so it\u2019s okay!\u201dThe atmosphere became suspicious, so I ran away.\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019m not kidding.\u201dI could hear Monika-san\u2019s voice from behind, I wonder if it was a joke or not. In any case, I\u2019m having trouble dealing with what to do when I\u2019m pressed by that big-breasted nee-san.I paid 1,000 cents to take a hot shower to warm myself up, then changed into the clothes I brought from home and returned to the guild reception.\u201cMaster, I want you to buy this.\u201dWith that said, I offer the treasure item I saw in the Frissen village.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Name: Flame KnifeDescription: When cut, it has a low chance of dealing with additional fire damage.Grade: RarePrice: 450,000 cents\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u201cOh, Allen-boy as always a good connoisseur. How much do you hope will it be?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s 400,000 cents\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s a reasonable place. Good, I\u2019ll buy it.\u201dMy savings have increased by 400,000 cents. Of course, it\u2019s still not enough to reach the target amount, so I need to earn more.But it\u2019s not the time to rush things yet.\u201cAllen-boy, don\u2019t do anything reckless, okay.\u201d\u201cYes, teacher\u201dLet\u2019s slow down for a while and start by making the VTOL, vertical takeoff and landing glider.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aAfter that, I spent about a month doing various research.First of all, I learned that there are two important things in making things with [Alchemy] skills.One is the blueprint. The accuracy of the finished product and the required magical power will change depending on how accurately you can imagine what you are making.In the game, Amy made a high-performance carriage with a fluffy image, but it was only possible when she grew up dramatically as the main character at the end of the game and also because of her extraordinary amount of magical power. In other words, it\u2019s impossible for me to do the same thing now.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgTherefore, it is important to prepare a blueprint that is as accurate as possible and imagine the structure in my head.And the other one is to prepare the ingredients as precisely as possible. This is a disposition that I confirmed by conducting additional test because there were many depictions of it in the game, but the amount of magical power required varies depending on the presence or absence of the substances used as the material.Particularly, it is almost impossible for me now to create anything from nothing.On the contrary, even if there are not enough materials, similar materials can be used for synthesizing. This trend was especially noticeable in monster materials.What makes me happy is that I don\u2019t need to make it using only the Wyvern film, but can also significantly reduce the cost by mixing the bat monster\u2019s film, which is relatively easy to obtain from Giant Bats.Also, I learned a few things while controlling the aircraft.First of all, the positive discovery is that I have almost verified the material for transmitting magical power.To operate the rudder and elevator, I use the [Alchemy] skill with my left hand to transform it. At that time, I discover that my hair was the most suitable material for transmission like an electric wire.It was a coincidence that I discovered this. At first, I was experimenting with monster materials from different types and parts of monsters. It happened to be that a hair fell on the experimental tools, which I accidentally used while being in a daze due to lack of sleep, Surprisingly it worked well.And the negative finding is that I can\u2019t control multiple locations at the same time. This is a problem related to my ability, If I try to control something in one place, I can\u2019t seem to be able to control another place.For example, if I fuel the engine with wind magic, I\u2019m not able to operate the rudder or elevator.It is pretty deadly and is quite difficult to achieve vertical takeoff and landing with just one engine. I need at least two like the Osprey, which has become a hot topic in Japan. If possible four like a drone.When I reached this conclusion, I decided to stop my research for a while.It seems that, if I can\u2019t use multiple spells at the same time, I will not be able to operate it.I know, there is an item called \u300eScroll of Multiple Chants\u300f on the top floor of a place called the Tower of the Sages.To capture this area high magical power is required, and even if I sneak in with the \u3010Concealment\u3011skill, I will not be able to climb it.But, if it\u2019s the current me, I am confident that I can capture it in another way.And so, I started designing the tools and procuring supplies needed to capture the Tower of the Sages.About alchemy, magic, chanting, and magic circles.Magic is activated by properly using magical power to combine the methods of identifying the completed state and the process to achieve it as a set.Chants are the words that describe the process of achieving the complete state that you imagined in your head. This words and the completed state imagined in our head are connected by magical power to activate the magic.A magic circle is the description of the complete state and the process to achieve it. Magic is activated by applying magical power to it. It\u2019s easy to understand if you think of it as a magical blueprint.Alchemy: It\u2019s a kind of magic where you create something by fusing the materials. Since in alchemy the complete state and the process of achieving it are very complicated, it is common to use magic circles instead of chanting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 15Chapter 15 \u2013 Villager A captures the Tower of the Sage:-\u201cCourse \u2013 clear, engine \u2013 On, take off\u201dI start the wind magic engine and take off the wind magic glider from the runway.If there is no runway, I should make it. So, I made the runway by carving out the inner sections of the forest in the northeastern part of Lurden.It\u2019s a bit of a hassle to go back and forth. Anyway, it\u2019s impossible to take off and land in town. I should have done this from the beginning.The glider on which I was riding was steadily increasing in altitude, at this momentum, it will soon reach the height of the stratus.By the way, the Tower of the Sages is located in a rather inaccessible place. It takes about 10 days from Lurden to reach the town, and then to the forest for another 4 days on foot.This tower is said to be built by an ancient sage, which has 300 floors above ground and looks like a deep blue skyscraper modelled over Burj Khalifa.The 300th floor is maybe 1,000 or 1,500 meters high.By the way, in the game, you can come to this tower free-spirited to study for the school festival during the second grade. Nonetheless, if I don\u2019t go now, I can still clear it later, which is unnecessary.Well, the Tower of the Sages is quite far away. Thus, thanks to the introduction of the wind magic engine, rather than gliding, it is proceeding at a considerably higher speed than the first time. Expected At this pace I\u2019m expecting to reach in a few hours.The wind magic glider has also been improved compared to the first time and is designed exclusively for capturing the Tower of the Sage.First of all, the biggest improvement is the function to remove the core of the wind magic engine that powers the glider.Last time, the core disintegrated because it was fused all together with the materials. It became useless after getting damaged once. But this time even if an accident occurs, I will not lose this core part. I can reuse the old Wyvern magic stone every time.And it is my hair that transmits the power. It was painful to pluck it out, but it can\u2019t be helped, as if I can gain something without sacrificing anything. (TL: The idiom on the last is \u80cc\u306b\u8179\u306f\u5909\u3048\u3089\u308c\u306a\u3044, I tried my best to convey the meaning.)It\u2019s not perfect and considering its short term usage makes me feel depressed. It would be better to upgrade it later.Thanks to this cost reduction, the magic stones required to alchemise the core has changed to Orc magic stones instead of Wyvern magic stones.This is a rather large upgrade.Orc magic stones can be bought from the guild for around 100,000 cents. Although Orc is a monster that is hated for different reasons, it is very popular for its meat. As a result, it is also the main source of income for intermediate adventurers. So, Orc magic stones are always in stock.In this way, the wind magic glider that achieves both cost reduction and performance improvement keep on travelling smoothly in the air.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aWhile chewing on the sandwich I made in flight, I saw a tower of tremendous height in front of me.No doubt about it, that is the Tower of the Sages.Now, as planned, let\u2019s get ready to start the operation.I control the elevator with my left hand to raise the altitude of the aircraft while flying around the tower.As the altitude rises steadily, the glider breaks through the stratus and rises above the clouds. Stratus exists at a height of about 2,000 meters above the sky, so the current altitude is about that.A sea of white clouds spread under my eyes. The upper part of the tower protrudes as if it penetrates the cloud. And the rooftop of the tower is visible now.I approach it operating the glider, particularly there is no intervention.Just as expected.I move the glider up to make some distance, then turn around facing down toward the tower.\u201cDirection okay! altitude okay! goal, the top floor of the Tower of the Sages. Glider missiles, assault!\u201dI fuel the wind magic engine at maximum output.The aircraft speed up and rush towards the top of the tower while making a rattling noise.\u201cNow! eject!\u201dI remove the core used for the wind magic engine and activate the emergency escape device.The device activates correctly and I got ejected straight up high.\u201cOh! mana, the source of all things, gather in my hands and become the wind.\u201dI open the prepared parachute while decelerating by driving the wind diagonally downward.And start the small wind magic engine that I had prepared and adjust the posture in the air. It\u2019s as simple as adjusting the place of fall while not gaining momentum.With this gear, it may be closer to a motor paraglider than a parachute.While the glider I ejected from became a missile and crashed into the top of the Tower of the Sages with a loud noise.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgSince it is light in weight, it will not offer much impact, but because of the iron attached to the tip, it should be able to do some damage.When I landed on the roof of the Tower of the Sage, I checked the condition of the tower. The part where the glider collides had collapsed making a hole, yet it seems that there is no particular effect on other places.I hurriedly fold the parachute and used a rope to enter the top floor.\u201cAs planned!\u201dI evaded the Sage Tower\u2019s traps, monsters, bosses, all of them and reached the top floor.In the meantime, the self-repairing function of the Tower of the Sage worked, and the outer wall was gradually repaired. It soon returned to its original state as if there had been no collision.By the way, the reason why I know that the outer wall of the Tower of the Sage can be destroyed from the outside is, of course, because there was such a description in the game.There was an event in which Amy and her friends were celebrating their achievement of reaching the top floor of the Tower of the Sage when suddenly a black sky dragon attacked them by destroying the outer wall of the Tower of the Sage.The character design was cool, but suddenly getting attacked by an enemy character without any conversation event was a messed up scenario. At that time I cursed the Devs while playing without understanding anything.Well then, I who invaded the top floor in this way headed for the treasure chest placed in the center of this floor.When the treasure chest opens with a squeaking noise, a scroll was there inside it.There is no doubt that it is \u300eScroll of multiple chanting\u300f.I immediately use the scroll to get the \u3010Multiple Chant\u3011 skill.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Name: AllenRank: EAge: 12Blessings:\u3016Wind God\u3017Skills:\u3010Concealment\u3011\u3010Appraisal\u3011\u3010Alchemy\u3011\u3010Wind Magic\u3011\u3010Multiple Chant\u3011Place of residence: LurdenCash on hand: 3,308,751Level: 1Strength: EMagic Power: D\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Now, only one skill is left that I need.

    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16Chapter 16 \u2013 Villager A gets lost in the lost forest:-phew\u2026 at last it\u2019s over. It took me 2 days just to translate 5 sentences all about the details of the glider. Seriously it was tiresome I had to browse through the details and designs of the gliders and VTOL jets.Well enough with my blabbering, go on and enjoy the chapter.\u2013Aninsar\u201cCourse \u2013 clear, engine \u2013 On, take off\u201dI put on my homemade goggles and start the wind magic engine to launch the vertical takeoff and landing type wind magic glider, Buitor. Of course, the origin of the name is the Katakana version of VTOL. (TL: for those who don\u2019t know what Katakana is, it is a Japanese syllabary used for the transcription of words from foreign languages or loanwords.)Buitor with me accelerates as if sliding on the runway, and at the optimal speed it took off at once.Eh! What happened to vertical takeoff and landing you say?It consumes too much magical power and makes me tired, so I don\u2019t do it when I don\u2019t need it.Of course, Buitor can take off and land vertically. This has been demonstrated in research and development over the past two monthsFirst of all, Buitor is similar to the previous wind magic glider but has undergone significant improvements.Like before the propulsion engine is below the belly, and the style of manoeuvring Buitor is the same as the wind magic gliders so far.But, the aircraft has a double structure, with two wind magic engines installed under the propulsion wind magic engine.The buoyancy for vertical takeoff and landing is obtained by taking in air from the front with those engines and discharging it from near the nose and tail of the aircraft directly below.Besides, winglets are created at the tips of the left and right main wings, and a mechanism that transforms the winglets into a wind magic engine that assists altitude control during takeoff and landing is also incorporated.Ah, a winglet is a bent up part at the tip of the main wing of an airplane. Winglets are also attached to the wings of the Hoda Jet, made by a major automobile manufacturer in my previous life.In any case, Buitor can\u2019t go against the limitations of physics \u2019cause it is physically flying. Taking off with lift from the wings consumes much less energy than taking off against gravity with just the force of the wind.For the same reason, fighter jets that take off and land vertically do not normally take off and land vertically.Now, this time\u2019s destination is the lost forest. And the target item is the \u300eScroll of No Chant\u300f, which is sleeping before the entrance of the infinite corridor of the lost forest.It was like this in the game settings.Once upon a time, there was a gentle sage who could use a lot of magic without casting spells. he used his magic to help people. One day, the wise sage went to the elf village in the lost forest to get the ingredients for the medicines, but he got lost and pass away.It was said that he was unable to go to heaven because he died in the middle of his ambitions. So, by becoming a \u300eScroll of No Chant\u300f he is waiting for someone to carry on his aspirations of helping people.There was no such boss battle for this scroll. It ended with a polite burial of the remaining corpse.And because the corpse was in front of the infinite corridor, I\u2019m sure the wise sage was once captured in the infinite corridor but managed to escape with his power. It was said in the game that he might have fallen there due to exhaustion.Also, after passing through the lost forest, there is another elf village on Temple Street. But I have no use there, so I have no plans to go there.In the first place, you can\u2019t enter unless you go there with an elf, who trusts you. And even if you enter with an elf, there is nothing particularly remarkable to see in the elf village.In the game, a forced event occurs in the summer of the second grade. The village gets attack by the monsters that live nearby, So the heroine will be asked by an elf, whom she met by chance in the town to help them.After defeating the monsters and saving the elf village, the queen of the elf will give her a fairy hair ornament. It is like a pass to the elf village. where I\u2019m going now, there will be no monsters and nothing should be happening. By the way, the setting of the scroll was that you get it by chance on the way.It takes about two weeks to get to the Lost Forest by carriage from Lurden. It\u2019s further beyond the northern mountains.I\u2019ll arrive in the evening, so let\u2019s enjoy Buitor\u2019s flight.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aThe sunlight is barely reaching the surrounding of the mountain. According to the map I bought at the guild, I should arrive at the village of Linzea, but I can\u2019t find a place like that.The village of Linzea is the closest village to the lost forest and my destination. even in the game, you have to go to the lost forest from this village.Anyway, the current situation is not very good. Because of the deep forest, I lost sight of the highway, and I don\u2019t know where I am. In short, I\u2019m lostIf I don\u2019t find it quick, the sun will set.I just want to avoid the situation where I can\u2019t find the village and had to look for a campsite for the night.Furthermore strong monsters appear around here. Of course, I have brought my weapons, but I shouldn\u2019t take any extra risks here. I can defeat monsters because of the surprise hit from using \u3010Concealment\u3011. I\u2019m definitely not strong myself.For the time being, if I fly around the forest properly\u2013, the sun begins to set over the mountains.Not good!When I start looking around impatiently, I found a part of the forest that is open.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cWhat if the village is in there?\u201dI muttered to myself and turned Buitor toward it. Maybe I can make it in time before sunset, and if I can land on flat land, I\u2019ll be able to find a campsite.Gradually nearing the open place.That is a village. I can see something like a house made of wood, and some human figures can also be seen.Fortunately, in addition to it, I noticed that there was a gaping plain area some tens of meters away from the village.If I suddenly land in the village, it will make a fuss, so let\u2019s land there.I gradually lower the altitude while circling the sky.\u201cVertical engine, start!\u201dSince the speed and altitude have dropped a lot, I start the engine for vertical landing. The intake and exhaust ports are opened and airflow begins.From here on, fine control is important.I have to control the altitude of the aircraft while reducing the speed.\u201cAltitude control engine, start!\u201dAuxiliary engines attached to both wings also start.By sending magical power to the four engines, at the same time using the main engine well, Buitor\u2019s speed gradually decreased.As expected, magic power gets scraped off by the stone. keeping in mind the practices, I calmly control the aircraft.\u30fb\u30fb\u30fbAnd my Buitor landed safely.I opened the seat belt for safety and got off the aircraft, stepping on the ground with both feet.\u201cAh, I\u2019m tired\u201dI mutter involuntarily and stretched out greatly.After hiding the Buitor when I start walking towards the village.\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201dThere was a man\u2019s voice and several men appeared from the woods. They are all aiming at me with a bow and arrow.And to my surprise, their ears were long!\u2026\u2026How did this happen?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And on the throne, the beautiful queen I saw in the game is sitting.\u201cYou are human, right?\u201d\u201cYes, my name is Allen.\u201d\u201cThen, Allen-san. For what did you come to this village?\u201dThe Queen begins her interrogation\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I got lost. I was actually trying to go to another human village.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t lie!\u201d\u201cPlease be quiet. But, our village is protected by the power of spirits. You humans and demons should not be able to pass through that forest. How on earth?\u201d\u201cI came from the sky\u201d\u201cFrom the sky, you say? Does that mean you have the magical power to keep flying over that forest?\u201d\u201cWell, yes. If you say it like that.\u201d\u201cWhat \u2026\u201dIt looks like the Queen got shocked.\u201cHer Majesty, that shouldn\u2019t be possible. I can\u2019t feel that much magical power from this person.\u201dAn aide like man seems to be suggesting to the Queen to prove me wrong. I have a hunch that such a character did not appear in the game.\u201ccertainly, I don\u2019t feel strong magic power, but \u2026 right, Allen-san. Do you have any blessings?\u201dShould I say? Well, the opponent is not human but the elves who were supposed to hate humans in the game, so it\u2019ll be okay probably.\u201cFor the time being, I did receive the blessing of\u3016Wind God\u3017.\u201dThe Queen stood up in a surprised manner.\u201cIs, is that true?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201dI unlock the\u3016Wind God\u3017on the status that was hidden by \u3010Concealment\u3011 and show the status of the guild card.\u201cOoh! God didn\u2019t abandon us.\u201dI\u2019m impressed with how they exaggerated, but what exactly does that mean?\u201cUmm\u2026 Your majesty. I can\u2019t seem to perceive the story at all \u2026\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m sorry. Allen-san, no, Allen-sama. Please save our village.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dWhy did the event start? There Shouldn\u2019t be any monster casualties for the request yet.\u201cActually, an evil spirit has appeared in the lost forest. At first, It was only active in the lost forest, but gradually it starts coming closer to this village.\u201dIt\u2019s an event I knew nothing of. Did the evil spirit appear before the monsters appeared? What a series of disasters!While keeping in mind the impressions of other people, I try to match the story for the time being.\u201cUm, What has it done?\u201d\u201cThat evil spirit chases us and the spirits. However, because of its slow movement, no one has been injured yet. But, if this goes on, damage may occur and eventually, we will not be able to protect the forest and the village.\u201d\u201cIn other words, an evil spirit is attacking you, so I need to repel it, right?\u201d\u201cYes. you are blessed by the god of the wind. If it\u2019s you, I\u2019m sure you can do it.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that kind of request falls under the priest\u2019s territory?\u201d\u201cI want to invite as few humans as possible to this village because there is an unfortunate history between humans and elves.\u201dI see. It wasn\u2019t drawn in the game, so something like this also happened.\u201cMother! You don\u2019t have to rely on a human like him. I\u2019ll get rid of it for you.\u201dA cute girl of about 15 years old, came in. I knew her. She was the one who asked to get rid of monsters in the game. I remember her being the princess of this village, and contrary to what she looked like, she was in her mid-20s.\u201cSheryl Laura! I\u2019m talking to a guest right now. Please go back.\u201d (Tl: in the raw, name of the princess was \u30b7\u30a7\u30ea\u30eb\u30e9\u30eb\u30e9. If anyone can translate it do suggest me in the comment.)\u201cBut!\u201d\u201cThe evil spirit has returned!\u201dIt seems that the evil spirit just appeared during our conversation.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cI\u2019m going to get rid of it\u201d\u201cShery! Wait! Shery!\u201dSheryl Laura-san starts running. Also, some elves chase after her.\u201cAllen-sama \u2026?\u201d\u201cUm \u2026 do I have to go? Huh! okay \u2026 I\u2019m going, But Don\u2019t expect much, okay!\u201dThey were staring at me with a very expected expression, which made me feel very uncomfortable. So, I decided to go see it for the time being.***And we came to the square, but what\u2019s that strange thing supposed to be.A man with a wizard-like vibe is raising his hands diagonally up in front while moving slowly. He seems to be moving with the gesture of chasing something\u2026 right, something similar to butterflies.However, his movement is rather slow.Besides, that man is also very slender, or it may be said that he looks ghastly. his wizard\u2019s robe is also tattered.Ah, No doubt. He is a completely suspicious person.\u201cKuu, you came, evil spirit. Take this!\u201d.Sheryl Laura-san shoots an arrow. However, the arrow that should have hit the suspicious person changed its trajectory and deviated before reaching.\u201cYour Majesty, is that the evil spirit?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. That black, ominous fog like thing chasing the spirit is the evil spirit.\u201d\u201cA spirit? A black fog? I can only see a suspicious person chasing alone something that I can\u2019t see.\u201d\u201cAllen-sama, can you see the true identity of that fog?\u201d\u201cUm, is it not visible?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSilence flows between me and the Queen.Meanwhile, Sheryl Laura-san and the elves in the village are in a state of panic.As the suspicious person close in, the elves got frightened and start crying and fleeing. Some franticly fired arrows and even began to cast magic.However, neither the arrow nor the magic reaches the suspicious person.\u201cAllen-sama, I\u2019ll help you to see the spirits temporarily.\u201dWhen the Queen put her hand on my head, it felt like something enter my body.\u201cHow do you like it?\u201dWhen I look at the suspicious person again, I can certainly see something like a small light beyond. If you look closely, it looks like a little girl.\u201cOh, that\u2019s true. He was already a suspicious person, but now he looks like a more problematic suspicious person.\u201d\u201cin that case\u2026\u2026\u201dDon\u2019t look at me with such praying eyes.\u201cfor, for the time being, I\u2019ll try to persuade him.\u201dI said so and start walking towards the suspicious person.\u201cHey, the wizardly old man? it\u2019s a crime to chase after a little girl like that.\u201dWhen I called out, the suspicious person was stunned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then I\u2019d like Allen-shi to ask them for me. I need the petals of the spirit tree and the honey made by the elves to make the elixir.\u201d\u201cHmm?

What are you looking for today?\u201d\u201cI Came to sell items.\u201d\u201cDo you have the items you want to sell to me?\u201d\u201cOh, here.\u201dI give out three small bottles of elven honey.\u201cThis is\u2026 quite fresh. Is it freshly harvested?\u201d\u201cI happened to get it from a certain connection. How much will you give for it?\u201d\u201cFufu. Good. How about 2 million in total?\u201dthe old woman of the shop raises two fingers, by saying that.\u201cYes. That\u2019s fine.\u201dIt sold much higher than expected. By the way, this is the result of my appraisal.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Name: Elven HoneyDescription: A precious honey that can only be obtained in the Elven Village. When eaten, it is nutritious and has effects such as beauty, health, and longevity. It is also used as a raw material for various elixirs.Grade: RarePrice: 300,000 cents\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500By the way, there were five in total. It seems to have the effect of beauty, health and longevity, so I decided to give one as a gift to my mother and carry the other as a seasoning for when I camp.\u201cCan you get more of this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s difficult right away, but if I get again, I\u2019ll bring it.\u201d\u201cOh, I request. I haven\u2019t seen it at all in the last few decades. I\u2019ll buy 100, 200, or whatever you bring.\u201d\u201cOkay. I accept your request. By the way, do you have a magic bag?\u201dA magic bag is an item that can carry more things than it\u2019s size with the power of magic.This item didn\u2019t appear in the game because inventory was there. I found out its existence in the Adventurer Guild when a senior adventurer got it and was proud of it.\u201cNo. of how much capacity do you want?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019d have been better if there was one with the capacity similar to this room.\u201d\u201cHahaha, something like that is not available on the market, and even if it\u2019s, it\u2019s a price that one can buy a country with it.\u201d\u201cIs that so.\u201dApparently, I was too greedy.\u201cWell, if it is of a pouch size with the capacity of a bag, you will find around 500 of them. I do see it occasionally in the market.\u201d\u201cOkay, do get one for me.\u201dI left the Lurden Store after such an exchange.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aWell, my fate changing plan has finished the first stage, so I decided to move to the second stage.After all, I had all the skills I need and the money to enrol. All that remains is to build the power to win the duel.So my next strategy is to level up.To raise the level, I need to train hard and defeat the enemy.It seems that the enemy can also be a human rather than a monster, but I\u2019m not planning to become a criminal.That\u2019s why I decided to exterminate monsters as an adventurer after a long time.The destination is the village of Stresen. There is a Goblin Dungeon near this village.In the otome game, it is the second battle part and also the first actual battle. (TL: probably after tutorial one.)This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgHowever, my purpose is not the capture of the Goblin Dungeon. All I have to do is get rid of the goblins that occasionally attack the village and raise my level, for that I don\u2019t have to break through the dungeon.In the game, I went straight to the dungeon to capture it without knowing that I didn\u2019t have to do so.By the way, dungeons are terrifying and annoying existence that spawns monsters indefinitely. As the number of the monsters increases, they will come out and rampage, so it is necessary to thin them out once in a while.There is a boss room in the deepest part of the dungeon. further back, a dungeon core is there. If you touch it, you will return to the entrance.This was the setting told in the game. When I asked a senior adventurer, I heard that the body of a person who died in the dungeon had disappeared after some time, what a terrible story. it could have been the result of being eaten by a monster, I may be wrong.By the way, there are rumours that if you break the dungeon core, you can kill the dungeon. But according to the records, no one has broken it, so there is no credibility to it. If you hit the core, the attack will be deflected to the ground. Even if you shoot magic, the outcome will be the same.Also, monsters are both annoying and good source of resources, so no one seems to be bothered about destroying them.By the way, I took a request from the guild to get rid of Stresen\u2019s Goblins.\u201cOh, Allen-boy. You\u2019re finally making your debut to defeat goblins. Don\u2019t let your guard down.\u201d\u201cYes, master. I\u2019m going!\u201dWhen I answered to master, a senior adventurer called me.\u201cAllen-boy, don\u2019t die\u201d\u201cI know. I\u2019ll run away if it becomes dangerous.\u201dThis person is a feckless senior adventurer who starts drinking alcohol from the morning at the guild tavern every day. Thank you for your concern and you should work too, is what I thought.\u201cAllen-kun will finally make his debut in exterminating goblins and become an adult from a boy. He looks reliable, I feel lonely, it\u2019s complicated.\u201d (TL: I also felt complicated to translate your feelings. LOL)\u201cMonica-sa.. whoa.\u201dMonica-san\u2019s hug attack pushed my face against her plump hills. Before, I used to get pressed directly to her chest, but now I have to bend down a little.My height has increased.\u201cDon\u2019t overdo it? Do you understand?\u201dI know. I know it and I don\u2019t feel like overdoing it, so please stop this skinship.You see, I\u2019m also a man \u2026Somehow getting rid of Monica-san\u2019s hug attack I went home and told my mother about the request.Mother knew that I would stay in Stresen village for a while. So, she kindly hugged me and told me not to overdo it.Unlike Monica-san, it was a very gentle hug.Mom, please wait. I\u2019ll definitely protect you from the destruction.Author\u2019s Note:-Thanks to you all, I won 19th place in the different world reincarnation category of the fantasy genre. I couldn\u2019t believe that the ranking will rise again from yesterday.Thank you very much.All the popular books around my work made it look plain, so I was quite surprised((((\uff1b\u309c\u0414\u309c)))).And to all the readers who supported my work.Are you a god?That\u2019s all, I look forward to working with you all in the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 20Chapter 20\u00a0\u2013 Villager A captures the Goblin Dungeon:-Good news folks, my exams are over.\u30fe(\u2267\u25bd\u2266*)oAs promised, I will start releasing twice a week, every Thursday and Sunday.Also, this chapter was a little bit big, so I\u2019ve decided to release it into two parts.\u2013Aninsar\u201cI\u2019m Allen. I\u2019ve accepted the request to get rid of the goblins.\u201d\u201cOh, finally someone came. I\u2019m the village chief here. Quite a young boy you are. Well, thank you for accepting the request. I was in trouble because no one has come for the last six months.\u201dWhen I greeted the old man, who is the village chief, I was taken to the house which was rented for my stay. According to the contract of the request, the village will provide accommodation, so the rent is free. But I have to pay for meals myself.The reward for subduing goblins is 1,500 cents per kill. It also includes the price of the magic stone that is offered as proof of subjugation.Moreover, goblins meat is inedible. Sometimes they have weapons but they\u2019re tattered and useless, and goblins\u2019 magic stones aren\u2019t very expensive except for large rare ones. They roam in groups, so you also have to face the danger of losing your life while attacking them. From an adventurer\u2019s point of view, there is very little gain in fighting them.If they build a nest and gather like the ruins of the royal capital, you may have the treasure they collected. but if they didn\u2019t hoard any, you won\u2019t really make a lot of money.Well, due to such circumstances, adventurers will not come unless some convenience is provided.That\u2019s why this village provides accommodation for free. But meals are not free, so it costs about 2,000 to 3,000 cents a day just to stay.Well, it\u2019s natural that no one will come for about half a year. I will also leave after completing the request and raising my level.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aThe next morning I head towards the Goblin Dungeon.On my hand is an AK-47-style automatic rifle, created with the help of \u3010Alchemy\u3011 skill. I named it Kalashi. Of course, the origin of the name comes from its inventor Kalashnikov.However, the mechanism does not use a gunpowder explosion, but the burst of compressed air using wind magic.I had a lot of trouble with it because the reload and magazine mechanism was not working properly. Its development was proceeding in parallel with the development of Buitor, but, was finally completed to be launch in a real battle.Eh? Why am I so familiar with how guns works, you say? That\u2019s because I was a gun otaku in my previous life.In my previous life, I loved airplanes and guns, and my childhood dream was to be a fighter pilot. Also, when I was a college student, I participated in the trial shooting, maintenance and dismantling experience tours in the former Soviet Union and Southeast Asia.The Career I finally choose in my previous life was aeronautical engineer. but in this current situation, I don\u2019t need to be cautious about using a gun.Now, I can see a goblin in the distance. It\u2019s probably a goblin wandering out of the dungeon.I aim the Kalashi while holding it, then pull the trigger.Dahn, Dahn, DahnOnly one of the three shots hit the goblin\u2019s right chest. As expected it\u2019s hard to aim perfectly. I need to increase my marksmanship along with my sword training.DahnI approached the cringed goblin and Shoot him down.Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have the ability to shoot through the key points from a long distance. Then there is only one thing I can do.I use my \u3010Concealment\u3011 skill to hide and search for goblins. And when I walked for a while, I saw three goblins walking together.I went around and approached them from behind, at a distance of about 5 meters I fired.Dandandandandandan \u2026\u2026As expected at this distance, the bullets hit the mark, and the goblins collapse. When I get closer, I strike the still-breathing goblin\u2019s head and kill it.\u201cHahaha. What the! Isn\u2019t it an easy victory?\u201dI\u2019m a little excited about the fact that even multiple goblins, which were scary when I was 8-years old, can easily be defeated. but, let\u2019s do the things that need to be done first.If I don\u2019t burn the body and dispose of it, It will attract other monsters.I took out the goblin magic stone from the bodies and hurriedly disposed of the bodies by burning them.After that, I finished today\u2019s hunt by defeating 15 goblins in the forest, then went to the village.\u201cToday\u2019s delivery is 12 goblin magic stones. Can you please confirm it Chief?\u201dI give 12 goblin magic stones to the village chief.\u201cHmm. well done. Then your guild card.\u201dI give my guild card. The village chief took out a guild card with a different colour from mine and touches my guild card.\u201cRequest number: RR1STL154, permanent request, content: Goblin subjugation. total Number of subjugation 12. Approved by the client \u201dThe fulfilment of the request is now approved. This world is convenient in some parts, but it was originally a world of otome games with loose settings. So, it\u2019s a loss, if you care about how things like this work.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aAnd the next day, I went out to get rid of the goblins again.By the way, one of the seven magic stones that I didn\u2019t report yesterday was broken when I killed the goblin, and the remaining six were used to make bullets with \u3010Alchemy\u3011.Using \u3010Concealment\u3011 skill to approach the goblins from behind.Then, shoot at the vitals and stab the survivors to end them, after that take out the magic stone.Burn the corpse to dispose of it and then the extermination is over.After doing this for about a week, I no longer see any goblins in the forest, around the village.It\u2019s about time.With that in mind, I decided to enter the Goblin Dungeon.On my waist is a 300,000 cents magic lantern that I bought in the guild for this day.It is a magic item that lights up with magical power. I also brought the torch just in case, but it wasn\u2019t easy to use, so I hastily bought it.It may be possible to make it if I do my best with \u3010Alchemy\u3011, but I can\u2019t make it because I can\u2019t use fire magic. No, it might be possible if I do my best to research, but it seems to be difficult.If it can be solved by using money, then I don\u2019t want to waste my time.I slowly proceed through the Goblin Dungeon, relying on the lights of the lanterns.It doesn\u2019t seem to be that messy, but the encounters are at least once every five minutes. Sometimes one, and sometimes about five of them.By the way, I kept using the \u3010Concealment\u3011 skill, but I couldn\u2019t make a surprise attack well. Apparently, they don\u2019t seem to notice me, but notices the light of the lantern, and approaches with a confused face.Well, it\u2019s a surprise attack in the sense that I\u2019m going to do it with Kalashi when they approach defenceless.In a way, I felt like an Atlantic football-fish. (TL: for reference a family of deep-sea anglerfish.)This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgThat\u2019s why I proceed without heeding the danger.To stop my sister from pestering, I had to crazily play this shitty game. So, I remember every detail about this game. And as per my memory, there are no gorgeous treasures here.The Goblin Dungeon has a total of five floors. And at the lowest floor, the dungeon boss, Goblin Lord, is there with his minions- two Hob Goblin and two Goblin Mage.I arrived in front of the boss room in no time. The number of magic stones I have obtained so far is well over 100.After taking a breath, to calm my excitement, I pushed the big door of the boss room.Gigigi, the door of the boss room opens, and when I went in, I saw the figure of the five monsters I expected to see.I aim with Kalashi to shoot the goblin mages first. The first one to attack wins.Dandandandandandandandandandandandandan \u2026\u2026The goblin mages become bloody and fall when I emptied the magazine on them.I use \u3010Wind Magic\u3011 to create a breeze and blow the sand made from \u3010Alchemy\u3011 toward the bosses.It\u2019s the \u3010No Chant\u3011 skill that I got from that pervert.No matter who I get it from, a skill is a skill. There is no sin in using a skill.I reload Kalashi when they lost sight of me.Then, activate the \u3010Concealment\u3011 skill and approaches the Hobgoblins who are looking for me. I aim at the head from behind and pull the trigger.Dandandandandandandandandandandandandan \u2026\u2026I shoot the bullets in their head from a distance of around 5 meters, then hide again using the smokescreen.After that, while changing the magazine, I get behind the Goblin Lord with the \u3010Concealment\u3011 skill.Dandandandandandandandandandandandandan \u2026\u2026Again, shot in the head from a distance of around 5 meters.\u201cGaaaa\u201dDespite being bloody, the Goblin lord raised his sword and tried to hit me.As expected, of the Lord type monster. Even in the game, it was impossible to defeat him with only firepower, so I had a hard time defeating him. However, I had expected this situation.I took out the goblin magic stones I\u2019ve collected so far, use \u3010Alchemy\u3011 to create water balloons, and throw them at his face.When it lands on the Goblin Lord\u2019s face, it burst into a transparent sticky liquid that adheres to his face.\u201cGyaaaaaaa\u201dGoblin Lord holds his eyes while facing down. The contents were simple, it is a blinding sticky liquid in which pepper components are dissolved, that is, a liquid in which components that hurt the eyes are concentrated.I mercilessly shoot bullets into the Goblin Lord, who holds his eyes.Dandandandandandandandandandandandan \u2026\u2026 click clickI shot it all. The Goblin Lord is lying on the ground, but it\u2019s still moving. I was surprised to see that he was still alive even though I punctured him with holes.I aim at the neck and activate the wind cutter with the \u3010Wind Magic\u3011 skill.When I saw a slight scratch on the skin of his neck, I kept using the wind cutter in the same position. Thanks to the acquisition of \u3010No Chant\u3011 and \u3010Multiple Chant\u3011, the wind blades deepened the wound on his neck one after another, and finally, the head and torso were separated.However, defeating the Goblin Lord was harder than I had imagined. In the game, there was a setting that if you throw pepper powder, he will get incapacitated with pain for a while. So I prepared it as insurance, and I was right for doing so.If I didn\u2019t do it, then I would have been dead by getting hit once.It seems that the equipment needs to be modified again.I hurriedly dismantle to take out the magic stones. In particular, if I bring the Goblin Lord magic stone to the guild, I will be certified as this dungeon\u2019s conqueror. It is considered an adventurer\u2019s achievement. So I will submit it to the guild.With this the Goblin Dungeon is clear, unfortunately there is no treasure for clearing it. A long time ago, the dungeon had already been conquered, so the first one to conquer it had taken away the treasure.This dungeon is unpopular not only because defeating goblins doesn\u2019t make much money, but also because you can\u2019t expect any treasure.As I move to the back of the boss room, a round sphere that glows black is floating in the air.This is the core of the dungeon.When I reach out and touch the dungeon core with my right hand, I was surrounded by light, and the next moment I was standing at the entrance to the dungeon.While feeling the sense of accomplishment of the dungeon capture, I returned to the Stresen village with a relaxed gait.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With this, my guild card will have a record of conquering the Goblin Dungeon.I came back to Lurden from Stresen village with a carriage and directly went to the guild.\u201cAlso you\u2019ve defeated a total of 138 goblins. With this, Stresen\u2019s goblin problem seems to be okay for the time being. Well done, Allen-boy!\u201dMaster said that while patting my head roughly.In this way, the permanent request to exterminate the goblins in Stresen village was withdrawn.Well, my guild card now looks like this.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Name: AllenRank: EAge: 12Blessing:\u3016Wind God\u3017Skills: \u3010Concealment\u3011\u3010Appraisal\u3011\u3010Alchemy\u3011\u3010Wind Magic\u3011\u3010Multiple Chant\u3011Place of residence: LurdenPossession: 5,519,416Level: 6Strength: EMagical power: DAchievements: Goblin Dungeon Conqueror\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500The level has reached 6.

The Goblin Dungeon conquering reward, or rather the real profit was on the sale of the Lord\u2019s magic stone of about 500,000 cents, is also obtained. (TL: what the! he just soloed a dungeon while being lvl 1.)The next strategy is to raise the level by high-speed laps in the Goblin Dungeon. I would like to raise the level so that I can challenge the next dungeon, but when it comes to high-speed laps, I want a weapon that can defeat the Goblin Lord in one shot. Otherwise, it will be difficult to conquer the Orc Dungeon, which I planned for the next one.So, I will be researching and developing new guns for a while, for that, I would like to change my house. I can\u2019t sleep in the same room with my mother in a small one-room house forever, can I. Moreover, I also need a warehouse to store supplies.I would like to move to an apartment of about 2 LDK or 3 LDK and give my mother a better life.So I went home after completing the guild procedure.\u201cMom, I\u2019m home\u201d\u201cOh, Allen. Welcome back. Did you get hurt?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. I came back after conquering the Goblin Dungeon. How were you mother?\u201d\u201cOf course, your mom is always fine. Also Martina-san from next door \u2026\u201dIt\u2019s nothing but an everyday parent-child conversation, which makes me feel warmer than anything else. As expected, I can\u2019t let destiny take away my important mother from me.\u201cBy the way, mom. I\u2019m starting to make a lot of money, so why not move to a large apartment together?\u201dI bring out the main subject.\u201cAllen, You can still live in this house, right? And spend the money you earn yourself. You don\u2019t have to spend it to look after your mother.\u201dWell, I thought she would say that.\u201cThat\u2019s not the case. Me being an adventurer needs me to have a lot of luggage, but I can\u2019t put too much here. Also if I live separately, then it will be a waste of money. That\u2019s why I want to move and would be happy if mom also comes with me. \u201cMother looks at me and thinks for a bit.\u201cA-Also, I often leave my house for requests and all. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if mother lived with me and take care of the things \u2026\u201dA soft touch wraps me when I became all jittery.I tightly hug her, still, she embraces me kindly\u201cStupid. you don\u2019t have to say so much, your mother knows well, doing what will make Allen happy.\u201dAs always I end up getting consoled. It always fills my heart with warm feelings.\u201cWell, I\u2019m off tomorrow, so why don\u2019t we look for a new house together?\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cYup!\u201dI nodded obediently to mother\u2019s words.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\u201cHuh, that\u2019s why you came to the guild with your mom.\u201dMaster looked at me with astound face and said so.\u201cI\u2019m indebted for always taking care of my son. Is he doing well? Is he inconveniencing everyone?\u201d\u201cOh, oh. Allen is doing his best. Umm \u2026\u201d\u201cAllen\u2019s mother, Katerina. Nice to meet you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the receptionist, who taught Allen-boy swordsmanship, it\u2019s Rudolph. Nice to meet you. Allen-boy is the newcomer whom the guild has lots of expectations. He has a good track record, and above all, he has the guts to continue to keep up with it almost every day for 4 years. There are many people who care about him, so if he goes up to D rank, there will be many people who will invite him to the party. \u201c\u201cThank you so much for always helping him\u201d\u201cOh, oh\u201dBut, right? talking about parties, If you put an E rank in the party, he/she will be disliked because the requests you can receive will be limited, but if he/she were to be of D rank, then there will be no limit.I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m getting better, but I also have a plan of fate destruction. What should I do?Ah, well, I will think about it when my rank will rise.Even if I think about it now, it\u2019ll be of no help, so I\u2019ll return to the main subject.\u201cThat\u2019s why master. I want you to introduce us to a good property.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why Allen-boy. The guild isn\u2019t a place to look for real estate. Though I can introduce you to a property, but it\u2019s for adventurers. It\u2019s in an unsafe place, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s suitable for ordinary people like Katerina-san to live in.\u201d\u201cThen, please introduce us to a real estate agent!\u201d\u201cOh, oh. Today Allen-boy is eating more than usual. If that\u2019s the case \u2026\u201d\u201cOh? Allen-kun, are you moving?\u201dMonica-san called from the side. It doesn\u2019t seem to be working hours yet, because she is wearing plain clothes. Won\u2019t she suddenly hug me today?\u201cThat\u2019s right, Monica-san. I\u2019m starting to make a little money, so I thought I\u2019d move to a slightly larger room with my mother.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s, great. Then, why don\u2019t you come to our place?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHey, Allen-kun? What did you imagine?\u201dAfter saying that, Monica-san licks her lips bewitchingly. An ordinary person would be surprised at the gesture, but, to me, it looks like an illusion of a snake sticking out its tongue.\u201cOh, no, no\u201dWhen she saw I was having a hard time answering her, she changed the subject.\u201cMy dad runs an apartment, so I can introduce you to a house that is right for Allen-kun to live with his family, you know? Oh, Allen-kun\u2019s mom, I\u2019m Monica, I work as a waitress here. Nice to meet you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Katerina. Thank you for always looking after my Allen.\u201dThough late, They exchange greetings.\u201cI see. If it\u2019s Monica-san\u2019s place, then it will be safe.

No, even in that battered apartment, it would cost about 60,000 to 70,000, probably. Isn\u2019t it a bargain?\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go and see it.\u201d\u201cThen, it\u2019s decided!\u201dThus, I decided to go and see Monica-san\u2019s father\u2019s apartment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So it can be said that the 4th floor will be a little easier.\u201cHere, this room.\u201dWhen I open the door and went in, I found a 3 LDK apartment occupied with a kitchen, a toilet and even a bath space. It seems difficult to pump water, but a faucet is there. What does it mean?\u201cThere is a shared wall in the courtyard. Also, as you can see, there are magic tools for using water.

In the first place, guns were basically made to kill humans. And the damage caused by them is highest when a human gets hit by a bullet, and it remains in the body in a deform state.Large calibre, i.e. larger the diameter of a bullet, less the chances of it penetrating out of the body. In other words, the ability to kill humans increases, i.e. the power increases.On the other hand, if you make the calibre smaller, it will easily penetrate out of the body. So, the killing ability will be lower. Also, you have to hit the key vitals accurately to defeat a human with a single blow.Now the problem is that I\u2019m dealing with monsters, not humans. I don\u2019t understand why such a full-scale battle part was incorporated into the world of otome games. Anyway, that\u2019s the case, so there is no choice but to deal with it.Kalashi uses a standard 30 calibre 7.62 x 39 mm bullet. So, I made another rifle with Kalashi\u2019s specs and modified the calibre to 22. I named it Nikov. Now that I think about it, the Soviet Union had made something similar as a successor to the AK-47.Was it called AK-74?The 22 calibre was more successful on the US military\u2019s M16, but I\u2019m not familiar with that design.Weapons made by the former Soviet Union were on the market here and there. Touching the real thing was easy. Also, it had its charm.That said, both Kalashi and Nikov are similar in appearance, but the mechanism is entirely different.Now, regarding the other modification, i.e. improving the bullet. The first thing that comes to mind is to make a Full Metal Jacket bullet (a.k.a FMJ bullet) that covers the bullet with hard metal.Originally, I didn\u2019t do it because it was troublesome to procure brass to cover it, but it may be good to use this as an opportunity to envelop the bullets. Better yet, it would be nice to find a tungsten deposit somewhere, but it\u2019s not so convenient.I went on, doing trial and error repeatedly for two weeks.Eventually, both the 22 and 30 calibre bullets became FMJ bullets with an iron core and a brass coating. They were powerful enough to lightly penetrate an iron plate of about 5 mm.The reason for using FMJ in both the guns is that I wanted to avoid leaving lead residue in the gun cavity and muzzle, which could cause an outburst.Now, let\u2019s go to the Goblin Dungeon for a trial.I immediately get on the Buitor and flew towards the Goblin Dungeon.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aI arrived at Stresen Airport in less than an hour. Of course, I made it secretly here as well.It is built on the opposite side of the Goblin Dungeon from the Stresen village. So it won\u2019t be discovered.I don\u2019t have any reason to go to Stresen village, so I just head for the Goblin Dungeon.I move forward holding Nikov while putting Kalashi on my back. As before, the lantern is lowered on my waist, and the \u3010Concealment\u3011 skill is in effect while moving.There are fewer goblins than last time, but still, a decent number of goblins are there. I proceed while defeating all of them.By the time I got to the boss room, I had about 40 goblin magic stones.And then, in the boss room, I meet the boss gang- Goblin Lord, two Hobgoblins, and two Goblin Mage again.Like last time, I shoot and kill the Goblin Mages and Hobgoblins first. Then use a smokescreen to hide and went behind the Goblin Lord.Dandandandandandan \u2026\u2026 ClickNikov has run out of bullets, but it has penetrated properly.The Goblin Lord, who is spilling blood from six bullets in his body, roared and rushed towards me.I jump to the side and avoid it, then switch to Kalashi.DandandandandandanOne-shot hit the Goblin Lord between his eyebrows. It might have pierced his skull as his movement stopped, and he collapsed as it is.This time I was able to win by a margin. When I collect the magic stone, I touch the labyrinth core and transfer it to the entrance.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgWith this, I head for the second lap. Goblins are no longer my opponent unless I\u2019m careless. I reach the boss room without any problems.I got about 20 goblin magic stones this time.There is no one in the boss room because I defeated it earlier.Then, touching the labyrinth core again, I move to the entrance and head for the third lap. On the third lap, I was able to collect about 20 goblin magic stones.When I entered the boss room, I saw two Hobgoblins, two Goblin mages and the Goblin Lord for the third time.Since I know the strategy, I punctured the Hobgoblins and Goblin Mages with holes using Nikov and then used Kalashi to puncture holes in Goblin Lord.Then, collect the magic stone quickly and went to challenge the next lap.Well, if I traverse the Dungeon like this, the boss who should have been dead will be revived once every two laps. Though it takes a week to revive naturally, if you traverse in a row like this, the boss will revive.In the game, if you keep doing this in the Dungeon of the wind mountain in the summer of the second year, you can easily clear the main route without paying. Of course, I didn\u2019t discover it myself. It was written on the Wiki when I looked it up.My goal in the future is to do that and raise the level before enrollment.In this way, I went on traversing the Goblin Dungeon every day for about a week and made a total of about 100 laps.I decided to sell the goblin magic stone to the guild on my way home, but I was astounded by what master told me.\u201cHey, Allen-boy. Why is Goblin Slayer title in your achievement record?\u201d\u201cMaster, what is that?\u201d\u201cThis title is given to those who have hunted more than 1,000 goblins in a year.

However, at present, Orc Dungeon is an undiscovered dungeon. So it is known as a town near the Orc Forest.Of course, there are a lot of orcs as they are overflowing from the dungeon. But, the town is safe from the troubles because orcs are hunted regularly for their meat.Of course, since orcs are monsters, they do attack humans. But it seems that the damage to humans is less, cause a small group of people deals with them regularly.This time my plan is, of course, traversing the Orcs Dungeon. Also, there is a permanent request to subdue the orcs in the guild of Altmunt. I will take it.I immediately head towards the orc forest. The dungeon is located at the foot of a beautifully shaped mountain, like Mt. Fuji, that can be seen far beyond this forest. But, I will not go there today.Today, I\u2019m here to find out the effectiveness of my firearms against the orcs. In the game, the orcs took more damages than the hobgoblins. but they were horribly tough. In other words, their HP is high while the defence is low.As usual, I activate the \u3010Concealment\u3011 skill and proceed through the forest. Then, after walking through the forest for about an hour, I found an orc.First, let\u2019s try shooting with Nikov.Dandan DandanWhen I shot four bullets from behind, the orc falls easily.After my laps in Goblin Dungeon, I thought about various things and changed Nikov\u2019s bullets to a type of bullet called Hollow-point bullet.Hollow-point bullets are those that deform and expand when they hit a target. If the bullets pierce the target then their killing ability increases. Even in my previous life, this type of bullet was mainly used for hunting.Kalashi\u2019s Large calibre bullet may not pass through hard monsters, so I only changed the bullets for the small calibre Nikov.Just in case, I shoot another shot in its head, then start dismantling.Orcs are large monsters that are over 2 meters long. It\u2019s too big, so carrying everything is impossible. I peeled off only the magic stone and rare parts of the meat. The rest were of less value. So I burned it.After walking for about an hour, I met another orc. Kalashi\u2019s turn now.Don Don Don DonLike before, four shots in the same way. It seems that at least one shot hit. But, even after getting shot at, it can move. It became angry and rushed towards me.Don Don Don Don Don Don Don DonI shot few bullets at the oncoming orc. One of them seemed to have hit its head, as it falls facing forward.When it stopped moving, I approached it. The bullet pierced its head brilliantly. The result was as expected.For now, it seems to be a good balance to use Nikov for normal hunting, and Kalashi for hard enemies that Nikov\u2019s bullets can\u2019t pass through. It may change later.I took out the magic stone and collected as many edible parts and skin as I could have this time, then returned to town.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aThe next day, I came to the entrance to the Dungeon of Orcs.This dungeon is a huge dungeon consisting of 100 layers in total. And its feature is that there are floor boss rooms on all floors.Only the orcs and their evolved monsters appear. There are no gorgeous treasures. Also, no major traps are there.According to my memory, the treasures along the way are of Uncommon grade. But when you defeat the last boss you can get an Epic class item.That Epic class item is certainly just an event item, and it must have been a decoration that has no value other than increasing the likability of the target. I do remember collecting it to acquire the events stills. (TL:- it means event illustrations.)Now, I aim for the lowest layer and proceed at once by the shortest route. This time too, I\u2019m using the \u3010Concealment\u3011 skill and Nikov actively. By collecting only the magic stones while leaving the defeated orc meat, I move forward.Like that, I arrived at the boss room on the first floor. The bosses here were 5 orcs. Only Nikov was enough to deal with them.Unlike the Goblin Dungeon, the boss here is not much stronger than the monsters that appear in that hierarchy.When I collect the defeated orc magic stone, I move on to the next level.The orcs that appeared became stronger as they went up in the hierarchy. Next to the orcs are the High Orcs, the Orc Mages, the Orc Priests, the Orc Generals, and the last floor\u2019s boss, the Orc king.Especially, the General and the King are troublesome. The General is a versatile warrior who has excellent physical ability and even uses magic. And the King is the very king of orcs who is even stronger than the General, has higher intelligence, and also commands his subordinates to take organized actions.I came to the lowest boss room where the Orc King was waiting. The bosses here are one Orc King and two generals. Also, 10 subordinates consisting of Highs, Mages, and Priests will appear randomly.This time there are 4 highs, 2 mages and 4 priests.\u201cGuoooooo\u201dKing notices me who opened the door of the boss room and raises his sword.I calmly fired Nikov at the priest. when it ran out of bullets, I create a smokescreen to hide. Then, after hiding using the \u3010Concealment\u3011 skill, I move towards the Mages and Priests to deal with them first in the usual way by firing Nikov. And then, the Highs were also dealt with.There are only three left.One of the generals shoots an arrow of fire. I hurriedly jumped sideways to dodge it. At that moment, another general shoot an arrow of fire which makes me unable to avoid it this time.I use the \u3010Wind Magic\u3011 skill to move the wind to blow it away, and fire Nikov in rapid succession.Dandan DandanOne of the generals was hit on the left shoulder. He moaned that seems to be painful. The King touches the general and casts healing magic.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgMeanwhile, another general shoots an arrow of fire at me.As expected, it is troublesome to do anything when the king is still alive.I use the smokescreen again to activate the \u3010Concealment\u3011 skill again and hide.The King and the General took a formation that keeps their backs together. It\u2019s an action that shows they understand that I\u2019ll appear from behind them to attack.But this time my aim was not that. I throw a pepper-filled water balloon that blinded the Goblin Lord at King\u2019s face.\u201cGugaaaaa\u201dWhen the King holds his eyes down, the Generals trembled.I didn\u2019t miss the chance and kept shooting Nikov at the two generals until I ran out of bullets.The Generals weren\u2019t moving anymore.The King looks at me with blood lust. It seems the blindfold has been healed and he is unharmed.Even though Nikov\u2019s bullet hits the King, it couldn\u2019t penetrate his skin. Probably it didn\u2019t have enough power to penetrate.I switch to Kalashi. And at that moment, the King started rushing towards me. Judging from the situation so far, he probably thought that he would not be damaged.He has great intelligence even though He\u2019s a monster.However, Kalashi\u2019s bullets are FMJ bullet that specializes in penetrating power.I held Kalashi, aimed at King\u2019s head, and triggered it.Dandandandandandandandandandandandandandandandan \u2026\u2026Dosa~tsuLike that, the King became a corpse.\u201cOkay, with this it\u2019s over.\u201dI recovered the magic stone and proceeded to the room with the Dungeon core. There is a treasure chest in front of the Dungeon core.When I slowly opened the treasure chest, there was a bracelet in it.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Name: Fertility braceletDescription: A bracelet with a prayer for the prosperity of descendants. Women equipped with this bracelet are more likely to give birth.Grade: EpicPrice: 10,000,000,000 cents\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Oh, that\u2019s right. I remembered. It is an event item.Is this what signifies orcs nature! (TL:- did my best to translate the tsukkomi, here is the raw \u30aa\u30fc\u30af\u3067\u305d\u308c\u3063\u3066\u305d\u3046\u3044\u3046\u4e8b\u304b\uff01 do comment me if it needs to be changed)The memory of my previous life where I use to add such Tsukkomi is revived.However, this thing is too valuable. It will be hard to cash this one. Let\u2019s take it as a source of funds for the worst case.When I picked up the fertility bracelet, I touched the Dungeon core and moved outside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Enjoy the 2nd last chapter of this arc.\u2013AninsarI\u2019m finally 13 years old.Thanks to the level-ups due to high-speed laps in the Orc Dungeon for about half a year, the achievements of orc hunting has accumulated, resulting in acquiring the Orc slayer title. Thanks to this, my rank increased to D, and the level also went up to 23. I heard that I have to take an escort request to reach rank C. But I don\u2019t have any intention of doing it yet.Also, I refused the party invitation from my seniors, saying that I want to train alone for a while.By the way, it seems that there has been a lot of fuss about the fact that orcs have stopped appearing in Altmunt recently.Well, I want to believe it is not my fault.I have also saved money thanks to the regular trade of Elven honey. Now, I need 5 million more to reach the minimum target amount.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Name: AllenRank: DAge: 13Blessing:\u3016Wind God\u3017Skills:\u3010Concealment\u3011\u3010Appraisal\u3011\u3010Alchemy\u3011\u3010Wind Magic\u3011\u3010Multiple Chant\u3011\u3010No Chant\u3011Place of residence: LurdenMoney: 15,457,109Level: 23Strength: DMagical power: BAchievements: Goblin Dungeon Conqueror, Goblin Slayer, Orc slayer\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500(TL:- I don\u2019t know why but the author didn\u2019t add the Orc Dungeon Conqueror achievement.)Also, the people in the elf village were doing well, and the airport was also maintained.The runway is only 300 meters long because I didn\u2019t want to cut through the forest much. Also, I\u2019m not worried about the landing because the brake function of Buitor has been strengthened. Also, The spirits of the wind help by providing a moderate headwind at the time of takeoff. So, VTOL is possible.By the way, in the village, it seems that it is usually used as a playground for children and as a place for practising archery. Even in the village, no one complains about it.Now, I\u2019m not able to raise my level anymore in the Orc Dungeon, so I\u2019m going to challenge a high difficulty dungeon.The dungeon which I\u2019m going to challenge next is the Dungeon of the Wind Mountain. The recommended capture level in the game is 30, the Orc Dungeon was 15, and the Valley of the Flying Dragon is 25. So you can imagine how difficult it is.By the way, the Dungeon of the Wind Mountain is a famous dungeon that was already discovered, and a capturing race was held by the famous adventurers.As of now, the deepest floor record that has been traversed is only up to the 8th floor. It has a history of swallowing many famous adventurers.In the game, there were 30 floors in all. And it was a mysterious place with an empty sky even though it was located underground. The monsters that come out are all monsters that fly in the sky. Also, there were traps here and there that cannot be cleared without using wind magic.I felt nostalgic of the fact that in my previous life I got game over when I charged into it without knowing that I could not capture it until I get the \u300eBook of the Wind Magic\u300f in Marx Route or the Valley of the Flying Dragon.Leaving the story for later, the remarkable thing is that the treasures you can get in this dungeon are two \u300eSubstitute ring\u300f. And the drop from subduing the boss at the bottom is the \u300eSky Knight sword\u300f.As the name suggests, a \u300eSubstitute ring\u300f is an item that can revive the user only once even if he/she dies.And the \u300eSky Knight sword\u300f is a sword that evolves the blessing into\u3016Sky Knight\u3017when equipped by a person who has the blessing of\u3016Knight\u3017. When you become a\u3016Sky Knight\u3017, your tendency for getting \u3010Wind Magic\u3011 increases.In the game, I equipped Leonardo, the son of the Chief of the Imperial Knights, with this item to awaken him. But I remember that \u3010Wind Magic\u3011 did not play an active part because of his low magical power.By the way, the last boss of this dungeon is Blizzard Phoenix. If I fight normally, it will be a strong enemy that I can hardly win now.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgBlizzard Phoenix is a terrifying monster that blows a strong snowstorm from far above, depriving you of sight and physical strength. Also, it unilaterally shoots an ice arrow from quite a distance like a rain hail.However, the size of the dungeon boss room is limited, so it is not much one-sided.In the game, during the royal route, the trick was to defeat it by attacking the weak points with the powerful flame magic of Crown Prince Karlheinz. And if you get close enough, its defence power is not high, so you can defeat it even with a physical attack.If the physical attack goes through, my gun should also be able to handle it. With that in mind, I decided to challenge the Dungeon of the Wind Mountain.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\u201cA D-rank adventurer, Allen, is it? Solo is deadly though. Something like this at that age. Well, no problem. You can enter. But if you don\u2019t want to die, just look around the first layer only.\u201dI showed my guild card and register for a free pass at the guild in Zeiben, the town closest to the Dungeon of the Wind Mountain. This dungeon is managed by the guild and can only be entered at rank D or higher.You can enter it without permission. But if an item obtained in the dungeon under control is taken out of the dungeon by a person who was not registered for a free pass, then that person will be treated as a thief.And this dungeon is usually challenged by A-rank and B-rank adventurers, in parties. A 13-year-old, D-ranked kid like me came challenging it would seem like a reckless guy who was daredevil, only to be ridiculed.But I\u2019m going to traverse it and capture it. Rather, I will be doing high-speed laps in this dungeon until I enter school.Of course, if I stand out any more, it would lead to unexpected situations. So I\u2019m not going to report after capturing it.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aI then left the town and came to the dungeon.The first floor is no different from other dungeons. What comes out of the cave is a blood-sucking vampire bat. It is a huge vampire bat of about 1 meter in length, and are a terrifying monster that sucks up all the blood in the body when it bites.As I proceeded while using my \u3010Concealment\u3011skill, about 5 vampire bats were hanging from the ceiling.This is where the new weapon shotgun comes into play. It\u2019s a shotgun made from utilizing the results of Kalashi. I named it Saiga. The origin is, of course, the famous Russian shotgun, Saiga-12.Of course, the contents are of a magic gun that is completely different from Saiga, but it looks quite like it.It took a lot of trouble to make Saiga function properly as a shotgun, but this time it was finally complete and ready for actual battle.Doon, DoonWhen I pulled the trigger, I was able to easily defeat the Vampire bats. It feels like overkill, but the shotgun is still great.After collecting the magic stones of the Vampire bats, I quickly head to the next floor. From the second floor, even though it is underground, it is bright and even the sky is there. It\u2019s really a mysterious place.Also from here, the dungeon-like area of the wind mountain dungeon, where many bird monsters come out, continues.With Saiga in my hand, I walked deep into the dungeon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And now I have arrived on the 28th floor. This dungeon has 8 gimmick floors where wind magic is absolutely necessary to breakthrough.This floor covers 10 floating islets. But to reach the next floating islet, it is necessary to use wind magic to hit a target as small as an apple on that floating islet.Then you will be transferred to that islet.You can reach the next floor by going around these floating islets in the correct order.By the way, if you make a mistake in the order, you will either get teleported to the entrance of this floor or you will fall head-on. (TL:- I think at the end the floor judges if the order is correct or not)It was also famous as a shitty dungeon in the game. In fact, it would be quite difficult to break through here without the Wiki.By the way, if you fell, it would be game over immediately. So if I fell, my life would be game over.With that in mind, I carefully cross the islets. All the attacking monsters are shot down with Saiga, but, sadly, the defeated monsters fall as they are.Like that, I reached the 5th floating islet. There is actually a hidden gimmick here.On the north side of this islet, there is an entrance to the inside of the island. (TL:- by inside it means underground)This entrance is quite annoying. It gets smaller with each islet you cross over, i.e. the more islets you cross over the smaller the entrance gets. While cursing the evil intentions of the production team, I felt nostalgic over the memories of my previous life.Now, Normally the plan is to prepare a rope with a hook and go down the side of the floating islet along the cliff. But I have the costly cheat skill\u3010Alchemy\u3011.With the help of\u3010Alchemy\u3011skill if I make stairs to go down, then there will be no danger. Of course, if you could pay for it. It\u2019s also possible in-game.I easily invade the inside of the islet in this way. The interior was a straight passage, with a place that looks like a small altar.And on the altar that I arrived at, a pair of \u300eSubstitute ring\u300f was enshrined.In the game, there was a scene where the targeted capture character puts the \u300eSubstitute ring\u300f on the heroine Amy\u2019s finger and says \u2018Next time, I want to give the real one\u2019. Event stills were also prepared for each targeted capture character. So it was quite a famous event.This event comes after the villain daughter condemnation event. So, I don\u2019t care what happens to the event.Since my safety is the priority, I thankfully took both of the \u300eSubstitute ring\u300f. (TL:- don\u2019t want to spoil much, but, in a sense, the rings did fulfil their event purpose.)After putting one of them on the middle finger of my left hand, I hurried back.With this, I got the insurance for the worst.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aFinally, I reached the front of the boss room.Inside is Blizzard Phoenix, a dangerous monster that you would never want to face outside.I check the condition of the guns and change Saiga\u2019s bullets to slug bullets. Slug bullets are also called bear-killers. Although their range is not good, their power is enormous if they are shot from a short distance.In addition, this time, I also made a polycarbonate shield to block the attacks from reaching.Now, all preparations are done!So I barge into the boss room.The boss room is a vast dome-shaped room with a radius of about 100 meters. And the Blizzard Phoenix clad in ice was waiting, giving off a divine aura.\u201cKyeeeeeeee!\u201dThe moment the door opened, The Blizzard Phoenix, out of the blue, shot a snowstorm towards me, or rather, at the door I was invading from.I\u2019m hiding as usual with my\u3010Concealment\u3011skill. But for the time being, let\u2019s expect a surprise attack when the door opens. That seems to be Blizzard Phoenix\u2019s way.While passing through the snowstorm with the shield, I hurriedly moved outside the path of the snowstorm.Immediately after that, the Blizzard Phoenix shot an ice arrow at the place where I was.Meanwhile, I secretly approach the Blizzard Phoenix and hit it with Saiga\u2019s bullets.Doon, Doon, Doon, DoonI shot four times, but after getting hit once, It noticed me and distanced itself.However, there was a reaction. Blue blood is dripping from the Blizzard Phoenix\u2019s body.And to my surprise, the blood drops that had spilt on the floor were already frozen.I activate the Golden Combo of the\u3010Concealment\u3011skill from the smokescreen.But the Blizzard Phoenix immediately slammed me with a snowstorm.I use the shield to prevent direct hits and move out of the path.But, the Blizzard Phoenix shoots ice arrows one after another at me, who escaped from the snowstorm.It seems that I got hit by the snowstorm before hiding properly with the\u3010Concealment\u3011skill.I tried running to the side to avoid it, but I couldn\u2019t avoid it. So, I immediately put the shield forward and took the ice arrow head-on.GagagagagagagagaWhen the ice arrow crashed into the shield, it made a loud noise. The shield withstood the impact of the ice arrow, but it got frozen quickly.If it goes on like this, I won\u2019t be able to handle it.In a poor situation like this, I took a new step.\u201cForge\u201dI forge a rock of enough size to hide next to the shield, then abandon the frozen shield and hide behind the rock.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgThen, when I forge a new shield and equip it, I activate the\u3010Concealment\u3011skill and start moving.Blizzard Phoenix senses that I\u2019m gone and is flying around looking for my whereabouts.I want to hide to the last minute and aim for a headshot.Thereupon, the Blizzard Phoenix start attacking with a snowstorm, probably because he couldn\u2019t find me.As I was about to receive a snowstorm, I hastily created a rock in front of me to hide.\u201cDamn\u201dThe Blizzard Phoenix noticed me and shot an ice arrow.An overwhelming out of range attack power. But, when it comes to shooting from range, even I can do it.I switch from Saiga to Nikov. Then hold the shield in front and start shooting.DandandanThen hide behind the rock. Then again, shoot at the Blizzard Phoenix from behind the rock.I earnestly repeat this pattern of attack.\u30fb\u30fb\u30fbSuddenly the ice arrow stopped coming.When I activated the \u3010Concealment\u3011 skill and jumped out from behind the rock, I saw the figure of Blizzard Phoenix there, lying on the ground twitching.It seems it got hit in the weak points.I quickly approached and shot the Blizzard Phoenix\u2019s head with Nikov.\u201cOkay, It was a close call, but I managed to beat it.\u201dI start dismantling it.When you look at it like this, Blizzard Phoenix is very beautiful.However, most of what I thought was the beautiful ice blue wings seemed to be made of ice. I tried peeling off the ice feathers, but the peeled feathers began to melt already.Unfortunately, it seems impossible to use it as a material.It can\u2019t be helped, even so, it\u2019s quite huge. I handle the Blizzard Phoenix in the same way I handle the other monsters. By doing that, I found a magic stone around its heart, so I took it out.Thereupon, I noticed something when I looked at the gradually melting ice feathers.Oh? There is something other than ice in the tail feathers. And also on the wings.I recovered one beautiful ice-blue tail feather and two wind feathers from the remains of the melted Blizzard Phoenix.The meat is \u2026. for some reason has a very bad colour, so let\u2019s leave it.Even in the game, there was no explanation that it could be eaten.I also collect the wing bones and proceeded to the boss room. There, the familiar labyrinth core, treasure chest and pedestal are enshrined.I opened the treasure chest and took the \u300eSky Knight sword\u300f.And this pedestal is a magic stone synthesizer. The existence of this device is the reason why I wanted to come here.After all, this is a cheat device that breaks the common sense of this world.What this device can do is, synthesize the same type of magic stones and increase the size of the magic stone. In the game, two magic stones of the same size could be synthesized to one size higher. In other words, it took two tiny magic stones to make a small one, four to make a medium one, eight to make a large one, and 16 tiny magic stones to make a huge one.For example, if you defeat an ordinary goblin, you can get a tiny magic stone. It sells for around 1,500 to 2,000 cents. But the larger size trades for 30,000 cents.With this device, you can create something worth 30,000 cents with only 12,000 to 16,000 cents.So, the goblins and orc magic stones that were stored so far will be sold after being synthesized here.In this way, I put the magic stones I got while traversing this dungeon on the pedestal and synthesized them, then transferred to the entrance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And even after paying 20 million for entrance and tuition fees, I will still have plenty of savings. It\u2019s thanks to that pedestal that I was able to make so much money. It can be said that my life as an adventurer is quite successful.To begin with, I didn\u2019t intend to raise my rank to C. But when the Orc Slayer achievement pop-up in my guild card, pressure from the authorities intensified. Also, master was pushing me for becoming the youngest C ranker. So when I took an escort and subdue thieves request at the age of 14 years old, I ranked up.Also, my level is 37. Comparing to the game, it is a level where you can win the final battle with Anastasia, who succumb to darkness.So far, my swordsmanship didn\u2019t play any role in battle. But the sword training I asked from master was indispensable. Thanks to that, I managed to pass the entrance examination for swordsmanship, even though I couldn\u2019t beat the examiner. Needless to say, I passed the magic test. If anything, it was harder to adjust my strength so that I wouldn\u2019t stand out too much.By the way, I use the \u3010Concealment\u3011skill to hide all of my skills and blessings except \u3010Wind Magic\u3011. Given that, If a student with so many skills enrols in school, then he/she will definitely get involved in some trouble.The fact that I shouldn\u2019t stand out until the villain daughter condemnation event is very important. By that time, the only things that will be different from the original should be the circumstances related to the \u300eScroll of Appraisal\u300f, and a mob character, i.e. me getting mixed with the school environment.All I need to do is, let the events proceed as much as possible according to the game, and stop the condemnation event, which in turn will stop the villain daughter Anastasia from succumbing to darkness. Doing that will save me, my mother, my master, Monica-san, my seniors, and additionally, all the people who live in the royal capital.Let\u2019s do it!\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aAnd like that, the season where the Sakura petals danced in the air came. I finally got enrolled in the royal high school- the stage of the otome game.I pass through the gates of the Royal High School wearing a brand new uniform with a blazer. From there, I head to the auditorium, which is the venue for the entrance ceremony.At the entrance of the auditorium, the results of the entrance examination are posted in order from top to bottom. The student\u2019s classification is also written.1st place Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett (Noble)2nd place Allen (special)3rd place Amy von Brayes (Noble)4th place Markus von Beinz (Noble)5th place Claude Justine de Westerdale (Noble)6th place Oscar von Wimlet (Noble)7th place Margaret von Altomund (Noble)\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb11th place Karlheinz Bartille von Centraren (Noble)\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb21st place Leonardo von Jukes (Noble)\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 Below, B class \u2500\u2500\u2500\u250022nd place Vandaren von Ceben (Noble)23rd place Heide Marie Asmus (general)This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org24th place Isabella von Luinberg (Noble)\u30fb\u30fb39th place Glen Weitberg (general)It seems, this year they are accepting a total of 39 students. The parentheses after the name seem to indicate the type of examination. (Noble) is for an aristocrat, (Special) is for a scholarship student, and (General) is for general. By the way, being a scholarship student only gives the benefit of exemption from the written examination, no other support such as exemption from tuition fees are given.And for some reason, I ended up in class A. I didn\u2019t want to get involved in the event, so I would have preferred class B, but \u2026Well, it can\u2019t be helped. In class A, everyone except me is of course aristocrats. Even in class B, there are only 3 commoner students.I sat on the back corner seat of class A so that I don\u2019t stand out.Anyway, I\u2019m not allowed to start a conversation with my classmates. According to what I learned in the etiquette class before enrollment, it is profane to start talking to aristocrats as a commoner.In other words, it seems that it is forbidden to speak until you\u2019re asked from the other side. And even if you talk to him/her once, you are not allowed to talk to him/her if the other side does not allow you.I don\u2019t want to stand out from the beginning, so this is fine. But I enrolled with normal expectations, So it\u2019s quite shocking that from the start I\u2019ll be lonely.After waiting for a while, all at once, the students came in.Anastasia came in with her entourage. As expected of her ridiculous beauty. Unlike an ordinary person like me, there is an elegant and inaccessible aura around her. Even though she is such a beauty, she looks like a statue because of her expressionlessness.Anastasia glanced at me, but seemingly uninterested she sat down in the front row.Then, His Imperial Highness Prince Karl Heinz comes in. The remaining four capture target are also here in full force. All of them are releasing a terrible handsome aura.If it was a girl who had played the game, she would have gone squeaky in this place, but when I see them, I get sick.In-game, I had to increase their interest. As I don\u2019t have that kind of hobby, I suffered a lot of mental damage.They also glanced at me and sat next to Anastasia.Then came Amy, the heroine with the characteristic pink hair. She was a baron\u2019s daughter and have been raised as a commoner until just a few months ago.When I glanced at her, she came closer to me and called out with a sweet voice like sugar.\u201cGood morning. I\u2019m, Amy von Brayes. You\u2019re the Scholarship student, Allen-san, right? Nice to meet you.\u201dImpossible1! At this entrance ceremony, the heroine should have been thrilled to see the crown prince.\u201cNice to meet you, Amy-sama. I\u2019m Allen, commoner Allen. Be Kind to me.\u201dI pretend to be calm and answered her.\u201cAllen-san, you got a perfect score in all subject and graduated by skipping class at the age of 11, right? At that time, I was a commoner and attended the same school, That\u2019s why I remember you being the hot topic in gossips.\u201dAmy looks up at me with a slight blush and glittering eyes.cu-cute.As expected of the heroine of an Otome Game. No wonder that the capture targets fall for this cuteness.However, in the game, did the character spoke in such a sweet and stupid way?Anyway, my school life started with a feeling of turmoil from the beginning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As expected, I\u2019m alone. No one talks to me.I became the perfect lonely guy.By the way, Amy was the only one who talked to me on the day of admission. She seemed to have successfully completed the meeting event with the crown prince and has lost interest in me.The crown prince is also taking care of Amy\u2019s this and that, saying \u2018Amy-san was a commoner before, so she would have trouble understanding many things\u2019. But it seems that I, a real commoner, have no use for him. So I get ignored in the classroom.If we pass each other in the hallway, I have to bow my head. So I don\u2019t get the chance to talk to him. By the way, private rooms are given in the dormitory. But, the buildings are different for the aristocrats and the commoners. So meeting each other is not possible.I expected to get ignored by others. But, after being spoken to once, getting ignored become mentally harder.Today, there should be an event where Amy, who should have\u3016healing\u3017blessing, uses healing magic. Orientation of the classes is also over. Full-scale lessons will begin from today.The first class is on magic exercise.I followed the aristocratic classmates to the training ground.\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s start the lesson. It may be boring for those who can already use magic. But, learning the basics of controlling it well comes first.\u201dThe teacher explains so while addressing the students.\u201cPeople who can use magic already raise their hands\u201dIn response to the teacher\u2019s call, everyone\u2019s hand went up. Of course, I also raise my hand.Hmmm? in the first place, since there was a magical entrance exam, so everyone can use it when they enter the school, right?Is it possible to enrol without using magic?Gununu. It\u2019s not like it was a waste of effort, but it\u2019s kind of disappointing.\u201cOkay. Then, Crown Prince Karlheinz. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s simple, can you show us a little?\u201d\u201cAh, leave it to me.\u201dWith that said, the crown prince comes forward and start chanting with full confidence. I don\u2019t know what he is saying because he is far away. But when he created a fireball, he threw it toward the target, which hit it directly.clap clap clap\u2026Everyone from the class burst into applause. So, wrapped in it, I also applaud.By the way, the crown prince has the blessings of\u3016fire magic\u3017and\u3016hero\u3017, just like the protagonist of a story. In the game, the\u3016hero\u3017blessing effects were like buffing yourself and your friends when you lead them.\u201cIn this way, if you control it correctly, you will be able to hit it firmly even if it is so far away. On the contrary, if you do not control it, you will not hit the target, or in the worst case, it may run out of control and backfire.\u201dThe teacher explains the precautions for using magic.\u201cThen, next is Anastasia-sama.\u201d\u201cOkay\u201dAnastasia comes forward when she was called by the teacher. At this time, Anastasia and the Crown Prince didn\u2019t even look at each other, let alone exchange words. No, Anastasia thanked the prince, but the prince ignored it.Apparently, the relationship between the two is still quite awkward.Anastasia creates an ice arrow and shoots at the target. The ice arrow shot by Anastasia destroys the target and stops after hitting the wall behind it.clap clap clap\u2026Again Everyone burst into applause. Apparently, At present Anastasia has better magical abilities than the Crown Prince.By the way, Anastasia\u2019s blessings are\u3016Ice Magic\u3017and\u3016Knight\u3017. The only characters who have two blessings are the Crown Prince and Anastasia.However, the prince thought that his fianc\u00e9 has disgraced his honour. His face turned bright red and demanded a do-over.\u201cAnastasia, destroying the target even though I was unable to. Do you want to disgrace my honour?\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t want to \u2026 I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201dAnastasia says so and bows silently.\u201cEnough, I\u2019ll show you my full power.\u201dAfter saying that, the crown prince begins chanting.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cYour Highness, don\u2019t!\u201dAnastasia tries to stop the prince, but it was too late. The prince creates a huge fireball on hand.\u201cKu, Uu\u201d\u201cYour Highness!\u201dThe crown prince moans, and Anastasia\u2019s voice similar to scream echoes.And the next moment, the crown prince\u2019s fireball went out of control.The fireball explodes at hand, and the flame spreads wrapping around the entire area. But, the very next moment, Anastasia froze the surroundings and quickly extinguished the prince\u2019s runaway flames.\u201cYour Highness!\u201d\u201cKarl-sama!\u201dAmy, while looking worried rush to the prince with a sweet voice. Then she used healing magic to heal the burned crown prince.\u201cWha?\u201dAnastasia stares at the situation with a surprised expression. Also, the teachers watching didn\u2019t stop the treatment.About 10 minutes after that, the prince\u2019s burns were completely healed.Hmmm? Did it take so long? Wasn\u2019t it just described in the game?\u201cAmy, this is \u2026\u201dWith that said, the crown prince stares at Amy in a surprised manner.\u201cYour Highness! Are you okay?\u201dAnastasia tries to hand a handkerchief to the prince. but the prince refuses it and stands up. While putting his hands on Amy\u2019s shoulders the prince thanked her.Ah, it was there. An event still like this.\u201cThank you, Amy. What a wonderful power it is.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s, I was just praying for Karl-sama \u2026\u201dWhen Anastasia\u2019s saw this situation, her eyebrows twitched, but she turned her back and went away without saying anything.Was it my imagination, or did I saw Amy glanced at Anastasia\u2019s situation with a slight grin on her mouth?\u201cToday\u2019s class is over. Now that you know what magic is like, let\u2019s train hard from today. That\u2019s it dismiss.\u201dWhen the teacher said so, he quickly left the training ground.Anyway, this was the event. The teacher who did not stop it properly was also a teacher. And the crown prince, who was disgraced by his fiance, threw childish opposition and messed up the lesson. He treats the original saviour who stopped the runaway magic, the villain daughter, his fianc\u00e9, wickedly and thanked Amy only.Even though it\u2019s a loose and convenient otome game event, it doesn\u2019t feel good after watching such a funny farce.Though I think so, I can\u2019t do anything now. I obediently left the training ground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29Chapter 29 \u2013 Villager A is overwhelmed by the atmosphere of the class:-5 more chapters after that, the side stories (POV of Anastasia) will come, which I enjoyed the most in this novel.Though short, enjoy the chapter.\u2013AninsarEver since Amy treated the crown prince, who got injured by his runaway magic, she was harassed more or less, which may be a natural consequence.For example, when Amy enters the classroom, some students deliberately ignores her while gossiping quietly, but with a voice loud enough for her to hear, about the rumours, such as she has negligible mana, a former commoner, has poor manners, a prostitute\u2019s child, etc are true or not.I\u2019ve also heard rumours that, in the girl\u2019s dormitory, she can\u2019t find her belongings in her room sometimes. About this one, I\u2019m not familiar with it.In the game, the harassment in the school was lead by Anastasia\u2019s so-called entourages.In the game, because they disappeared from school after the civil war, it seems there was no clear description about them. It was written that some aristocrats were crushed, so they quit school. I think that\u2019s what happened to them, probably.By the way, I have witnessed many times that Anastasia was careful not to get herself involve in such low and worthless harassments when she sees such scenes.I usually use \u3010Concealment\u3011 to collect information, but when I saw her at that time, Anastasia was careful, so I think she was thinking about trying to stop it.By the way, Amy, on the other hand, is sneaking up on the crown princes and the other capture targets with a cat-like voice, ignoring all the bullyings. It seems that her character is quite different from Amy in the game. Well, the game did not show any scenes other than the event. So it may have been this way.Besides, a girl who has lived as a commoner suddenly gets taken over by the Baron family and enrolled in a school full of aristocrats and gets bullied. If the crown prince and the sons of influential aristocrats take cares of her, then it may be unavoidable to fall for them while relying on them.Well, because of such circumstances, the atmosphere of the class is already the worst.The girls in the class divide themselves into Anastasia\u2019s and Crown Prince\u2019s faction.Anastasia\u2019s faction did want to eliminate Amy, as I explained earlier. But they don\u2019t seem to have much going on because Anastasia herself has stopped doing anything. Also, their number is overwhelmingly small.On the other hand, The Crown Prince\u2019s faction is not monolithic. They appear to be using Amy to oust Anastasia. However, the Crown Prince\u2019s faction doesn\u2019t care about Amy. So they are often seen backbiting and harassing her.In addition, the crown prince has a lot of problems in his behaviour. Despite having a fianc\u00e9, he only spends his time with Amy. He does not even talk to Anastasia, except when necessary.It seems that the people around me are planning to oust Anastasia because of that. But honestly, I want them to do stop doing sloppy things.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgWhether it\u2019s royalty or aristocrats, they\u2019re collecting taxes from the commoners and living a luxurious life. So I want them to at least fulfil their responsibilities.Especially the crown prince has to unite the country as the future king, but what he does is intolerable. Anastasia is the daughter of the Duke of Ramslet, who controls the southern breadbasket, which boasts the country\u2019s largest wheat production.You can understand the meaning of this marriage of convenience, right!On the other hand, Amy is Baroness Brayes, from a so-called ordinary aristocratic family. She is not particularly poor or rich, but that doesn\u2019t mean she has strong connections.For the like of Brayes family, it would be profitable if Amy becomes queen even if she was an ordinary child. But for the country, the disorder is inevitable.Looking back on the history of this country that I have learned, there are many stories of the queens, who had a weak backing at her parent\u2019s house, being replaced by the daughter of a high-ranking aristocrat. For example, she was forced to divorce when her parent\u2019s house collapsed or was not suitable. Or she was assassinated when it was terrible.Therefore, for the benefit of this country, the crown prince should take Anastasia as a queen and Amy as a royal concubine,i.e. a mistress.For the time being, this country is monogamous, so he can\u2019t have a concubine. But the rich are openly flirting with their mistress, and I\u2019ve never heard anyone blaming them.Well, after all, this world is the world of that annoying otome game. And according to fate, the royal capital and I, my mother, master, Monica-san, and my senior adventurers are all on the road to ruin.Feeling depressed, I let out a big sigh and walked to the classroom.Like that, today also, the day of sitting around the corner of the classroom as air began.Oh, by the way, I\u2019ve successfully established the position of a statue. Nobody talks to me, and I\u2019m a commoner, so I can\u2019t talk to aristocrats except when necessary in class. Perhaps they think my presence is thin, so they don\u2019t care about my whereabouts all the time. Probably I\u2019m treated as a commoner who can only study.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

While on the other hand, Amy seems to have managed to complete the events smoothly. She is surrounded, and treated like a princess, by not only the crown prince but also the other capture targets.Of course, the capture targets other than the crown prince are also aristocrats. And except Claude, the third prince of the neighbouring country, they all have fiances. Since their fianc\u00e9es were not enrolled in the school, so no problems have occurred. But the ripples were spreading after all. Personally, I think it would be nice if Amy could only stick together with Prince Claude, who has no fianc\u00e9.Well, It seems Amy is aiming for the reverse Harem route.Of course, I\u2019m not sure yet.Well, looking at Amy and Co, it seems that the distance to the crown prince is the closest, but at the same time, the distance to the other capture targets is also quite close. And at this time, this much intimacy with Prince Claude only happens in Claude\u2019s and reverse Harem route. Furthermore, in Claude\u2019s route, the flag with the Chief knight\u2019s son Leonardo has already been broken. So Leonardo should be a little away from Amy.If so, the flow will be almost the same as the Crown Prince\u2019s route, which has the advantage of being easy to read.Now, I head towards the auditorium to attend the closing ceremony. There, a crowd was gathering around the wall of the auditorium, where the test results of the final exam were posted.\u2014-1st place Allen (500)2nd place Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett (497)3rd place Amy von Brayes (479)4th place Markus von Beinz (458)5th place Claude Justine de Westerdale (438)6th place Margaret von Altmunt (423)\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb12th place Oscar von Wimlet (413)13th place Heide Marie Asmus (412)14th place Karlheinz Bartille von Centraren (411)\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb28th place Vandaren von Ceben (386)29th place Isabella von Luinberg (385)\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb38th Glenn Weitberg (375)39th place Leonardo von Jukes (321)\u2014-Oh, it seems I was able to get a perfect score.However, it is natural to get a perfect score, because even the Japanese Middle school students are studying more advanced contents than this.But, Still, I did my homework to study for the preparation and review test.After all, I\u2019m a commoner. Poor grades can result in dropout, so I have to keep my grades as good as possible.It seems that the classification after the summer vacation will be decided by comprehensively judging this result with the results of the magic and swordsmanship exam, the results of free research during the summer vacation, and the social status.Huh, social status. Seriously.Speaking of which, the Chief knight\u2019s son\u2019s grade is the lowest. Is this okay?Well, even in the game, there was a description that the results were not good. And there must have been an event in which Amy became friendly and taught the subjects while increasing the likability. But, what is going on?Perhaps because they were busy teaching kindly to Amy, who is in 3rd place, how to co-up with her surroundings, they got stuck with this grade \u2026 No way, that is the case, or is it?Well, the story has derailed, so let\u2019s return to the current situation.In my case, I don\u2019t have any social status, the test is perfect, and the magic test was adjusted to a little weaker than the son of the Court magician. Though swordsmanship is no match for opponents who have blessings and skills, I think I still have a good point in it. Maybe it\u2019s a little above the average.So my evaluation by the school teachers seems to be a commoner with average wind magic abilities, maybe?That\u2019s why I wouldn\u2019t drop out of school with this result.I turn my heels back and enter the auditorium. Then, after waiting for a while, the boring closing ceremony begins. When I return to the class after listening to the long story of a great man, the homeroom begins.Then, by calling each person\u2019s name, the answer sheet is returned.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cAllen-kun, you were the only one with a perfect score. I heard that you were a genius since the beginning of our school system, but you have shown your talent without regret. Everyone, Please give Allen-kun a big round of applause.\u201dWhen I was called and went to the front, the teacher said that. Although I\u2019m happy about it, I still feel a little troubled as I didn\u2019t want to stand out so much.Besides, the aristocrats will not applaud the commoners anyway.I thought so, but there is one person who is applauding me.It was Anastasia, who was scratched from the first place. And the noble daughters who surround her, who seems to have a relatively close relationship with Anastasia, also applauds me.I deeply thanked Anastasia and everyone else for their applause then returned to my seat.Then, when everyone\u2019s answers sheets were returned, the contents of the free research during the summer vacation were explained. It seems that anything can be done, and no evaluation criteria are there.Ah, I see. In other words, it is like that.This is a well-established school with a strong social disposition. And this free research is used as an evaluation standard for classification, as you can\u2019t put a great aristocrat in the lower class.Huh. not again.But I don\u2019t get bothered by it. I can listen to the elf folklore and put it together in a report, or if I want to, I can also make a report on the discovery of the Orc Dungeon or the other achievements.There is a ruin exploration event for Amy and the capture targets, but there is nothing to intervene in it. In the first place, all I have to do is, stop Anastasia from getting angry and cause the so-called otome game template events. Then, Anastasia, who had stopped bullying Amy, would be completely acquitted.I don\u2019t know how much effective it will be in this country where social status and power speaks for themselves, but I\u2019ll do what I can.When the homeroom was over and I left my seat to return to the dormitory, Anastasia called out to me.\u201cHey, Allen, right?\u201dI hurriedly put my right hand on my chest, and my left hand behind my waist then turned and knelt to thank the vassals.It\u2019s a tone that doesn\u2019t seem like a duke\u2019s daughter. But, even in the game, Anastasia always spoke in this tone when talking to a person of lower status. I was surprised at first and had a preconceived notion that she must be a proud villain daughter like character. But it feels nostalgic seeing like this.However, I humble myself as a person of lower status without regret.\u201cYes. I am honoured to have Anastasia-sama remember my name.\u201d\u201cGood. We\u2019re in school. So You don\u2019t have to show such respect. Stand up.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI got permission and stand up.\u201cYou are qualified as an adventurer, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHave you ever entered the Dungeon?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s Goblin Dungeon, I have.\u201d\u201cI see. Okay. I\u2019ll send a messenger later. I\u2019m sorry for stopping you.\u201d\u201cYes\u201dWith that, Anastasia walked away along with her entourage.Will a messenger come?Did I get noticed by her?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So it took some time to translate the chapter.(\u273d\u00b4\u0f6b`\u273d)Anyways, enjoy the chapter next one will be interesting.\u2013AninsarWell, Since the school\u2019s figurine lifestyle has come to a halt, I was thinking of traversing the Dungeon of the Wind Mountain to make money. But something unexpected happened.On the third day of summer vacation, I\u2019m at the entrance to the northeastern forest, where the ruins in which I got the \u300eScroll of Appraisal\u300f is there. Other than me, Anastasia, the Crown Prince &amp; the other capture targets with Amy, is also present.\u201cHis Highness, and everyone present here, thank you for your time today.\u201dI kneel and thank my vassals.\u201cOh\u201dThe crown prince said so bluntly.Apparently, he isn\u2019t interested in me at all. He is watching Amy with affectionate eyes while Anastasia looks at such a prince with cold eyes.By the way, the reason why everyone came to such a place was that I was asked by Anastasia to help the princes in their independent research.Even if it is a request from the Duke\u2019s daughter, to a commoner like me it is actually an order. So I don\u2019t have the option to decline it. If I refuse, it is obvious that I will be kicked out of the school.Well, for the time being, I\u2019m grateful that I\u2019ll be able to submit it under a joint name. But, I\u2019m a person of low status. Therefore, I\u2019m sure from writing the manuscript to proofreading the report. I have to do it alone. So it feels complicated.Now, I\u2019ve complained a lot. In short, this is an event where the heroine Amy gets the \u300eScroll of Appraisal\u300f in the game.Even in the game, during the prince route or the reverse harem route when the prince was a member, Anastasia followed along and hired an outside adventurer to guide him for safety.However, it seems that the event has changed a little because a foreign element called me is mixed in the school. Perhaps Anastasia thought it would be better to use a convenient adventurer in class for free than to hire an unknown adventurer from outside.On the other hand, the fact that all the capture targets are here means that Amy is aiming for the reverse Harem.You know, it is quite difficult to clear the reverse harem route. I have to move around and set flags thoroughly, but apparently, Amy is doing well.I think it\u2019s mentally irritating when the girl I like gets intimate with my friends one after another. But it seems that everyone here isn\u2019t like that.However, Amy seems to be quite disliked by the girls in her class, and bullying seems to be gradually escalating.Well, Anastasia doesn\u2019t seem to be involved in that, and it doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201cWell, are you all ready? If you don\u2019t mind, then I will guide you all to the ruins.\u201d\u201cOh, no problem.\u201d\u201cThen I will move on. Along the way, there is a horned rabbit monster called Horn-Rabbit. If you\u2019re not careful, you may get stabbed by the horn and get injured.\u201d\u201cHuh. Who are you referring to? As if I will lose to the likes of a Horn-Rabbit?\u201dPrince Claude said so as if trying to make a fool of me.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cI also have been training firmly to become the knight leader in future.\u201d\u201cThe likes of Horn-Rabbit, I\u2019ll kill it with a single blow.\u201d\u201cHuh. I\u2019ll make a barbecue of such Horn-Rabbit.\u201d\u201cHey, if you burn the Horn-Rabbit, only charcoal will remain.\u201dOthers also verbally oppose my words. Firstly, Leonardo, Oscar, Markus, and finally Prince Karlheinz.By the way, I don\u2019t think I could eat the Horn-Rabbit even if it was roasted, without draining the blood properly. But I decided not to put in a tsukkomi.\u201cAh, Umm. I\u2019m sure Allen-san was worried, so he said that.\u201dAmy speaks with a strangely sweet voice to the capture target.\u201cOh, as expected. Amy will care for the commoners also.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my Amy.\u201d\u201cHey, Amy doesn\u2019t belong to Claude, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. She is mine, right?\u201d\u201cNo, she is mine\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s \u2026 I \u2026\u201dThere is a nauseating exchange going on in front of me. When I glance at Anastasia, she was giving a frozen look on the crown prince and Co.When Anastasia noticed my gaze, for a moment, she had a slightly embarrassed expression on her face. But soon after, she coldly told the six people with a frozen expression again.\u201cYour Highness, His Majesty will be worried if it\u2019s too late. Let\u2019s start.\u201dThe crown prince, who had a slightly sullen expression, clicked his tongue, perhaps because he was angry at the fact that his sweet mood got watered by this exchange.\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s start. Now, move.\u201dI couldn\u2019t say anything, No matter what, he is a crown prince. I can\u2019t be rude. I expressionlessly gave a small reply, \u201cYes,\u201d and guided them to the ruins.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Though the fever has gone, I still feel a little weak.Secondly, Sorry for 1 release this week. I will try to release 3 chapters next week.Anyways, enjoy the chapter folks. Anastasia\u2019s POV is just after 2 more chapters.\u2013Aninsar\u201cThere is a moss called Luminous Moss (TL:- it was called \u2018Akarigoke\u2019 in the raw, which means \u2018moss emanating light\u2019) in this ruin, which illuminates the inside with a decent amount of brightness. Therefore, there is no need for lights such as torches and lanterns at this ruin. But do note that this is not the case with other Dungeons or ruins.\u201dWhen we arrived at the ruins, I spoke the lines of the adventurer who guided the princes &amp; Co. in the game. I should proceed as much as possible according to the game to avoid uncontrollable situations.Amy, who heard my lines, was looking at me while muttering something. When I noticed it, I instinctively asked her.\u201cAmy-sama? Is there any problem?\u201d\u201cEh? ah, umm, as expected, adventurers are so familiar with it.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Thank you. If you have any concerns, please feel free to voice it.\u201dI feel a little uncomfortable with how she said those lines with a strangely sweet voice.I proceed into the ruins with this discomfort, without understanding what it is.\u201cWow, amazing. The walls shine so much. It\u2019s beautiful \u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, but Amy is more beautiful, you know?\u201dAmy is impressed by the scenery, and the Crown Prince praises such Amy. It\u2019s the same as the interactions in the game.Anastasia looks at these two people with cold eyes.Like that, we arrive at the end of the ruin. Then Amy tries to move to the left, so I stop her.\u201cAmy-sama, there\u2019s just a small room with nothing in it.\u201d\u201cEh? Is that so?\u201dAmy asks me so with a sweet voice.\u201cAmy wants to see it. It\u2019s okay for a little bit, right?.\u201d\u201cUnderstood\u201dAs expected, the crown prince covers up for such Amy, so I move into the small room on the left. And Amy, who came in after me, walked straight towards the right back corner of the small room as if being sucked into it.Ah, I see. Is it like that?\u201cAs Allen said, there is nothing in this room.\u201dAnastasia leaked her thoughts. There, while seeing Amy\u2019s actions, I remembered a perfect story and got on Anastasia\u2019s soliloquy to hit a jab on her.\u201cYes. It seems that the goblins were nesting in this site about seven years ago. At that time, I was still a child. So I couldn\u2019t participate in the subjugation. But, what I heard from the seniors in the Adventurer\u2019s Guild is that it seems, in this room, the goblins stored their collected treasures. However, since all the adventurers brought them back during the subjugation, there is nothing left now. \u201cOf course, I hide the fact that I secretly stole the \u300eScroll of Appraisal\u300f and picked up the silver coins.\u201cI see. Did something like that also happened?\u201dAnastasia nodded as if impressed with my explanation. Her expression was not frozen as before but had a tinge of girlishness suitable for her age.Amy, while listening to our conversation, moved to the other corner, then checked the ground and whispered something.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cHmm? Amy, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cEh? um-umm, nothing.\u201dWhen the Crown Prince, worried about Amy\u2019s suspicious behaviour, asked her about it. Amy replied in a hurry. As expected, there is a familiarness in her actions.Well, I haven\u2019t confirmed it yet. But I wonder if Amy knows about this world like me, that is, that Otome game\u2019s settings.Considering the point that she wanted to enter this small room, the point that she walked to the right-back of the room, and the point that she examined the opposite corner. It seems she wanted the \u300eScroll of Appraisal\u300f and the game mode, which I\u2019ve confirmed, from the silver coin.Well, the \u300eScroll of Appraisal\u300f should have dropped in any of the easy, normal, and hard modes of the game. And there shouldn\u2019t be any other game modes.What did Amy think of this situation?\u201cHey, let\u2019s move on. Guide me.\u201d\u201cOkay\u201dWhen the Crown Prince ordered me, I stopped thinking and resumed to guide around the ruins.After, I guided around, collected herbs and observed blue slime. We came to the deepest part of the ruins, where the Dungeon core was said to have existed when this ruin was a Dungeon in the past.\u201cThis is the part where the Dungeon core was said to be when it was a Dungeon. However, I don\u2019t know when it disappeared and why it disappeared. I don\u2019t even know if this was really a dungeon or not.\u201dWhen I explain that, Anastasia curiously dug around the wall. Amy, on the other hand, is boringly playing with her hair. Perhaps, she\u2019s no longer interested.\u201cChi, I didn\u2019t get to see a big monster in such a place.\u201d\u201cHis Highness Claude, aren\u2019t we with Amy? Shouldn\u2019t we be pleased that the danger was low?\u201d\u201cNo, Markus. There can be no danger to Amy because I am with her.\u201d\u201cLeo, the best way to protect your loved one is to stay away from danger, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cHuh? It seems Markus is not confident in protecting Amy from danger. If it\u2019s me, I can protect her in a cool way, though.\u201dFor what the hell did these guys came here? Even if Amy is capturing them, if the future Lords with authority acts like this, won\u2019t the future of this country be in jeopardy?In this way, the charmed reverse harem\u2019s ruins exploration date, which was also a ruins survey for independent research, ended with sharp mental damage for me.Hmm? But in the game, Anastasia was quite sarcastic about Amy, who was clinging to the crown prince. It seems nothing happened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Thanks again, everyone, for worrying about me. Enjoy the chapter.\u2013AninsarWell, the long summer vacation, which seemed short, was over in no time. After that exploration, I had to write a report, so my remaining vacation got spent on it. In the end, I couldn\u2019t go to the Elven Village or the Dungeon of the Wind Mountain.The reason, Anastasia\u2019s enthusiasm was not satisfied with it.Now, from where should I start talking?As I thought, let\u2019s start from the day after the exploration was complete.The day after the exploration, Anastasia summoned me in front of the school gate. And then we boarded a gorgeous carriage with the Ramslet family crest on it.\u201cThank you for coming. Also, thank you for guiding us yesterday. It really helped.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cNow, about the matters of making a report.\u201d\u201cYes\u201d\u201cFirst, I made an appointment with a dungeon expert, a history expert, and finally an expert in studying that ruins. We\u2019ll be listening to their explanation.\u201d\u201cEh? Do we have to do that much for independent research?\u201dI unintentionally spoke my thoughts. Because this is a summer vacation free study of junior high or high school level, it\u2019s like going to a university professor to write a report of that level.Isn\u2019t it overkill?I thought so, but it seems that was not the case for Anastasia.\u201cWell, Allen is a commoner, so for these things, you can be sloppy. But, Listen carefully. This report is for the Crown Prince, Prince Claude, and the future high aristocrats of our country.\u201dWell, having great expectations for the future is simply the fame and hard work of their ancestors. I don\u2019t think they have any potentials.\u201cYou don\u2019t know when and where you will fall short if you submit a half-hearted or incorrect report.\u201d\u201cHuh\u201d\u201cTherefore, we should listen to the opinions of experts, understand them well, and compile a report based on that.\u201d\u201cI-I understand.\u201dI\u2019m not sure how the school report will make someone fall short, but it\u2019s probably shame or something like that.Honestly, it doesn\u2019t matter whether the crown prince or the capture targets fall short, but Anastasia\u2019s sincere feelings have goodwill in them.Then let\u2019s do it to the point where everyone will praise!Even so, I graduated from a famous national university in my previous life. I\u2019ll be fine.And just like that, Anastasia successfully put me on it, so I decided to listen to the lectures of the expert teachers from various fields.Then, after receiving the lectures from each expert teacher, we went to the Royal Palace Library and searched the literature. Furthermore, the content was discussed and summarized with Anastasia in the form of a proper academic thesis. Then, we asked an expert teacher to see the report, got the feedback, and finished it as a report.By the way, annoyingly, none of the Prince &amp; Co. helped with writing this report. We decided the day to meet and issue invitations many times. But every time we receive a reply of their absence in the name of the crown prince. (TL:- I think it means the crown prince response to them on behalf of others.)In this case, no matter how much of a duke\u2019s daughter Anastasia is, she can\u2019t be forced this much.We decide to show the resulting report to the crown prince the day before the end of the summer vacation. By the way, the chief editor is supposed to be the crown prince.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgWell, he has a status, so I can\u2019t help it.But, despite all the work we did, the words of the crown prince were heartless.\u201cLong. Explain in 3 minutes so I can understand immediately. I\u2019m busy.\u201dAh, hmm. I know how it feels if you were my boss. It\u2019s like reading a thesis.But. You\u2019re a student in the same position as me, isn\u2019t it? Is it okay to speak like this from this age?I wanted to yell at him, but if I said that, I would get thrown into prison for lese-majesty.While enduring my anger, I explained it as simply as possible.After explaining the main points, the crown prince left, saying \u2018good work\u2019.I think it was amazing that I didn\u2019t yell at his back.\u201cHis Highness is that kind of person. I\u2019m sorry, but please bear with it.\u201dIt was strangely impressive that Anastasia said that with a look that gave up.That expression does not show the love and attachment to the crown prince, as shown in the game. To me, it looked like a girl who gave up and accepted her fate as a piece of a political marriage.By the way, the report that was complete in such a way naturally received high praise. As expected of his highness the Crown Prince, as expected of Prince Claude, and so on. Anastasia was also getting praised, but I got treated as a goldfish shit.I\u2019m not sure how the rumours went around. But I was treated as a scrap that got on the crown prince ride and had only his name entered.Even in such a situation, I don\u2019t have the opportunity to argue. Because I\u2019m a commoner and my opponent is an aristocrat.I was wondering what this school was for. At least, I\u2019m sure that human behaviour and such things are not present in its philosophy at all.Also, only Anastasia is saying that I participated in the discussion as the leading role. But the current situation is that where the voices of those who are trying to curry favour to the crown prince are much louder.Well, I\u2019ve to bear this kind of lifestyle for another half year. If I put up with it for half a year and make the Prince &amp; Co. tattered in a duel, I will drop out.There is a good chance that I will get executed after that, but I think I have a good relationship with Anastasia, so in the worst case, I think me and my mother will be able to escape.So, while convincing myself, I renewed my determination to endure this shit-like school life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It looks good in this way.Also, with the event in this chapter, we\u2019re closing in on the condemnation event with only one cliche event remaining.And lastly, tomorrow, I will release another chapter as promised. It\u2019ll be the long-awaited debut of the POV\u2019s starting with Anastasia\u2019s, so look forward to it.\u2013AninsarNow, autumn came. Speaking of autumn, it\u2019s the season for cultural festivals. You may be wondering why there is a cultural festival in such a world. Well, it\u2019s a Japanese otome game. So, there will be obviously a cultural festival in this school as well.In the game, it was an event in which Amy collaborated to organise an exhibition while working with the capture target. This time it looks like the reverse harem route, so it seems that all the capture targets, Amy and the villainess will be exhibiting something.By the way, at this cultural festival, you can do anything within the bounds of common sense. Also, it seems that it has nothing to do with one\u2019s grades. However, participation is mandatory.As the independent research gave a huge toll on my spirit and the event that I want to stop at this cultural festival happens in the corridor, so there is no need for me to get involved with Amy\u2019s group this time.Also, after something like that, even Anastasia wouldn\u2019t probably ask for my help.Thinking so, I decided to do an Orc meat skewer stall by myself and completed the necessary procedures.I\u2019m an adventurer. So, hunting an Orc and doing a dismantling show would be fun.When I was thinking about that, Anastasia called me.\u201cHey, Allen\u201d\u201cYes, what is it?\u201d\u201cHave you decided what you will do at the cultural festival? If not, why don\u2019t you help His Highness again?\u201dWow, really? We hadn\u2019t talked much since then, so I thought I wouldn\u2019t get asked anymore, but this was surprising.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Actually, I have already submitted an application for an Orc meat skewer stall.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Is that so? I\u2019m looking forward to it. Good luck.\u201d\u201cThank you\u201dI bow to say that, but the expression, which usually stays frozen, seems to be a little downhearted. Somehow I feel guilty.\u201cAh, but if it\u2019s absolutely necessary.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll go eat it because it\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you.\u201dAnastasia then turned back and left.No, but Amy is also suspicious, so it may be better to keep an eye on her.Thinking so, I decided to act to stop the worst.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aToday is three days before the cultural festival, and I have infiltrated the workroom of Anastasia\u2019s group.It seems the Crown Prince &amp; Co. decided to exhibit about the downtown culture of this country. In short, it looks like they have created a place where Amy can play an active role.And, just like in the game, the Crown Prince &amp; Co. are making the exhibition in a group, but No matter how you look at it, Anastasia is just moving around. It seems that Amy and the capture targets have decided everything entirely. Anastasia was not given the right to choose and is told to manage the booth.No matter how much I have to be there for the future\u2019s sake, even I\u2019ll get sick, I think.And recently, When there are no capture targets, where Amy and Anastasia are alone, Amy becomes sarcastic. Even now, she started her sarcasm again without noticing that I was watching them with \u3010Concealment\u3011.\u201cAnastasia-sama, you are still here?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s not cute like that, you\u2019re not loved by Karl-sama, you know?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Our engagement is not like that. It\u2019s for the country.\u201dIt was good that I was watching it. Apparently, the event started in an unexpected place.\u201cEh? But that kind of Karl-sama looks cute, don\u2019t you know? I\u2019m sure, Karl-sama and the citizens understand that a cute queen is more good, don\u2019t you think?\u201dWhen I heard that, it felt like the air in this room has cooled. Even though the air was cold, it wasn\u2019t like the weather changed. The air itself was physically cold.As evidence, cold air is visibly swirling around Anastasia.\u201cOh? What\u2019s wrong? It\u2019s no good. Look, the future Queen is smiling.\u201dWith that said, Amy posed with a smile and shook her neck as if to incite Anastasia. Her hands were squeezed and only the index fingers were raised such that the fingertips were placed on her left and right cheeks.She was doing the so-called cheek and finger flirty pose.Also, it was scary how Amy\u2019s face was smiling, yet her eyes weren\u2019t.\u201cAmy, are you insulting me?\u201d\u201cNoo, Anastasia-sama, you\u2019re scaring me.\u201d (Tl:- Imagine it as if doing it to anger someone.)I was getting frustrated while watching from the side. Anastasia, who is not yelling at her from this, is great.However, the conversation in the game was more flowery. It was not a terrible conversation like this.No doubt, she is trying to anger Anastasia to raise her hand.It\u2019s a pity that I can\u2019t record this because I don\u2019t have a smartphone, so I keep watching.Anastasia sighs loudly and begins her sermon, which I don\u2019t know how many times she had told her.\u201cListen, this country has a social status system. It can\u2019t be overturned even by the students of the same school. So behave yourself.\u201dHowever, Amy argues without hesitation.\u201cThat\u2019s strange because Anastasia-sama and I are both humans. Everyone is equal before God.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the story before God. I\u2019m just telling you to behave according to your status. To begin with, what do you think you are? Cuddling with men who have fianc\u00e9es. Don\u2019t do anything that will mislead others!\u201dPerhaps Anastasia\u2019s patience was running out as her voice gradually becomes louder.\u201cThat\u2019s not the case, I and Karl-sama are friends. Also, Marx, Leo, Oscar, Claude are all-important friends. Don\u2019t blame my friends!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m saying it\u2019s weird. Choose a man without a fianc\u00e9!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll not let an outsider like Anastasia-sama interfere with our friendship!\u201d\u201cWhat!?\u201dWhen the air got colder, the capture targets rushed in after hearing the noise.\u201cHey, Anastasia. What the hell are you doing? Weren\u2019t you both preparing things? Didn\u2019t I warn you not to quarrel? Can\u2019t you do that even though you usually say things while making yourself look great?\u201d\u201cHis Highness! That\u2019s, this woman!\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cKarl-sama. I only wanted to get along well, but Anastasia-sama was rude to me.\u201d\u201cHey!\u201dAt Amy\u2019s messed up explanation, Anastasia tried to protest, but the Crown Prince yells at Anastasia.\u201cShut up! Shut your impudent mouth now! It\u2019s an order!\u201d\u201cGu~tsu\u201d\u201cThe relationship between me and you is when we are outside. Don\u2019t bring that relationship to the school.\u201d\u201cUnder\u2026stood\u2026\u2026\u201dAnastasia then resumed her work with a frozen expression.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aThen, in the evening, the capture targets went out of the room with Amy. Anastasia, who had been working for a while with a frozen look, left the room with all her belongings. Perhaps she was going to take a break.I sneak out after that.And as I walked down the hallway for a while, I saw Amy standing with her back against the wall. There she smiled and said, provoking Anastasia when she passed in front of her.\u201cWhat a klutz. How do you feel about your fianc\u00e9e getting robbed?\u201dAnastasia\u2019s eyes open widely when she heard those words. Then, with her face bright red, she raised her right hand.\u201cFue-cushion\u201dAt that moment, I sneezed as loud as I could after undoing my concealment.Astonished Anastasia, stopped in her posture without swinging her right hand.\u201cOh, Oh? Anastasia-sama? And Amy-sama also? Ah, maybe you were talking? Excuse me!\u201dWhen I said that, I ran away from the place in a rush as if I happened to be there.I stopped Anastasia\u2019s actions with a perfect performance that I think is Oscar-worthy. I got out of the sight in the shadows and activated \u3010Concealment\u3011 again, then returned secretly and resumed monitoring.\u201cIt seems useless to say anything to you, but remember. Your Highness is the future king of this country. You who do not understand the role of the royal family and the aristocrat is not suitable for him. Don\u2019t approach His Highness. \u201cAnastasia said so with a frozen look and left without hitting Amy\u2019s cheek.And Amy, left on that spot, regretfully glares at her back.\u201cWhat is the meaning of this? That mob called Allen shouldn\u2019t even appear in extra mode?\u201dWhile muttering to herself, Amy also left the place. And shortly after that, the Prince &amp; Co. chased after Amy and passed in front of me.But what is an extra mode? Does that mean there was a mode I didn\u2019t play?But there was no such information even on the Wiki\u2026The content was quite different, but this was the event I was trying to stop.In the game, Anastasia, who was furious, slapped Amy\u2019s cheek, and surprised by that, Amy crouches down and begins to cry. Then, the Crown Prince and the route\u2019s capture target appears and unilaterally blames Anastasia. And the relationship between Anastasia and the Crown Prince shatters.Well, it looks like it\u2019s already collapsed.Now, I remove my concealment when I couldn\u2019t see anyone else.Also, there is one thing that is clear about this time. As expected, Amy is the same as me.I can say it definitely this time.In short, a woman who has played that game has reincarnated as Amy and is trying to follow the game scenarios to capture the reverse harem route.So that\u2019s it. As a woman, it may be a dream-like situation to get surrounded by handsome men. If I had reincarnated as the main character of a gal game, I might have aimed for the Harem route.However.I don\u2019t like it!It is the destruction of the capital city that is waiting for Amy if she proceeds with the capture targets.It is not the world of that game, but the reality in which mother, master, senior adventurers, Monica-san and all the peoples who took care of me are living.\u201cGood. I\u2019ll do it thoroughly.\u201dI renewed my determination.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 35Chapter 35 \u2013 Villager A sells Orc\u2019s meat in school festival:-The plot returns to the cultural festival.Also, the next chapter is the beginning of the cute reactions of Anastasia. So look forward to it.(\uff3e\u25bd\uff3e)\u2013AninsarThere were various things related to Amy, so whether it is safe or not will come later, now it was the day of the cultural festival.The sky is finally whitening. And I\u2019m now in the Great Dungeon of Orcs near Altmunt.The reason why I came here at such a chilly time is to get the Orc meat that I will dismantle in the cultural festival.Now, I saw a relatively small orc alone, so to hunt it, I sneaked up and headshot it with Nikov, then hurriedly drained the blood.I carried the hunted prey as it is and tie it to Buitor with a rope. Then, I took off vertically after starting Buitor and soar into the sky at once with the Orc hanging.I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a pretty surrealistic sight from the sides, but this is the only way to transport it by air. I had to sacrifice few things for a greater cause.It\u2019s autumn now, so the temperature isn\u2019t too high, it\u2019s chilly. If I go over the sky, it\u2019s pretty cold, so I\u2019m hardly worried about the meat rotting. Rather, I\u2019m worried that it\u2019ll freeze.I flew Buitor at full speed and arrived at the private Lurden Airport after a few hours of flight. Then quickly carried the Orc and rushed to the school.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aI hang the hunted Orc in front of my stall. Right now, it\u2019s 10 o\u2019clock. The dismantling show is scheduled to start at 11 o\u2019clock, so until then, it\u2019s for attracting customers.Immediately after some time, people start gathering around the Orc.\u201cHey, what\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an Orc meat skewer stall.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that a monster?\u201d\u201cIt seems to be the food of the commoners.\u201d\u201cWhy is such a thing in this school?\u201dSince only aristocrats or rich children goes to school, so a whole orc is quite shocking, it seems.\u201cI will start the Orc dismantling show from around 11 o\u2019clock. Please come and see it.\u201dWhile advertising that, I skewered the Orc loin that I had prepared separately and start grilling it over the charcoal.Oh, by the way, Orc meat tastes almost the same as pork. Even though they walk on two legs, look wise they are similar to pigs. They don\u2019t exude feelings like a human being. Besides, the meat is good to eat and fetches quite a price when sold along with the fur. So they are considered good preys by the adventurers.Oh yeah, Although this is extra information, according to a senior adventurer from the rural areas, the dismantling method of pigs is similar to the Orcs.As Orcs are monsters, a method to convert them to livestock is not possible, so its meat can only be eaten cheaply in and around Altomund, which is near the Great Dungeon of Orc. And since Orc is rarely seen around the royal capital, eating Orc meat in the royal capital costs more than ten times the price of pork.In that case, people who bother to eat Orc meat, even though it tastes like pork, are probably quite fond of it.Well, By the royal capital\u2019s standard, it is high-class Orc meat, but due to this being a cultural festival, I will be selling it for 100 cents per skewer without profit.On an occasion like this, I don\u2019t have any interest to make money.Now, the loin meat was cooked and gave off a savoury smell.I lightly sprinkle salt and pepper on it to adjust the taste, then keep it away from the fire.\u201cIt\u2019s roasted! 100 cents a skewer. How is it?\u201dHowever, aside from looking at it from a distance, no one came near. When I saw that the meat is getting colder, I start grilling the new skewered batch and put the cold meat in my mouth as it is.Yeah, it\u2019s delicious. Now that I think about it, I was in a hurry and hadn\u2019t eaten anything since morning.The juiciness of the meat, which tastes like pork, spreads in my mouth.\u201cUmm, Isn\u2019t it looks like he is eating something delicious?\u201d\u201cEh, but it\u2019s a monster, is it okay?\u201dI can hear them whispering.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cAllen, you have started already. Can I have one skewer?\u201d\u201cThank you\u201dAfter saying that, when I turned to meet the person, I found Anastasia, along with her semi-long blue hair and blue-eye entourage.\u201cAnastasia-sama, and um\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Margaret. Margaret von Altmunt. I\u2019m fussy about the taste of Orc meat, you know?\u201dWhat the! She is the daughter of the lord of Altmunt, where the Great Dungeon of Orcs is located?\u201cExcuse my rudeness, Margaret-sama. Well, then I will start the Orc meat dismantling show at 11 o\u2019clock. This Orc is very fresh because it was alive until this morning, so I\u2019m sure you will be satisfied.\u201d\u201cOh? There shouldn\u2019t be any Orcs around here, right?\u201d\u201cYes, but I got it through a secret route. It\u2019s an adventurer\u2019s privilege.\u201dAt this stage, I can\u2019t disclose the fact that I\u2019ve air transported it. What I can do right now is to take advantage of the fact that it\u2019ll have a great impact on society and can start chaos if I use it in war. So I will have to disclose it after thinking it through about the situation.\u201cHmm? Is there something like that? Well, it\u2019s fine, oh? That Orc meat, isn\u2019t that of good quality? It\u2019s hardly seen in the royal capital, isn\u2019t it the \u2018upper\u2019 rank loin?\u201d\u201cAs expected of Margaret-sama, you have good eyes. This is the \u2018upper\u2019 rank Orc meat from Altmunt. I couldn\u2019t prepare the \u2018special\u2019 rank, so only the \u2018upper\u2019 rank is what I can offer.\u201d\u201cBut then, isn\u2019t 100 cents a skewer too cheap? If someone wanted to eat it in the royal capital, he/she had to pay 10,000 cents to eat it, you know?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s the cultural festival. I wanted to make everyone understand the work of adventurers.\u201d\u201cIs that so. I\u2019m impressed. Then, I might as well get a skewer too.\u201d\u201cThank you\u201dI place the skewer and start to grill. When the fat falls on the charcoal\u2019s fire and makes a gentle noise, a savoury scent drifts around.Anastasia then speaks loudly to Margaret.\u201cMargaret, you\u2019re very familiar with Orcs. As expected you are still eating Orc meat in the Altmunt county, don\u2019t you?\u201dMargaret responds with a loud voice.\u201cYes, of course. It\u2019s a speciality of my Altmunt. I think Orc meat is healthier and tastier than pork. Moreover \u2018upper\u2019 rank loin is not easily available in the royal capital. It\u2019s rare after all. There is no loss in eating it.\u201dAfter that, the people who were watching the conversation from a distance start ordering alongside them.\u201cAnastasia-sama and Margaret-sama also, Thank you very much!\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cWe just talked to each other, you know?\u201dIt seems they are implying to not think about their conversation. But, No matter how you see, they intentionally spoke loudly so that their conversation endorses this meat as nothing suspicious.In this way, the prepared loin meat was sold out in a blink of an eye.The orc dismantling show also attracted a large crowd thanks to both of them, and the rest of the orc was sold out without waiting for the end of the cultural festival.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 36Chapter 36 \u2013 Villager A goes around the Cultural Festival:-Welcome folks, 4 more chapters and we will reach the main dish of the school arc, the condemnation event. And by the way, the next chapter is Anastasia\u2019s POV of this chapter. Look forward to her reactions.\u2013AninsarNow, I decided to look around the other exhibits after closing the store. As I\u2019m free right now, I might as well enjoy the occasion, cause it will be a loss if I don\u2019t.Well, Let\u2019s start with Anastasia and the Crown Prince\u2019s group\u2019s exhibition.If I remember from the gossips, it\u2019s about the lifestyle in downtown \u2026.When I went to see the exhibition, the onlookers were already singing praises there. Since there was no one at the reception, I look around without permission.When I saw the exhibition, I noticed that the contents were surprisingly thin.It explains the lifestyle of the so-called commoners rather than the downtown. But it was clear that they didn\u2019t interview the commoners. It is probably based on how Amy lived before being taken over by the Baron. But to be clear, this is a pretty good life.According to the exhibition, commoner children basically live without starvation. They eat bread &amp; butter with soup. And also vegetables and meat, which is not dried, once a day. It also depicts that in many cases, 4 to 5 family members live in a room of 2LDK to 3LDK. And since there are magic stones, there is no problem with water, but many houses use firewood for the fire, it seems. Then it portraits that the commoner children go to school, and when they graduate, they go to work.I see. I did not know.At least it\u2019s completely different from the area where I used to live. In my case, it\u2019s different because ours was a single child-mother family, but it\u2019s normal for a poor household of eight with lots of children to live in a one-room apartment.In short, the poorer the house, the more the children acts as the workforce. Because of that, children get forced to work from an early age. And a significant proportion of them misses the school.Therefore, there are quite a few people who cannot read. And that is one of the factors that bind them to live in poverty.And because of that, they rarely saw magic stones, so it is not uncommon for children to not know their existence.Everyone spends their days this way, and their meals are usually hard bread, somewhat rotten vegetables, and a little dried meat or beans.However, I think the part where the support system for the commoners of this country is described, is organized well. The support measures and the history of the school system are summarized in an easy-to-understand manner. It is probably made by Anastasia.I heard the capture targets and Amy flirting from the next room, so I ignored them and left the exhibition room as it is.Because it will make me feel uncomfortable, I\u2019m sure.Then I went to Margaret\u2019s exhibition.\u201cWoah, Allen, you came.\u201dIt was Anastasia who greeted me there.\u201cHuh? Um, excuse me for disturbing?\u201d\u201cWhy are you saying it in a questionable way. I was kicked out of His Highness\u2019s group yesterday. So Margaret picked me up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat should I say? I was at a loss for words.That wasn\u2019t the case in the game. Moreover, in the first place, Did she usually act like that?\u201cDon\u2019t make a face like that. Well, take a look at it because both Margaret\u2019s and mine are on display.\u201d\u201cY-Yes, but I don\u2019t know about embroidery \u2026\u201dWhile saying that, I went around the exhibition. I don\u2019t know anything about embroidery, so I can\u2019t judge whether it\u2019s good or bad, but I thought that it\u2019s like designing flowers, birds, etc.By the way, Margaret\u2019s embroidery was colourful flowers, and Anastasia\u2019s embroidery was fruit and cake.\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good or bad, but I got hungry when I saw Anastasia-sama\u2019s embroidery.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026really\u201dAnastasia, who said that was a little embarrassed. I\u2019m used to seeing her usual frozen expression, so I was a little startled.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgWe both stop talking, and an indescribable silence flows between us.Right then, Margaret came for help.\u201cOh, Allen-kun, you came. Thank you.\u201d\u201cY-Yes, even if I don\u2019t know embroidery at all, what I get to understand is that I can\u2019t do it.\u201d\u201cIs that so. Well, the men are like that. By the way, the cultural festival is about to end. So we better clean up and go to the auditorium.\u201d\u201cAh, yes. Thank you for today.\u201dIn short, it means that you should go out because it will close. Interpreting that, I obediently came out and head to the auditorium.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\u201cThen, I will announce the Grand Prize winner of this year. The Grand Prize goes to the \u201cAbout the downtown culture and life, along with the kingdom\u2019s support system\u201d exhibition, represented by His Imperial Highness Prince Karlheinz Bartille von Centraren and his group.\u201dclap clap clap clapYup. I knew. It was a fixed race anyway, worthless.\u201cHis Highness\u2019s exhibition focuses on those who live poorer than ordinary commoners and highlights their living conditions through interviews. It also considers the role that the kingdom plays and what it should be like in the future. It highly evaluated the contents of sociality.\u201dHuh. Where in that thin content!I curse in my heart. I\u2019m sure I have an ugly face now.I thought so, and for a while, I turned my face down so that no one could see it.Then, the capture targets and Amy, led by the crown prince, go up to the stage and receive the award. Of course, there is no figure of Anastasia, who got kicked out yesterday.\u201cThen, I would like to hear from the representative, the Crown Prince.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Karlheinz. I\u2019m glad I won the Grand Prize. First, I chose this theme from Amy\u2019s idea. We royalty and aristocrats always exist to guide the weak people. So we did this exhibition to highlight the status quo. And to think about what we can do from it. We will also graduate from our prestigious high school and become human beings who have to stand on top of the people. So I hope it will give us an opportunity to think about what to do then. That\u2019s it. \u201c\u201cThank you, Your Highness.\u201dclap clap clap clapIt\u2019s very flimsy, and surprisingly, abstract speech giving from the top.Sometimes, It makes me annoyed when I think that he will be the next king!Isn\u2019t this country seriously in peril?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So I will upload them both next time.\u2013AninsarIt\u2019s the season when the wintry wind blows. The tree leaves have fallen completely, and the clothes of the passers-by are ready for winter. As usual, I am enjoying the figurine lifestyle, but the stage of the game is gradually approaching.Now, if I remember, Anastasia\u2019s condemnation event was after finishing the final exams, so there is another event that must be stopped before that.It\u2019s also a template event that is common in otome games, where the heroine is harassed by the villainess and her entourage, and then finally pushed down the stairs.However, unlike the game, Anastasia endures without doing such an act, and it seems that Margaret and the other entourages are also holding back.It\u2019s unclear why Anastasia &amp; Co. are behaving differently from the game, as Anastasia and her entourage are different from Amy and me, who have reincarnated with the game\u2019s knowledge. If not, they should try to act better.However, regardless of the reasons, if this template event is stopped, Anastasia will not have any relation to the wrongdoings.Also, there is another difference in the game. It\u2019s the relationship between Anastasia and the Crown Prince. Since the incident at the cultural festival, the relationship between Anastasia and the crown prince has completely collapsed. It has deteriorated to the point where they hardly speak even when they meet face-to-face.Originally, this relationship breakdown was the result of the villainess being scolded by the Crown Prince after the completion of this template event.As I\u2019ve been watching it since summer vacation, Anastasia seems to have left the stage of being obsessed with the Crown Prince.It would be better to become a queen only in shape if it stabilizes the country. Isn\u2019t that the only thing in Anastasia\u2019s head?She should just throw away a man like him and look for her happiness.Me thinking that may be the proof that I have formed a bond with Anastasia.Ah, just to be clear, even if the engagement between Anastasia and the Crown Prince is resolved gracefully, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for me to come around.In the first place, I can\u2019t even speak to her first. And when the engagement gets called off, will not Anastasia, the daughter of the Duke, get marriage proposals from aristocrats and royalties from other countries, who want to connect with the Ramslet family, one after another?Unfortunately, there is no room for me to get in there. I think I already understood the reality.Besides, my real purpose is to protect my mother and the people who took care of me. Only that can never be compromised.Now, the event should occur on a cold, rainy day, so let\u2019s keep an eye on it until then.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aThree days later, when I went to the classroom, the female students were unusually present this early and were whispering about the rumours.When I listened to it, I got to know that Amy was harassed by burning the pen that she had taken good care of in the girl\u2019s dormitory. After which Amy appealed to the crown prince that it must have been done by Anastasia.It seems that the crown prince who swallowed it called Anastasia and took her to the corridor as it is.Of course, I\u2019m a figurine and a stalker, so when I left the classroom, I hide using \u3010Concealment\u3011 and look for Anastasia &amp; Co. Then, I came across the scene where the Crown Prince, Amy, and the capture targets surrounding Anastasia alone.\u201cAnastasia! give up already. What are you thinking, harassing the kind-hearted Amy by burning her pen?\u201d\u201cHis Highness, I didn\u2019t do that, and I have told my friends not to do this kind of things.\u201d\u201cBut considering the situation, there can be no other than you.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cThat\u2019s right? Miss Anastasia. No matter how cute Amy is, being jealous is ugly, you know?\u201dAs if to support the Crown Prince, Prince Claude teases Anastasia with a ridiculous tone.Anastasia sighs loudly when she sees the six with a frozen look. On the other hand, Amy hid behind the capture targets and grinned as if to provoke when she looks at Anastasia.Ah, I see. So it was you who burn it to create this situation.However, Anastasia speaks in a cold voice without changing her expression.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be told such a thing without evidence. So excuse me, the lessons will start.\u201dThen after bowing, Anastasia turns to walk away. At which Leonardo grabs her arm and forcibly stops her steps.\u201cWait. The talk isn\u2019t over.\u201d\u201cLeonardo von Jukes, I didn\u2019t allow you to touch me. You, a Viscount\u2019s son, dare to touch me, a Duke\u2019s daughter, without permission.\u201d\u201cShut up! If you plead guilty, I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d\u201cIs that a threat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s bad that you don\u2019t plead guilty. There can be no one other than you who did this to harass Amy.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEven after this, Anastasia didn\u2019t change her expressions at all and looks at Leonardo with a cold expression. No, what\u2019s behind those eyes may be contempt.However, it would be bad if it stays like this.When I disable \u3010Concealment\u3011, I deliberately made loud footsteps and approached Anastasia.\u201cExcuse me for disturbing you while you were conversing! It\u2019s almost time for the class to start!\u201dWith that said, I kneel and thank my liege.\u201cTch, enough. let\u2019s go.\u201dWith that one word from the Crown Prince, Amy\u2019s reverse harem returned to the classroom.\u201cAllen, you \u2013\u201c\u201cAnastasia-sama, it\u2019s time. The class will start.\u201dI interrupted Anastasia\u2019s words by saying that, and I hurried back to the classroom.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Though the main content of the event is in the next chapter, it is still good. Enjoy!\u2013AninsarAfter that, days passed by, and also Amy was not pushed down the stairs by Anastasia.To be precise, Amy was trying to summon Anastasia to the stairs using her tricks, but Anastasia every time excused her using the teachers or her cronies. (TL:- I am changing entourage -> cronies.)As a result, the end of the semester came without the event where Amy gets pushed down the stairs.Of course, there was also a final test, and the results were posted.\u2014-1st place Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett (500)1st place Allen (500)3rd place Margaret von Altmunt (491)4th place Isabella von Luinberg (456)5th place Amy von Brayes (451)6th place Markus von Beinz (441)\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb9th place Claude Justine de Westerdale (421)10th place Oscar von Wimlet (419)\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb29th Karlheinz Bartille von Centraren (396)\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb38th Glen Weitberg (379)39th place Leonardo von Jukes (261)\u2014-It feels a little refreshing.No, I\u2019ll correct it. It feels rather refreshing.It serves you right!In the game, Anastasia, who was mentally cornered, had a breakdown and lost first place in her grade to Amy. As a result, she was further cornered, which led her to lose her calm in the condemnation event, so she requests a duel. But the result this time was, opposite.Amy dropped to 5th place in the grade, Anastasia returned to 1st place, and Anastasia\u2019s cronies improved to 3rd and 4th place.Moreover, Crown Prince Karlheinz, who has been talking so highly of himself, got a result which was easy to find if counted from the bottom.Even more! Leonardo, the future knight Captain, who tried to force Anastasia to admit her false charge, is at the bottom of the list for the second term consecutively.Serves you right!When I was looking at the bulletin board with that in mind, Anastasia called me from behind.\u201cAllen. I didn\u2019t lose this time.\u201dAnastasia\u2019s voice is bouncy. I turn back and compliment Anastasia.\u201cCongratulations to Anastasia-sama. You got a perfect score.\u201d\u201cNo, isn\u2019t Allen\u2019s also a perfect score? As expected. Congratulations.\u201d\u201cThank you\u201dI obediently bow to Anastasia.\u201cAllen-kun, as expected, good job.\u201d\u201cMargaret-sama, congratulations on 3rd place.\u201dWhen I turned to Margaret\u2019s voice, there I saw Margaret smiling and standing side by side with another one of Anastasia\u2019s cronies. This seemingly unassuming person with brown hair and dark eyes was, I believe, the one who harassed Amy in the game.\u201cThank you, But with a little more effort, I could have lined up with Anastasia-sama.\u201dAlthough she regrets saying that, her expression is satisfying.\u201cAllen, she\u2019s Isabella. She\u2019s the daughter of Viscount Luinberg. Isabella, as you know, Allen is a scholarship student.\u201d\u201cIsabella-sama, I\u2019m honoured to meet you.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you too, Allen-san. I\u2019m sure we will be in the same class from next term.\u201d\u201cAllen, Isabella was in class B until this term. But with this grade, she will definitely be in class A. Get along well.\u201d\u201cThank you so much. I look forward to working with you.\u201dI said so while greeting her, but unfortunately, I would be leaving this school if the condemnation event happens.A vague feeling of guilt remained in my chest.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgAnd that night, a graduation cum promotion party was held at the banquet hall in the royal castle, inviting many guests and all of the students.It\u2019s December now, so the school is going into winter break, which will continue until the coming spring, resulting in a long vacation. It seems the aristocrats with territories will return to help or learn by themselves. In-game terms, it is treated as a period for level grinding.Now, the sons and daughters of the aristocracy have already gathered in the banquet hall. And they are chatting with each other wearing luxurious dresses. However, such gorgeous dresses and chats have nothing to do with me. I wore my usual uniform, and as usual, I\u2019m standing by the wall.The food provided is all cold and rich food, but since I will never have a chance to eat it again, I will take my time savouring it.Anastasia is with her cronies, and Amy is along with the prince &amp; Co. as usual. I felt a little sad when I thought that today would be the last time I would see this scene.When the party was in full swing \u2013 although there was no alcohol being served \u2013 the best student from each grade was announced.First, a graduating second-year student was called in. He had excelled in academics, magic, and swordsmanship, but he hadn\u2019t had enough of it, so he had done some research and worked with a university professor to develop a new magic stone.He went up to the stage, gave a speech, and then, for some reason thanked the prince and went down. The venue was filled with applause.Then it was the turn of us, freshmen. An announcement was made in the hall.\u201cThe freshmen highest award goes to Crown Prince Karlheinz Bartille von Centraren.\u201dAs soon as the name was announced, the audience erupted in applause. However, the expressions on the faces of those applauding varied: some seemed to be congratulating from the bottom of their hearts, some looked disappointed, and others were not interested but were applauding just for the sake of it.However, no matter which route it is, the crown prince is always called here, and the condemnation of the villainess from the stage is the event in the game.\u201cThe crown prince has achieved excellent results, especially in swordsmanship and magic, and has been involved in well-rounded research with the experts in academics, as well as deeply dug into social issues. This award will be in recognition of those achievements of his.\u201dThe Crown Prince went up to the stage and received the award as if it was a matter of course.Then he turned around and looked at us from the stage.\u201cThank you, everyone, but this wasn\u2019t something I could have done alone. Now, those who are being called come up on the stage. Claude Justine de Westerdale, you never cease to amaze me with your excellent eye for details. Please continue to be my good friend.\u201d\u201cYeah\u201d\u201cMarkus von Beinz, you are my rival in magics, but at the same time, your cool judgment has always helped me.\u201d\u201cYes\u201d\u201cLeonard von Jukes, you have always been my sword, and I thank you for your tireless efforts.\u201d\u201cYes\u201d\u201cOscar von Wimlet, you never cease to amaze me with your ability to see the true value in things. I\u2019m counting on you to keep up the good work.\u201d\u201cYou can count on me.\u201dAll the capture target go up to the stage. And after a pause, the prince opens his mouth.\u201cAmy von Brayes, I think I\u2019ve grown a lot as a person since I met you. I hope you\u2019ll always be by my side.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAmy happily ran up to the stage and into the arms of the prince. However, many guests frowned at her unconventional behaviour.\u201cThis achievement of mine was only possible with their help. I will not forget this and promise to study hard to become a good king who guides the people.\u201d\u201cKarl-sama\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. You can do it.\u201d\u201cI will also support you with all my heart.\u201dA farce took place on the stage, and the audience applauded it.I was staring at the scene with cold eyes.\u201cAnd there\u2019s one more thing to declare here.\u201dThe crown prince declared in a clear voice and took a breath.\u201cAnastasia Clynel von Ramslett, come forward.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then the continuation of the main story with the duel event. If you can wait, then I will suggest waiting till chapter 40 for more fun.\u2013AninsarThe crowd quieted down quickly, and Anastasia, whose name got called by the Crown Prince, stepped forward with a cold expression.\u201cAnastasia, as of this moment, I am breaking off my engagement to you!The Crown Prince declares as he looks down on Anastasia from the stage with the dialogue as the event takes place.\u201cYour Highness, are you serious?\u201dAnastasia doesn\u2019t seem to be upset and confirms that with a plain tone as if she was going through paperwork.\u201cHmph. You are still a woman with no understanding. Instead of a rotten woman like you, this kind-hearted and healing Amy is the one who deserves to be my fianc\u00e9e.\u201dThe prince says so with an imprudent look and attitude. But Anastasia asks the prince to confirm without changing her expression at all.\u201cYour Highness, are you sure you want a woman who knows nothing about etiquette, nobility, or even what a country is? Your Highness seriously thinks that this woman will be the Queen of this country?\u201dAnastasia turns her cold gaze toward Amy without losing her expression.Amy, who received the line of sight, shrank with a jerk, and the crown prince gently embraced her.\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous! Her kindness is what this country needs. It doesn\u2019t need you who tries to find logic in everything. In the first place, we know of the many harassments you\u2019ve perpetrated against Amy! A woman with characteristics like you is unfit to be the Queen of our country!\u201d\u201cIs that so? Then your Highness will take responsibility for the result, right?\u201dHmm? Anastasia\u2019s dialogue is quite different from the game.As I thought, Anastasia has already cut her ties with the crown prince in her mind. Anastasia doesn\u2019t have any fragments of regrets when she looks at the crown prince.\u201cI thought what you would say but, this is why I don\u2019t like the big-headed Ramsletts. That\u2019s why Ramsletts are bumkins who can only make wheat forever.\u201dAnastasia, who was going to back down easily, protested against this.\u201cYour Highness. I don\u2019t care what you say to me, but I can\u2019t overlook the insults against the Duke of Ramslett. Please take back what you just said.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019m just telling you the facts.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s why Anastasia-sama, who is from a provincial family, is disliked by Karl-sama, you know?\u201dPerhaps Amy saw it as a chance to make Anastasia angry, so she attacked her. However, Anastasia gave Amy a cold look and sighed a little.\u201cAmy, are you also going to insult the Ramslett family?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true because Karl-sama said it.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s get a formal protest from the Ramslett family against the Brayes family.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s cowardly to use the power of your parent\u2019s house.\u201d (TL- so it\u2019s not cowardly to gang up on a helpless girl. (\uffe3m\uffe3\uff09)My head started to hurt as I listened to the exchange.Well, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s doing it intending to make her angry, but what kind of logic is it that it\u2019s cowardly to protest as a house after insulting an entire noble family that is supposed to value honour?\u201cEnough of this useless talk. I\u2019ll leave you to it.\u201dAnastasia says so and then turns back to leave, but the crown prince stops her.\u201cWait! Amy is right. If you\u2019re proud of yourself as an aristocrat, solve it yourself before you cry to your parents. Until then, I won\u2019t allow you to leave this place.\u201d\u201cYour Highness, what are you implying?\u201d\u201cWhat are your gloves for?\u201d\u201cAt least it\u2019s not meant to be used lightly in matters like this.\u201d\u201cI see. The daughter of the Duke of Ramslett can\u2019t even fight for the pride and honour of the family? It seems that His Excellency the Duke has no talent for raising children.\u201dThe Crown Prince snickered at Anastasia after saying that. And some of the guests who saw that were also heard laughing.\u201cDoes Your Highness asks me to apply for a duel?\u201d\u201cThink for yourself. Don\u2019t you understand, unless I, the Crown Prince, tells you everything? As usual, what an obnoxious woman.\u201dThe expression on Anastasia\u2019s face showed her frustration when she heard that. In short, she was ordered in the name of the Crown Prince to apply for a duel herself.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cUnderstood\u201dAnastasia said so and threw her gloves at Amy.\u201cOh! um, this is \u2026\u201dAmy was overly surprised by the glove thrown at her, but she tries to pick them up and return them to Anastasia.\u201cHow far will you go to make me look like a fool?\u201dAnastasia was not enraged but looked at Amy with cold eyes.\u201cAmy, this means that woman, feeling insulted, has challenged you to a duel.\u201d\u201cWell, is that so? I, fighting \u2026\u201dWith a spoiled voice, Amy asked the prince so.Nonsense. You definitely knew what this meant and deliberately arranged it to make Anastasia fight in a duel to banish her during the condemnation event.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll fight this duel on behalf of Amy.\u201dAs in the game, the Crown Prince applies for the proxy.\u201cWhat? Your Highness? Ordering a woman to fight a duel and then acting as her opponent\u2019s representative in the duel, are you insane?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? You asked for a duel on your own. I want to protect Amy, so I\u2019ll act as the representative, that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAnastasia quiet down as it is.\u201cI will also act as a proxy.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it too.\u201d\u201cMe also, let\u2019s do it.\u201d\u201cOf course, I will fight too.\u201dAs in the game, all five of the capture targets apply for the proxy.\u201cWhat about you? Do you have any representative willing to fight against the five of us?\u201dAnastasia looked around, but of course, all the boys in the room looked away.Well, no one wants to fight the crown prince and the prince of a neighbouring country.\u201cIt looks like you\u2019re not popular.\u201dThe crown prince looks down on Anastasia, saying so, but no matter how you see, it\u2019s a matter of authority.Nevertheless, it seems that it\u2019s finally time to fight.After taking a breather, I raise my hand and step forward.\u201cI will act as a representative.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This way, you can enjoy it in one go, and I can also take a short break.\uff08\uff3e-\uff3e\uff09\u2013AninsarIn the buzzing banquet hall, the guests reacted in different ways: some looked at me curiously, some raised their eyebrows, and some were whispering to each other.On the other hand, the students and teachers looked on in stunned amazement at the sudden engagement cancellation and duelling application.\u201cA-Allen?\u201d\u201cYou are \u2026 the commoner from that time, right?\u201dIn the midst of all this, Anastasia and the Crown Prince react, respectively. Anastasia looks surprised like a pigeon that got hit by a peashooter, but isn\u2019t the Crown Prince\u2019s dubious face and those lines too much?\u201cGood grief, I\u2019m still in the same class as His Highness, though. Rather than that, Anastasia-sama. Please acknowledge me as your representative as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cEh? Ah, um, I admit.\u201dWhile Anastasia was surprised, I quickly got her to admit it and swiftly moved on.\u201cAnd? What do you demand of each other in this duel? what about you, Anastasia-sama?\u201d\u201cI-I have decided already. Take back the insult to the Ramslett family and apologize.\u201d\u201cOkay, then what about Amy-sama?\u201d\u201cEh? Umm\u2026 Don\u2019t come near us anymore.\u201dOh, that is the exact same line of the game. Jeez. (TL:- Does she believes that if she does the same things everything will be on track?)\u201cOkay. Then, if Anastasia-sama wins, Amy-sama and the others will admit that their earlier remarks about the Ramslett family were insulting and will formally apologize. And, if Amy-sama wins, (TL:-\u2018which will not happen\u2019 is what Allen is thinking.) Anastasia-sama will stay away from Amy-sama, is that correct?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. You will stay away from Amy and the five of us.\u201d\u201cI understand. Then let\u2019s do it that way.\u201dFor the time being, let\u2019s finish the condition confirmation in a clerical manner.\u201cWhat about the format of the duel?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got one. Get me four more proxies. If you can\u2019t, we can match it one-on-one every day, and you have to win five matches in a row.\u201dThe Crown Prince looks down on me, or rather us, as he says this. It seems that he doesn\u2019t feel like lynching us five to one.No, maybe he is just making fun of us, thinking himself to be the superior one here.\u201cAh, that will be a bother, so can I have all five of you come at me at once? How about one against five, and anything goes except killing?\u201dClaude reacts to those words.\u201cOi, oi, oi, you think you can fight us and win? You, with your mediocre swordsmanship and magic?\u201d (TL:- Listening to this, somehow I get the feeling that the role of bandit will suit him more than that of a prince.)I see. So that\u2019s how you react. Then it\u2019s just right. Since it will be the last time anyway, let\u2019s stir things up as hard as I can.The angrier they are, the easier it is for me to do it.\u201cHuh? Your Highness Claude. By any chance, are you scared of me?\u201d\u201cwhat?\u201dObviously, Claude\u2019s tone intensified. If it were manga or anime, there would probably be an anger mark on his forehead. (TL:- Well, it\u2019s a web novel though.)\u201cNow, please calm down. But Prince Claude is right, isn\u2019t he?\u201dWhile conciliating Claude, Markus began to admonish me.\u201cYou are no match for me or His Highness in magic, and also in swordsmanship, Leo, His Highness, or Prince Claude are superior to you. In addition, we also have Oscar, who is an expert archer. You have no chance against us. I admire your courage in coming forward to duel, but you\u2019ve done enough. We won\u2019t say anything bad, so back off.\u201dWell, if you didn\u2019t know me properly, you would probably come to that conclusion, and at first glance, it seems like a good argument, but this is a terrible way of phrasing it.However, it\u2019s not like that I\u2019ll get angry. What is necessary now is to have the other party lose their composure.I want to avoid any unnecessary interventions that will mess it. So before that happens, I have to end the duel quickly.That\u2019s why even though I have nothing against Markus, I\u2019m going to provoke him.\u201cHmm? I can\u2019t be persuaded by someone who keeps losing to a commoner me, in studies, can I? Markus-sama?\u201d\u201cWhat! Even though I was thinking of your own good!\u201dWhen I stirred him up, I got a funny reaction.Does he have a low tolerance for agitation, to begin with, or is it that he can\u2019t stand being agitated by an entity that looks down on him?Either way, this low boiling point will probably disqualify him from being the future prime minister.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cYou\u2019re not beautiful, aren\u2019t you? As expected, if you\u2019re a commoner, you can\u2019t help but be savage, can you?\u201d\u201cI see. Do aristocrats only have honours? Ah, but many nobles don\u2019t have it, so Oscar-sama and the others are in which group? Also, I think it\u2019s more barbaric to surround a woman and neglect her as a fianc\u00e9e. Isn\u2019t it? In addition, when it comes to men flocking one woman, I believe bees are also like that, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201dOscar distorts his stunning face. Then Leonardo came at me.\u201cSuch foolish talk is unbearable to hear. Behave properly.\u201d\u201cEven if you say so. You\u2019re the ones who are making accusations. And the last time I saw you, you surrounded a woman and tried to force her to admit she was wrong. Even though you are the son of the knight captain, which one of us is stupid here? Leonardo-sama?\u201d\u201cWhat!?\u201dSomehow when I pressed their anger switch, they start reacting funnily.This may be interesting, but I feel that if I find enjoyment in this, it will be outrageously bad for my character, and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll fall into self-loathing later, so let\u2019s finish the story before I open any strange doors.\u201cNow, Your Highness Crown Prince Karlheinz. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to run away, even though it\u2019s a very favourable condition of 1 to 5?\u201d\u201cWhat!? You, argh\u2026I understand. Okay. Don\u2019t regret if you die by mistake?\u201d\u201cHuh? Are you declaring that you\u2019re going to break the rule that forbids killing now?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t you run away? Come to the training ground now. Hey, someone witness this duel!\u201d\u201cThen I will do it.\u201dWhen the crown prince said so, a middle-aged man stood up from the guest table. He was one of the men who had just laughed at Anastasia along with the Crown Prince.Are you trying to cheat in the judgement also?Well, okay. In that case, it\u2019s just a matter of getting these guys back on track.\u201cThen we\u2019ll wait for you at the training grounds first. Don\u2019t run away!\u201dWith that, Amy, the Crown Prince &amp; Co., and the middle-aged man strode away.\u201cWell then, Anastasia-sama. I\u2019ll go back to the dormitory and get my weapons, so please go to the training grounds first.\u201dI tell this to Anastasia, who is stunned.Ah, by the way, the reason I don\u2019t have weapons right now is that swords are not allowed inside the royal castle and the school is just a stone\u2019s throw away from here.Anastasia came to her senses at the sound of my voice and came at me with a menacing look.(TL:- Below is the most amusing conversation of this event. Really worth it!)\u201cW-What foolish things are you saying! It\u2019s not too late. I\u2019m declining you as a representative. In this situation, no one will blame you. Besides, if anything happens to you in the duel, it will be treated as just an accident. I can\u2019t let a man as talented as you die in a place like this!\u201d\u201cHmm? Are you worried about me by any chance? It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not going to die. Or rather, if it\u2019s an opponent like that, no matter how many people come, I\u2019ll win in plenty of time.\u201d\u201cWha!? Allen \u2026?\u201d\u201cHave you heard? There is an adventurer in this royal capital who holds the record for the youngest C rank.\u201d\u201cEh? Ah, hmm, I\u2019ve heard that \u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s me, you know. I\u2019m the youngest C-rank adventurer who has traverse Goblin Dungeon with Goblin Slayer and Orcs Slayer achievements. I\u2019ve also succeeded in defeating Blizzard Phoenix alone.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d (TL:- Anastasia is like \u21b4)For the second time today, I could see Anastasia\u2019s puzzled and dumbfounded expression.I feel lonely when I realized that this was probably the last time I would see it. But I\u2019ve prepared for this. I will give it everything I have and win this battle.\u201cSo you should relax as you do in a big boat because I\u2019m sure you will win this duel.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And all the other supporters who support me in fulfilling my Kofi goal, I express my gratitude again. Thank you very much, everyone. It really helps.o(\u3003\uff3e\u25bd\uff3e\u3003)oThe duel has started, but it lacks the beat down. I would\u2019ve like to see a little more, given how much Anastasia got harassed by them.But all in all, it\u2019s fine.P.S- Sorry for the inconvenience folks, enjoy the chapter.\u2013AninsarI rode back to the dormitory in the school carriage and put in my pocket the special automatic pistol I had prepared for this day. I then put on my adventurer\u2019s gear, grabbed my camouflage dagger, and headed back to the royal castle to enter its training grounds.Many spectators had already gathered, mainly students and guests who had attended the party. And the moon was shining brightly in the sky above.\u201cAllen!\u201d\u201cAllen-kun\u201d\u201cAllen-san\u201dAnastasia, Margaret, and Isabella worriedly called out to me.In the game, Anastasia was alone at this point, but it seems Margaret and Isabella came along with her.\u201cGood\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but mutter to myself when I realized that Anastasia wasn\u2019t isolated.\u201cWhat is good, you idiot!\u201d\u201cOh, no. I just thought that Anastasia-sama is well taken care of by her friends.\u201d\u201cWha\u201dFor the third time today, I saw her surprised face. Moreover, this time her face was red. Margaret and Isabella were looking at Anastasia with smiles on their faces.\u201cThen, Anastasia-sama, I will win for you.\u201d\u201cOh, yes. And, one more thing, Allen. That witness is from a faction that\u2019s hostile to my family, the Ramslett. Be careful.\u201dI Knew it.However, I know that trick from the game, and I have no problem with it.\u201cYes. Thank you very much. But there is no problem. I have no intention of relenting.\u201dWith that said, I walked to the centre of the training area.The Crown Prince, the five capture targets, Amy, and the man who will witness the duel were already there.As expected, The Crown Prince &amp; Co. were underestimating me, as they were not wearing any armours and the weapons in their hands were probably borrowed. Did they borrow a spare one from the knights?\u201cI\u2019ll give you credit for not running away. But you can\u2019t win, can you? I can still let you off the hook\u2026\u201dThe crown prince begins his tedious talks, but after coming this far, I\u2019ve already entered a rough adventurer mode. (TL:- Probably his adventurer lifestyle after the duel.)To reduce the possibility of defeat to zero, the opponent must lose their composure.That\u2019s why I agitated him in the earlier exchange and made him lose his calm.\u201cAh, again. You\u2019re annoying! You know what they say, the weaker the dog, the more he barks. Just come at me. I\u2019ll beat you all to a pulp. Or are you trying to get me to turn it down because you\u2019re not confident? Your-High-ness?\u201cYou! It\u2019s too late for regrets, know that?\u201dThe crown prince who got on my cheap provocation was easily enraged. The other capture targets are also ready to pounce on me right now.I grinned at Amy, who was standing behind them with her hands folded in front of her, staring at them as if she were praying.Amy\u2019s face quickly reddened, as if she noticed the expression on my face, and then a look of anger appeared on her face.Now, the declaration of war is over. Let\u2019s do it.I will destroy destiny right here, today!\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aI stepped away from the Crown Prince &amp; Co. and held up my dagger.\u201cThen the duel between Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett and Amy von Brayes will start.\u201dThe referee man loudly declares the beginning of the duel.\u201cLady Anastasia\u2019s representative is Allen, and Lady Amy\u2019s are Karlheinz Bartille von Centraren, Claude Justine de Westerdale, Oscar von Wimlet, Markus von Beinz, Leonardo von Jukes, a total of 5 representatives. At the request of Lady Anastasia, this will be a 1 to 5 irregular system, and all acts other than killing will be permitted! (TL:- what a loophole rule, totally in favour of Allen. (\u2267\u25bd\u2266))With the signal from the referee, I create a smokescreen. And then, using \u3010Concealment\u3011to hide, I move close to the five people who got frozen in place and present them with the specially made bullets I developed for this day from close range.By the way, this automatic pistol is equipped with a suppressor, and since it is fired by wind magic, the sound is very different from guns that use gunpowder.So, a former Japanese, Amy would never dream of being shot.And since it\u2019s loaded with special rubber bullets, they won\u2019t die unless they get hit on the critical spots.Well, it might be able to break a bone or two.When the smoke screen cleared, Leonardo and Claude, who had been beehived by rubber bullets, were lying down, blowing bubbles.I shot Leonardo and Claude, who are good in close combats, with particular care.It\u2019s a natural result.\u201cGuu, uh, uh, what was that \u2026\u201dAnd Markus, Oscar, and the Crown Prince are also struggling, but unfortunately not to the point of falling.In my pocket, I secretly concocted a water balloon filled with pepper ingredients and threw it at Oscar\u2019s face.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgThe water balloon, which made a beautiful clean hit on Oscar\u2019s face, cracked with a crisp sound and the blinding liquid containing the pepper component attacked Oscar\u2019s face mercilessly.\u201cGyaaaaaaa, eyes, my eyes!\u201dI then approached Oscar, who collapsed and placed a dagger on his neck.\u201cCome on! Witness!\u201d\u201cAh, um\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t admit this, I\u2019m going to slowly slice his neck! Can you take responsibility?\u201d\u201cI-I understand. Leonardo, Claude, Oscar, incapacitated.\u201dWhen I heard that, I hurried to get away from the rest so that they wouldn\u2019t attack me.In less than a minute, the three of them were knocked out, and the Crown Prince and Markus didn\u2019t seem to understand what had happened. Amy, who is behind them, also has a hint of impatience in her eyes.Incidentally, there is a reason why I left these two last. The Crown Prince is the next king, and Markus is the next head of the Court Magician, and in the game, it was said that he was the future Prime Minister. I need these guys to change their minds and become decent. If they don\u2019t, they will eventually repeat the same kind of foolishness, which will lead to the destruction of the Kingdom.On the other hand, Claude is a prince from a neighbouring country, so he doesn\u2019t matter. And Leonardo\u2019s position as the successor to the Knight Captain will be in doubt if he loses to me in this situation, so he\u2019ll have to leave.Oscar, well, even though he\u2019s from a Marquis family, isn\u2019t he a lower priority compared to these two?It\u2019s better to have two than three enemies, and as long as they\u2019re still conscious and listens to my sermon, that\u2019s all that matters.When I put out the smoke screen again, I hid in \u3010Concealment\u3011 and shot rubber bullets at the Crown Prince and Markus one by one.\u201cGat\u201d\u201cGut\u201dI talk to them in a condescending tone as they kneel.\u201cNow, Your Highness, Markus-sama. How does it feel to kneel to someone you thought was beneath you?\u201d\u201cY-You bastard \u2026\u201d\u201cDo you think you can get away with this \u2026\u2026 for free? If you stand up to us, your family will too.\u201d\u201cHuh? Markus-sama? As you\u2019re about to lose in this duel, Are you threatening me with your status now? Were you trying to get me to withdraw because you were afraid of losing just now?\u201d\u201cWha\u201d\u201cBut now I\u2019m the representative of Anastasia-sama, the daughter of the Duke of Ramslett. Markus-sama\u2019s current words are also getting directed to the Duke of Ramslett, Are you planning to assassinate the Duke of Ramslett?\u201d\u201cU, gu~tsu\u201d (TL:- Just the raw, didn\u2019t know what to translate it into.)Markus bites his lip in frustration.\u201cIn general, don\u2019t you think you know who\u2019s more reasonable in your heart?\u201d\u201cI-I \u2026 Amy \u2026\u201dAs long as you can\u2019t argue with it, I guess that\u2019s what it is.Moreover, if they knew what they were doing, that\u2019s even worse.\u201cJust because you want to protect her doesn\u2019t mean you can make one-sided assumptions without any evidence, you know? At least, as far as I know, Anastasia-sama was in a position to stop it rather than bullying Amy? In addition, it was Amy who was trying to provoke Anastasia into raising her hand, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cNeve\u2026r, Amy \u2026 will never do something like \u2026\u201dI can\u2019t believe that such a man, who puts emotion first at the expense of reason, is the future prime minister.\u201cHuh, Can\u2019t you believe it? Are you going to judge us with coloured glasses like that and aim for a Kingdom where false accusations and corruption will be prevalent in the future?\u201d\u201cWha, I-I\u2019ll \u2026 never do that \u2026\u201dMarkus, unable to say anything back, mumbles.\u201cWell, that\u2019s fine. You guys apologize to the Dukes of Ramslett and Anastasia-sama. It is time to end this. If a short-tempered person like you becomes the future Prime Minister of this Kingdom, we\u2019re all going to die! Reflect on that!\u201dI kick Markus in the face as hard as I can.\u201cGah\u201dThen I grabbed Markus by the hair as he fell to the ground, made him look up, and put the dagger to his neck.\u201cWitness!\u201d\u201cMa-Markus, incapable of fighting\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So the updates may get delayed a little.P.S:- The long-awaited 2.0 update of Genshin Impact got released. Yet why do these important updates gets released before my exams!!!!~(>_<\u3002)\uff3c\u2013AninsarWhen I got back to the dormitory, I grabbed my packed luggage and rushed out of the room to return home where my mother is.And when I got home, I told my mother, who was waiting for me to return, everything that has happened today.I told her that I took the side of the duke\u2019s daughter, who was being treated unreasonably by being forced to accept a duel that was intended to banish her when she loses. And that I have beaten up not only the crown prince but also the prince of a neighbouring country and the heir of some high-ranking nobles while fighting in the duel.I\u2019m sure I must have made my mother sad, who would have wanted me to graduate from school and get a good job.That\u2019s what I thought, but when my mother heard my confession, she said something unexpected.\u201cYeah. You did your best. It was great. To help a girl who was in a bad situation, you have grown into a fine man.\u201dThen she hugged me gently.\u201cAllen, before something happens, you should run away. If anything happens, your mother will take your place.\u201d\u201cNo! I did that on my own. \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. Your mother is fine as long as you\u2019re safe and healthy. okay?\u201d\u201cUh, mother \u2026\u201dWhen I was told that, I couldn\u2019t say anything. But though I wanted to save my mother, I ended up sacrificing her!\u201cNow, go to bed today. Tomorrow I\u2019ll make you something you like for the first time in a long time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026okay\u201dGetting urged by my mother to go to bed, I went to my room. Then, I change into my sleepwear and crawl into bed.My head was spinning, and I couldn\u2019t get my thoughts straight.Where on earth did I go wrong? In the end, Will I be unable to save my mother?As I was thinking about this, there was a knock at the door of my room. It was my mother.\u201cI\u2019m coming in, okay?\u201d\u201cYes\u201dMom came in through the door and then sat down on the side of my bed.\u201cHow long has it been since I\u2019ve seen Allen\u2019s face in bed like this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not that young anymore.\u201dI say so because of embarrassment.\u201cYou know what, your mother always wondered why Allen is so brilliant when he\u2019s the child of that man and me. But, As I thought because you\u2019re his son.\u201dMom said sincerely.\u201cAfter all, you helped a girl who was being bullied, didn\u2019t you? You are really just like him.\u201d\u201cis that so\u2026\u2026\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cI\u2019m sure your dead father would have been proud of you, Allen.\u201d\u201cI wonder if that\u2019s true\u2026\u2026\u201dMy father died before I could remember. I\u2019ve never been told why, but maybe he did something like I did.\u201cWhat are you looking at me like that for? You haven\u2019t done anything wrong, have you? Then you should be proud of yourself. Besides. If you get punished, whether, by the king or the duke, I\u2019ll complain.\u201d\u201cUh, mother \u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why Allen. You did your best. It was great.\u201dAfter saying that, she gently stroked my head. Though I was too old to be stroked like that, I fell into a deep sleep.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aAnd when I woke up the next day, my head was much clearer.I don\u2019t know why I felt so negative and distraught yesterday. But after thinking about it, it\u2019s as expected so far.Intervene in Anastasia\u2019s condemnation event to prevent her banishment. By doing so, I have prevented the outbreak of civil war and prevent an invasion from the Estonian Empire.So far, I\u2019ve been able to destroy the fate scenario according to the actions I\u2019ve taken.It has not yet been decided that I will get executed, and since the duke\u2019s family is still indebted to me, there is a good chance that I will not be if I use it well.After all, I had been through a lot yesterday and had said a lot of outrageous things, so I must have been mentally weak.With that in mind, I left the room and headed for the living room. My mother has already prepared breakfast for me.\u201cMother, good morning.\u201d\u201cGood morning, Allen. Did you sleep well?\u201d\u201cYes, Umm, thank you for yesterday.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. More than that, the breakfast is already ready, you know?\u201d\u201cYes\u201dI sat down on a chair and waited for my mother. Then we started eating breakfast together.It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been home, and it\u2019s a very peaceful morning. I don\u2019t know how long this will last, but I want to cherish these days as much as I can.I thought so from the bottom of my heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was an elderly man who looked like a butler, dressed in a very expensive-looking jacket.\u201cYou\u2019re Allen-sama, right? My name is Sebastian, a butler in service to the Duke of Ramslett.\u201d\u201cYes\u201dWow! He is a butler, and his name is also Sebastian. Come to think of it, wasn\u2019t there a character like that in the game?He was not a character that was firmly involved in the story, so my memory of his is fuzzy.\u201cThe head of our family, Gerhard-sama, would like to speak with you. Would you please accompany me?\u201d\u201cGot it\u201d\u201cPlease wait. My son!\u201d\u201cPlease be assured. Allen-sama is my Lady\u2019s benefactor. He will not be harmed. Let us swear by the name of our family, the Dukedom of Ramslett.\u201d\u201cMother, it\u2019s okay.\u201dNo matter what, Anastasia\u2019s parents would not treat me badly.When I thought about it, my mother didn\u2019t say anything more.If anything, it\u2019s more important to see how much cooperation I can get here. In order to do that, I need to make sure that the Duke likes me.I put on my uniform, dressed up and then boarded the carriage with Sebastian\u2019s guidance.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aI arrived at the Duke\u2019s huge mansion in the aristocratic district, where I was shown around the interior of the mansion, which was as magnificent as its appearance, and was led to a seat on a sofa in the reception room.The maid brewed a cup of tea, from which I took a shaky sip of it and took a deep breath to calm myself down.It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve thought of all the possible answers. And if it still doesn\u2019t work, I can always escape through the sewers.I can manage.Thinking about this made me relax a little.Then, After waiting for a while, a hairy, stern blond gorilla came into the room wearing a very nice suit made for humans.Ah no, it\u2019s wrong. When I looked closely, I saw that it was a human. I mistook him for a gorilla because of his magnificent beard, chiselled face, and wonderful physique.And the moment I thought about such an unimportant thing, my tension quickly eased.Alright, I can do it.I kneel and thank my liege.\u201cI\u2019m Gerhard, the head of the Dukedom of Ramslett. It looks like you\u2019ve taken care of my daughter. Come on, have a seat.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s nice to meet you. My name is Allen.\u201dWhen I was allowed, I said my name and took a seat on the couch.\u201cNow, I\u2019m sorry to call you out of the blue this morning.\u201d\u201cNo problem at all.\u201dFor the time being, considering Anastasia\u2019s personality, it would probably be best not to be too sycophantic.\u201cHou, Don\u2019t ask about the business or do unnecessary flatter, is it?\u201d (TL:- Duke\u2019s response on Allen\u2019s tone.)Apparently, I was right. I responded to the Duke\u2019s words with silence.\u201cI see. Something like this at that age? No wonder my daughter took interest in you.\u201dThe Duke\u2019s expression relaxed as he said that.\u201cWell, first of all, I heard that you fought a duel with the Crown Prince and Prince Claude on behalf of my daughter last night. Let me thank you for this. Thank you, Allen-kun.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s! I\u2019m sorry to trouble you.\u201dI was surprised because I didn\u2019t expect the Duke to thank me so frankly. However, the Duke looked at me with an impressed look.Hmm? What was the element that impressed you now?\u201cNow, can I ask you a few questions?\u201d\u201cYes, Anything you want.\u201dI answer shortly.\u201cUmu. I\u2019m sorry, but I had to look into you. You\u2019re the youngest C-rank adventurer to ever traversed the Goblin Dungeon and also a slayer of goblins and Orcs. And according to my daughter, you\u2019ve even defeated a Blizzard Phoenix.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cAlso, I heard that you skipped a grade in the common school and saved up the money to enter the high school by yourself.\u201d\u201cYes\u201d\u201cThen why did you request to be a representative in a duel like that? You\u2019re not so stupid that you don\u2019t understand the meaning of it, are you? Surely, you wanted my daughter, isn\u2019t that the reason?\u201dOf course, It was a question that was bound to come. I gave him the answer I had prepared.\u201cYes. I was prepared to get expelled from the school. And about Anastasia-sama, I respect her attitude of earnest effort. Of course, I understand that our statuses are different.\u201d\u201cThen why? As you enrolled in the High School, that means you had dreamt of graduating it, right?\u201dThe Duke\u2019s expression did not change. He probably doesn\u2019t have any ulterior motive for this question and genuinely wants to know because he doesn\u2019t understand my actions.\u201cWell, that\u2019s right. You may not believe me, but I wanted to protect my mother and the people who took care of me.\u201d\u201cwhat?\u201dFor the first time, the Duke moved his eyebrows and gave me a dubious look.\u201cI don\u2019t know how much you know, but it\u2019s clear to everyone that there is no justice in that duel at all.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ve heard it all. I\u2019ve never heard of a duel as terrible as that one.\u201dThe Duke nodded and replied to my words.\u201cBut even such a duel is a duel. If Anastasia-sama had fought the duel herself, she probably would have lost because she would not have been able to hurt His Highness.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure she will, given my daughter\u2019s personality.\u201d\u201cIn that case, Anastasia-sama would have been expelled from the school for a crime she did not commit because the other party demanded that Anastasia-sama was forbidden to approach His Highnesses.\u201d\u201cIt would have happened.\u201dThe Duke nodded without changing his expression.\u201cHowever, if the Duke\u2019s daughter gets unilaterally eliminated in such a manner, the other noble families would not be safe either. What awaits this is the succession struggle between the Crown Prince and the Second Prince. Looking back at the history, this conflict is very dangerous as a lot of blood will be spilt, and the country will be in chaos.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I understand what you\u2019re saying. But, what does that have to do with protecting your mother or anyone you know?\u201dThe Duke asked me a question as he deepened the wrinkles between his eyebrows.\u201cIn a recent newspaper, I noticed something worrisome about the Est Empire.\u201d\u201cWha! What did you say! You! No way!\u201dI nod silently.\u201cIs that so, you have thought that far \u2026 I see. I see. I get it. I\u2019ll take full responsibility for your case. I can also guarantee your mother\u2019s safety. You can relax.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dI said and bowed deeply.\u201cDo not worry. From this moment on, the Duke of Ramslett is your backing. If you have any problems, please contact us.\u201d\u201cThank you very much!\u201dIn this way, I thanked the Duke and came back to my parent\u2019s house riding their carriage.By the way, I couldn\u2019t see Anastasia. She said she didn\u2019t want to see me. I don\u2019t know why but it felt like she didn\u2019t like me.It was a strange way to say goodbye, and unfortunately, it can\u2019t be helped. I guess I should just be happy that I destroyed my fate and still managed to survive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The story will revolve around their interactions and relationship development.P.S:- Yep, Anna is cute.(\u203e\u25e1\u203e)\u2013AninsarA few days after the Duke promised me his full support, Sebastian-san came to visit my parent\u2019s house again.\u201cAllen-sama, it\u2019s been a while. I am here to extend an invitation from the head of our family. We would like to invite you to dinner tomorrow, so please come with your mother. Our family will provide a carriage to pick you up. Also, since we understand the situation, please do not wear formal clothes, and come dressed as you normally would in town. Also, there is no need for you to bring any souvenirs.\u201d\u201cUnderstood\u201dAfter saying that, Sebastian-san left the written invitation and went home.\u201cAllen, who was here?\u201d\u201cThe butler of the Duke of Ramslett. I\u2019ve been invited for dinner with my mother tomorrow evening.\u201d\u201cOh, what should I do? I don\u2019t have a dress. Also, Allen has the uniform only, Umm.\u201d\u201cMom, Sebastian-san said that we don\u2019t need to wear formal clothes. He reminded me that we should come dressed in the usual clothes used to walk around town. He was concerned that I probably wouldn\u2019t have that kind of clothing.\u201d\u201cMore-more than that, getting invited by a duke feels like fluffy and unrealistic. Oh! That\u2019s right. I have to tell them about this absence in tomorrow\u2019s afternoon work. Allen also has nothing planned tomorrow, right?\u201dWith that said, my mother rushed out of the house.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\u201cThank you for inviting me today.\u201dAs I had been told, I came here in casual clothes and empty-handed, but I still felt uncomfortable. Sebastian-san guides us through the Duke\u2019s huge mansion and into the dining room.There Duke, Anastasia, and what I assumed to be Anastasia\u2019s mother and brother were already seated waiting for us.\u201cHello, Allen-kun, welcome. And you must be Allen-kun\u2019s mother. Nice to meet you. I am Gerhard Kreinel von Ramslett, the head of the Ramslett family. My daughter is often supported and helped by your son for that I\u2019m very grateful.\u201dThe Duke then naturally took my mother\u2019s hand and kissed the back of it. As expected of a nobleman.\u201cThis is my wife, Elisabeth, and my son, Friedrich.\u201dIt seems to be the Duchess and the next Duke, also Anastasia\u2019s mother and brother.\u201cIt\u2019s an honour to meet you. Elisabeth-sama, Friedrich-sama. My name is Allen.\u201dI said and knelt so as not to be rude.\u201cMy name is Katerina, Allen\u2019s mother. Thank you for inviting me today.\u201dWhen my mother said that, she spread the hem of her skirt and bent down a bit to take a bow.\u201cToday, I have invited my daughter\u2019s benefactor and his mother here. Let\u2019s not be so formal about it.\u201dWhen the Duke said so, we stop the courtesy.\u201cCome on, Anna, Allen-kun is here, you know?\u201dElisabeth-san says so and brings Anastasia in front of me.\u201c\u2026 Allen\u201d\u201cAnastasia-sama, nothing\u2013\u201c\u201cYou! Was that not a way to say goodbye!\u201dAnastasia said to me with more emotion than I\u2019ve ever seen her show in my life. I didn\u2019t see her the last time I was here, and I thought she hated me, but I guess not.I\u2019m glad.I was relieved to find out that she didn\u2019t hate me, and I couldn\u2019t help but smile at how cute this emotional Anastasia was.\u201cWha! What are you laughing at? I am!\u201d\u201cExcuse me. It\u2019s good to see you again.\u201d\u201cEh, Ahh. Yes, Me, me, too. Also, you know, umm, I\u2019m, I\u2019m grateful, for the representation\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to. Also, I couldn\u2019t leave it that way.\u201d\u201cO-Ohh\u201dI\u2019m a little surprised at the appearance of Anastasia that I can\u2019t see at school.\u201cAllen-kun? Anna has been worried about you for a long time, you know? On the day of the incident, she ran crying to her father\u2019s room in the middle of the night.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cMother! That\u2019s not it! Also, I was not crying!\u201dWhen Elisabeth-san says so in a funny way, Anastasia denies it with a bright red face. (TL:- Kawaii, =\uffe3\u03c9\uffe3= )\u201cOh my, Anna. That\u2019s right, Allen. If you don\u2019t mind, why don\u2019t you call her \u201cAnna\u201d? I\u2019m sure she\u2019d like that.\u201d\u201cEh? What? M-Mother?\u201dAs I thought, Anastasia, who is laughing according to her age, is far more attractive than having such a frozen expression.\u201cUmm, then Anna-sama?\u201d\u201cUgh, geez. Then, only when no one is around, okay?\u201d\u201cYes, Anna-sama\u201dThen, I introduce my mother to Anna, who is turning bright red, and the dinner party begins. Then the Duke gets right to the point.\u201cNow, the reason why I\u2019ve called you both here is that I thought I\u2019d like to give you a report on how this whole thing went down.\u201dI look the duke right in the eye.\u201cFirst of all, the apology to the Ramslett family, which was decided as a condition for the duel, was settled on the fact that His Highness the Crown Prince and Miss Amy would apologize to Anastasia, representing the Ramslett family, during the school\u2019s opening ceremony next term. Because it would make sense to do it in a place where there are people who saw the scene of the insult.\u201d\u201cYes\u201d\u201cAnd the engagement between the Crown Prince and my daughter is officially cancelled. As expected, I couldn\u2019t continue the engagement after what they did to her.\u201dWith that said, the Duke took a breath.\u201cWell, my daughter seems to be quite fond of you, Allen. I would like you to be her \u2018friend\u2019 as well, Allen.\u201d\u201cYes, if I could do it, I will.\u201dI guess that\u2019s why he said the word \u2018friend\u2019 so strongly. Of course.\u201cAnd finally, regarding your treatment, I have had the royal family approve that Allen-kun and Katerina-san will come under the protection of our family. Therefore, you will not have to leave school and will not be punished.\u201d\u201cReally!\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s true. If you want, you can work here after graduation, or I can find you a job. But first, make sure you make the most of your time at school.\u201d\u201cThank you very much!\u201d\u201cOh, Duke-sama. Thank you. Thank you very much.\u201dMy mother and I thanked the Duke for his kindness. Apparently, I don\u2019t have to drop out of school, and I can continue to attend school.\u201cAllen, I\u2019ll be in your care again next year.\u201dAnastasia said to me, rejoicing, and a big smile bloomed on her face.\u201cMe too, I look forward to working with you.\u201dI managed to reply that, but her smile that I saw for the first time was very attractive.I\u2019m glad I worked so hard just to see this smile.I honestly thought so.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019m thinking of challenging the newly discovered Dungeon in Altmunt. Would you mind escorting me?\u201d\u201cInto the Great Dungeon of Orcs? Fine, but how deep do you want to go?\u201d\u201cGreat Dungeon? What do you mean?\u201dOops, without a thought, I answered her. So it was discovered recently.However, trying to correct it improperly will not do me any good, so I decided to confess it obediently.\u201cActually, a long time ago, I found an undiscovered Dungeon in the depths of the Altmunt forest and conquered it.\u201d\u201cHuh? What did you say? Allen, Wasn\u2019t the Goblin Dungeon the only one you traversed?\u201d\u201cBecause even though it was an undiscovered Dungeon, the boss on the bottom level was only the Orc King. There were no traps, and it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal, so I thought I didn\u2019t need to say anything about it.\u201dWhen Anna hears me say that, she puts her hand on her forehead and has a dumbfounded expression on her face.\u201cSeriously, they say there\u2019s a fine line between genius and all but were you also of that group?\u201dThat\u2019s rude, I\u2019m not a genius, so there\u2019s no way I\u2019m even close to them. In my previous life, in college, there were a lot of people who were a lot better than me.\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been traversing it with high-speed laps, so if you can protect yourself at least, I can probably conquer it with Anna-sama, but what do you think?\u201d\u201cWait, Allen. What is a high-speed lap?\u201d\u201cEh? To raise the level, I just traverse the Dungeon and then transfer to the entrance and repeat.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAnna is putting her hand on her forehead again. As I thought, she must have been overwhelmed when she was made to be the Crown Prince\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.But I think it\u2019s more attractive when her expression changes like now. As I was looking at her, Anna stared into my eyes.Iya, I\u2019m not that immune to women, so I\u2019m embarrassed when they stare at me with such a beautiful face.\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re you. So, are you going to take care of it?\u201d\u201cYes, gladly\u201dAnd so with that, Anna and I went to play in the Great Dungeon of Orcs. (TL:- Dungeon date(?).)\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aThen, after a long time, I rode a horse-drawn carriage to Altomunt. It\u2019s a bit of a hassle to take a horse-drawn carriage over a long distance that would have taken few hours if we had taken the Buitor, but it\u2019s nice to travel by horse-drawn carriage because it has a retro feel to it.And After a long journey, we arrived at Margaret\u2019s family house.\u201cHi, Allen-kun. Long time no see.\u201d\u201cMargaret-sama, it\u2019s been a long time.\u201dI kneel and bow.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Allen-kun. You\u2019re my classmate. Also, you\u2019re the knight who saved Anna-sama\u2019s life.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not like that\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, jeez. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, Allen-kun, who was able to defeat five of the strongest students in the school. If it weren\u2019t for Anna-sama, I would have recruited him as a knight myself.\u201d\u201cHey, Margaret\u201d\u201cI know, I know. Ana-sama, I\u2019m not going to snatch your precious Knight-kun away from you. I\u2019m not like that whore.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201c\u2026\u2026 Ah, right. Besides, Allen\u2019s not that kind of guy.\u201dEh? Hmm? What is this exchange? Maybe am I wishing it \u2026. No, I can\u2019t. The Duke reminded me that I\u2019m only a friend, and if I put my hand on her, my neck will fly.Not metaphorically, but physically.Well, with that exchange, I was given a room at Margaret\u2019s mansion and taken care of. What\u2019s more, I was even accompanied by a maid!Of course, I\u2019m grateful, but the mansions of the aristocrats were unnecessarily large and luxurious, and for a mediocre citizen like me, I felt uncomfortable in a place like this.Ah, of course, I didn\u2019t spend a dream night with the maid, okay?\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aThen next day, I took Anna, Margaret, and the five knights guarding us to the Great Dungeon of Orcs. We went through the formalities and entered the Dungeon, but unlike the time when it was undiscovered, there seemed to be a lot of adventurers taking on the challenge.\u201cThen let\u2019s proceed quickly. However, I would like to get an idea of your abilities, so if any orcs appear, please try to fight them by yourselves. If it looks dangerous, I\u2019ll help you right away.\u201dThe five knights seem to think I\u2019m a shady person, but they followed the orders of their master, Margaret, to the letter.\u201cThen I\u2019ll do it first.\u201dWith that said, I readied my Nikov and fired a shot at the Orc that had come out from the back. With a loud bang, the bullet struck the Orc right between the eyes, and it collapsed and stopped moving.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat? What was that now?\u201dAnna and Margaret say so and become speechless. The knights also froze, their eyes darting around.\u201cWith the application of wind magic, I sent iron bullets flying and shot them in. This is a magical tool to assist with that. I made it.\u201d\u201cI-I see. As expected of Allen, I\u2019m counting on you.\u201dWhen I said that, Anna returned from the astound state and said so.\u201cThank you\u201dAfter that, things went pretty fast. The knights followed my instructions, and we were able to move forward with ease.In this way, we quickly traverse the Orc\u2019s Dungeon, which I knew all too well, and easily defeated the boss at the bottom level.\u201cOkay, with this, you have now conquered the Great Dungeon of Orcs. Congratulations!\u201d\u201cOh, ohh\u201d\u201cI had to rely on Allen-kun halfway through, but yeah. Thanks.\u201dThus, we quickly conquered the Great Dungeon of Orcs and later added the achievement of the Great Dungeon of Orcs Conqueror in my guild card.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

By the end, she was able to defeat the Orc King on the 100th level by herself without my help, so she must have reached at least level 20.Then, when Anna\u2019s level stopped rising, we quit traversing the Great Dungeon of Orcs at high speed and returned to the capital. After that, the days were rather peaceful, I spent a fulfilling winter vacation, occasionally went to the elf village to get honey from them, and to the Wind Mountain Dungeon alone and played with Blizzard Phoenix while doing high-speed laps, also researched to improve the Buitor and the firearms.By the way, in the elf village, that pervert was still there and doing whatever he wanted, but since he wasn\u2019t harming anyone and the elves seemed to be satisfied, so I decided to leave him alone.And that pervert, no matter how perverted he seems, is the spirit of light. As long as that pervert is lending his power, there won\u2019t be a problem with the monsters settling in the forest unless there is something wrong with them, you know?Now, since we were able to stop Anna\u2019s condemnation and banishment as I had originally intended, I was able to stop the initial trigger that led to the destruction of the royal capital. However, the reality is not so sweet where everything would be solved with this only.First of all, from what the Duke said at that time, it seems that both the Crown Prince and Amy ended up with a lenient punishment of no blame as long as they apologized. So, we have to be careful because I don\u2019t know what Amy will do to get rid of Anna in the future.On the other hand, the story that the Crown Prince and his entourage were defeated by me in a 5 vs 1 duel has become quite popular among the nobles, and they say that neither the Crown Prince nor his entourage is worthy of being the heir of their family.In particular, the Crown Prince lost the support of the southern aristocrats, who united around the Duke of Ramslett, when he cut his ties with his political marriage partner Anna.Due to these influences, there has been a change in the royal palace factions, where the crown prince originally overwhelmingly dominated it and is now divided between the crown prince\u2019s faction, the second prince\u2019s faction, and the moderate faction, which believes that we should watch and choose the better option.On the other hand, the Duke seems to have decided to wait before making any decisions. It seems that the Duke and the Southern aristocrats are treated as the Ramslett faction because they have not acted together with the moderates.I don\u2019t know what their intentions are, but since they\u2019ve also hushed up the nobles of their faction, I think they\u2019re looking for the right moment to maximize the favour they can sell to either side.By the way, all of this information was given to me by Sebastian-san, and the situation is similar to the scene after Anna was banished in the game.I can\u2019t help but think that it would have been better if I had just disposed of the crown prince without giving him a sermon at that time, but then no matter what I do, I would be executed for doing so. The world is not that simple.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aAnd then the first day of school in second grade came, and I could feel the eyes on me. As expected, \u2018The commoner who had a duel with His Highness is good\u2019 kind of rumours are floating around.I didn\u2019t care and head to the auditorium to check my class placement, but there was something unexpected.Please take a look at this first.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25001 Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett2 Allen3 Margaret von Altmunt4 Amy von Brayes5 Markus von Beinz\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb10 Oscar von Wimlet\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb18 Karlheinz Bartille von Centraren19 Isabella von Luinberg\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 Below, B class \u2500\u2500\u2500\u250020 Leonardo von Jukes\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb38 Glen Weitberg\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500The first good thing is that Anna\u2019s entourage and friend, Isabella, has been promoted to class A. On the other hand, the crown prince is still in class A even though he dropped many grades. Well, I guess they can\u2019t just suddenly drop the crown prince to B class after awarding him as the best student.And Leonardo, who came last in the final exam for the second time in a row, finally dropped to B class.Serves you right!And one more thing, did you notice the biggest change?Yes, the name of Prince Claude, who had come from a neighbouring country to study abroad, was missing. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on, but I guess it means that Prince Claude has dropped out of school.Not only me, but the other students looking at the notice board seemed surprised to see Prince Claude\u2019s name missing.\u201cAllen!\u201dAnna, who found me, spoke in a lively voice.\u201cGood morning, Anastasia-sama\u201d\u201cOh! Oh, Ahh. Good morning.\u201dAnna twitched for a moment, then looked around before returning my greeting.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cMore importantly, have you heard anything about Prince Claude?\u201d\u201cNo. I was surprised that his name wasn\u2019t on the notice board for the classification.\u201d\u201cI see. I don\u2019t know why, but apparently, the Kingdom of Westerdale has asked him to drop out.\u201d\u201cIs that so, he\u2019s been through a lot.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right \u2026 more than that, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes\u201dThen, prompted by Anna, I enter the auditorium and took a seat in the front. Now that I think about it, a year ago I was sitting in the back corner, so things have changed.And after the teachers had finished their long speech, Anna, the Crown Prince and Amy were called to the stage.\u201cAllen, you come too\u201d\u201cIs that ok?\u201d\u201cOh. You acted as my agent. You have the right to see it through behind me.\u201d\u201cGot it\u201dWhen I was told that, I followed Anna, and then Markus, Oscar, and Leonardo, who saw us, followed Amy.\u201cNow, I\u2019m sure you know what I\u2019m talking about, so will you accept the outcome of the duel?\u201dWhen Anna declared so, Amy and the crown princes face contorted in frustration, and then they looked down.Then, with a small shake of her head, she bowed and apologized to Ana.\u201cWe retract and apologize for our words against the Dukes of Ramslett. We apologize.\u201d\u201cI am sorry.\u201dNeither of them seemed very sincere at all, but I guess the fact that they apologized in front of the public like this was important.\u201cAll right. I accept your apology. From now on, I hope you won\u2019t easily belittle my Dukedom of Ramslett.\u201dWhen Anna accepts their apology. The Crown Prince, Amy, and Leonardo stared at us blatantly, then hurried back to their seats.Markus and Oscar, on the other hand, hurried back, looking embarrassed.\u201cSeriously, I don\u2019t know what they apologized for.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind. And one more thing, this is for you from me. I hope you\u2019ll accept it because it\u2019s also a declaration to the rest of the students. How about it?\u201d\u201cYes, of course\u201d\u201cReally\u201dAnna said so and took a breath, then declared loudly.\u201cAllen! As my representative, you have defended the honour of my Dukedom of Ramslett well! The Duke of Ramslett has decided to take Allen and his family under our protection in recognition of his achievements and to reward him for his loyalty!\u201dThen Ana took a handkerchief out of her pocket and offered it to me.\u201cThis is the family crest of my dukedom, embroidered by me. Will you accept it?\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dI don\u2019t know much about etiquette, but I knelt and reverently accepted the gift. Then one or two people clapped for me. Margaret and Isabella.And as if invited by the two, everyone clapped.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aAfter that, the opening ceremony ended without a hitch, and the series of disturbances stemming from the event that had been going on since last year to condemn the villainess came to an end.\u201cBy the way, Anna-sama. I\u2019m not familiar with this kind of common sense, but why did you make such a declaration there? The king has already approved it, right?\u201d\u201cHmm? Ah. That was just a check on the other students. Allen here already belongs to the Dukedom of Ramslett, so don\u2019t mess with him. It\u2019s a threat that if they mess with you, they will become an enemy of the Duke of Ramslett.\u201dAnna said this while blushing a little. Thus began the second year of school life, where the villainess was not expelled, which was impossible in the game.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, they are no longer at the top of the overwhelming class caste as they were last year.In particular, people from the noble families of the Second Prince\u2019s faction began to blatantly avoid the Crown Prince &amp; Co. . In short, the struggle for power in the royal court has been brought into the school as well.Also, Leonardo, who drop to class B, was apparently disinherited.The Duke of Ramslett made a formal protest to Viscount Jukes, accusing Leonardo of using violence to force Anna to admit her guilt in the pen-burning scandal last year. In response to the protest, Leonardo admitted that he did the right thing and loudly asserted his legitimacy. As a result, the Jukes were left with no way to defend themselves.Well, Leonardo was convinced that Anna did it, and believed what he did was right, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not very happy with the punishment. Of course, I\u2019m convinced of Anna\u2019s innocence, and even suspect that Amy might have played a part in it.However, no matter what the facts were, we can\u2019t judge a crime without evidence, and it\u2019s a bit presumptuous of us to make a personal judgment about it.With that in mind, it\u2019s probably good news that Leonardo was disinherited and is no longer a candidate for the next Knight Captain. If he were to become a knight, he would definitely cause problems, and he would never be a Knight Captain.Besides, would Leonardo be able to graduate with those grades after being disinherited and losing the backing of his family?That would depend on his efforts, but if he failed to graduate and was expelled, would he have a place to go?By the way, Anna, on the other hand, is basically being treated like an object of caution. But, thanks to her friend Isabella, who is in the same class as her and Margaret, her face is more lively than last year, and I\u2019m really glad that I can see her smile.It was a good thing that the engagement was gone.I believe that from the bottom of my heart.And for me, I\u2019m continuing the figurine position. However, the big difference from last year is that I can now talk freely with Anna, Margaret and Isabella.I heard that this was largely due to what happened at the opening ceremony.I didn\u2019t understand at all the significance of Anna\u2019s deliberate action during the opening ceremony, but the conversation with Margaret and Isabella after the ceremony revealed that there was an important meaning hidden in it.\u201cYo, Knight-kun. You\u2019re pretty hot, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cCongratulations, Allen-san\u201dAfter the opening ceremony, as I was walking with Anna towards the classroom, I was approached by Margaret with a grin on her face and Isabella with a slightly cheerful expression.\u201cMargaret-sama and Isabella-sama, what do you mean?\u201dI asked back, not understanding what they meant.\u201cEh? Didn\u2019t you get a handkerchief with a family crest, hand-sewn by Anna-sama?\u201d\u201cYou see, Margaret-sama, Allen-san is a commoner, so this kind of thing is \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s right.\u201dAnna is trying to keep her composure, but her face is slightly flushed.\u201cYou see, Anna-sama. You need to explain it properly, you know?\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgBeing told by Margaret, Anna began to explain to me, slurring her words.\u201cAh, um, let\u2019s see, Allen. It\u2019s, uh, it\u2019s something, well a lady gives a handkerchief with her family crest hand-stitched on it. So, That\u2019s, uh, that\u2019s how it works.\u201dYeah, I don\u2019t understand at all.\u201cAllen-kun, that handkerchief you see, is a gift that a lady gives to her knight. In other words, Anna-sama declared in public that Allen-kun is hers. Oh, my God! I\u2019m so jealous.\u201d\u201cH-Hey! Margaret! Ah, Allen is my benefactor! Something like mine is!\u201dOh, I see. So that\u2019s how it is. I\u2019m glad to hear such a beautiful and wonderful woman say that to me\u2026But, I can\u2019t put my hands on her.I knew her from my previous life, and I wanted to help her if I could, so it\u2019s not that bad for me, but it\u2019s a complicated feeling.Besides, the Duke has reminded me that I\u2019m just a friend. I understand that this means that Anna will eventually be married off to someone else in a political marriage, so don\u2019t get your hopes up.Virginity seems to be important in the political marriages of the aristocracy, and it would be better for both of them not to get hurt if they did not expect to make mistakes.\u201cAnastasia-sama, thank you. I will definitely protect you if anything happens.\u201d\u201cOh, oh, it\u2019s a promise.\u201dAnd, well, there you have it.That\u2019s why I\u2019m now recognized by the whole school as Anna\u2019s accessory figurine (but strong when fights seriously).That\u2019s why they are divided into four groups: the Crown Prince\u2019s faction, centred around Amy\u2019s reverse harem, the Second Prince\u2019s faction, which is at odds with the Crown Prince\u2019s faction, the opportunistic faction, which only reluctantly follows the Crown Prince, and us, the Duke of Ramslett\u2019s faction.To be honest, factional fights even within the school are trivial, but I guess this is the epitome of this country.Besides, the situation as it is could eventually lead to a civil war like in the game.In any case, the situation at the school was even worse than in the game, with the number of the Crown Prince\u2019s faction decreasing and the number of the Second Prince\u2019s faction and the opportunistic faction greatly increasing. This means that the Second Prince\u2019s faction now has the material to attack the Crown Prince\u2019s faction through my intervention.I don\u2019t really care who becomes the next king. However, I\u2019ve made all the preparations to this point and things are going according to plan. I have to avoid the situation where the capital is overrun.And now that I\u2019ve succeeded in destroying destiny, it\u2019s dangerous to act based on my knowledge of the game from here on. While referring to the game\u2019s knowledge, it is important to be prepared by gathering information.Est Empire! I won\u2019t let you overrun the royal capital!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So I will be following the schedule from this week.o((>\u03c9< ))oTo my surprise, I\u2019ve been living a normal school life lately. I wake up in the morning, eat breakfast in the dormitory, and go to class as usual. After school, I study in the library with Anna, Margaret, and Isabella. Then after eating dinner, I return to my room in the dormitory and spend the rest of the time freely.Since then, neither Amy nor any of the reverse-harem members have mess with us, and I feel as if last year when I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone, was a lie, a dream-like school life.One day, while I was resting in my room in the dormitory, Sebastian-san came to visit me and took me out.\u201cGood evening, Allen-sama. After that, how was your school life?\u201d\u201cYes. Thanks to Anna-sama, Margaret-sama and Isabella-sama, it is fulfilling.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Then that\u2019s good. By the way, how are things going at school? It took a long time for my lady\u2019s series of incidents to come to light, so I was wondering if you could tell me anything you\u2019ve noticed.\u201d\u201cI see. So that\u2019s how it was\u201dIn other words, the purpose of his visit to me was to gather information. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s talking to people other than me, but in short, as a member of the Duke of Ramslett\u2019s family, he\u2019s expecting me to gather information about the school.As for me, I don\u2019t want to become a useful tool and get used completely. But now that he is my backer, and I want Anna to smile. For that reason, I need to make sure that the Duke of Ramslett remains alive and not executed like in the game.\u201cOf course. I owe a debt of gratitude to both the Duke and Anna-sama, so I will cooperate to the extent I can. In return, if you don\u2019t mind, can you tell me what\u2019s going on in the royal palace?\u201d\u201cIn the royal palace, is it?\u201d\u201cYes. As I said to the Duke, I am worried about the national crisis from the struggle for succession.\u201dWhen I say that, Sebastian-san seem as if he\u2019s thinking long and hard about something.\u201c\u2026\u2026 What do you envision in the current situation, Allen-sama?\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I haven\u2019t been able to see through it yet. I\u2019m especially curious about Prince Claude.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 I see.\u201dSebastian-san didn\u2019t change his expression, but I could see that he was a little upset. So I tried to change the subject a little.\u201cRight now, I\u2019m in a position to support the prince, who supports the duke.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cHowever, if it were possible, I would really like them to decide either to banish the Crown Prince or to not accept him as a Crown Prince in the future.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you\u2019re worried about the west?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s what I meant. It\u2019s just that I have too little information to be sure.\u201d\u201cIs that so? That\u2019s right. I see. I understand. I\u2019ll invite you to the Duke\u2019s residence later.\u201d\u201cThank you\u201dThus, I was invited back to the Duke\u2019s residence.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\u201cWelcome, I hope you\u2019re enjoying your time at school.\u201dAs soon as I arrived at the drawing-room of the Duke\u2019s residence, the Duke called out to me.\u201cYes. Anna-sama has been very good to me.\u201d\u201cWell then, As her \u2018friend\u2019, help Anna when she needs.\u201dThat\u2019s why he emphasized the word \u2018friend\u2019 again.\u201cYes. Of course. I\u2019m a \u2018commoner\u2019, so if I can be of any help to Anna-sama, I\u2019ll be satisfied.\u201dI now emphasize the word \u2018commoner\u2019 to show my willingness to follow the status system.\u201c\u2026\u2026 All right. Passed.\u201dThe Duke grinned and cut to the chase.\u201cNow, Allen-kun. No, Allen says you\u2019re concerned about the west. What did you assume from the information you just gave me?\u201d\u201cYes, I heard that Prince Claude was expelled from school at the request of the Westerdale Kingdom. From that, I have a hypothesis that the Westerdale Kingdom may have made some kind of deal with the Est Empire.\u201d\u201cHou\u201dThe duke looks at me with an interested expression.\u201cPerhaps the general view is that this expulsion is a reprimand and punishment for the disgrace Prince Claude has shown.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s how it\u2019s generally perceived.\u201d\u201cHowever, considering Prince Claude\u2019s mentality, I think he would choose to be next to Amy-sama, even if it means putting himself to shame.\u201d\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d\u201cPrince Claude was blindly in love with Amy-sama. That should be obvious from that crazy duel.\u201d\u201cThen why did Prince Claude agree to leave school?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s in Amy-sama\u2019s best interest that he is not at the academy.\u201d\u201cHou. You mean?\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cYes. Isn\u2019t Prince Claude expecting Amy-sama to have to leave our country? This is where the confusion from the succession dispute comes into play. And if it\u2019s just a succession dispute, it\u2019s inconceivable that Amy-sama, who is favoured by the legitimate son of such a powerful nobleman, would flee the country. In other words, doesn\u2019t Prince Claude think that there is a reasonable possibility of devastation caused by war?\u201dOf course, there is also the possibility that the Crown Prince\u2019s side will lose and Amy and her family will be forced to leave the country, so there is no denying that the theory is a bit far-fetched.But when the Duke heard my opinion, he was silent for a while, pondering, and then he smiled and opened his mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting reasoning. However, the Westerdale Kingdom is a friend of our country and an ally against the United Kingdom of Norsane in the north. It also relies heavily on imports of food and resources from our country. Why would the Westerdale Kingdom make such a deal with the Est Empire?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a possibility. However, this year\u2019s freshman list at the school did not include the name of the Westerdale princess who is one year younger than Prince Claude.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? I heard that she was originally planning to enrol in a school in her own country.\u201d\u201cNo. If it is such an important neighbouring country, I think they would have sent another person here. Or, it wouldn\u2019t be strange if there was talk of a political marriage, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cHmm\u201d\u201cAt least the Westerdale Kingdom is not allied with the Est Empire or the Kingdom of Xaus. Besides, if the United Kingdom of Norsarne and the Westerdale Kingdom make peace, our country will be surrounded by enemies. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to assume the worst here?\u201dHowever, even after saying this much, I believe that expulsion is a punishment in more ways than one.But on the other hand, there is no guarantee that the Westerdale Kingdom will lend a hand when the Est Empire invades.Of course, in the game, the Westerdale Kingdom did not betray us but lent us a hand. But the reason why the Westerdale Kingdom helped the Crown Prince, Amy and the others were because Prince Claude, who fell for her, witnessed the moment Amy awakened as a saint and used it to persuade his home country.There may be some opportunism due to the fact that it was a game.However, Prince Claude, who was supposed to persuade, has dropped out of school. It is unlikely that Prince Claude will be present at the moment of Amy\u2019s awakening.Besides. In the first place, I doubt very much that Amy can be a saint.As long as that pervert is doing whatever he wants as the spirit of light, the Elf Village rescue event will not occur. If that\u2019s the case, she won\u2019t be able to reach the elf village. And if that happens, the event of receiving the blessing of the Spirit of Light itself will not occur.Furthermore, even if she did manage to reach the elf village, the spirit of light is that pervert.Wouldn\u2019t Amy have to be about ten years younger to do something for nothing in return?And when that happens, it\u2019s hard to believe that they will lend force to recapture the country to the illegitimate daughter of a Baron who is no saint and the Crown Prince who lost disgracefully to a commoner.To be clear, there is no reason not to think that it would be better to join hands with the Est Empire to share the territory.\u201cHmm. That\u2019s good. I\u2019m surprised you thought that far ahead with so little information. It is true that the relationship with Westerdale is not perfect. But as the Duke of Ramslett, I can\u2019t move from the royal family in the current situation.\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s because of what happened, isn\u2019t it?\u201dBut the Duke was silent for a moment, and then slowly opened his mouth.\u201cAllen, Friedrich is back in the territory now. Do you know why?\u201dEh? The next head of the family has returned to the estate?The Duchy of Ramslett is the southern breadbasket. And in the south is the Kingdom of Xaus. Also, the Kingdom of Xaus is an ally of the Est Empire.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me Est and Xaus are moving at the same time?\u201dThe duke smirked at my words.\u201cFufufu, not bad, Allen. But the army can\u2019t make any sudden moves. It won\u2019t be until summer, when the winter wheat harvest is over, that they\u2019ll make a move. You got my daughter\u2019s handkerchief, didn\u2019t you? I\u2019m counting on you.\u201d\u201cYes\u201dIt seems that things are far beyond my expectations.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Not only did Anna get a perfect score, but Margaret got a perfect score, and Isabella is very close to getting a perfect score.And for some reason, Amy, who was supposed to be a smart girl, is getting worse and worse. It seems to me that the content of the test is just barely up to the level of Japanese junior high school, but how can this happen when she has memories of her previous life?Well, I don\u2019t care. There is no real harm these days.Amy is quiet as if she\u2019s been nailed, and the Crown Prince and his friends are in a state where they are helpless against Anna.He doesn\u2019t mess with me at all these days because I win in both magic and sword fighting in the class by an overwhelming margin.I don\u2019t know if I was lazy or couldn\u2019t get out, but I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t level up during the winter break.Anyway, as long as they don\u2019t interfere with us, there\u2019s no need for us to do anything to them as we don\u2019t care.I\u2019m more concerned about succession disputes and foreign relations than that.Conflict can only occur on the same level. And the opposite of love is indifference.I never thought I would feel these words this way.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aNow, today I have promised to go to the Adventurer\u2019s Guild with Anna.Oh, before I go, I\u2019m not talking about introducing Anna to master or anything like that. If I do that, my head will physically fly.Eh? What if it doesn\u2019t mean that? Well, I know that but still\u2026Anyway, we students at the school need to do some independent research during the summer vacation.And Anna wanted to know about the role that adventurers play in this country, so we decided to visit the guild to see if it could be a theme.I\u2019ve notified the guild in advance, so there should be no problem.By the way, Margaret and Isabella are also planning to do independent research together, but they have their own interests, so I\u2019ve asked them to do some research at the library today, and we\u2019ll get together later to decide on a theme.Now that we had changed into civilian clothes, we headed for the guild on foot instead of using the Duke\u2019s carriage to avoid causing a scene. Anna was too conspicuous, so I asked her to wear a hooded cloak, though it would be a little hot.We walked down the main street of the town, then around the corner to a street that was off the main street. Thereupon I saw Amy and her friends, who I thought were unimportant earlier, in an alleyway.\u201cHuh? Amy-sama? Also, the Crown Prince and the others? What on earth are they doing in a place like this?\u201dIf you look closely, you can see that they seem to be surrounding a small person wearing a crude linen robe against the wall.Umm? I\u2019m not sure about the situation, but what is going on here?We look at each other and nod, then quietly approached them.That person looks very thin. A man would not be that thin, so it must be a woman who is surrounded by them.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you that we\u2019ll get rid of the monsters. So hurry up and guide us to the village.\u201d\u201cWe are the best in our grade. We will not abandon those who are in trouble because of being attacked by monsters.\u201dFollowing Amy, Leonardo says so. However, since I am special, I\u2019ll leave it at that, but isn\u2019t the top performer of the grade already Ana, and isn\u2019t you guys that are largely isolated?What\u2019s more, how can you be so high and mighty even if you\u2019re at the top of your class?\u201cHii, That\u2019s why I told you there\u2019s no such thing as demons\u2013\u201cThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.orgThe woman, who looked completely terrified, countered with a shiver.\u201cHow dare you lie to me, the next king?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not lying.\u201dUmm? For the time being let\u2019s help her? I feel like I\u2019ve heard that voice before.And in contrast to them, Markus and Oscar, who are together but didn\u2019t involve. I wonder if they feel guilty about it?However, I feel like I\u2019m just as guilty when I don\u2019t stop it.I glanced at Ana, and she nodded widely, so I called out to them.\u201cHey. What are you guys doing out here in a place like this?\u201dThen Amy glared at me like an Oni.\u201cWhat! Are you going to interfere with me again? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re trying to stop me from getting my blessing, is it?\u201d\u201cUm? What are you talking about?\u201dI have no idea what she is talking about.But the next moment, the petite woman dashed toward me.\u201cA-Allen, help me!\u201dThen she tackled me in the stomach with tremendous force.\u201cOwa~tsu!? W-What the hell?\u201dI couldn\u2019t avoid it because Anna was behind me, so I took it in a hurry.\u201cHmm? Could that voice be Sheryl Laura-san?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! Please, some weird guy is threatening me out of nowhere! Help me! I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to take my money!\u201dWhen I heard that, I felt the air around Anna became cold.Dangerous! Is she angry!\u201cI see. Your Highness, what are you trying to achieve by committing robbery in the middle of the city?\u201d\u201cW-What kind of nonsense are you saying? We came here because Amy received a divine prophecy that there would be a person here who would seek help for their village which will get attacked by the monsters. And according to the prophecy, this woman appeared in the exact place and appearance described in the prophecy.\u201dHmm? Prophecy? blessing? Sheryl Laura-san will?Ah, I see! So this is the compulsory event of the request for help from the elf village.\u201cUh, Sheryl Laura-san. Did something like that happened?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not being attacked by the monsters! I\u2019m here to request Allen for a job!\u201dSheryl Laura-san, who tucked herself behind my back, said so.\u201cUm, that\u2019s how it is, so can you stop pestering her now?\u201dHowever, he glared at me and wouldn\u2019t follow those words.\u201cYour Highness? Is it really okay for Your Highness to rob in the middle of the city?\u201dWhen Anna said this to the Crown Prince with the cold glares she has shown for the first time in a while, he looked as if he had given up.\u201cKuh, It\u2019s no use. Let\u2019s go home!\u201d\u201cEh? Wait a minute? Karl-sama.\u201dThen they glared at us and walked away embarrassed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If Sheryl Laura\u2019s ears get exposed in a place like this, it would be a big problem.So I took them to the Adventurer\u2019s Guild and asked master to rent a reception room for VIP. And after asking him to make sure no one came in, we finally had a calm environment to talk.\u201cNow, Introduced her to me, Allen.\u201d\u201cYes, Anna-sama. This Lady is Sheryl Laura-sama. She is the daughter of the Queen of the Elven Village. Sheryl Laura, this is Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett, daughter of the Duke of Ramslett, and the one to whom I am indebted to.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dAnna froze beautifully. Then, after being frozen for a few seconds, she immediately changes to the expression of a noblewoman and performs the courtesy of a lady.\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were Her Royal Princess, and I apologize for my rudeness. My name is Anastasia, daughter of the Duke of Ramslett. Your Highness, Sheryl Laura, it is an honour to meet you.\u201d\u201cHmph. Yeah. Now that you know it\u2019s okay. So, why are you in such a weird pose?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dAnna froze again.\u201cAnna-sama, I apologize for the delay in explaining. They don\u2019t have such manners in the elven village, and status doesn\u2019t matter much.\u201d\u201cWha?\u201d\u201cSo, Sheryl Laura-san, What on earth do you want?\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m here to ask Allen for a nomination request? There\u2019s going to be a summer festival in the Elf Village which we celebrate once every 10 years. So I came to invite Allen. I don\u2019t know much about it, but when adventurer gets a nomination request they are supposed to do it, right? \u201c\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cBecause you haven\u2019t been coming around lately, Allen. Meryl, Rho-sama, and everyone in your village misses you, you know?\u201dNo, I haven\u2019t been there lately you say, but didn\u2019t I went during winter vacation. And Why are you risking your life to come here just for a summer festival?\u201cWell, Sheryl Laura-san? You know that human towns are dangerous for elves, don\u2019t you? Also, you didn\u2019t say anything about it when I went there this winter, you know? Why didn\u2019t you tell me then?\u201d\u201cAh, no, um, you know. I was wondering if I could get a ride on that flying boat of Allen\u2019s.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t take such a risk for something so simple as this!\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cUuu, I\u2019m sorry \u2026\u201dI mean, what am I going to do now? Anna found out about Buitor, too.\u201cHey, Allen, looks like you\u2019ve got a lot of explaining to do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes\u201dAnna\u2019s gaze is very cold.\u201cFirst of all, Why are you familiar with the elves?\u201d\u201cOf course, it\u2019s because Allen is a benefactor of our village.\u201dSheryl Laura-san answers Anna\u2019s question.\u201cUu \u2026 So why is Allen a benefactor?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because Allen is the treasured child of the Wind God who descended from the sky when the village was attacked by an evil spirit!\u201d\u201cThe god of the wind\u2019s \u2026 treasured child?\u201d\u201cOh? You don\u2019t know? Fufu, You guys look like you\u2019re getting along, but you\u2019re not. Oh, maybe he\u2019s just using his power to make you obey him, is it?\u201d\u201cHey! Sheryl Laura-san!\u201dAnna looked blatantly shocked.\u201cPlease don\u2019t bully Anna-sama too much.\u201d\u201cOh, no. You want a little girl like that, Allen?\u201dSheryl Laura said with a colicky, happy laugh.\u201cPlease don\u2019t make fun of me. There are things you can say and things you can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cHmph? Well, okay. So, I\u2019m going to ask Allen to come to the summer festival, okay?\u201d\u201cHuh. Well, that\u2019s fine. So, when is it?\u201d\u201cIt starts tomorrow.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cOh, if it\u2019s Allen, shouldn\u2019t we there in no time?\u201d\u201cWell, yes, but \u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cW-Wait! If Allen\u2019s going, you\u2019ve to take me with you too, okay?\u201dAs we were exchanging these words, Anna interrupted us from the side.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. I can\u2019t take any other human other than Allen into the village. If you\u2019re Allen\u2019s wife then it would\u2019ve been possible, but you\u2019re not, right? You guys don\u2019t look very close, you know?\u201dWhen Anna heard that comment from Sheryl Laura, she fell silent and froze.Oh, but what should I do? This seems difficult.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Is it good that the existence of the Elf Village gets found out?\u201dI asked Sheryl Laura-san anxiously.\u201cWhat are you talking about? Of course, it\u2019s bad.\u201d\u201cUmm, you know what? Sheryl Laura-san, when you make a request at the Adventurer\u2019s Guild, they check your identity. If Sheryl Laura-san had made the request, there would have been a big fuss, and she would have been caught.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine. If I call the spirits, they can take care of a human or two.\u201dSheryl Laura-san says it smugly, but it\u2019s different, that\u2019s not it.What on earth am I supposed to do with her? She\u2019s completely out of touch with common sense.\u201cNot one or two, but ten or a hundred will come.\u201d\u201cOh my. I\u2019ve heard stories, but do humans really want to catch elves that badly?\u201d\u201cUmm, well, some people are like that, but that\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s because Sheryl Laura-san is a suspicious person here. How in the world did you get into town?\u201d\u201cHmm? I went in through the gate as usual, okay? I didn\u2019t get stopped, you see?\u201dHey! Gatekeeper! Nice, but do your work properly!\u201cWell, that\u2019s okay. For the time being, let\u2019s go to the summer festival. I didn\u2019t need to pay for the commission, because you took care of me, and I didn\u2019t want to get found too.\u201d\u201cThen, let\u2019s go together! immediately!\u201d\u201cInstead, please allow me to take Anna-sama with us. Or rather, without Anna-sama, Sheryl Laura-san won\u2019t be able to leave the town. She\u2019ll be stopped at the gate.\u201d\u201cBut this little girl is not your wife, is she?\u201d\u201cHowever, I can\u2019t just have her go with us to the gate and be done with it.\u201d\u201cHmph? Right, that\u2019s what Allen thinks.\u201dSheryl Laura-san moved her gaze slowly between me and Anna. Then gave a small sigh with a slightly disappointed expression and said something outrageous.\u201cThen, should I pass it by as your fianc\u00e9?\u201d\u201cfi, fi, fianc\u00e9 \u2026\u201dAnna froze. (TL:- this interaction will be a sugar overdose in her POV.)Umm, no, yes, let\u2019s not even think about it. I don\u2019t want my head to physically fly off.\u201cThen, please do that. Umm, Anna-sama? If you don\u2019t mind, would you like to go with us to the elf village? We\u2019ll find out more about the adventurers later.\u201d\u201cEh? Oh, oh, Ohh!\u201dThat\u2019s how I managed to get out of this situation, and took Anna back to the Duke\u2019s residence. I don\u2019t know how she did it, but she came back in a flash with permission to stay out overnight.Then, with Anna\u2019s face pass, we slipped out of the gate for the nobles and headed for the Lurden Airport in the northeast forest.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\u201cHey, Allen, what is with this place? Why is there this straight, open space in the middle of the forest?\u201dAna said this with a surprised look on her face as we arrived at the airport.\u201cThis is my secret base. The only person who has been here, is you, Anna-sama, so please keep this to yourself.\u201d\u201cOh, ohh. It\u2019s just me, is it?\u201dFor some reason, Anna looked somewhat happy when she said that.\u201cYes. Then, I\u2019m going to get ready, so please wait here.\u201dI said so and carried Buitor out of the underground hangar.\u201cWhat? From the ground?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a skill I have. I didn\u2019t know what would happen if I made it public, so I kept it a secret.\u201d\u201cOh, I see, \u2026\u2026. secret, is it? Alright!\u201d\u201cYes. And before I go any further, please do not go wild. Also, since it\u2019s originally a single-seater, I\u2019m going to tie you both up with a rope to secure you. Is that okay?\u201d\u201cOf course. I\u2019m looking forward to flying on that.\u201d\u201cFly? What on earth are you saying \u2026\u2026 No, it\u2019s Allen, so he can do something like that. Okay, I\u2019ll prepare myself.\u201dOnce they agreed, I tied them to Buitor.\u201cOh, um, Allen? Why am I tied up like this? Maybe this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it a lot, but I don\u2019t think I can get a good balance other than this.\u201dThis chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cH-Hey, Allen. Isn\u2019t getting overloaded? And that, close, aren\u2019t you too close?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. But other than this, it doesn\u2019t seem to be stable, so please bear with me. Then off we go.\u201dI start the wind magic engine and use full power to levitate Buitor vertically.I lay face down to steer, and Ana lay down so that her face was around my waist. Anna\u2019s ample breasts were hitting my buttocks and thighs, which was a perk, but\u2026\u2026.\u201cHiiiiiiii. I knew it.\u201dAnd Sheryl Laura-san, who was screaming, was suspended in midair. Just like I did when I carried the Orc before, I put ropes through the hooks that were for luggage suspension and hang Sheryl Laura-san in a suspended state.\u201cA-Allen! Amazing! It\u2019s amazing! And fast! What on earth is happening?\u201dThe Buitor accelerated quickly, gaining altitude, and then I heard Anna\u2019s excited voice coming from around my back.\u201cIt is similar to the way a piece of paper is blown away by the wind. It is also an application of wind magic.\u201dIt\u2019s not true, but no matter how much I tell them about lift, they\u2019ll never understand.\u201cHey, the royal capital and the royal castle is so small already!\u201d\u201cYes. It takes about 4 hours to fly to the Elven Village. We should arrive just as the sun is setting.\u201dBy the way, Sheryl Laura-san, who was supposed to be hanging, was quiet. But, I can feel her weight, so it\u2019s not like she fell.\u201cI see, as I thought you are amazing, Allen.\u201dI felt Anna rest her head on my back as she whispered in a calm voice.I trust you, it\u2019s as if she is telling me so. I felt Anna\u2019s weight and warmth, and at the same time, my heart was pounding and filled with something warm and fuzzy inside.Oh, I see.I am\u2026\u2026.I really like Anna.At first, the only reason was that I felt sorry for the character in the game.And when my memories of my previous life came back, I had a light-hearted hope that I could have a chance with the \u201cvillainess\u201d while helping my mother.I\u2019m ashamed!I want to hit myself of that time when I was thinking about such a thing. Isn\u2019t this the same as that of Amy!Anna is Anna.Just as my mother and I are not characters in a game, Anna is naturally a person too.She is a very hard worker and has a strong sense of responsibility, and desperately work hard for it even if it kills her.But the truth is that she\u2019s shy, she\u2019s not good at expressing her emotions, she\u2019s clumsy, but when she\u2019s having fun, she smiles and laughs wonderfully.Before I knew it, I fell in love with that Anna. (TL:- Finally, he has realised his feelings. But still, I like Anna\u2019s one.)By no means I was supposed to like her.With us like that, boarded, the Buitor glided effortlessly through the high summer sky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Welcome\u2026.to\u2026the\u2026.eh? Human?\u201d\u201cSheryl Laura-sama?\u201dThe elves who came to greet us at the airport looked confused when they saw Sheryl Laura-san wrapped up in ropes and Anna with me.\u201cAhaha, A lot of things happened, and the situation became like this.\u201dI try to deceive them by saying that as I untie Sheryl Laura\u2019s rope.\u201cSee, Sheryl Laura-san, we\u2019re already on the ground.\u201d\u201cUgh, I don\u2019t want to hang in the air anymore!\u201dYeah, as expected, hanging in the air was pitiful.

Who is that human?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s Lady Anastasia, my\u2013\u201c\u201cOh, I see, I see. You\u2019re already at that age, aren\u2019t you, Allen-san? As expected, humans grow up so quickly. Still, I\u2019ll get Her Majesty\u2019s permission, okay?\u201dApparently, he resolved it before I could finish my saying.\u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019m on my way to Her Majesty\u2019s place.\u201dAfter saying that, I took stiff-faced Anna\u2019s hand, nodded, and led her into the village.\u201cOh, it\u2019s Allen!\u201d\u201cHuh? There seems to be a stranger with him, see?\u201d\u201cIs it okay?\u201d\u201cBringing her to the summer festival, is it that kind of relation?\u201dI knew all the elves in the village, so they didn\u2019t say anything when I walked by. But, as expected, they seemed to be wary of Anna.I greeted them appropriately and walked towards Her Majesty\u2019s house as the sunset in the village.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\u201cAllen-sama, it seems Shery has forcibly made a request. I\u2019m sorry for that. Also, thank you very much for helping her.\u201d\u201cOh no, me too. I\u2019m sorry for hanging Sheryl Laura-san in the air like that.\u201dWhen we had apologized to each other, Her Majesty turned her attention to Anna.\u201cSo, who\u2019s this girl?\u201d\u201cYes, let me introduce her. She is lady Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett, my\u2026\u2026precious lady.\u201dThe moment I said that I heard Anna gulp.\u201cI see, this person is Allen-sama\u2019s\u2026.\u201dThe queen looked at Anna unkindly with an evaluating look.\u201cAnna-sama, She is this elf village\u2019s Queen.\u201d\u201cI am Anastasia, daughter of the Duke of Ramslett. It is an honour to meet you, Your Majesty.\u201dAnna makes a graceful gesture of ladylike courtesy.\u201cFufu, I see. Anastasia-san is a young lady from a good place. Then, do you understand why the elf village is closed?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes\u201d\u201cI see. Then knowing that, why did you decide to come here with Allen-sama, Anastasia-san?\u201d\u201cWell, that is\u2026.. I\u2026..\u201dAfter saying that, Anna face downward.This chapter is scrapped from readlightnovel.org\u201cAllen-sama, could you give us a moment, please?\u201d\u201cOkay, then Anna-sama, I\u2019ll be outside.\u201dWhen I was told that, I left the room. Immediately after that, pervert and Miri-chan came towards me.\u201cAllen!\u201dWhile saying that, she lunged at me, and I caught her and picked her up. By the way, when I met her four years ago, she was already about three or four years old, and even now, she looks almost exactly the same, only a little bit bigger.Normally, elves grow at the same rate as humans until they are about ten years old, but Miri-chan has barely grown at all. And the reason for that is this pervert.It seems that because she made a contract with this pervert, Miri-chans\u2019s existence has become closer to that of the pervert\u2019s existence, or so I\u2019ve heard. It is said that because of this her life span as an elf, which is normally 500 to 1,000 years, will be extended to 10,000 to 100,000 years.I\u2019m not sure about it, because there were no such facts in the game, but it seems to be a happy thing for the elves. As proof of this, Her Majesty, Sheryl Laura-san, and everyone else in the village was overjoyed and celebrated for Miri-chan.I thought, \u201cWhat a horrible thing happened,\u201d but I didn\u2019t interfere, because I think it wasn\u2019t right to say anything about the elves based on human values.However, as a result of such an extended lifespan, the growth of the body also slows down by that much\u2026\u2026I guess that\u2019s what this pervert wanted all along.Is it okay for the Spirit of Light to be such a lousy and greedy person?\u201cAllen-shi, long time no see!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still as perverted as ever.\u201d\u201cAllen-shi also as sarcastic as ever.\u201d\u201cNot as much as you.\u201d\u201cOops\u201dIf this is how a spirit of light is, then it\u2019s the end of the world.\u201cI heard something about Allen-shi bringing his wife here. What did you like about her?\u201d\u201cEh? Hmm, well, personality?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing the little girl with a good personality that Allen-shi admits! Why don\u2019t you show her soon?\u201d\u201c\u2026.If I show her to you, Anna will get tainted.\u201d\u201cMmmm, is she such a cute little girl, huh? As expected of Allen-shi, a comrade I recognize.\u201d\u201cAnna is not a little girl. And don\u2019t you dare treat me like a comrade! I don\u2019t understand a single bit of your hobby.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be shy! That way of admiring my Miri-tan, no matter what you think, is of a comrade of mine.\u201dNo. No matter how you look at it, isn\u2019t it adorable to spoil a little girl like her?\u201cHey, hug me.\u201d\u201cAh, yes, yes.\u201dI put her down once. But when she asked me to hold her again, I picked her up again.\u201cThere you go, debunked!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still annoying as hell.\u201dI experienced the utter humiliation of being smirked at by this pervert.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Allen-shi is an honorary elf.\u201dWhen I whispered to the pervert, such an answer came back.\u201cIt seems you can\u2019t see the spirits without the help of the elves, but for the time being, he is here. Yes, for the time being.\u201dWith that said, I point at the pervert.\u201c\u2026\u2026I see.\u201dShe looked a little disappointed, and then, as if she couldn\u2019t see anything, she turned to face the direction I was pointing and gracefully bow again.\u201cSpirit of Light Rho-sama, My name is Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett.\u201d\u201cHmph?

Unexpectedly, Allen-shi, likes to play with fire, is it? I see, so What? Whoa?\u201dAhhh, annoying. You\u2019re being annoying, you pervert. Damn it.I know that. I know I\u2019m not supposed to like her, and she\u2019s not supposed to like me.Anna will eventually have to marry for political reasons. Though the man she has to marry will no longer be the Crown Prince, he will surely be someone like a high-ranking noble or foreign royalty.Anna is a flower that I, a commoner, will never get. I\u2019m not even allowed to wish for such a thing.And yet!Although it was to save my mother, before I knew it, there were more people I wanted to protect, and I was wishing for things I shouldn\u2019t have.Damn it!\u201cIs that what that look means? Is Allen-shi serious about that girl? Oops. You\u2019ve been calling me a pervert for years, and now you fall in love with her. Is this how paying back feels? Fufufufufu. Hey, hey, how are you feeling now? NDK? NDK?\u201dGununu, it\u2019s frustrating, but I can\u2019t say anything back.\u201cWell, whatever. I\u2019m not a demon either. It\u2019s okay because no information will leak outside of this village. You just have to do what you want to do tonight and be refreshed. \u201c\u201cIt\u2019s even worse! Ah\u2026..I\u2019m sorry.\u201dI apologized to Anna and Miri-chan for shouting so loudly. But, that pervert with a grinning expression, Anna with a suspicious expression, and Miri-chan with a surprised expression stared at me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 55The next morning, we decided to take a look around the Elf village, which was in the midst of its once-in-a-decade festival. Yesterday it was too dark to make out much, but the houses in the village were colourfully decorated with many flowers and ornaments, and the atmosphere was very festive.Just in case you\u2019re wondering, I slept in a different room.Even though that pervert was egging me on, I put up with it and didn\u2019t crawl out of bed at night.Well, I don\u2019t want Anna to think bad of me, Maybe she likes me as a person of the opposite sex. Unless, of course, I\u2019m being conceited.That said, if I crossed the line, there was no taking it back. I\u2019m not sure I can stop myself if I go that far.And if you ask me if Anna will leave everything behind and come with me when that happens, the answer is definitely no. Watching Anna so far, I\u2019m certain about that.However, from the time she woke up in the morning and was eating breakfast, something was wrong with Anna. She was kind of awkward, or something like that.Did something happen?As I walked down the street with Anna, she said whatever she wanted to me, but I just replied appropriately.\u201cHmm, is that the girl Allen-san\u2019s?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Anna-sama is my precious lady.\u201dThat\u2019s not something I would deny.\u201cOh, isn\u2019t she quite beautiful?\u201d\u201cOh, surprisingly. Allen was the type to choose by face.\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t even look at the elves in the village.\u201d\u201cCome on, how about it?\u201dI didn\u2019t choose her because of her face, but I don\u2019t think she would believe me if I told her that I fell in love with Anna\u2019s inner being. Besides, it was a little embarrassing to mention it when Anna was standing next to me.\u201cBut then you have to protect the girl. Here, the girl there. Come here.\u201dAnna looked dubious when she was called, but the young beautiful elf woman \u2013 who must have been over 400 years old \u2013 led her into a building.And soon, she came out with a crown of flowers on her head.\u201cThat\u2019s? Oh, Anna-sama. It suits you very well.\u201d\u201cOh, oh, thank you. Allen. And, umm, this is?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s you see, is the requirement for a man and a woman to be together at this festival. The boy desperately protects the girl he falls in love with, and the girl who gets protected and keeps the crown intact until the end gives it to the boy she loves in front of the spirits, who will then bless the girl with their blessing and the boy and girl will be married.\u201d (TL:- Finally, the trap of the festival.)Hey! I didn\u2019t know there was an event like that?\u201cThere are five couples participating this year. By the way, don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll only throw fruit at you. Now, get to the central square!\u201d\u201cOh, that, Allen. Will you protect me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s! Of course.\u201dI was completely fooled. No one told me it was such an event.But even fruits can lead to injuries, depending on where it hits. If I were to leave Anna with a swollen face, it would be a serious matter.So I made up my mind.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aAnd when we got to the central square, the other four groups had already gathered. As typical of elves, beautiful men and women were gathered there. They seemed to be couples regardless of age, ranging from 40 years old at the bottom to 500 years old at the top.Then the beautiful music reverberates, and we danced to it.Even if it\u2019s called dancing, I just moved my feet as Anna told me to, so I guess I wasn\u2019t really dancing, but I guess I looked like I was trying.But the thought of Anna in my arms, and the soft, pleasant smell of Anna that I suddenly felt, made my heart race.Do you know how I feel right now, can I protect Anna from fruits? The event began. If I can protect Anna for one hour, we will win.When the gongs rang and signalled the start of the attack, the other four groups suddenly started running at high speed using magic.\u201cHuh!?\u201dI let out a yelp of surprise, but immediately fruit came flying from Anna\u2019s blind spot at a tremendous speed.\u201cAnna-sama! Excuse me.\u201dI hurriedly knocked it off, and in a panic, I picked Anna up by her side and ran off at once.\u201cHey, Allen! This is!\u201dAnna, looking flustered, protests in my arms, but I\u2019m in no position to say anything about that.\u201cAnna-sama! We have to run.\u201dThen, this time, water spears came flying at us, blocking our way.Hey! Wait! I thought fruit was the only thing you threw at us!\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t get hurt or break things, anything goes!\u201dThe elf who seemed to have thrown the water magic told me so.Visit lightnovelreader[.]com for extra chapters.If that\u2019s the case, I will also!I created a smokescreen and started running before it disappeared. Then I ran through the village and hid behind a building.\u201cHa~a ha~a ha~a, did we manage to shake them off?\u201d\u201cOh, oh. That, Allen\u2026.\u201dIn my arms, Anna is staring at me, blushing in embarrassment.Ugh, so cute.I stared at Anna like that and froze at her foul cuteness.\u201cH-Hey, Allen? Well, umm, I-I can walk on my own.\u201d\u201cOh, I-I\u2019m sorry.\u201dWhen she said that, I hurriedly set Anna down and let her stand.\u201cAnd, umm, thank you. F-For saving me.\u201d\u201cNo, me too, that, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo, umm, well, sorry.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s, w-wasn\u2019t I heavy?\u201dAnna says something like that to me with her face turning bright red. (TL:- cuteness overdosed.)Were you aiming for that? Could it be that Anna is doing that in order to destroy my reason?It was so destructive that such an impossible thought passed through my mind.I took a deep breath to calm myself down and resisted the urge to push her down.\u201cNo, Anna-sama, Anna-sama is so light that it\u2019s okay for hours.\u201d\u201cH-How many hours will you!?\u201dFor some reason, Anna panicked and shouted out. I looked around to see if her voice had caught any attention.Then, out of the corner of my eye, there was the figure of the pervert with a grin and a nasty smile on his face. And for some reason, the other spirits are gathering one after another.No-No way?\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa! I heard that. I heard that!\u201dWhen he said that, that pervert suddenly gestured and made fun of me by imitating us while acting.\u201d \u2018Honey, wasn\u2019t I heavy?\u2019 \u2018Oh, my angel, you\u2019re so light. I could take you like this and keep running for 100 years!\u2019 \u2018Oh, honey, that\u2019s wonderful.\u2019 \u201cThen the countless spirits that had gathered around the pervert imitated his gestures and performed the action in unison.\u201cTh-That!\u201d\u201cH-Hey, Allen! The elves are!\u201dWhen I was told by Anna and looked around, I saw a group of grinning elves approaching us with the fruit of their choice in their hands.\u201cLet\u2019s, Let\u2019s run away.\u201d\u201cAh\u201dI pulled Anna\u2019s hand and rushed away from the spot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Well, you\u2019ve shown me something hot!\u201d\u201cBut I won\u2019t let you reach the goal so easily.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Even we don\u2019t have a girlfriend!\u201dIt no longer sounds like an accusation based on mere jealousy, but let\u2019s just think about protecting Anna.However, as long as there is a restriction that you cannot break things, I cannot do anything fancy with [alchemy].\u201cThen, Allen-san will also give up on your girlfriend and will be mourning with us for 10 years.\u201d\u201cHehehe, Suck it up.\u201dWith that, the elves took a large amount of fruit in their hands and threw them one after another.\u201cPuukusukusu\u201d (TL:- pervert laughing)That grinning pervert is pointing her finger and laughing right in front of me.Damn! Why don\u2019t they rest?No, that\u2019s not it! If this happens, I\u2019ll only protect Anna alone!\u201cExcuse me, Anna-sama!\u201dI hugged Anna straight to my chest and pushed her down, using my body as a shield to take the fruit attack.\u201cH-Hey! Allen?\u201d\u201cIf I can endure like this until the time runs out, I can protect you, Anna-sama.\u201d\u201cAllen! \u2026\u2026 Hey, don\u2019t be silly! Mana. Oh Mana, the source of all things. Follow my command and become ice and take its form. Ice Coffin\u201dWhen Anna activated her ice magic, an ice coffin was formed to completely wrap us around.Naturally, it\u2019s ice, so it\u2019s extremely cold.\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018you\u2019ll endure until time runs out\u2019? What\u2019s the point if you get beaten up for it!\u201d\u201cBut \u2026 Anna-sama\u2026\u201d\u201cAnna, I\u2019m fine with it. Her Majesty told me that in this elf village, it doesn\u2019t matter what your status is in the human world. So, you know, well. As long as you are in this village\u2026\u2026\u201dAnna\u2019s voice, which had been eloquent at first, became quieter and quieter until it seemed to fade away, and as if in proportion, her initial expression of anger turned into one of shame.\u201cAnna-sama \u2026 No, Anna. That\u2019s \u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah\u201dInside the ice coffin, we stare at each other, oblivious to the elves and spirits watching outside.Thenknock KnockThe sound of the knock on the ice coffin made us huff and raises our face.On the outside of the clear ice, there was a troubled-looking queen, peering at us. The elves around us no longer had any fruit.\u201cOh. Umm, well, Anna\u2026..\u201d\u201cA-Allen. Oh.\u201dAnna looks away in embarrassment and then breaks the spell of the ice coffin.(Tl:- Cuteness overdose (\u2267\u2207\u2266))At that moment, Sheryl Laura-san, who was nearby, threw fruit at us. But I didn\u2019t miss the action.I twisted my body to protect Anna and caught the fruit on my face. The juice of the red fruit sticks to my face, blocking my vision with its sweet scent.And the next moment, I heard the sound of gongs signalling the end.\u201cSheryl Laura-san?\u201d\u201cHmph. You did a good job of keeping your guard up until the end.\u201d\u201cAllen\u2026\u2026 that, I\u2019m sorry. I let my guard down.\u201d\u201cNo, no. It was me. But I did a good job of protecting you.\u201dWhen I said that, Anna laughed and then said happily.Thank you, my knight.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aAfter we managed to protect Anna\u2019s crown despite being covered in fruit juice, we met up with the other participants, also covered in fruit juice, in the central square.Two of the four couples seemed to have failed to protect the women. However, they didn\u2019t seem to be so grieving and were encouraging each other to do their best next time. I got the impression that they were trying to do their best in the next competition.After all, different lifespans give you a very different sense of time, is what I thought.Now, for the other two pairs, the woman gives the man her crown of flowers and then kiss on the forehead.The man who received it dropped a kiss on the flower crown, put it on the woman again, and then kissed her lips, or rather, kissed her deeply. Then, the spirits around them are glittering and showering light.\u201cOh, amazing\u201dVisit lightnovelreader[.]com for extra chapters.\u201cKi, ki, kiss, d-doing th-that\u2026\u201dIt seems that I, who can see the spirits, and Anna, who can\u2019t, feel things differently.\u201cAnna, if you don\u2019t want to go any further, you can, well, just pretend to kiss\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen I said that, she glared at me and acted as if she was going to step on my foot.I was trying to take care of you. It\u2019s unreasonable.Well then, finally, it was our turn.I knelt in front of Anna, and Anna hands me her flower crown, which I took and closed my eyes. And with a soft squeak, she kisses me gently on the forehead.I stood up and kissed the flower crown and put it on Anna.\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s repetitious. If you\u2019re a man, be prepared.\u201d\u201cYes\u201dAnna closes her eyes, looks up a little, and pouts her lips. I drop a gentle kiss on her pretty pink lips.I sucked her lips and then inserted my tongue to gently knock on Anna\u2019s dentition. Then Anna also entwined her tongue with me.Our first kiss was filled with the scent of a very sweet but unfamiliar red fruit.With us like that, the spirits were also waving showers of light.Then my lips and Anna\u2019s parted for good, and Anna looked at me with an upturned and slightly troubled face. Then, the next moment, Anna\u2019s eyes widened, and she looked around.\u201cWh-What is this light?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a blessing from the spirits.\u201d\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u201dAnna was mesmerized by the sheer fantasy of the scene.And then that pervert came in.\u201cAnastasia, daughter of Elisabeth and Gerhard\u201dWhat the! hell!? I can\u2019t believe he can speak in a normal tone!\u201cYou are.?\u201d\u201cI am the spirit of light, Rho, and the selfless Wise Sage Loringus.\u201d\u2026\u2026 Selfless\u2026..is it\u2026.! ??This guy who seems to have condensed the libido of that pervert!? What\u2019s more, would you say such a shameful thing yourself!?\u201cLoringus-sama? Oh, Loringus-sama!\u201dI wondered why Anna was so impressed, but after thinking about it, I realized that this pervert was Elisabeth-san\u2019s magic teacher.Hah.\u201cAnastasia, I have witnessed your determination and love. Let me bestow my holy blessings upon you.\u201dThat pervert said this in an uncharacteristically distant and theatrical tone and placed his hand on Anna\u2019s head. Then Anna\u2019s body was enveloped in soft, warm light.Now I\u2019m probably staring at this scene with dead eyes.\u201cAs long as you do not lose that love, the spirit of light Rho and Loringus\u2019s soul will always protect you. Anastasia, please take care of Allen for me.\u201d\u201cOh, Rho-sama. Loringus-sama. Yes! Yes! Thank you!\u201dAnna was so moved that she shed tears of excitement, and the spirits flew around her as if to congratulate her, and sparkling, fantastic lights danced around her.I stared at this beautiful scene with indescribably complicated feelings.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That much was good, but \u2026\u2026.\u201cCongratulations to Allen-sama and Anastasia-san.\u201dHer Majesty congratulates us.\u201cTh-Thank you\u201d\u201cHmm, hmm, nevertheless, you\u2019re a good couple, isn\u2019t it?\u201dSheryl Laura-san, too. We\u2019re not married, right?\u201c\u201dCongratulations!\u201d\u201d\u201cT-Thank you\u201dWell, as you can see, Anna and I are now fully treated as husband and wife. I found out later that the event was, in essence, like an elf wedding.(TL:- Congratulations, \uff2f(\u2267\u25bd\u2266)\uff2f)However, elves do not have the same concept of marriage as humans.If they get along with each other, they become partners and form a couple-like relationship, then if they don\u2019t get along, they simply part ways.However, it is said that this is not the case after the summer festival event and that participating in this event is an indication of one\u2019s desire to have a child.And when I asked what those guys meant by mourning? It seems that the elves are having fun by deciding on such roles.In fact, I heard that one of them has a partner and a child.And since we jumped in and overcame such an event, the elves naturally thought we were very close.And when it comes to humans having children, it means married, thinking that we\u2019re married, they are congratulating us.But let me say a few words.If it\u2019s so important, say it first!!Anna spoke to me, who is like that.\u201cHey, Allen. I really like this village. The elves and the spirits all seem to be happy.\u201d\u201cIs that so.\u201d\u201cThere is no royalty or nobility collecting taxes from the people and using the money to live a life of luxury for nothing. Everyone is equal.\u201d\u201cYes\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t humans be like this\u2026.\u201dAnna\u2019s expression looked terribly sad as she said this.Lively music rang around the bonfire as the elves and spirits danced and sang happily.Sheryl Laura-san, who is supposed to be the princess of the elves village, was dancing happily in the circle with others. There was no such thing as a status barrier you could find there.There is simply one elf named Sheryl Laura.\u201cWhat exactly is a king, and what exactly is an aristocrat?\u201d\u201cAnna \u2026\u201dThere is also a queen in the village of the elves. However, she doesn\u2019t seem to make any decisions forcefully but rather acts as a mediator when something troublesome happens, or does something when an external enemy appears, which is rarely.There is no such thing as a crown prince who uses his status to give orders.\u201cBut I suppose it\u2019s still impossible for humans.\u201dAnna mumbled sadly and rested her head against mine. I hold her shoulders and gently support her.\u201cHey, Allen. Can I be just Anastasia here and not the Duchess of Ramslett?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dThe feeling of loving, cherishing, and protection comes from my heart.\u201cThen, will Allen be just Allen, not the commoner Allen?\u201dAnna looks at me with moist eyes as if she is clinging to me.I couldn\u2019t help but cover her lips.That time seemed like an eternity. So\u2026\u30fb\u30fb\u30fbNight falls in the village of Elves.This is deep in a lost forest that humans can never enter.

She sleeps peacefully with my left arm as a pillow, and I feel two conflicting emotions: the desire to look at her forever and the feeling that it\u2019s too late.As I was struggling with this, and wondering if I should wake her up, Anna woke up.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dThe moment her eyes meet mine, she turns bright red and then tends to look down.\u201cGood morning. Anna.\u201d\u201cG-Good morning, Allen\u2026.\u201dAfter she replied, Anna fell silent.\u201cUm, Anna.

Don\u2019t apologize to me now, okay? I\u2026.I\u2026!\u201dI shake my head and kneel down to Anna, who says this in a panicked manner.\u201cAnna. I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to happen, but I\u2019m going to make sure that I\u2019m recognized by the Duke so that I can come to pick up Anna. And I will protect you forever. So, please marry me, even though the order is reversed.\u201dI said so and held out the\u300eSubstitute ring\u300f.Anna alternately looked at my face and the ring I offered her, and then she started to shed tears.\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes\u201dWhen she said that, I gently slipped the \u300eSubstitute ring\u300f on her left ring finger.(TL:- Yesssss, Allen is fully determined, Now the world will see his true strength.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was the last time we could forget our identities, so we savoured the view from the sky.Incidentally, the Elf Queen gave Anna an ornament called a fairy hair ornament just before we left. With this, Anna will also be able to go through the lost forest by herself.She\u2019ll probably never use it, though.This is the item that Amy was originally supposed to get, but I guess it doesn\u2019t matter. The elves village will not accept Amy and the others because there are no monsters, and if Amy and the others go to the Lost Forest, the Crown Prince and the others will be lost.Huh? Doesn\u2019t that seem like it would solve a lot of problems all at once?Well, whatever.Uh\u2026 Oh, yeah. That pervert changed her behaviour just like a cat for a long time, probably because Anna was able to see him. But when he said in my ear, \u2018Did you feel better after what you did?\u2019 I almost yelled but managed to hold it back.As usual, that pervert will remain a pervert. But I\u2019m grateful for that\u2026\u2026.(TL:- Probably referring to the advice.)Also, since the holy blessing that was supposed to be given to Amy in the game was given to Anna, the route for Amy to become a saint must have been lost. If that\u2019s the case, I think it\u2019s no longer possible for Amy, a mere baroness who is not a saint, to reach the goal of reverse-harem in this world where monogamy is the rule.To put it bluntly, Amy is already stuck in the water. And I\u2019m not the only one who thinks so.Well. The next day after I sent Anna back to the Duke\u2019s residence, I was summoned by the Duke as expected.\u201cNow, Allen. You know why you\u2019re here, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes\u201d\u201cThen explain it. What\u2019s with the ring? Why is my daughter wearing that ring on her left ring finger?\u201d\u201cThat is my gift to her.\u201dThe moment I said that a look of anger appeared on Duke\u2019s face.\u201cYou fool! Have you forgotten that I gave you my backing during the duel and protected you from the royal family?!\u201dBut this reaction was within my expectations.\u201cIsn\u2019t that a mutual thing? Or would you rather that Anastasia-sama had been defeated in such an atrocious manner and the honour of the Duke had been disgraced?\u201d\u201cShut up! You\u2019re a commoner! And my daughter is a noble, moreover the daughter of the Duke of Ramslett! not the daughter of some noble!\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s why I gave her that ring.\u201dAt that moment, the Duke looked confused as if he had been caught off guard, and then became angry again.Good, good. This is one of the dozens of patterns I\u2019ve envisioned.\u201cDon\u2019t say stupid things! A Duke\u2019s daughter wears a ring given to her by a commoner, you say! And on her left ring finger, no less!\u201dThis reaction is also as expected. Now, it\u2019s time to cool it down.\u201cDuke, that ring is not just a ring. It\u2019s the \u300eSubstitute ring\u300f, an ornament of epic grade. It is a special ornament that, if the wearer of the ring is killed, the ring will take her place and save her life for once. Besides, I may not always be able to protect Anastasia-sama. That is why I gave her the ring on her left ring finger as a token of my feelings for Anastasia-sama.\u201d\u201cWhat? Epic grade, you say!? How on earth did you get such a thing? \u201cDuke digresses himself when he hears that the ring I gave him is an epic grade ornament that should have been worn by the king.This pattern is also assumed. If it\u2019s like this, I can do it.\u201cI\u2019m an adventurer. So, I\u2019ve dived into the famous dungeon of the Wind Mountain and found it myself.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cWhat? The Dungeon of Wind Mountain? Isn\u2019t that the most difficult dungeon, with only eight levels yet to be conquered!\u201d\u201cI got it from a hidden room in the gimmick floor of the floating islet on the 28th floor of the Wind Mountain Dungeon.\u201d\u201cThe 28th layer!?\u201d\u201cYes. The Wind Mountain Dungeon consists of 30 levels, and the boss of the final level is a blizzard phoenix!\u201d\u201cBlizzard Phoenix? Don\u2019t tell me you actually defeated it!\u201d\u201cYes. As I said before, I was the one who succeeded in defeating it alone.\u201d\u201cWhat? No, that\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dDuke seemed to be completely taken in by my words, but he still doubt my words themselves.So, as a last resort, I took out the Blizzard Phoenix\u2019s magic stone, tail feathers, and wing feathers from my bag and presented them to the Duke.\u201cThis is?\u201d\u201cThis is the proof. This is Blizzard Phoenix\u2019s magic stone, tail feather, and wind feather. For me, they are abundant, so please accept them!\u201dThen Duke fell silent for a moment.Then, after a long, long silence, he slowly opened his mouth.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cI would like to have a place where I can earn enough military honours to earn a title. And if I am successful enough, I would like the right to stand next to Anastasia-sama and protect her with everything I have for the rest of my life.\u201dDuke wrinkled his brow and then, after another long silence, replied as if spitting.\u201cThree years. I\u2019ll wait that long. But I will not allow this relationship to go any further.\u201d\u201cYes, sir. Thank you.\u201dI bowed my head and thanked him. Duke glared at me and then spat at me again.\u201cYou better be ready. I\u2019m going to send you into a battlefield so harsh you\u2019ll wish you were dead.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s what I want. If you want, I\u2019ll ride into the enemy\u2019s stronghold, even if it\u2019s just me.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201dI dared him to do so and left the Duke\u2019s residence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 59I\u2019m enjoying my flight with Anna. Today, with only two days left of summer vacation, we are heading to the Valley of the Flying Dragons, the first time in a long time for me and the first for Anna.There were a lot of things, but I\u2019m still in the same relationship with Anna as before. It seems that the Duke has not found out that I crossed the line, and although I feel a twinge of guilt, no further problems have arisen so far.\u201cBy the way,\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI decided to ask her a question that had been bothering me for a while, as it had become normal for us to not use honorifics when we were alone.\u201cWhy is Anna\u2019s tone like that? Somehow, the wording is different from that of a normal noble lady.\u201dI heard Anna gasp behind me.\u201c\u2026..so?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dI was told in a small voice, but I couldn\u2019t hear it, so I asked back. Then, unexpected words came back to me.\u201cDoes Allen-sama prefer women who speak politely?\u201dWell, what should I do? This still makes me feel very nervous, but even if she change it now, it doesn\u2019t feel strange.\u201cNo, I want to be easygoing with Anna, and I\u2019m fine with the way she\u2019s most comfortable talking. If you\u2019re comfortable talking the way you normally talk, that\u2019s fine, and if you\u2019re comfortable talking the way you\u2019re talking now, that\u2019s fine too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Really\u201dAnna\u2019s tone returned to normal. After all, the polite tone means that she is being cautious.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like it or anything. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m wondering why you talked like that.\u201d\u201cOh, that is. I was engaged to his highness, wasn\u2019t I? At that time, I had lived in the castle for a while as an apprentice. But for some reason, in addition to being an apprentice, I was also trained as a knight along with his highness.\u201dHmm? Why is that so?\u201cHowever, it has helped me hone my sword skills, and that in itself is not a problem. But His Highness wasn\u2019t giving the necessary orders to the knights and maidservants in his service. So I had to clean up the mess and give orders on his behalf, but before I knew it, I had become their superior, and this way of speaking was completely ingrained in me.\u201dHow. I have no idea what could have happened to make the situation like that, but it seems that Anna\u2019s tone was originally caused by that crown prince.Huh? Perhaps, the crown prince\u2019s character was fostered because he was spoiled like that?\u201cAh, but that\u2019s not good if you become a mother with this tone, right?\u201d (TL: (\u2299\u02cd\u2299))She told me something very terrifying. But if Anna thinks that way, maybe it\u2019s simply a matter of having a chance.\u201cWell, then. Let\u2019s change things up a little bit after you marry me.\u201dWhen I said that, Anna gulped and was silent for a moment. I can\u2019t see her face, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bright red.Then Ana replied with a small \u201cYes,\u201d and changed the subject.\u201cBy the way, I\u2019ve heard that the Valley of the Flying Dragons is a terrifying place with wyverns flying around. Are you sure it\u2019s safe?\u201d\u201cI have an acquaintance, so I think it\u2019s okay, probably.\u201dWhen I answered that, Anna put her head on my waist.I trust you.This is such a sign from Anna.The wyverns looked a little surprised to see us on the Buitor, but they didn\u2019t seem to be attacking us at all. If we were about to be attacked, I would do my best to turn around and switch to the land route, but it seems that they remember me properly.As it is, I landed Buitor in front of the Temple of the Winds, in the square where Jerome had been sleeping before.Then I took Anna\u2019s hand and escorted her into the Temple of the Winds.There they were, Jerome and Melissa, with their slightly, or maybe much, changed appearance. The colour of their scales and eyes hadn\u2019t changed, but their bodies were much larger, and they looked much more fearless and cool. But she didn\u2019t have a child as she did in the game.\u201cWha! That is a Sky Dragon!?\u201d\u201cHey, Jerome-kun, Melissa-chan.\u201dTo Anna\u2019s surprise, I called out from the entrance, and Jerome came running toward me. Jerome, now a giant black sky dragon with a pair of wings, bowed to me.\u201cA, a, a, Allen-san! I-It\u2019s been a long time!\u201dI felt a sense of nostalgia and relief when I saw Jerome, who, unlike his cool new look, was still surprisingly low-key, but Anna\u2019s eyes were wide with surprise.\u201cOh? Allen-san? It\u2019s been a long time. What happened? Did you need any help?\u201dUnlike Jerome, Melissa, a beautiful white dragon with the appearance of a queen of the sky, moved her long neck and looked at me.\u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s a 50/50 thing. One, I came to see how you were doing. Did anyone attack you or anything?\u201d\u201cHmm? Oh, by the way, I heard from the wyverns in the valley that a strange pink woman and her cronies attacked us while saying something incomprehensible.\u201d\u201cWas there any damage?\u201d\u201cSomehow, I heard it was very weak. It only took a blow from the tail. Well, I had a recommendation from Allen-san. So I went on a little trip with my Jerry. It was fun.\u201d\u201cI see. That\u2019s good to know.\u201d\u201cSo what is it that you need help with? \u201c\u201cIt\u2019s not right now, though. I was just hoping you could help me in the future when she\u2019s in some kind of crisis.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Melissa brought her face close to Anna\u2019s, and Anna let out a small squeal and clung to my arm.\u201cAre you saying that this girl is Allen-san\u2019s chosen one?\u201d\u201cOh. That\u2019s right. I haven\u2019t gotten her parent\u2019s approval yet, but I\u2019m gonna make sure I do.\u201d\u201cOh, dear, that\u2019s good.\u201dMelissa-chan said so with a grin. However, Jerome, start saying mysterious things.\u201cI-If it is A-Allen-san\u2019s request\u2026\u201dMelissa-chan glared at Jerome.\u201cYou can\u2019t just kill this girl\u2019s parents or something, okay?\u201d\u201cEh? If they don\u2019t approve \u2026\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019re still no good. You\u2019re not ready to be a father yet, are you?\u201d\u201cu, un\u201dHmm? I don\u2019t know how it happened, but it seems that Jerome has become very radicalized after not seeing him for a while. What on earth could have happened to him?However, it seems that even now and in the past he is still completely laid on Melissa\u2019s back, so I am very relieved for some reason.But from the way you\u2019re talking now, does that mean that Jerome-kun is still a kid?I feel sorry for you for that\u2026\u2026.\u201cWell, that\u2019s okay. Then, let me smell you to remember your scent.\u201dWith that said, Melissa-chan brings her face closer and sniffs Anna. Jerome also sniffs Anna as if to imitate her.\u201cYes, I understand. It\u2019s none other than Allen-san\u2019s request. I\u2019ll help you protect your important person.\u201d\u201cThank you. That\u2019s very helpful, Melissa-chan.\u201d\u201cFufu, that\u2019s okay. If you want to thank me, can you bring me some beef?\u201d\u201cI thought you\u2019d say that, so I brought you some.\u201dWith that said, I took out the beef and oak meat that I kept in my magic bag and handed it to Melissa-chan.\u201cOh! As expected of Allen-san! You\u2019re so thoughtful!\u201dThat said, Melissa-chan swallows the meat one after another deliciously.Melissa-chan looked at me to which I nodded, and she quickly devoured the meat I had given her while Jerome looked on greedily.\u201cIf you like it so much, I\u2019ll bring more, whenever that may be.\u201d\u201cOh? Really? I\u2019ll be waiting for you!\u201dMelissa replied happily.Then Jerome looks at me with greedy eyes.Hey, Jerome-kun. You\u2019re gonna do your best to hunt fresh prey and feed Melissa-chan so that she can have a baby with peace of mind, right?One of you won\u2019t be able to hunt while the eggs are warming up, isn\u2019t it?Or rather, if you want it, say it properly?With that in mind, I took out the meat I had prepared for Jerome from another magic bag and offered it to him. Jerome\u2019s tail wagged as usual, and he happily took a bite of the meat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 60The summer vacation went well, except for the secret that Anna and I couldn\u2019t tell anyone about. We ended up submitting a report that discussed the relationship between adventurers and the country from multiple perspectives.This time as well, Anna will help us to listen to the opinions of many people involved, including domestic experts and the guild master of the adventurer\u2019s guild, and it was good to be able to clarify their positions and report on the conflicts of interest that arose.To put it simply, the country and the nobility would like to incorporate the money earned from the dungeon into their finances. But the adventurer\u2019s guild would not allow it because it would cause many adventurers to be in red.If the country is to incorporate the money earned from the dungeon into its finances, it needs to hire adventurers with the same treatment as the knights, but it is in a dilemma because it does not have the money to do so. If I were to be more precise, I would say that I don\u2019t want to pay them because it would be a waste of money. As expected, it can\u2019t work that way.However, in Margaret\u2019s Altmunt, a good relationship has been established, with the Knights and adventurers conducting a joint operation to ensure stable hunting of Orcs. I concluded this report by advocating a new relationship with adventurers based on the results in Altmunt, but I wonder how it will be received.Incidentally, after writing this report, Anna and I traversed the Wind Mountain dungeon together. Due to this, we were the youngest adventurers to be upgraded to B-rank adventurers, which is a bit of a compliment.Of course, there is a reason for this. Though it served as proof to the Duke that I am not lying, the most important purpose was to improve Anna\u2019s level.I don\u2019t think there is any more of the game\u2019s scenario where the entire family of the Duke of Ramslett gets executed in a civil war after Anna\u2019s banishment, and Anna comes back as a dark knight. From what I\u2019ve heard, the southern aristocrats centred around the Duke of Ramslett are now firmly united as a monolith.Harming them without reason would surely lead to civil war, and no matter how anti-Ramslett the opponent is, no one would be foolish enough to support them under the current circumstances.If we keep the balance as it is, we may be able to avoid the destruction of the royal capital. However, as long as we are still surrounded by enemies on three sides, we cannot let our guard down.So, with two blessings that are particularly rare in this world, Anna\u2019s level up will not only make her power, but also the entire army of the Duke of Ramslett\u2019s domain stronger. (Tl:- probably morale.)Well, in the event of an emergency, she will say that she will take the lead in fighting, so it also serves as insurance for when that happens.Oh yeah, after we conquered the Wind Mountain dungeon, I talked about the treasure. When I showed her the \u300eSky Knight sword\u300f, Anna\u2019s eyes lit up.So I promised to give it to Anna on her upcoming birthday.This \u300eSky Knight sword\u300f is a legendary weapon, but it\u2019s meaningless because I don\u2019t have the blessing of a\u3016Knight\u3017. Besides, even if I get the\u3016Knight\u3017blessing from somewhere, I don\u2019t need the skill of \u3010Wind Magic\u3011, which it provides, because there is the blessing of\u3016Wind God\u3017. In that case, it makes more sense for Anna to use it.Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t even celebrate her birthday last year because of my position and status. So I\u2019m really looking forward to Anna\u2019s birthday, which will come after the cultural festival.Well, Anna stubbornly refused to take off the \u300eSubstitute ring\u300f I had given her and the fairy hair ornament the Elven Queen had given her. Although there were many rumours about the ring, in particular, Anna never said who gave it to her and continued to dodge it with a smile like a noblewoman.However, it seemed that Margaret and Isabella knew about it.But, this was not the case with the fairy hair ornament.This was because there was a still in the game, and Amy knew what it looked like, so when Amy found out that Anna had the fairy hair ornament on her head, she was naturally furious and made a scene.\u201cHey, why are you wearing the hair ornament I was supposed to get? Give it back!\u201dOn the first day of the new semester, Amy prodded Anna.\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? This is a precious treasure that I was given by a certain nobleman. It doesn\u2019t belong to you, and I can\u2019t give it to you no matter who says.\u201dAnna refuses, as a matter of course. And no matter how you look at it, you can see that Amy\u2019s argument is wrong, but the Crown Prince took Amy\u2019s word for it without question and ordered Anna.\u201cWhat are you talking about? The hair ornament exists for Amy\u2019s sake. Stop talking nonsense and give the hair ornament back to Amy.\u201dThe crown prince says so and orders Anna to return the hair ornament.For my part, I was hoping he\u2019d recover and be decent, but this might not be the best idea.\u201cYour Highness. Do you really understand what you are saying?\u201d\u201cOf course! So hurry up and give her back that hair ornament.\u201dAnna flinched at the lack of understanding, and at that moment Leonardo reached out to take the hair ornament by force.At that moment, light shined from the hair ornament, and Leonardo was flung away, slamming hard against the wall of the auditorium, where the opening ceremony had just ended.Then countless voices can be heard from Anna\u2019s hair ornament.\u201cPunish those who take the tokens from those who are recognized by the spirits.\u201d\u201cPunishment\u201d\u201c\u201dPunishment\u201d\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201d\u201dPunishment\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201c\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201dPunishment\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d(TL:- reminds me of the novel \u2018The White Cat That Swore Vengeance Was Just Lazing on the Dragon King\u2019s Lap\u2019)It was like a chorus, one voice after another, and then more and more voices.\u201cWho harms the spirit\u2019s beloved child?\u201d\u201cWho\u201d\u201c\u201dWho\u201d\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201d\u201dWho\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201dWho\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201dAt that moment, the auditorium erupts in a state of panic, and the students start running out of the auditorium in droves.Amy is looking at Anna with a frightened expression, while the Crown Prince and his friends are looking at Anna in a dumbfounded way as if their understanding has not caught up with them.I stand in front of Anna as if to protect her.\u201cYour Highness, there is no doubt that this hair ornament was given to Anastasia-sama by a nobleman. And as you can see, if you try to take it by force, you will be punished. So, do you still think it belongs to Amy-sama?\u201d\u201cGu~tsu, but..\u201dFrom the look on his face, he seems to understand that he is being arrogant. If that is the case, why is he doing this?Meanwhile, Amy glared at me as if she wanted to curse me to death.\u201cYeah! It\u2019s him! He\u2019s the one who made everything go wrong! I have to become a saint! Otherwise, this country is doomed!\u201dI don\u2019t think Amy is in her right mind either. I\u2019ve heard from Melissa that she was blown away by a single blow from a regular wyvern in the Valley of the Flying Dragons, so I think it\u2019s better to remove her from her delusions as soon as possible.\u201cHey! Say something!\u201dAmy, oblivious to her disgusting behaviour, continued to complain to us. But I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and said something I shouldn\u2019t have said.\u201cAmy-sama, no matter what you say, this hair ornament belongs to Anastasia-sama. Please wake up now. I don\u2019t know what kind of dream you\u2019re dreaming about, but this is reality. Please look at the people who are living in front of you right now. There are no heroines in this world. Anastasia-sama, His Highness, Markus-sama, Oscar-sama, Leonardo-sama, and even Amy-sama are not characters that move according to the scenario. They are all human beings, and there are many more people beyond that, you know?\u201dThis is not the game world, and you\u2019re not the only one who knows the game and acts accordingly.As a former Japanese, if you had any common sense, you should understand that much.Amy, who seemed to have understood the meaning of the words I had said, widened her eyes and nodded her head, then slowly left the auditorium.At that time, I thought that this would stop Amy from intervening. I was sure she would reflect on it.However, I would later realize that this was just wishful thinking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Your Highness, such an order is unacceptable.\u201dNaturally, Anna protested, but the Crown Prince was acting innocent. No, he has a black smile on his face, as if he knew everything.\u201cAs long as the jade seal is affixed, this is a royal order. If you refuse this, you and the Duke of Ramslett will be traitors in the eyes of the world.\u201d\u201cGu~tsu\u201dAmy looked at us with a triumphant expression on her face.Did she perhaps doesn\u2019t care about anything anymore and has only thought about ruining us?\u201cTake Lady Anastasia to the Royal Palace\u201d\u201cHa!. Then, please accompany me.\u201d\u201cWait!\u201dI intervened with the knights who were trying to take Anna away and stopped them.\u201cAnna-sama!\u201dMargaret, who was with her, glared at the Crown Prince, and Isabella was dazed and wondering what to do.\u201cCalm down, Allen. I don\u2019t think my father would have approved of this. You need to inform him first. Also, Margaret and Isabella, you need to tell everyone what just happened here.\u201d\u201cUgh, I-I understand.\u201dThen, when I was handed the order from Anna and withdrew, she got surrounded by the knights brought by the Crown Prince.Amy gently approached me and whispered in a low voice.\u201cThat\u2019s too bad, isn\u2019t it? But you\u2019re not even a mob, so don\u2019t do things you\u2019re not worthy of. The Villainess is destined to be raped into a mess and then turned into a weapon, you know?\u201dWhen I heard that, I lost my temper and put my hand on my sword, but Anna stopped me.\u201cAllen, I\u2019m fine.

However, the meeting with the Duke was soon granted.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? What happened?\u201d\u201cAs expected, the Duke doesn\u2019t know! It\u2019s Anna-sama! The Crown Prince ordered Anna-sama with a decree bearing the jade seal to marry the Commander of the Imperial Magicians of the Est Empire! And so she was taken by the Crown Prince\u2019s knights.\u201d\u201cWhat!?

This jade seal is real. And if you\u2019re here, then Anna told you to come to me, didn\u2019t she? Then I understand how you feel, so calm down. Even though she board a royal carriage, she is supposed to be taken to the royal palace first. There\u2019s no way she\u2019d be taken to the empire right away without any preparation.\u201dI send a resentful glance at the Duke, who refuses to allow me to sortie.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cI\u2019ll check the order with His Majesty first. It\u2019s not too late to talk. Besides, if they\u2019re out of town, we can always get them back by sealing the border.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cJust stay here. Okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter saying that, the Duke hurriedly got into the carriage\u2026\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aAnd it was not until several hours later that the Duke returned.First of all, the king said that he did not give such an order and did not know about it. And the Crown Prince himself refused to testify and said that he had done nothing illegal. However, many students saw that the Crown Prince gave this to Anna and ordered her to do it.On the other hand, it was true that Anna had been approached regarding this matter. It was at the stage of consulting with the Duke about it.In short, the crown prince may have forged the order.And the carriage in which Anna was tricked into riding with the help of the Crown Prince, did not go to the royal palace, but instead went straight out of the east gate. As soon as it left the east gate, the carriage sped off at a high speed, which left a lasting impression on the gatekeeper.\u201cThis shit!\u201d\u201cWait! Allen-kun!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too late to move! What kind of father are you if you don\u2019t put your daughter\u2019s safety first!\u201dWith Blood rushing to my head, I lost my temper. I shouted abuse at the Duke and ran out of the Duke\u2019s residence. I can hear the duke calling out to me, but I ignore him.If something happens to Anna, I can\u2019t repent even if I regret it!I hurried through the gate and launched the Buitor.I fly as low as I can over the highway, not caring that Buitor\u2019s existence will be revealed.Everything else was trivial compared to Anna\u2019s safety.Gliding many times faster than the carriages, I overtook one after another, and in less than an hour, I had caught up with the carriage of that time.Then I dropped Buitor off a few kilometers away, and in full gear, I intercepted the carriage.They kidnapped Anna, the duchess, with a fake order. At this point, they are treated like bandits, so even if I kill them, I will not get accused.A few moments later, a carriage passes right in front of the bushes where I\u2019m hiding. I shot a bullet targeting the coachman.The coachman collapsed with a single blow, and the knights who were escorting the carriage were startled by the sound, and their horses went wild, unable to respond immediately. I shot ammunition at such knights one after another.And when there was no more resistance, I checked the inside of the carriage.But the carriage was empty, and no matter how hard I searched, my precious woman was not there.It was only here that I realized I had fallen for a decoy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 62I got caught in a decoy and lost sight of Anna. So, I dragged the survivors of the knights who were escorting the decoy carriage back to the royal capital.Thanks to the hard armour, the bullets didn\u2019t go through properly or hit the right spot, and about half of them survived.I\u2019ve killed several bandits with my own hands when I accepted requests to take them down as a condition of my promotion to C rank. What\u2019s more, instead of shooting them like I did this time, I\u2019ve even slashed them with my sword.So it\u2019s not like this is the first time, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with killing the person who kidnapped the duchess.After that, among these knights, whom I brought back, there was that man who had taken Anna, but this man was a soldier sent from the Est Empire.He seemed to be a low-ranking soldier, so when the torturer interrogated him, he immediately threw up. And the knights around him were also said to be from the Est Empire.Moreover, it seems that arrangements had been made, so even if I had not attacked them, they would get attacked by the bandits, and the whole thing would go missing.By the way, the Crown Prince pretended that he didn\u2019t know anything about this as well. But this guy is definitely the one the Crown Prince has been guiding.Thanks to the testimony of the students of the anti-Crown Prince aristocracy in the school, the fact that the Crown Prince had this soldier with him and that he had ordered him to put Anna in the carriage was confirmed.However, it was assumed that the Crown Prince did not know that these soldiers were of Est Empire.And to my surprise, even the forgery of the order was pushed through with the unbelievable logic of \u2018it was just a temporary thing\u2019, and it was settled with the Crown Prince punished with house arrest. However, he was allowed to take classes at the school, so I guess you could say that there was almost no punishment.In short, the Crown Prince ordered Anastasia to be taken to the royal palace, but the knight was replaced by a soldier from the enemy country, and Anastasia was kidnapped, which is what got published.But, if this is the official report, the Jade Seal would be meaningless, so what was the king thinking?Could it be the child is the mirror of his parent?Also, what I did was not questioned because I stopped a soldier from another country from attempting to kidnap a duchess in the country.This was thanks to the Duke\u2019s hand behind the scenes.I expressed my gratitude to the Duke and apologized for my outburst, and was able to obtain his generous forgiveness.The duke, however, thoroughly protested against the royal family in this case and demanded the abandonment of the Crown Prince. He also declared that he would not cooperate with the royal family in any way unless Anna returned safely.With that, he said he was planning to leave the capital soon.It may be the highest level of aristocratic protest.No, this is more than a protest \u2026However, in response, the kingdom tightened border inspections. And so the search for Anna was on, but her whereabouts were unknown.If I think about it now, I must have been too proud.The fact that I was able to destroy fate as I had planned for over eight years, Amy and the others hadn\u2019t messed with us for over six months, and most importantly, Anna\u2019s love for me made me careless.Amid such senses of accomplishment and satisfaction, I had completely forgotten that this was a tower on the sand, built on a precarious balance.There was no evidence that this country was safe, even though I had preemptively collected all the items and events from the game and destroyed any chance of Amy becoming a saint!It was just an excuse that there was nothing I could do to help in my current situation.I should have looked for what I could and worked to reduce the possibility of the royal capital being overrun, even if only by a small amount!It\u2019s my fault for putting off something so important, something that I really needed to think about.Damn it! Damn it!In general, I should have taken Anna to the Duke even if I had to use force to do so at that time.If I had done that, none of this would have happened!But because of my stupidity, Anna was already taken away.If only I hadn\u2019t said those things to Amy!If only I had told Anna to hide the fairy hair ornament!If only I\u2019d paid more attention to the Crown Prince\u2019s movements in the first place!But it\u2019s too late for anything.I have no idea how they got Anna out of there.As long as there are no clues, there\u2019s not much I can do even if I search in the dark.If so, the next thing to do is \u2026!\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aThe Est Empire, on the other hand, declared war on the Centraren Kingdom on the same day and launched an invasion across the provisional eastern border. The excuse was that their own soldiers had been harmed and that their trust had been betrayed when they had asked Anna for a political marriage in the hope of peace, but it got thwarted by violence within the Centraren Kingdom.However, considering the fact that the letter declaring war was delivered shortly after Anna was kidnapped, and the war was started at the same time the letter was delivered, it was probably something that had been carefully prepared.To make matters worse, the Kingdom of Westerdale to the west quickly declared its non-interference. Originally, Westerdale and Centraren are allied against the United Kingdom of Norsane, but not against the Est Empire and the Kingdom of Xaus, which do not border each other.However, in the past, whenever a conflict broke out, they would support us with various supplies, but this time we could not expect that.The next morning, after the international situation had changed dramatically, we students of the high school were gathered in the auditorium.As for me, I didn\u2019t want to stay at the school anymore, but the Duke persuaded me to stay, so I had no choice. I can\u2019t allow myself to go out of control any more than I already have.Amy approached me and exaggeratedly egged me on.\u201cThat\u2019s too bad, isn\u2019t it? Your precious Anastasia\u2019s bridal carriage will be attacked by rogues, you know? And after that, she\u2019ll be cruelly raped and sold. Oh, you poor thing.\u201d\u201cWhy do you know that?\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.I stared at Amy as if I could kill her with just a glance, but she didn\u2019t seem to mind.\u201cIt\u2019s obvious. She\u2019s a villainess. So she\u2019ll be abandoned by her fianc\u00e9, cruelly raped and sold, then she\u2019ll become the dark knight and come for revenge. We\u2019ll defeat her and give her a happy ending. That\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be. You know that, right? You know that, don\u2019t you? I know that you\u2019ve been in my way a lot.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 scum.\u201d\u201cFufu. It\u2019s nice to hear a loser howl. You\u2019re not even a mob. You, who is not even a character, should leave immediately?!\u201dI couldn\u2019t say anything back. This was a situation I had foolishly brought upon myself.But not yet. It\u2019s too early to give up.Anna\u2019s death was not decided yet.While I was thinking about this, the headmaster of the school came upon the platform of the auditorium with a knight.\u201cI have a sad announcement to make today. As some of you may already know, the Est Empire has once again launched a unilateral war of aggression against our Kingdom of Centraren. War is a very sad thing. It is always the weak and innocent who are sacrificed in wars, and it must be very painful for those of you who will be protecting and leading your people. But \u2026\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s always a long story for the headmaster.But in the game, the knights didn\u2019t appear, and in the first place, the invasion war occurred after the civil war commotion. Moreover, taking advantage of the chaos in the kingdom, the villainess who had fallen into evil due to desperation took the lead and attacked at once. It was a blitzkrieg operation, thanks to the guidance of the villainess, who was originally excellent and was well versed in the situation in Centraren.But I don\u2019t think Anna would betray me like the villainess in the game. In the first place, Anna\u2019s family has not been executed, I\u2019m also here. Margaret and Isabella are there too. No matter how much she was framed by the crown prince, she would not lend a hand in the invasion.I was just thinking about it when it happened.\u201cNo! It\u2019s too much! Why can\u2019t we all get along better? I\u2019m sure we can understand each other if we talk.\u201dAmy interrupted the headmaster\u2019s long speech and shouted a line straight out of the game.Oh, no, was it such a terrible line? I think it was a little better than that, but my memory is already fuzzy.Amy\u2019s eyes are filled with tears and she has a very typical expression on her face. If you just cut out that look, she certainly looks like a heroine, also the Crown Prince and Leo, who were fooled by it, nodded that she was right.However, the headmaster coughed and spoke to Amy in an admonishing tone.\u201cYes. It\u2019s important to talk about it, but only if the other party is willing to discuss it. Also, I don\u2019t admit any arbitrary remarks. Is that okay?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d(TL:- seriously, her brain is a flower field. A typical example of someone who can\u2019t distinguish reality and fantasy.)Amy looks shocked, but it doesn\u2019t matter.In short, I guess she was trying to recreate a scene from the game here as well.I think it was a scene where the Crown Prince and his friends went up on the stage and shouted Love &amp; Peace, and were praised by the students.In the first place, the scenario of the game was broken long ago. The Crown Prince\u2019s position is clearly weaker than it was in the game.So of course there are more oppositions than there were in the game, and the war started because of something the Crown Prince did in the first place.There was no way he could make a reappearance.And this is not a problem that can be managed by the game\u2019s unique opportunism. The Est Empire, which had originally targeted the territory of the Centraren Kingdom, used the foolish Crown Prince\u2019s unnecessary actions as an excuse to carry out the invasion plan they had been preparing.Yes, that\u2019s just it.\u201cNow, as you can see from what I have said so far, our country is entering a wartime situation. For the time being, the school will be closed until the next spring, so please get ready to go home to your parents!\u201d\u201cEh? What do you mean?\u201dAmy tried to interrupt despite the warning, but the headmaster ignored her.\u201cAlso, I have an announcement about the student volunteers. The Commander of the Knights is here today from the Royal Palace. Then, Commander, I look forward to working with you.\u201dWith that said, the headmaster passed the mic like a baton to the knight commander.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Knights are looking for brave young men and women to defend this country against the unilateral, illegal, and outrageous aggression of the Est Empire! Raise your hands if you are willing to stand up for your country!\u201dI raised my hand first. I\u2019m worried about Anna, and I want to look for her right now, but without any clues, it\u2019s a waste of time to search in the dark. Then I\u2019ll do what I can do now.I\u2019ve already discussed this matter with the Duke. Besides, going to the front to prevent the destruction of the royal capital should not be a bad option.Besides, if she is taken to the Est Empire like in the game, and the empire tries to use Anna as a weapon, then!?I have to absolutely stop that!\u201cI see. So you\u2019re the scholarship student, Allen-kun. Is there anyone else?\u201dThe students tensed up at the loud voice that came from the podium. Then, I hear the most pathetic voice.\u201cIsn\u2019t it bad that the commoners are going and we, the nobles, are not?\u201d\u201cBut look, the crown prince hasn\u2019t run for it either, so why not?\u201d\u201cCertainly\u201d\u201cI-I can\u2019t fight a war\u2026\u201dAs these conversations were going on, a few people raised their hands here and there, and eventually about a third of the students joined. However, the Crown Prince and the others did not join till the end.What is royalty for? What are nobles for?And Leonardo, you\u2026.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aAfter that, the volunteered students were taken directly to the royal palace where we were given military uniforms. We were told that we would be treated as apprentices and that we would basically be working in the rear, carrying relief supplies, doing paperwork, and helping out at the first aid station.But that\u2019s a problem for me.After changing into the military uniforms provided to us, we came to the presence of the king.\u201cWell done. Brave students. To crush the ambitions of the treacherous Est Empire\u2026\u2026\u201dI knelt in silence and listened to the king\u2019s long and gratifying talk.\u201cI wish you all good luck.\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201dHah\u201d\u201d\u201dI don\u2019t know if everyone was touched by the story or not, but I raised my hand and asked for an opportunity to speak.I can\u2019t just let them take over the chain of command. No matter what, I need to get them to agree to one of my demands.\u201cHmm? Well, I\u2019ll allow you to say it.\u201d\u201cThank you, Your Majesty. My name is Allen, and I am an adventurer under the protection of the Duke of Ramslett.\u201d\u201cMmm? Ah, so you\u2019re the commoner he was talking about then. So, Allen, I heard that he won\u2019t cooperate this time, but is that the Duke of Ramslett\u2019s intention to not unite in the face of national crisis?\u201d\u201cNo. But the Duke is thinking about the country. His decision to move to the southern territories is also based on his intention to support the Centraren Kingdom and the Royal Family.\u201d\u201cXaus is it? Then what do you want to say?\u201d\u201cI would like to ask you again to protect Lady Anastasia, daughter of the Duke of Ramslet, as soon as possible, and to punish those who were involved in the theft or forgery of the Jade Seal.\u201d\u201cwhat?\u201dA look of anger appeared on the king\u2019s face.I see. So he\u2019s aware of what has happened.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Seeing this, I was convinced. After all, he is the root of all evil.And the fact that he can get angry so easily over something like this shows that he is.I had a vague idea from what the Duke and Sebastian had told me, but now I\u2019m pretty much sure that he is a fool.I don\u2019t know why, but I guess this guy is thoroughly protecting and pampering the Crown Prince who has done so much.However, because of this, that idiot remains an idiot forever, and the people around him think that it\u2019s okay, which leads him to become even more irresponsible.\u201cI apologize for that. However, I\u2019d like to take responsibility for what I just said and go fight alone on the front lines. Please order me to do so.\u201d\u201cwhat?\u201dA look of confusion appeared on the king\u2019s face.He would be so. He thought I was going to fight him, but unexpectedly I volunteered for a suicide mission.\u201cHowever, if I successfully defeat the imperial army, I would like to be compensated well.\u201dThen the king grinned and declared.\u201cOh, that\u2019s fine, Allen from Ramslet. Go to the front lines alone and kick the Imperial soldiers to the curb at your leisure. Until then, I will not allow you to return to the royal capital. However, if you bring victory to my Centraren Kingdom through your efforts, the rewards will be as you wish. Gold, treasure, titles, women, whatever you want, I will give it to you.\u201dAs I had heard from the Duke in advance, if you use this kind of method, this fool will not mind saying such a stupid thing.\u201cHah. I am grateful and happy. So, which battlefield should I bring victory to?\u201d\u201cYou should capture the fortress city of Cardacia and retake the Bruseni region. If you do that, my country will be victorious.\u201d\u201cHah. I have received your order.\u201dI thanked him and left the bustling audience hall with a letter of command in my hand that had been written and stamped on the spot by the king.I can hear people saying things like, \u2018What an idiot\u2019, \u2018Duke of Ramslett\u2019s dog\u2019, but at least I\u2019ve already consulted the Duke about the current matter. There should be no disadvantage for the Duke in this.Besides, I was able to get a 100-point perfect answer out of this stupid and brainless king, which was enough for me.Only Anna\u2019s situation was unexpected, but I was prepared for the war.Let\u2019s show the Est Empire the fruits of my labour to the fullest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was the first time I explained to my mother about my relation with Anna, and she gave me a response I hadn\u2019t expected.\u201cI knew it. It was the beginning of summer vacation, was it? you seemed more mature or softer, something like that. I don\u2019t really want Allen to go to war, but the girl you like is a duchess. It can\u2019t be helped.\u201dMother then gave me a lonely and happy, complex look.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about your mother, do your best to fulfil your promise with Anastasia. Never make a mistake in the order thinking \u2018who\u2019s important,\u2019 okay?\u201dThat said, she sent me on my way.Don\u2019t get the order wrong. Those words pierce my heart deeply.After all, I can\u2019t stop thinking about my mother.But that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t tell her. I couldn\u2019t tell her that Anna had been kidnapped and was missing.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aThen I came to the Valley of the Flying Dragon.\u201cOh? Allen-san, you came again. What\u2019s the matter? Hmm? What happened to your beloved girl today?\u201d\u201cActually\u2026\u2026\u201dI explained to Melissa-chan and Jerome what had happened.\u201cWhat the hell is that? I can\u2019t forgive him! Then I should just kill that Crown Prince guy, right?\u201d\u201cNo, no, no, Melissa-chan. We have to kill every single person in that place called Royal capital.\u201d\u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t.\u201dThe suggestion to slay the Crown Prince is slightly heartening, but not so much.\u201cDon\u2019t do it because my family lives in the royal capital. And if you attack both the royal capital and the crown prince, there will be a bounty on your head, and I will have to fight you, so no! Instead, I want you to find Anna.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Well, I don\u2019t like the idea of fighting you either. So we\u2019ll just find your beloved girl, is it?\u201d\u201cOh, please. I\u2019m going straight to the war.\u201dWhen I said that, Melissa-chan said as if she was amazed.\u201cGood grief. Don\u2019t people usually need our help in that war?\u201d\u201cT-Th-Tha-That\u2019s what I like about you, Allen-san.\u201d\u201cWar should be done by us human beings who are stupid.\u201dI said this self-deprecatingly, but Melissa-chan and Jerome looked at me curiously.\u201cAll right. Leave your beloved girl to us. I remember her smell. Come on, Jerry, let\u2019s go, okay?\u201d\u201cY-Yeah. A-Allen-san. Leave it to me. D-Don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re on a mud boat, okay.\u201d (TL:- Here mud boat mean it\u2019s made of mud. It\u2019s a reference to the folk legend called Kachikachiyama.)\u201cOh, oh\u201dHow goofy, I thought, but was it better to plunge into a large ship?(Tl:- Don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking.)While I was thinking this, both Melissa and Jerome soared into the sky to fulfil their promise to me and soon disappeared from sight.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aThen I flew at full speed to Bruseni. It\u2019s a basin surrounded by mountains on all sides. Even though it is a basin, it is quite large and fertile, with lakes and rivers running through.The Centraren Kingdom and the Est Empire have been fighting over this fertile land, and before this war began, they had been sharing it equally. However, while the Est Empire was well-prepared, our Centraren Kingdom was always on the back foot, so we\u2019re unable to respond to the sudden declaration of war.You might think, \u2018What is the military doing guarding the borders of a war zone?\u2019 But to be honest, I think it would be cruel to ask them to take responsibility for that.In the first place, the enemy had taken their time to prepare, had increased their rations, weapons, and manpower, and then declared war.On the other hand, Sebastian-san told me that the border patrol had repeatedly warned and requested reinforcements from the top brass.Despite this, the leaders of the royal capital only warned the Est Empire and did not allow the troops to increase themselves or even renew their equipment.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.In other words, they did not take it easy on the other party\u2019s provocation but took a mature approach and resolved the issue through discussion.Well, I thought, \u2018That sounds like the Japan of the past,\u2019 but history is full of examples of such responses leading to war.Moreover, war is only one of the means of diplomacy. If it is in the best interest of your country to talk, you talk. If it is in the best interest of your country to go to war, you go to war.It\u2019s just that it\u2019s fundamentally wrong to assume from the start that you won\u2019t be attacked.Huh? When I think about it, I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m so obsessed with this country.Well, well, for now, let\u2019s do our best to fulfil my promise with Anna and end this war with victory, to prevent the destruction of the royal capital.I landed near a fort with the flag of the Centraren Kingdom, then pulled Buitor by the rope to the front of the fort.\u201cThe flag of the Duke of Ramslett? Who the hell are you!\u201dThe soldier guarding the fort stops me.\u201cMy name is Allen. I\u2019m a B-rank adventurer under the protection of the Duke of Ramslett. And I have been ordered by the king to destroy the Est army here in Bruseni.\u201dIn order to avoid being lambasted, I dared to speak roughly and showed him the order. The order contains all the words that I extracted from the king at that time, and of course, the Jade Seal is stamped on it.\u201cTh-This is His Majesty\u2019s! And after all, the Duke of Ramslett hasn\u2019t abandoned Centraren!\u201d\u201cIt would be reassuring if the Duke of Ramslett would also fight for Centraren!\u201dIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m here on the Duke\u2019s orders, but it seems that they\u2019re relieved to know that the Duke of Ramslett is on their side.After all, the Duchy of Ramsaret is the largest wheat-producing region in the country, and naturally has a great influence on its distribution.If the Duke of Ramslett turns his back on them in this situation, means that food will be much harder to come by.Of course, the bigwigs in the capital can afford to pay high prices so they don\u2019t starve, but it goes without saying that the poorer you are, the harder it gets.If you think about it, that may be the reason why the royal capital was so easily attacked and overthrown in the game.In short, what would have happened if the chaos caused by the idiots who tried to execute the Duke of Ramslett en masse and fish for their concessions, lead to the unsatisfactory supply of food to the military?Doesn\u2019t that explain a lot?(Tl:- probably the strategy of the Est Empire)Well, it doesn\u2019t matter now.\u201cNow, I\u2019m going to boost the morale. Tell me where to clean off.\u201dWhen I said that, the man on guard shook his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The takeoff method is not a vertical takeoff, but a normal takeoff using the runway I just cut.I\u2019m sure he\u2019s saying, \u2018What!? It flew!?\u2019. Some of the soldiers beside the garrison captain sat down as if their hip gave up.Incidentally, this Buitor Rev. is the result of a series of improvements to Buitor in preparation for this war.First of all, the fuselage has grown a size or two. The cockpit is covered with removable polycarbonate panels from the front and part of the sides, which are aerodynamic and protect me from the wind chill, although I still have to lie down to fly. Also due to the larger fuselage, it has more space for storing things.In addition, it is designed to be ridden by two people with Anna in mind, so once I rescue her, I hope to enjoy flying with her again.And the main feature is that it has been modified to be able to operate as a bomber. I\u2019ll explain this as I use it.I\u2019m currently flying at a low altitude of about 200 meters above the ground. Normally, when I fly, I fly at a height of about 1,000 meters, though I measure it by eye. However, I choose this altitude because I can use binoculars to visually check whether the soldiers on the ground are friends or foes at a height of about 200 meters.By the way, these binoculars were also made by me. I\u2019m not an expert, so I couldn\u2019t make anything too sophisticated, but the mechanism itself is not difficult, so I think I was able to make something decent.It\u2019s a bit bulky, though.Now, as I was doing this reconnaissance flight, I spotted an enemy unit ahead of me.There were fifty, maybe a hundred of them. I don\u2019t know how the Est army is being distributed, but it\u2019s probably on the scale of a company.Oh, well. Let\u2019s make these guys my first target. This is war now. There is no time for hesitation.I move into glide flight and perform alchemy to shift the Buitor Rev. into bombing mode. Bombing requires a bit of concentration, so I don\u2019t want to waste any magic power.And when I reached the airspace above the enemy troops, I start bombing them. The enemy troops don\u2019t seem to have noticed me.Round transparent spheres were created from the belly of the Buitor Rev.\u2019s fuselage and were dropped one after another.This ball doesn\u2019t use gunpowder at all, but it\u2019s still a decent bomb, and it\u2019s quite powerful.First of all, this ball is made of ice. And, the ball has a hollow structure that is filled with appropriately sharp pebbles, glass pieces, metal pieces, etc., along with compressed air.And this ball has a magic circle dug into it which magically reinforced only the inside to prevent it from bursting under the pressure. I don\u2019t know what the air pressure is inside, but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s very high.When this bomb hits the ground, the ice, which is not reinforced against any impact from the outside, easily breaks and the magic circle loses its effect. The result is a powerful blast and shock wave that scatters sharp, hard objects. In other words, it\u2019s just a bomb with no gunpowder or fuse.Even if I didn\u2019t put anything sharp in it, I could at least kill an Orc if it exploded nearby.But when something sharp splashes together, it can damage a wide range of Orcs. In other words, it can put more enemies out of combat by the same logic as a fragmentation grenade (Frag grenade).Of course, I don\u2019t have advanced technology such as targeting or precision guidance, so I have to rely entirely on free fall, but I drop a lot of bombs in the spirit of hitting the target in numbers.At first, I was going to make a proper bomb, but it didn\u2019t work because I didn\u2019t have the proper knowledge of fuses, and the cost was too much.But this approach solves all of those problems.Because the only materials needed to make this bomb are small, low-value magic stones such as Horn Rabbit\u2019s and Goblin\u2019s magic stones, and sharp objects that you can find in the area.You may think that there is nothing in the sky, but as long as there are clouds, there is water vapour, and unless you are in an arid region, there is no shortage of water.Moreover, it is not carried in the form of a bomb, so there is no danger of it going off.I\u2019ve brought along five little magic bags full of ingredients that I\u2019ve been knocking around at the Lurden Store. These bags have been a bit of a pain, but I can\u2019t turn my back on them.Anyway, if I don\u2019t run out of this material, I won\u2019t have to worry about running out of ammunition.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.And I\u2019m at an altitude of about 200 meters, so the magic and bows of the Imperial soldiers can\u2019t reach me no matter what.In the meantime, the bomb I had dropped fell to the ground and exploded.Starting with a loud explosion, dozens of bombs that I had dropped in batches exploded one after another, and the sound of the explosions echoed from this far behind me. I turned to check the results while regaining the altitude I had lost.Then I checked the area where the smoke was rising. It was too small to see with binoculars, but I couldn\u2019t see anyone moving. It looked like they were annihilated.Hmm? If I look closely, I can see someone moving at the edge, but he appears to be injured.However, even though I\u2019m used to seeing them when I\u2019m fighting off demons and bandits, I feel like I might get PTSD if I see too much of what I\u2019ve done, so I\u2019ll leave it at that.I\u2019ve taken away the combat capability of a single company, and that should be enough.\u201cMission accomplished. Now, on to the next.\u201dI steeled myself and looked for the next enemy unit. Then I drop bombs on the enemy units I find.In this way, I found enemy units and bombed them, and when the sun was setting, I finished the first day\u2019s battle and returned to the base.(Tl:- What to say he massacred the battlefield. (\u00b0\u30fc\u00b0\u3003) )\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\u201cAllen returned\u201d\u201cOh, oh. Good work there. I heard some kind of tremendous noise over and over again. What was that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me. Today\u2019s results include the annihilation of 4 battalion-sized Imperial troops, 12 company-sized Imperial troops, and 9 platoon-sized Imperial troops.\u201d\u201cWha? What did you say? How the hell did you do that?\u201d\u201cI bombed them from the sky with magic. They didn\u2019t seem to understand what was going on, so it would work for a while yet.\u201d\u201cOh, oh\u201dThe garrison captain of the fort replied although he did not seem to understand what was happening.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 66It\u2019s been a week since I joined the unit. As expected, I\u2019m getting better at handling them after so many successful battles.The number of imperial troops I\u2019ve wiped out is 10 in battalion size, 31 in company size, and 47 in platoon size, and I can\u2019t even begin to count the number of smaller squadrons I\u2019ve wiped out.Incidentally, by annihilation, I mean that the battle was rendered impossible, not that it was confirmed that everyone had been killed. In other words, there is a possibility that the surviving enemy soldiers will return to the base, be reorganized, and sortie as another unit.However, how many people can stand on the battlefield again in a situation where a big explosion suddenly occurs around them even though there is no one around them, and when they notice it, their comrades, superiors, and subordinates are lying dead?I would\u2019ve been traumatized for quite a while, and it would be tough to be told to go to the same place without any precautions.And now that I\u2019ve had such a great battle, it is required to attack a tougher place this time.Yes, things are going well so far.\u201cThat\u2019s why I want Allen to assist in the capture of the fortified city, Cardassia.\u201d\u201cOh. Let\u2019s leave it to me. How\u2019s the operation going?\u201d\u201cHey! You! What\u2019s with that attitude! You\u2019re an enlisted student soldier! You should know how to treat your superiors!\u201dAnd, well, of course, there are going to be guys like this.Besides, I know what you mean.I mean, you wouldn\u2019t think that the garrison captain of this fort, whom I first met, would be the general manager of the Bruseni regional army, would you?However, it feels strange to return to a more polite tone now, so it looks like this.\u201cI don\u2019t care. Besides, Allen is a B-rank adventurer. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the results. Moreover, Allen is a member of the Duke of Ramslett, sent here by the king. He\u2019s not under our command.\u201d\u201cBut.\u201d\u201cJust shut up. Besides, I\u2019d like to get this over with before the crazy ones from the royal capital arrive.\u201dIt seems that because of the declaration of war, a knight from the royal capital is supposed to come with his troops.\u201c\u2026..That\u2019s certainly\u2026\u2026Okay!\u201dThe nobles who made the situation worse by rejecting all of our requests might just be a hindrance if he comes.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\u201cThen, I\u2019m off!\u201dI said that and started Buitor Rev., and when I flew in the direction he told me to go for a while until I saw a huge fortress city.I see. The fortified city is protected by three walls and a water moat. Each wall is about 30 meters high, and the width of the water moat is about 10, no, maybe even 20 meters.In addition, on the west side of the fortified city, there are three more strong forts blocking our Centraren forces.We, the Centraren army, were attacking one of the forts.However, they are struggling with the high walls, also the arrows and magic seem to be preventing them from getting close to the battering ram or siege ladder!However, thanks to the struggle, there is no risk of an accidental explosion, so it is easy for me to do.As usual, I approached from the sky and dropped one bomb after another.For the time being, all the bombs I dropped fell inside the fort, but the aim is appropriate. They can\u2019t stand on the ramparts and aim at the attacking enemy soldiers.However, it seems that the bombing campaign to date was more effective than I had expected.Enemy soldiers seemed to panic immediately, and the counterattack from the fort soon lost control. Some of the enemy soldiers even ran for their lives.In the meantime, the battering ram reached the gate and the siege ladder attached to the wall. Seeing this, I was convinced that this fort would fall, and I headed for the next fort.The good news is that the friendly forces haven\u2019t arrived there yet, so I carpet-bombed the place.I probably dropped 200 or even 300 of them. The enemy soldiers outside must have been literally wiped out.Incidentally, the purpose of this bomb is to kill and injure with the blast and fragments, so it cannot make holes or collapse the solid walls. The shock wave may have broken some glass, but the building is still standing as expected.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.(Tl:- Naruhodo, environment-friendly bombing. \uff08*\u309c\u30fc\u309c*\uff09)Then I head to the third and final fort. I\u2019m going to try a different approach here.So I processed a different kind of bomb than the one I had just used. It took a lot of magic power, but a chunky glass container was made and dropped.And when it hit the building of the fort, it cracked, and as soon as the colourless liquid sealed inside splashed out, it burst into flames at once with an explosion.Yes, this is a kind of incendiary.And I was also relieved to see that this kind of incendiary worked well in the actual battle.By the way, what I put in the glass was a gasoline-like liquid that burns well.I don\u2019t know if it can be used to run a car, but it vaporizes at room temperature and burns well. By the way, when you think of gasoline, you probably think of pink or orange, but those are just coloured to make it easier to understand, and this gasoline-like liquid made by refining is colourless and transparent.Also, instead of the fuze, I used sodium extracted from salt by processing it and water. Sodium ignites rapidly when mixed with water, so I tried using it instead of a fuze.To put it bluntly, it\u2019s the kind of amateur work that would be laughed at by a real professional.But I didn\u2019t have enough knowledge in this area to develop it in time, so I applied my knowledge of chemistry, which I\u2019m sure everyone knows, to make it.However, as far as the experiment was concerned, there was a good chance of unexploded ordnance, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s much different from dropping lit torches together and hoping the fire doesn\u2019t go out during the fall.I don\u2019t know the details yet, but it seems that when water and sodium react, or when hydrogen burns, if there is vaporized gasoline there, it will ignite, so there is still room for improvement.Well, personally, I\u2019d like to create something with a more proper mechanism instead of this forced mechanism\u2026\u2026Now. Let\u2019s get back to the war situation.The imperial soldiers, startled by the sudden explosion that set the fort ablaze, rushed to put out the fire. I mercilessly dropped bottles of gasoline-like liquid on them again.Once the fire is lit, all you have to do is spray the gasoline-like liquid and the place turns into hell.Then, while throwing a lot of it, the glass material for processing the bottle was exhausted.After confirming that the flames were burning to the point where it seemed impossible to extinguish them, I decided to return. I guess my mission is now complete.On the way back, I encountered my allies who had already attacked the first two forts and were marching towards the third one I had burned.The friendlies raised their sword facing me in unison.I see. Apparently, they are greeting me.I turned the plane around once in the air to return the greeting and then went to the camp.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the meantime, I went around bombing all the forts and garrisons except the fortress city of Cardacia. The only major stronghold of the Est Empire that remains in the Bruseni region is the fortified city of Cardassia.And that Cardassia is already surrounded by our forces from the Centraren Kingdom.However, since many civilians were living in the area, we declared to start our indiscriminate attacks five days later, and advised the civilians to evacuate, for which the siege was intentionally lifted only at the east gate.For the first two days, a significant number of people escaped, but by the third day, the number had visibly dwindled to only a few families yesterday.And today is the fifth day, the fateful morning.So far, I\u2019ve been dealing with soldiers, but today I\u2019ll be killing those who aren\u2019t. Of course, I\u2019m less shocked than everyone fighting ground battles because my job is to bomb from the sky.Even so, the bombing of urban areas and the attacks on civilians were indeed something to be reckoned with.But it\u2019s too late now. I\u2019ve killed people for my ego.I\u2019m the one who chose that path.I will get Anna back, and I will protect her this time. There\u2019s nothing more important to me right now.I get on Buitor Rev. and start the wind magic engine.\u201cI leave it to you!\u201dI gave a thumbs-up to the captain of the guard, who called out to me. Then increased Buitor Rev.\u2019s speed and took off into the sky.\u201cDon\u2019t think. Don\u2019t think about it. They\u2019re the enemy. They chose to fight instead of heeding our warning.\u201dAs I told myself this, I reached the sky above the fortified city of Cardassia.I then proceeded to dump the bottles of gasoline one after another on a sturdy building in the centre of town. Apparently, this is the mansion of the Lord who protects Cardassia, and also serves as the city hall and barracks.Apparently, the Imperial Army understood that the recent attacks were done by me, so they pointed at me and tried to shoot me down with arrows from the top of the spire.However, none of the attacks reached.I\u2019m about 200 meters above the sky. Magic has a range of only a few dozen meters, and even a longbow has an effective range of at most 100 meters. Even if there is an arrow that can fly 200 meters horizontally, it does not mean that it can fly 200 meters upward against gravity.I\u2019m not an expert, so I won\u2019t go into details, but if there is such a difference in the level of technology in a fight, it should be impossible to win.I heard that in some countries, people tried to drop a bomber flying at an altitude close to the stratosphere with a bamboo spear, but such a thing is impossible.It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re led by a great general or not, you\u2019re not going to be able to lead your team to victory if you go head-to-head with an opponent who is unilaterally hitting you with firepower from a range where your attacks can\u2019t reach.All they can do is surrender, withdraw, or just hold up inside.I cleared my heart and dropped gasoline one after another, one of which ignited after several unexploded ordnance and burned with an explosion. Then it also ignites the unexploded gasoline one after another.All that was left was to spread the fire by dropping the bottles containing gasoline.After confirming that the centre of Cardassia was completely covered in flames, I then dropped bombs on the barracks that the map pointed out to me.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.I stopped looking at what the aftermath was.Now it\u2019s time to fly over Cardassia and drop the bombs on the enemy soldiers walking in the streets. But I didn\u2019t see if they hit the target properly.If I look back and think about it, I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t be able to go on if I see civilians dying.As a result of me killing my heart and tearing the inside to shreds, there was no resistance when allied forces broke through the gate and entered the fortified city.After confirming the fluttering of the Centraren flag in the square in front of the burned down lord\u2019s mansion and at the gates, I returned to the fort.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aTwo days later, the captain of the garrison and I entered Cardassia, which had been completely overrun. It was the first time in half a century that the Centraren had retaken this part of Cardassia.By the way, yesterday they had a fierce battle with civilians and defeated soldiers who launched a guerrilla attack. This fierce urban battle, which resulted in a large number of casualties on both sides, ended with a victory for us, the Centraren.The remaining civilians, with a few exceptions, were expelled and packed into wagons and sent to the Est Empire. The wounded prisoners were also handed over to the Empire\u2019s side in wagons along with the civilians.I thought it was a terrible policy to evict the residents, but I guess they are doing it to avoid a muddy urban war with the residents who have turned into terrorists.Besides, it seems that the Est Empire did the same thing to Centraren when we lost Cardassia before.Thus, the only people left in this fortified city of Cardassia were us, some civilians, and healthy prisoners.By the way, what they make the prisoners do is forced labour. They are forced to do things like ploughing fields and repairing broken buildings.Well, considering the current level of civilization, it might be something like this, and considering the fact that the residents of the royal capital were massacred in the game, this might be a very lenient response.Thus, for the first time in a while, I was able to sleep in a large room and a soft bed instead of a small fort.And at night, the information, which I was dying to know, was finally brought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She must have had a fianc\u00e9. I heard that she never took off her ring and hair ornament when she took bath, you know?\u201d\u201cIt seems that she was abandoned by that pampered idiot prince \u2026 she was probably having an affair with one of his retainer anyway.

I just didn\u2019t expect him to agree to such a ridiculous deal.\u201d\u201cThe crown prince is a true fool. He was only able to fix things because of that woman, but there was nothing inside.

Did he really think such a deal was possible?That idiot!\u201cBy now, the people of Xaus must have invaded the Duke of Ramslett\u2019s territory. No matter how strong the Duchy of Ramslett\u2019s army, if they separate from the country, it will not be free.\u201d\u201cNow we just need to see if Norsane in the north will make a move or not.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll work. I\u2019ve already talked to Westerdale. If that idiot Crown Prince becomes king, we\u2019ll have a country of easy-going stupids. And once the Dukedom of Ramslett is cut off, they won\u2019t be able to feed their people. Then the rest will fall into ruin on their own.\u201dMmm, I see. So Westerdale really was connected to Est behind the scenes.If that\u2019s the case, I don\u2019t think Claude will ever come to the front stage anymore.Besides, it seems that Centraren is still seen that way.This country is already \u2026\u2026. No, now is not the time to be thinking about that.\u201cWhoa, we\u2019re here.\u201dThe man who is not the Crown Prince casts some kind of spell on the wall. Then the wall suddenly disappears, and a staircase appears.Apparently, it was a hidden staircase with a magic-related mechanism.I see. No wonder I couldn\u2019t find it no matter how hard I looked.The crown prince and the man turned on the lamp and walked steadily down the stairs, with me following close behind.Originally, \u3010Concealment\u3011 was a skill I acquired in order to obtain a Scroll of Appraisal, but I\u2019m really glad I took it. Without this skill, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to break into a place like this by myself.Then, after descending a long spiral staircase, the Crown Prince duo arrived in front of an iron door. It had a lock on the outside, which clearly indicated that it was meant to keep people in.Then he opened the peephole of the iron door and looked inside.\u201cOh, it\u2019s coming along nicely, isn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s give it a little stimulation.\u201dAfter saying that, they unlocked the iron door and opened then went inside, I also followed them inside.Then, beyond that, illuminated by the lamps of the two, there was a strange figure of Anna.What the hell did they do to her?Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.She is dressed in a lyrical costume, but her face is expressionless. Her eyes are blank, and her face is a mess of tears and snot. Also, the sloppy drool is dripping, and the smell of filth is drifting.\u201cOh, she must have resisted a lot. If this happens, she won\u2019t be able to use the magic she originally had, so I\u2019ll have to re-educate her.\u201d\u201cWhat? Tsk. Can\u2019t you undo that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s too late now. But it\u2019ll only delay the actual launch for a few years.\u201dHe describes Anna as if she were a domestic animal, no machine.Anna turned her head toward us, but it was not hard to imagine that she did not see anything in her eyes.\u201cA, Ah\u201dAnna makes a small noise with an expression that does not make you feel intellect.There was nothing in there that reminded her of Anna.That Anna, who was sleeping peacefully in my arms, was as beautiful as an angel.That Anna, who had a cute and teasing voice.That Anna, who was surprised to fly for the first time, and was also excited like a child.That Anna, who accepted my proposal, and was pleased to cry.That Anna, who was nervous, tense and afraid that she would drop Miryl-chan in her unfamiliar arms.That Anna, who was so embarrassed that her ears turned red when I carried her like a princess.That Anna, who was jealous of me because she suspected the relationship between me and Sheryl Laura-san.The same Anna, who used to say that I was a cross between a genius and something else and got dismayed.That Anna, who was so happy to hear that her exam grades had caught up with mine.That Anna, who was trying so hard to make something good.Anna, who was worried and angry with me for being her proxy when she needed a proxy for the duel.And when I met her again, that Anna, who turned bright red and was angry.Even Anna, who had been struggling to endure unreasonable things for the sake of her noble duty with a frozen expression.(Tl:- these lines may feel odd because of my limited knowledge, I apologise in advance.)All of these things are important to me.But Anna, who was always so fascinating, was nowhere to be found.Maybe it\u2019s too late, as the man says.But.Still,\u2026\u2026Even so!I! No matter what! Want to save Anna!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 A\u2026\u2026lle\u2026nI felt as if Anna had said so.It wasn\u2019t that Anna actually said that out loud.Anna\u2019s eyes were unfocused, and it was hard to believe that she was seeing anything with them.But sure enough, Anna reached out her hand towards me, even though I was supposed to be invisible with my \u3010Concealment\u3011 skills.It\u2019s like knowing I\u2019m there.And as if she was saying that she wanted my help.I really wanted to know how to undo it, but I couldn\u2019t take it anymore!I can\u2019t let them do anything to Anna anymore!I fired two rounds of Kalashi, each, into the Crown Prince and the other man I thought was the mastermind.The Crown Prince got hit in the left chest and neck, and the other man got hit in the flank and left shoulder.\u201cGah, ha~tsu. When, did you?\u201dThe man was surprised to see me, who he must have recognized as suddenly appearing. The crown prince, on the other hand, collapsed in a pool of blood and didn\u2019t move an inch. He would probably die instantly.TanI shoot the man in the right knee.TanThen I shoot him in the left knee.TanThen shot in his right shoulder as well.There should be no resistance at all now.Besides, this man is also bleeding profusely. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to last much longer.Once I had secured my safety, I rushed over to Anna and stripped off the magical sword that released something black in my hand.\u201cAnna! Hold on! Anna!\u201dBut Anna\u2019s eyes only looked at the void and did not respond to my call.\u201cYou! What did you do to Anna?!\u201dI pulled out the dagger at my waist and pointed it between the man\u2019s eyes.\u201cHahaha. What the hell. You\u2019re that thing\u2019s boyfriend, Allen? Unfortunately, you\u2019re too late. There\u2019s no will left in it.\u201d\u201cAnswer the question!\u201d\u201cHmm. I just broke its heart to let the magic sword control it. It seems that it liked you a lot, but you came too late. Well, okay. It\u2019s all yours now. However, it can only be used to the extent of conceiving offspring. Hahaha.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dIn a fit of rage, I slashed this man across the face with my dagger.\u201cGuh, hahaha. But you can\u2019t get out of here anyway. Why don\u2019t you just give it a shot as a souvenir of the underworld?\u201dWhen he said that, I realized. Apparently, the gunshot was heard.I can hear the footsteps of someone coming down the stairs.\u201cHa~tsu. You killed His Highness. So be proud. Such a good dark side to be here, why\u2026.that\u2026\u201dThat said, the man lost consciousness. Perhaps he had lost too much blood.I shot him in the heart to finish him.Then, using wind magic, I decapitated them and stuffed them into the magic bag I had brought with me.I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve killed too many people already.Even though I know that, my emotions don\u2019t even fluctuate.I feel as if I\u2019m dismantling a monster.There\u2019s only one thing I have to do.Taking Anna back safely. That\u2019s it.I must never mistake the order of what is important.That\u2019s what my mom said to me, and it\u2019s what\u2019s pushing me forward.Then, using the surrounding walls as a material, I process a sheath, or perhaps a wrapping, that would enclose the entire sword and lower it to my waist.It could be dangerous to carry it around.But this way, I don\u2019t have to touch the magic sword directly, and thanks to that man\u2019s death, the black stuff that was emitting from the magic sword is already gone.Besides, if this is left behind in the Empire, Anna might be targeted again.So to prevent that from happening, I should take it.As I was just about to run away with Anna \u2026\u2026 a soldier arrived.\u201cHis Highness! G\u00fcnther-sama!\u201dYeah, it can\u2019t be helped.I take out the Saiga and shoot at him.With the soldier down with a single blow, I took Anna on my back and ran as fast as I could.As I ran up the stairs, I saw that many soldiers had already gathered there.I shoot them or blow them away with wind magic to clear the enemy soldiers and look for an opportunity to use \u3010Concealment\u3011.But there were so many enemy soldiers that there was no room for that at all.Of course, if I didn\u2019t have Anna on my back, I could definitely get away with leaving her behind.But that doesn\u2019t make sense.I can no longer imagine my life without Anna.And so, little by little, by force, I made my way to the backyard.It was just then.\u201cDra, Dragon!\u201d\u201cWhat? Why are the dragons in the Imperial Capital?\u201d\u201cHey, half go to subdue the dragons!\u201dOh, yeah. It\u2019s Melissa-chan and Jerome!Thank you!I switched from the Saiga to the Kalashi to sweep the area. Automatic rifles with an excellent rate of fire are easier to control.Thanks to the reduced number of people, I easily suppressed the enemy soldiers, and when I re-carry Anna, I activate \u3010Concealment\u3011.Finally, I reached the backyard where the Buitor Rev. was buried, taking Anna with me.But from my movements, they seemed to have expected me to come to the backyard.There were quite a few soldiers waiting for us there.However, since we are not visible, the situation is more favourable for us.I used my \u3010Alchemy\u3011 skills to create a hand grenade version of the bomb I had been dropping from the Buitor Rev. and threw it at the middle of the soldiers in the backyard.I crouched down, covered my ears with one arm, then open my mouth and closed my eyes. Then, I used my other hand to cover one ear of Anna and covered her other ear with the soil deformed through\u3010Alchemy\u3011.The compressed air in the hand grenade exploded as it hit the ground and shattered.I looked up and saw that the soldiers in the courtyard had been caught in the explosion and collapsed, looking rather grotesque.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.I did another sweep with the Kalash, kicking out any soldiers that got in my way, and then ran with Anna on my back to the backyard where I had buried the Buitor Rev.\u201c\u3010Alchemy\u3011\u201dInstead of taking out the Buitor Rev., I first built an earthen wall about three meters high.These will block the enemy soldiers\u2019 view and prevent them from attacking at the moment of takeoff when it\u2019s most vulnerable.Thereupon, I took the Buitor Rev. out from the bottom of the ground, put Anna on it, secured her, then I climbed aboard so that she gets covered from above, then activate the wind magic engine to start takeoff.Yeah, come on! Me! Don\u2019t rush! Calm down!Vertical takeoffs are especially nerve-wracking.I gradually increased the power while balancing the output of each engine, and then the Buitor Rev. with Anna and me on board softly floated into the air.\u201cWhere are the bandits!\u201d\u201cCaptain! There is a strange wall in the backyard!\u201dThe altitude of the Buitor Rev. soon exceeded the height of the wall.\u201cWhat! That is!\u201d\u201cHey. I don\u2019t know what it is, but shoot it down!\u201dIn my haste, I start the propulsion engines.I felt a sideways G-force, and the Buitor Rev. started to move forward little by little.However, the enemy soldiers were quicker to shoot the arrows.\u201cFall down!\u201dWith such a call, the arrow flew straight at me, the pilot, or rather at Anna, who was underneath me.I twisted my body to take the arrow.\u201cGu, u u~u!\u201dThe arrow hit me in my left hip, and I felt a tremendous pain from there.But it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m still alive.I\u2019m bringing Anna home, no matter what!Keeping the wind magic engine running with my resolve, Buitor Rev. with us onboard began to gradually increase its altitude and speed.But there was no way the enemy soldiers would just sit back and let that happen.\u201cDon\u2019t let him get away. Shoot him!\u201dWith such a shout, a large number of arrows were shot into the air.Crap!At the moment when I intuitively knew I was going to be shot down and prepared myself, a huge black body appeared in front of me!The black giant caught all the flying arrows with its body.\u201cJerome-kun!\u201d\u201cA, Allen-san, are you okay? Wh-where\u2019s your precious woman?\u201d\u201cI managed to get her back.\u201d\u201cThen, then, should we go home? Or should we destroy everything?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not the point. Jerome-kun, what about the arrows? Are you okay?\u201d\u201cIt, It\u2019s okay. I mean, my scales are still hard.\u201d\u201cAll right, then let\u2019s get out of here.\u201dBuitor Rev. with us on board was gaining speed and altitude rapidly.We were soon out of the reach of the Imperial Guard\u2019s weapons and successfully escaped to a safe zone.When I had enough time to spare, I turned around and looked at the Imperial Capital.There, a large amount of fire is rising around the area where the palace and large mansions, which were probably aristocratic districts, were lined up.In addition, the tall building in the center of town, which used to have several huge spires, has had all of its spires cut off and remodelled into a flat-roofed square building.Apparently, Jerome-kun and Melissa-chan went wild, flashily.\u201cWhat about Melissa-chan?\u201d\u201cOh, over there.\u201dIn response to my question, Jerome uses his head to point in a direction. When I look over there, Melissa-chan is flying towards me at a very fast speed.Thank God. She is safe.\u201cAllen-san? I\u2019m so glad. You got her back \u2026..hmm? What\u2019s wrong with her? Isn\u2019t her appearance strange?\u201d\u201cActually\u2026\u2026\u201dI told Melissa-chan and Jerome about what happened.\u201cSo I couldn\u2019t make it in time\u2026..\u201d\u201cI, I, I can\u2019t forgive them. I knew it, destroying half was not enough. I should have destroyed it all.\u201d\u201cRight. I agree.\u201d\u201cSorry. You can destroy it later. I need to get Anna to a doctor first. Also, my bad, but when you do it, give me a call.\u201d\u201c\u2026..that\u2019s right. I understand.\u201dIn this way, I rescued Anna and headed for Wishen, the territory of the Duke of Ramslett.Damn! Because of me, because I was late!Damn! Damn!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I can\u2019t thank these guys enough.And the important thing is that Anna is sleeping peacefully after we took off on the Buitor Rev.Her beautiful sleeping face, which I love so much, hasn\u2019t changed at all.\u201cIt took me so long to come to your aid. \u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sorry \u2026\u2026\u201dI gently stroked Anna\u2019s hair and dropped a kiss on her forehead.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aAs I looked ahead, I saw a large town. I checked it against the map, and there was no doubt that it was the capital.We reached the sky above the territorial capital in no time, but we found many people gathered to the south of it.I checked with my binoculars and saw that the flag of the Duke of Ramslett was flying on the side near the capital, and the flag of the Kingdom of Xaus was flying on the other side.As the guys from the Est Empire said, the Kingdom of Xaus seems to have invaded the Duke of Ramslett\u2019s territory.The fact that they are being pressed by the territorial capital must mean that they are in a predicament.Besides, there are quite a lot of men on the side of the Xaus Kingdom.No, wait, isn\u2019t that a little too much?There are probably 10,000 or so people here at most. But the other side seems to have ten times that many.I don\u2019t know how they manage to pull out without being overtaken.\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on here? Why are humans fighting like this?\u201d\u201cBecause they\u2019re fools, But the one who is defending is Anna\u2019s father. So I\u2019m going to kick off the other side.\u201dWhen Melissa heard what I said, she had a look of \u2018Good grief\u2019 on her face.\u201cEh, eh? Th-then we too\u2026..\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do that. Besides, Allen-san, will you be okay alone?\u201dI\u2019m grateful, as expected of Melissa-chan.\u201cAnna, I\u2019m sorry. Please be patient a little more.\u201dI nodded to Melissa-chan, and then gently stroked Anna\u2019s cheek as she continued to sleep.Maybe it was just my imagination, but I felt that Anna smiled gently.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aI increased the wind output of the magic engine and speeded up to move above the Xaus Kingdom army, then dropped bombs one after another.If I bomb across the enemy lines, there is no danger of misfiring on the allies. I can do whatever I want, just like I did in Bruseni.The bombs that fell exploded, and just like the Est soldiers in Bruseni, the Xaus soldiers were caught in the explosions one after another and lost their fighting ability.But unlike the time with Bruseni, my heart was not disturbed in the least.\u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s true. After all, I have done so many things like this over and over.\u201dI muttered to myself and continued bombing to annihilate the Xaus soldiers.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Then, a little further on, I spotted a camp with the flag of the Kingdom of Xaus and two other flags that I didn\u2019t know.Perhaps this is the position where the commander of the enemy forces is located.Naturally, I\u2019m going to drop a lot of bombs on that position as well.The bombardment was still going on as I moved, so the ground looked exactly like a copy of the destruction I caused.As expected, the Royal Army of Saus also apparently realized that there was something above them and that it was dropping something.The soldiers were desperately shooting arrows at me, but of course, they couldn\u2019t reach me.So I ran up and down the battlefield and bombed the hell out of them for about 30 minutes.Then, the troops that were crossing swords with the Duke of Ramslett\u2019s army gradually began to show signs of breakdown.This was my observation from the air, but it seemed that the Duke of Ramslett\u2019s army was superior in terms of the fighting ability of each and every soldier.In contrast, the army of the Xaus Kingdom has adopted a strategy of crushing the difference in individual strength with the advantage of overwhelming numbers.However, the Duke of Ramslett\u2019s army probably would\u2019ve pulled out well without fighting to destroy the siege.Therefore, the army of the Xaus Kingdom seems to have come up with a strategy of relying on their numbers and pushing head-on.Before the front line troops are destroyed, they are forced to fall back and push out other troops from the rear. By doing this, they seemed to be gradually lowering the morale of the Duke of Ramslett\u2019s army and reducing their numbers by putting them in a situation where no matter how many they defeated, more enemies would appear.Under such circumstances, I thoroughly bombed and destroyed the rear troops and the commander\u2019s camp.Losing the advantage of numbers and the orders of their commanders, the Xaus Kingdom\u2019s army collapsed within ten minutes and began to run away in the blink of an eye.As I watched this, I spotted the Duke riding his horse in the center of his army.I slowly start descending to speak with the Duke.\u201cI\u2019ll cover for you.\u201d\u201cThank you, Melissa-chan\u201dWhen I said that, Melissa-chan and Jerome huddled around the Buitor Rev. as if to protect it, and together we lowered our altitude.Of course, the Duke of Ramslett\u2019s army must have noticed that there was something up there.But it\u2019s a different story if there are 2 dragons involved. Moreover, they are both Sky Dragons, who are the king of the sky.The knights around the Duke are tightening their perimeter to protect him, and are ready with their bows &amp; arrows and shields to intercept us.However, whether the Duke is stopping them or because he knows that if he makes a move, they will die, they are not attacking.\u201cFufu. That\u2019s pretty wise, as expected of the father of Allen-san\u2019s partner.\u201dMelissa-chan said this with satisfaction and landed on the ground first. Then Jerome landed next to her, and finally, my Buitor Rev. landed between them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hey, hurry up and get the carriage ready.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to. I\u2019ll carry her straight to the yard of the Duke\u2019s mansion.

My house is the biggest building in the center of town. You\u2019ll understand if you go\u201d\u201cOkay! Thank you very much.\u201dI took off the Buitor Rev. and flew directly over the capital, then landed in the yard of the Duke\u2019s mansion with the help of Melissa and Jerome.\u201cHi~ee, dra-dragon\u201d\u201cUwa ~a~a~a~a~a~a~a!\u201dThe servants were surprised to see Melissa-chan and Jerome-kun, whereas the guards were trembling and readying their swords and spears.\u201cGa o~tsu\u266a\u201dWhen Melissa opened her mouth and funnily threatened them, some of the servants fainted, and some of them became incontinent.\u201cMelissa, don\u2019t tease them much\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t want to do anything, but when she reacted like that, I just couldn\u2019t restrain myself.\u201dI stand up and hold Anna to my side. The arrow wound hurts like a hell and feels like it\u2019s burning.But that doesn\u2019t matter.I hugged Anna to my side and yelled loudly.\u201cWe have rescued Lady Anastasia from the Empire! I\u2019ve already informed the Duke, who won in the battle, about her! A physician will be here shortly, so prepare a place for her to rest quickly!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s all the fuss \u2026\u2026 my, my Lady! What is with that look of her!\u201dHearing the commotion, a dignified maid came out from inside the building.She was rapt when she saw Melissa-chan and Jerome-kun, but the next moment she noticed Anna in my arms and rushed over to me.But she quickly frowns.Anna\u2019s outfit may be part of it, but probably both Anna and I smell terrible.\u201cI need a place where she can rest quickly!\u201d\u201cI-I get it! I don\u2019t know who you are, but I appreciate it. This way, please.\u201dI was led into the building with Anna in my arms and laid her down on a large soft bed in a very luxurious lady\u2019s room.Was it my imagination, or did Anna\u2019s expression seem to waver a little at that moment?\u201cAllen-sama, I presume. I will change the dress of my lady. So, we will prepare a room, so can you wait there?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes\u201dI replied and was led by another young maid to the room across the hall. It was a large room with modest furnishings and a relaxed atmosphere.\u201cSir, please use this room. Also, your military uniform is very dirty. So I will prepare a change of clothes for you. Please wait a moment.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes\u201dThen the maid went out and soon came back with a change of clothes. Apparently, the clothes prepared were the military uniforms of the Duke of Ramslett\u2019s army, and they had brought several sizes.\u201cI will help you.\u201d\u201cEh? Oh no\u201d\u201cNo, this is the work of a maid. Also, you\u2019re injured, aren\u2019t you? I can take care of it if it\u2019s something simple.\u201dWhen I was told that, I was half-heartedly pushed to take care of the arrow wound and help me change my clothes.\u201cAnd thank you, Allen-sama, for rescuing my lady. If you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201dAfter saying that, the maid left my room.To be honest, I\u2019m pretty sleepy from staying up all night yesterday. But my arrow wound is burning, and I feel like I\u2019m being forcibly woken up.Besides, I\u2019m still worried about Anna.I couldn\u2019t stand it any longer, so I slipped out of the room and headed for Anna\u2019s room.Just then, the maids came out in a row. It seemed that they had finished changing her clothes.I knock and then try to go inside, but the maid stops me.\u201cMy lady is resting now. Please refrain.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dI was indignant for a moment when I was stopped, but after thinking about it, it was only natural for a maid.However, I can\u2019t help but worry. I knew it was selfish of me, but I insisted.\u201cUm, I\u2019m worried about her. So, I\u2019d like to see her face\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMy lady is asleep. I will call you again when she wakes up, so please refrain from doing so.\u201dNo, that\u2019s why I\u2019m worried about her.As I was pondering what to do, I heard the Duke\u2019s voice from behind me.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I also need Allen. Come with me.\u201d\u201cYes\u201d\u201cUnderstood\u201dThe maid withdrew without a word, and the Duke came in with Elisabeth and an old man in a white coat who appeared to be a doctor.Then we enter the room where Anna is resting. She is sleeping peacefully with her eyelids closed, her body cleansed and her hair arranged.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.I was relieved that she was sleeping peacefully, but at the same time, I was worried that she might not wake up again.The Duke came up to me and started talking to me, who was feeling like that.\u201cNow, Allen. Can you tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cYes. There are some deep military and political issues that I would like to discuss. Is it okay to talk here?\u201dI glance at the doctor and check with the Duke.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. He is also a servant of my dukedom. He\u2019s not the kind of fool who falls prey to selfishness.\u201d\u201cI understand. The first thing you need to know is that the main culprits who kidnapped Anna\u2026\u2026stasia-sama are the crown prince of the Est Empire and a magician who seems to be close to him.\u201dThe moment he hears this, the Duke\u2019s face suddenly turns grim, and the doctor is also upset.\u201cAlso, the Crown Prince and that man said that they would break Anastasia-sama\u2019s heart and let the magic sword rule her. From what I\u2019ve overheard, it seems that they locked her up alone in the dark, told her lies that we\u2019re not alive, weakened her mind, and then gave her the demon sword when her mind was weak.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this magic sword?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. But this is the sword that Anastasia-sama was holding when I rescued her. Perhaps it affects the spirit of the person who holds it, so I brought it with me like this.\u201dI placed the magic sword, which I was carrying around my waist wrapped in a kind of scabbard made from the walls of the prison, on the floor and showed it to him.Incidentally, I hadn\u2019t thought of appraising the sword in the Empire, and I couldn\u2019t appraise it in this state when I couldn\u2019t see it completely.The details of this magical sword remains a mystery.\u201cSo that\u2019s the magic sword\u2026..\u201d\u201cI can take it out now, but what do you want to do?\u201d\u201cNo, let\u2019s not do that. I\u2019ll not be able to handle it if something happens.\u201dI nodded at the duke\u2019s decision and resumed my explanation.\u201cI understand. Let me return to the story. I followed the two of them to the prison where Lady Anastasia was confined. And when the man who was not the crown prince used some kind of magic and started to torment Anastasia-sama even more, I couldn\u2019t resist intervening, so I killed them and rescued her. Then, with the help of my friends, the Sky Dragon couple, I escaped the Imperial Capital and flew through the night to get here!\u201dWhen I tell him that much at once, the Duke is holding his head in his hands.\u201cW-Wait, wait, wait. Did you just say Imperial Capital? And you killed the Crown Prince? You came all the way here from the Imperial Capital in one night? Moreover, those Sky Dragons are husband and wife, and that they\u2019re your friend, is it?\u201dThe Duke huffed and sighed loudly.\u201cYou are not saying things just off the top of your head, right?\u201d\u201cYes. It was those two sky dragons that found Anastasia-sama. I\u2019ve also brought back the heads of the crown prince and the other man in a magic bag.\u201dWhen the Duke heard this, he looked up to the heavens.\u201cWell, that\u2019s all I know about the situation. Oh, and I watched over her the whole time she was flying, but Anastasia-sama stayed asleep and, well, she didn\u2019t wake up.\u201d\u201cOkay, I understand. Hey \u2026 can you cure her?\u201dThe duke looked at the old doctor with an expression of clinging to hope despite his tone, but he shook his head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. As long as there is a magic sword involved, there is nothing a doctor can do about it. The only thing we can do is to put our trust in the mercy of God. Also, if there is anyone who can heal the mind of a person, it is probably the Wise Sage. But that person is already\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u2026\u201dI see. There must have been a great person in the past. But it can\u2019t be helped\u2026..he is deceased.\u201cLoringus sensei\u2026..\u201dI was surprised at Elisabeth-san\u2019s muttering.\u201cLorin\u2026..gus? Then! Duke! I\u2019ll take Anna now!\u201dAs I said this, things in front of my eyes wavered.The arrow wound hurt as if it had been burned by flames, and then my heart suddenly started palpitating.Huh? What\u2026..is this?Breathing\u2026.not well\u2026.\u201cAllen!\u201d \u201cAllen-kun?\u201d \u201cYou!\u201dIn my distant consciousness, I thought I heard someone calling my name.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Allen-sama had collapsed and had been asleep for about five hours.\u201dThank God, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve been asleep for three days or anything.\u201cAccording to the doctor, there is a high possibility that the arrow that Allen-sama was hit with was coated with a special magic poison made with the proprietary technology of the Est Empire. The poison is said to take away the life of the victim after a certain amount of time has passed, and there is no antidote for it except in the Empire. The only way to get rid of it is in the empire. So, originally, Allen-sama should not be able to survive\u2026..\u201dWhat, poisoned arrow!?I hurriedly checked my left hand. As expected, the \u300eSubstitute ring\u300f I was wearing had shattered into pieces.I see. So, now I have no more insurance.\u201cWhat about Anna\u2026.stasia-sama?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s still asleep, but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s anything wrong with her life.\u201d\u201cIs that so.\u201dI slowly raise myself up.\u201cWould you like me to help?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201dJust as I was about to stand up, my stomach rumbled loudly.Oops. By the way, I haven\u2019t eaten anything since last night.I\u2019m sure I have a subtle expression on my face from embarrassment and subtle awkwardness.\u201cI\u2019ll bring you some food. Also, I will report to the Master, so please wait a while.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201dAnd the maid left my room. Then she brought me a sandwich and as I was picking it up, I was immediately summoned by the Duke.Not only the duke but also Elisabeth-san and Friedrich-san are present at the place where I was summoned.The duke, after confirming that I was seated, waved the others to leave.\u201cAllen, you\u2019re back on your feet, good.\u201dThen the duke looked relieved and suddenly thanked me.\u201cAllen, it\u2019s my fault that my daughter turned out the way she is now. Also, thank you for risking your life to save her. I know I\u2019m a foolish father who couldn\u2019t have done anything for her, but I still want to express my gratitude. Thank you very much. \u201c\u201cAllen-kun, thank you so much for getting my daughter back.\u201dI see, it\u2019s not good for the Duke to be seen behaving this way towards the commoners, so he made the others leave.\u201cNo. It\u2019s just something I really wanted to do.\u201dWhen I said that, the dukes gave me a complicated look like they were troubled or relieved.Then Friedrich-san also thanked me.\u201cAllen, Anna is my dear sister. Let me express my gratitude too. Thank you very much.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWell. So, you were responsible for the mysterious explosions that occurred only in the Xaus Kingdom\u2019s army today, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c\u2026.Yes. That\u2019s right. Well, it\u2019s like my magic. They were a hindrance to Anna\u2019s check-up.\u201d\u201cAfter all is that so\u2026.\u201dThat was all Friedrich-san said and remain silent.\u201cAllen, you were supposed to have gone to the Bruseni front alone to fight the Est invasion, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes. The entire region of Bruseni is now under the control of the Centraren Kingdom. There may be some resistance, but there shouldn\u2019t be any significant bases left.\u201d\u201cWhat? What happened to Cardassia?\u201d\u201cI fell, and most of the inhabitants were banished to the Est Empire.\u201d\u201c\u2026..I see, Fortified city Cardassia, that we haven\u2019t been able to recapture for 50 years.\u201d\u201cYes\u201dThen silence reigned over us for a little while.It\u2019s probably not fair to say in this situation.But I decided it was now or never and opened my mouth.\u201cDuke, I have a request.\u201d\u201c\u2026.What is it?\u201dThe Duke looked quite cautious, wondering what he would be asked to do.I think it\u2019s quite rare for a duke to have such an attitude.\u201cI think I\u2019ve fulfilled my promise. So, please give me your daughter, Anna.\u201dAt that moment, the expressions on the faces of the three people froze. The expression \u2018like a pigeon eating a peashooter\u2019 could be used to describe the expressions of these three people.It must have been such an unexpected request.\u201cEh? A-Allen-kun? Is that okay? If it\u2019s about my daughter, you\u2019ve been good to her, and that\u2019s enough already, you know? Allen, you should look for your own happiness\u2026.\u201d\u201cI love Anna, I can\u2019t think of a woman other than her.\u201d\u201cBut the doctor also said it was too late.\u201d\u201cI have faith that Anna will come back. No, I\u2019ll make sure she comes back.\u201d\u201c\u2026..I see. That much\u2026..\u201dWhen I told her that I was determined to do so, Elisabeth-san said so and kept her mouth shut.\u201cWell, well, if you say so much, isn\u2019t it okay?\u201dI don\u2019t know if Friedrich-san can\u2019t find the words or if he has some ideas, but he seems to agree with me anyway.It\u2019s a little light for the next duke though\u2026\u2026Besides, the way things are going, Elisabeth-san probably won\u2019t object.\u201cAllen, what do you mean you\u2019ve fulfilled your promise?\u201dBut the duke is not going to be swayed. But I am confident that I can make him shake his head.\u201cPlease have a look at this\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.I showed him the order for deployment that I had received from the king. The duke frowned when he saw the contents.\u201cNo way I didn\u2019t expect you to have been given an order like this\u2026.\u201dThat\u2019s right. Lead our country to victory by defeating the Est soldiers, capturing Cardassia, and reclaiming the Bruseni region. If done so, I will be given anything I desire. That\u2019s the order I\u2019ve been given.Moreover, it was properly worded that the reward would be as I wish, and it was an order in the king\u2019s own handwriting.Of course, the Jade Seal is also firmly stamped.\u201cI was the one who destroyed most of the Bruseni\u2019s enemy forces. With the help of the method you saw, and sometimes used a fire attack by dropping a lot of oil from the sky.\u201d\u201cOh, oh\u201d\u201cThen I sneaked into the imperial capital and killed the crown prince and his aide in the palace, and brought back their heads. May I serve you here now?\u201d\u201cOh, put it out.\u201dI glanced at Elizaveta and she nodded, so I didn\u2019t hesitate to take out two raw heads from my magic bag.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely Igor, the Crown Prince of the Est Empire. And\u2026\u2026isn\u2019t this guy G\u00fcnther, Commander of the Imperial Magic Division!\u201d\u201cI have defeated my enemies in Bruseni under the name of Allen, a B-rank adventurer receiving the protection of the Duke of Ramslett.\u201dI told him that I\u2019m not going to let him down.The duke crossed his arms, wrinkled his brow and pretended to think long and hard before he opened his mouth.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s admit. On the honour of my Ramslett Dukedom, I will recognize the marriage of Allen and Anastasia, and the Duke, who protects Allen, will undertake the negotiations with the Royal Family in his name.\u201d\u201cThank you very much.\u201dOnce I got up from my chair, I knelt down and bowed like a retainer. Then I handed over the raw heads of the hateful men and left.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aI went back to the room I was given and sat down on the bed and sighed heavily.I thought that now was the only time to get him to admit it.When the duke said he would wait for three years, I assumed that he would be willing to accept it, if necessary.But on the other hand, he is also cold-hearted enough to use Anna to stabilize his territory without hesitation.In the first place, I didn\u2019t think that my promise to wait three years would be kept. But on the other hand, I also thought that he would wait for me unless something went wrong.The reason why the Duke accepted my request at that time was because he thought I was powerful enough to present Anna with an epic-grade ring.In particular, the \u300eSubstitute ring\u300f is something that any nobleman who fears assassination would want to have.If you sell it to a source like that, you could probably make at least tens of billions of money, maybe even trillions.As an adventurer, I found it from the dungeon on my own.At this point, I\u2019m sure the duke\u2019s scales have tipped in my favour over some rich upstart aristocrat or a well-to-do person who just wants the name of the Duke of Ramslett, or some old man with a colour blur problem.Then, after I took Anna and showed her how to traverse the Dungeon of the Wind Mountain, he would have known that what I was saying was not a lie, and my presence would have become even heavier.In such a situation, Anna had gone through such conditions.It is true, of course, that the Duke is saddened by this, as a father who loves his daughter.It\u2019s easy to see that the Duke of Ramslett has family ties and affections, unlike the cold aristocratic families that we, the general public, would imagine by hearing just their names.However, the option of not using Anna as a pawn in a political marriage, no matter how much they bonded and loved each other, would not have existed in the duke\u2019s mind.However, after this incident, Anna is completely useless as a pawn in a political marriage.No man would go out of his way to marry a woman who was bedridden and unconscious, no matter how much he wanted to.In other words, Anna\u2019s current value as a pawn in a political marriage is zero, or even negative.There, the man who had single-handedly destroyed the troops of the Est Empire and the Kingdom of Xaus, and assassinated the Crown Prince of the Empire, came to offer a deal in a way that would honour the Duke.He told me that if he gives me his daughter, who was bedridden and the doctors had given up on her, he would give me all the credit for her and take me under his wing.It was a bit of his weakness, but this is how I finally got Anna.I fell backwards and lay down on the soft bed and sighed heavily again.\u201cBut, more than this, I wanted you to smile \u2026.\u201d(Tl:- Probably saying to Anna.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why are you here?\u201d\u201cAre you surprised? Well, it\u2019s good to see Allen\u2019s surprised face.\u201d\u201cDuke \u2026\u201dI looked at the Duke with a frown, asking him to tell me first, but his face showed that he was very pleased with himself.\u201cAllen, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re okay. When I heard you were hurt, my heart almost stopped, you know?\u201d\u201cMother\u2026\u2026\u201dI hugged my mom for a while.\u201cWell, Allen. Take a seat.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAllen, I brought your mother with me when I withdrew from the royal capital. You and Katerina-san are the people under my protection. When I say I will protect you, I will protect you. It is a matter of course.\u201dThe duke said in a matter-of-fact manner.I have to thank him for still giving me advice and keeping his word even after such a rude outburst.To be honest, I was trying to figure out how to get the mother out of the royal capital.\u201cAnd today we\u2019re having dinner together because Katerina-san is going to be family, too.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dWhen mother heard this, she looks around.\u201cMy daughter is not well and hasn\u2019t regained consciousness yet. However, my family, the Duke of Ramslett, has approved of my daughter and Allen\u2019s relation.\u201d\u201cAllen! Yes. You did your best. Congratulations.\u201dWith that said, my mother hugged me tightly and patted my head.I\u2019m already a head taller than her, so I bend down and let her do it, but it\u2019s embarrassing to do it in public.After that, we talked about Anna\u2019s current situation again, and mother had a sad expression on her face when she heard about it.\u201cBy the way, about the selfless Wise Sage Loringus, I actually have an idea. Can I take Anna somewhere tomorrow?\u201d\u201cNo. The doctor said to keep her on absolute bed rest. Besides, where are you going to take her?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a place deep within the lost forest where Loringus-sama last disappeared.\u201dThe duke wrinkles his brow when I say that.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to go see the elves that are rumoured to exist, are you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Anna and I are both acquainted with the elves of that village. That hair ornament that Anna wears all the time is a very special one, a fairy hair ornament given to her by the Queen of the Elves.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 I see. That hair ornament. I heard that the maids were creeped out by the fact that it was back in Anna\u2019s hair before they knew it, even though they had removed it.\u201d\u201cYes. In that village, there is a spirit of light that was born for the first time in 800 years, and that spirit may be able to do something about her.\u201d\u201cThen, can I ask you to do it for me? After all, I\u2019m worried about moving Anna now. If you can bring them here, it would be better. Of course, I won\u2019t harm the spirit-sama, and I can guarantee the safety of her companion if she has one.\u201d\u201cI understand\u201dThis is how I decided to go see that pervert.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aAnd the next morning, I launched the Buitor Rev. from the yard. However, it was going to be a long flight from the south to the north of the kingdom, so I landed at the airport in Ruhrden, took a short break, and then headed back to the Elf village.And when the sun was about to set, I landed at the airport in the Elf Village.\u201cAh? Allen-san? It\u2019s unusual for you to come at this time of year. Hmm? Where\u2019s your wife?\u201d\u201cWell, a few things happened. I\u2019m here on an errand for Her Majesty.\u201d\u201cI see. Well, take your time.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.The autumn days are often said to be the time when the sun drops quickly, and although it was still light earlier, it was already getting dark.\u201cYour Majesty, it\u2019s been a long time.\u201d\u201cAllen-sama, Welcome. What did you come here for today?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ve come to make a request to Rho-sama, the Spirit of Light.\u201d\u201cOh, to Rho-sama? Miri, come here.\u201d\u201cYes\u201dThen Miri-chan came to me. Next to her, of course, that pervert was flying along with her.\u201cAh, Allen. Carry me.\u201d\u201cYes yes\u201dI hold Miri-chan, who ran up to me. Her weight hasn\u2019t changed at all since that day in the summer, and I can tell that she hasn\u2019t grown.\u201cAllen-shi, I knew you\u2019d be here soon.\u201dThe pervert comes up to my ear and whispers in my ear.\u201cWhat do you mean when you say I\u2019ll come?\u201d\u201cSomehow, that girl seems to have been in a terrible situation for a long time! I was surprised that the power of the blessing I gave was being used more and more! So explain to me what happened? \u201cThat being said, I explained the situation to the pervert.\u201cThen, The irregularity day before yesterday was caused by the magic sword? Even I didn\u2019t expect that!\u201dApparently, the only reason why Anna was not controlled by the magic sword was that this pervert kept sharing his power through the fairy hair ornament to prevent it.I bow my head to the pervert.\u201cThank you for protecting her. And, please. No, I beg you! Please heal Anna.\u201dAfter saying that, I whispered so that only the pervert could hear.\u201cThe doctor told me that the you before your rebirth could do something about her\u2026\u2026\u201dHearing this, the pervert whispered in my ear with a troubled expression on his face.\u201cEven I can\u2019t heal everything. And I don\u2019t know if I can heal anything from here, it\u2019s too far away. That\u2019s why you have to bring her here.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s, the doctor said, absolute bed rest.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s true, that\u2019s true. Well then, take me and Miri-tan with you.\u201dAs the pervert said that, I hesitantly asked her Majesty if I could take her out.\u201cUmm, Rho-sama? Um, she is asking me to take Miri-chan along with me\u2026..\u201d\u201cI understand. Rho-sama, Allen-sama, please take care of Miri.\u201dI was expecting her to say no, but she easily gave me permission.This is how the pervert and Miri-chan decided to go with me, but is it okay to take such a young child out of the village?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At first, She had a hard time, but soon she started sleeping on my back.After that, I managed to coax the excited Miri-chan to calm down, and sometimes I landed to get her in a good mood, but somehow I managed to get back to the yard of the duke\u2019s mansion before nightfall.Thanks to the fact that I told them I would be back today or tomorrow, the head maid and the maid who took care of me came out as soon as I landed.However, they looked very suspicious when they saw me carrying the hooded Miri-chan in my arms.Moreover, the maid who took care of me seems to be looking at me accusingly. What on earth is going on?\u201cHead Maid-san, please tell the Duke I\u2019m back.\u201dThen I walked into the Duke\u2019s mansion, carrying the half-asleep Miri-chan in my arms.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been here. Certainly, this is where Liza-tan got married. And that head maid BBA, used to be cute too.\u201dWhat can I say, this pervert really is like the Wise Sage.The contents are as expected that\u2026..\u201cBut the BBA who was staring at Allen-shi was a BBA I didn\u2019t know. Allen-shi, What did you do?\u201d\u201cI have no idea. I\u2019d like to hear it myself.\u201dBy the way, I\u2019ve changed my tone back to normal. This pervert told me that it would be weird if I didn\u2019t talk as usual, so I decided to go along with it.\u201cAllen-shi, don\u2019t you think she knows you\u2019re just like me? Allen-shi, kidnapping is a crime? If you\u2019ve got a record, why don\u2019t you come clean?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. And I\u2019m definitely not like you!\u201dBy the way, while having this conversation, I hurried to Anna\u2019s room while carrying Miri-chan, who was sleeping and making child-like sounds.However, we seemed to have rushed a bit too much, and Miri-chan woke up on the way.After that, I had a hard time pointing out the pictures displayed in the house and asking questions about what was that and what is this?(Tl:- future practice, I hope. (p\u2267w\u2266q))But what a surprise! The pervert answered the questions in a way that even Miri-chan could easily understand.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that? When I was a human, I was called a wise man. This is just common sense.\u201d\u201cWhy do you even know works of art even though you are a wise man?\u201d\u201cOf course, it\u2019s because if you answer the questions correctly, Lolis will be happy and say that you\u2019re awesome!\u201dThe pervert is proud to say so, but her motive is that. Moreover, because of his rebirth as a spirit of light, she looks like an Outrageously beautiful girl.The gap between the two is quite terrible.In addition, she plays the role of an ideal spirit of light in front of everyone except Miri-chan and me, so no one is aware of her abnormality.As expected, he was just a pervert who continued to play the role of a selfless Wise Sage without his true nature getting discovered.\u201cHuh! Why are you only showing your nature so much in front of me?\u201d\u201cHmm, I wonder why? Even I don\u2019t know about it. But Allen-shi doesn\u2019t mind me being like that, does he?\u201cW-Well.\u201d\u201cThat means Allen-shi is also similar to myself.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s totally different!\u201d\u201cAllen, what is different?\u201d\u201cHmm? It\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dWhat kind of reaction will Miri-chan have when she realizes the true nature of this pervert?Despite such anxiety, we made it to Anna\u2019s room.knock Knock\u201cAnna, I\u2019m entering.\u201dI knock on the door and then call out.\u201cPlease, come in\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.I was shocked for a moment when the reply came back from inside, but I quickly calmed down.Yes, this is Elisabeth-san\u2019s voice.When we opened the door and went inside, Elisabeth-san was sitting by the bedside, apparently taking care of Anna.\u201cExcuse me.\u201dI entered the room with Miri in my arms.\u201cOh my? Who\u2019s that child?\u201dWhen I close the door, I take Miri-chan in front of Elisabeth-san.\u201cElisabeth-sama, this is Miryl Leura-sama, the youngest daughter of the Queen of the Elf Village. And now, on her right shoulder, is the spirit of light, Rho-sama, who has made a contract with her.\u201d\u201cOh, I see! Nice to meet you. I am Elisabeth, Anastasia\u2019s mother and the Duke of Ramslett\u2019s wife. Miryl Leura-sama, Rho-sama, thank you for coming to see my daughter today.\u201dThen Elisabeth-san showed her graceful and splendid ladylike bow.\u201cHmm, Anna\u2019s mother? Oh, it\u2019s Anna!\u201dMiri-chan stared at Elisabeth-san for some time, then found Anna, shook out of my embrace and dived into the bed.\u201cAh, wait, Miri-chan! Anna is now.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s asleep.\u201dWhile saying that, Miri-chan is gently touching Anna\u2019s cheeks. Elisabeth-san smiles bitterly at such a situation.\u201cWhy did you bring such a child here alone?\u201d\u201cWhen I told the Queen about my plan, she asked me to take Miri-chan along with me so easily that I couldn\u2019t believe it. I had no idea what was going on either.\u201dI managed to answer Elisabeth-san who was giving me a somewhat accusatory look, but then the pervert gave me a supplementary explanation.\u201cI\u2019m under contract with Miri-tan, so I can\u2019t leave her. So if I want to go somewhere, I have to take Miri-tan with me.\u201d\u201cI-I see. Umm, it seems that Rho-sama can\u2019t stay away from her contractor Miryl Leura-sama too far.\u201d\u201cBut is this Liza-tan? As expected, She\u2019s getting old.\u201dElisaveta-san seemed to be convinced from my explanation, but beside her, the pervert quickly said something incredibly rude.But, as expected, I can\u2019t tell her about this.\u201cNow, let\u2019s check her.\u201dWith that, the pervert flew to Anna\u2019s bed, leaving me to ponder how to continue the conversation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This is unacceptable. Who on earth did such a terrible thing! The one who did this must be crazy!\u201dThe pervert is touching Anna\u2019s forehead and is upset about something.I\u2019m grateful for her help, but I can\u2019t help but feel a little nervous about letting her touch Anna because I feel like it might taint her.But this is also for the treatment. I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201cI understand. I\u2019ll tell you the results. Miry-tan, can I borrow your body?\u201dWhen the pervert said that, Miri-chan gave a small nod.The next moment, the pervert entered Miri-chan\u2019s head, and Miri-chan\u2019s head hung.\u201cHmm!\u201dElisabeth-sama gasped in that situation and hurriedly supported her body.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Liza. Miri\u2019s body is now being moved by me, the Spirit of Light. My name is Rho, and I am related to the selfless Wise Sage Loringus.\u201d\u201cEh? Lo, Lorin, gus\u2026. sensei?\u201dI watched warmly as Elisabeth-san\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.I\u2019m not so twisted that I\u2019m going to get in the way here.\u201cLiza, your daughter seems to have grown up to be a very strong and kind-hearted woman. And you, as a mother, have become much more respectable. Loringus is very happy to see your growth.\u201d\u201cUh, oh, oh, sensei!\u201dElisabeth-san hugged Miri-chan\u2019s little body and cried, without fear of being seen.The pervert, who is moving Miri-chan\u2019s body, held Elisabeth-san\u2019s head in her small hands and gave her a gentle pat.I looked at her and, No, I won\u2019t say anything.After a while, Elisabeth-san began to calm down.\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry for such a shameful sight.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dWith that said, the pervert smiled using Miri-chan\u2019s face.The smile of the beautiful young elf girl was truly angel-like. So, Elisabeth-san also couldn\u2019t help but smile as well.But knowing what\u2019s inside, I just can\u2019t accept it normally.No, this pervert is a good pervert, but\u2026\u2026Huh. I guess some things in the world are better off not knowing.Really. Oh, really. \u2026\u2026!\u201cNow, let me tell you the results of the diagnosis.\u201dThe pervert said this with a straight face.\u201cYes\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s conclude. The soul of Anastasia is now sleeping deep in her heart.\u201d\u201cSo, will my daughter ever wake up?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s not dead. So, in theory, she\u2019ll wake up, but at least I can\u2019t help with that.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cWh-What do you mean?\u201dElisabeth-san looked like she was about to cry, and I couldn\u2019t help but ask her for a solution in a stronger tone.\u201cRight now, Anastasia is in a state where she has sealed her soul to herself. And if she hadn\u2019t done this, her soul would have been torn apart and lost by now.\u201d\u201cThen, then, why don\u2019t you just break that seal?\u201dI ask the pervert with a desperate feeling.\u201cThat\u2019s right. But I don\u2019t know the key to unlock the seal.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cThe power that triggered the seal is my power. When I blessed Anastasia, I made sure that I could lend her my power through the fairy ornament. Since it is my power, I naturally know how the seal was made. But since the seal is for the protection of her soul, it cannot be easily broken.\u201dAfter saying that, she took a breath, and then the pervert continued speaking again.\u201cYou will need a key to unlock the seal. It could be a person, an object, a memory, a place, or something that this girl truly cares about and looks forward to. If we can find out what the key is, it will be easy to break the seal. But if you force it, the soul will be broken and lost. Once that happens, it can\u2019t be undone.\u201d\u201cAhh\u201dElisabeth-san covers her face.\u201cSo there\u2019s nothing I can do right now. You\u2019re better off looking for the key to the seal. Oh, and I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s wearing the magic sealing collar, but please leave it on until she regains consciousness.\u201d\u201cEh? No, this is the one those guys put on her\u2026.\u201d\u201cI see. So that\u2019s what it is. Even if you don\u2019t have the key, it will come off if you break it. You don\u2019t need to worry about it because it will simply prevent you from using magic. However, if you take it off in this state, there is a risk that the magic will break out somehow. So, please do not remove it until she regains consciousness.\u201d\u201cIs that so \u2026..I understand.\u201dShe really feels like a Wise sage when I hear this kind of thing.I don\u2019t know why she looks like a different person to me anymore.\u201cMore importantly, please lead me to the magic sword that put Anastasia-san in such a state.\u201dI nodded and headed to my room with Miri-chan and Elisabeth-san.And when I opened the door and walked out of Anna\u2019s room, for some reason, I found the Duke and Friedrich-san sitting while leaning against the wall.The maids were worried about these two people.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201cDuke?\u201d\u201cDear? Friedrich?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. They will be able to stand up soon. This is what happens when anyone who has insolent thoughts about my contractor, Miri, tries to approach her. If they really wanted to harm her, it would have taken their life, so the fact that they were able to get away with such a thing suggests that they were thinking of something calculative nature. Now, please continue with the lead.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah\u201dS-Scary. The pervert\u2019s passion for little girls was really not half-baked.If she had this kind of auto-defence then, no wonder the Queen allowed her to go out.Hmm? So that means me and Anna also?Apparently, it was on my face, because the pervert answered my question as if he had read my mind.\u201cAllen, that\u2019s right. Neither Allen, Anastasia, nor Liza had any evil thoughts of looking at Miri and using her.\u201d\u201cO-Oh\u201dNo, no, no. Wait? You\u2019re the one who \u2026\u2026 uh, yes. I\u2019m not going to say anything.And when we entered my room, I offered her the sheath that contained the magic sword.\u201cI see, so this is the magic sword\u2026.\u201dThe pervert gives instructions by gesturing to put it on the floor. Apparently, it is too heavy for Miri-chan\u2019s body to hold it.And when the pervert the sword placed on the floor, the sheath-like wrap I had made returned to the sand and the magic sword revealed itself.The pervert grips the handle placed on the floor without hesitation with Miri-chan\u2019s body.\u201cAh, it\u2019s dangerous!\u201dI say that, but it doesn\u2019t feel like anything special happened.\u201cI see. After all, it seems that there is no doubt about it.\u201dThe pervert muttered so sadly and used some kind of magic.A dazzling light enveloped the area, then quickly converged on the magic sword and disappeared.\u201cThe magic sword has now been sealed. Please take this to the Elf village. This sword should not remain in the outside.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cThis sword is a magical sword made from the souls of numerous young children who were repeatedly abused, betrayed by loved ones and killed in despair.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dI\u2019m utterly disappointed with the content.\u201cThere should be no one in the human world who can purify this. If anyone can do it, it would have to be a saint, especially a saint of charity.\u201d\u201cEh? The saint of charity?\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but ask back at the unexpected word.\u201cYes. A woman who has received a holy blessing and has had her wish granted by a sacred object is called a saint. However, in the past, there were saints who were good at healing, saints who were good at the blessing, and even saints who fought with their fists. Among them, the saint of charity is the saint who specializes in prayers and words to save the hearts of the dead, the weak, and the wounded.\u201dI see. It\u2019s all connected to one existence. So that\u2019s what it means.\u201cBut as far as I know, there is no such person in this world right now. If that is the case, then it would be better if I were to purify it little by little over the next few hundred years in the Elf village.\u201d\u201cO-Oh.\u201d\u201cThank you, Rho-sama! Please, please take care of it!\u201dElisabeth-san, who said that, seemed to be moved by tears.\u201cYes, then I leave the rest to you.\u201dThat said, The pervert quickly slipped out of Miri-chan\u2019s body. Elisabeth-san hurriedly supports Miri-chan, who is about to collapse.Then, the pervert who came out of Miri-chan\u2019s body opened her mouth and said.\u201cAh, I\u2019m so tired. As expected, this kind of thing makes my shoulders stiff. \u201cNo more\u2026.. I won\u2019t say anything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When the maids apologized to me, I found out that I was suspected of kidnapping children or having an illegitimate child.No, No, I don\u2019t do that!Well, thinking from the maid\u2019s point- a commoner man who was allowed to enter Anna\u2019s room suddenly returned with a hooded child, is not hard to understand how I could be mistaken in this situation\u2026\u2026Well, she stayed for two days after that, and as a three-year-old girl, she did whatever she wanted and caused a storm at the duke\u2019s mansion before returning to her home.By the way, Miri-chan didn\u2019t say \u2018I want to come again\u2019 but said \u2018Bring Anna to play with me\u2019 to me, so the plan of the duke seems to have failed.Oh yeah, and that pervert didn\u2019t ask for any compensation whatsoever.When I dropped him off at the elf village, he said to me, \u2018When you get married and have children, bring them to me.\u2019What can I say, I thought that there are times when she is a pervert, and also times when they call her selfless Wise Sage.Of course, she was still a pervert, but for a moment I thought that maybe she was just a pervert who liked children.No, Well, no matter how it turns out, a pervert is a pervert.Also, it\u2019s important to say that I tried holding her hand, kissing her, hugging her, and many other things, but it didn\u2019t work.I still don\u2019t know what is the key to waking Anna up.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aNow that a little time has passed since I returned Miri-chan to the elf village, I think it\u2019s time to sort out the situation here.First, the Kingdom of Xaus, which had attacked with a large army, lost most of its troops and withdrew. Peace has returned to the territory of Ramslett dukedom.It was quite a blow for the Ramslett dukedom to be deprived of its stockpile of wheat and to have its invaded city plundered.However, thanks to a solid claim for damages against the Kingdom of Xaus and response of almost full compensation, the balance of income and expenditure seemed to be quite positive.This may be due to Friedrich-san\u2019s power at the end of war negotiations, but the main reason seems to be that the defeat was too great for the Kingdom of Xaus to ignore.According to the Duke, the army that attacked us was over 100,000, which is almost all the army that the Kingdom of Xaus can mobilize for an expedition.It is estimated that only about 20,000 to 30,000 returned home safely after being defeated by the Duke of Ramslett\u2019s army of only 10,000.If this gap is exploited and the Kingdom of Xaus is invaded, it will be the Kingdom of Xaus that will be cut off from its territory.By the way, the Duke had asked for reinforcements, but the royal family did not send any reinforcements.Therefore, all negotiations for the end of the war were conducted by the Duke of Ramslett.I heard that there is no problem with this because this Kingdom is like a feudal system, but it\u2019s also strange that they didn\u2019t send reinforcements to defend the Kingdom\u2019s territory.After all, was it because he had refused all cooperation and asked for the disinheritance of the Crown Prince?On the other hand, I heard that the eastern front against the Est Empire ended up in a stalemate after I left.It seems that the Centraren Kingdom, which wants to defend the seized Bruseni, and the Est Empire, which wants to reclaim it, are in a state of a slow standoff.However, since we had captured the fortified city of Cardassia and taken all of the Bruseni regions, I had met the victory conditions that the king had mentioned.Yes, as far as I\u2019m concerned, this should be no problem.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Honestly, I think they should either quickly make peace with the Est Empire, or increase their forces and push them a little further.Well, unlike in the game, the war is overwhelmingly in our favour, so the possibility of the destruction of the royal capital has been greatly reduced.Unless the king makes a very stupid decision, that is\u2026..\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aI\u2019m currently riding in the Duke\u2019s carriage to the royal capital.The reason why we are heading to the royal capital is because the duke has been summoned by that king, personally.He\u2019s willing to negotiate for my reward, but the Duke\u2019s assessment is that he\u2019s most likely aiming for assassination or house arrest.Besides, according to the Duke\u2019s secret agent, the King says that I\u2019m the royal adventurer he discovered.To be frank, I don\u2019t know what that means.However, taking into account the various circumstances, he came to the conclusion that the king was thinking of eliminating the Duke of Ramslett.I totally agree with that idea.So we discussed the various possibilities and came up with a few plans. Some plans would be to fight, some would be to bow, but if things keep going like this, it would be the plan to fight.But if the plan is to fight, the country will be divided and the people will be forced to sacrifice a lot.So, as a final negotiation, the duke dared to go to the royal capital, knowing that it was a trap.In the course of that discussion, I told him about my blessings and skills. I would no longer have to hide anything from the Duke since we would now be in-laws.However, to my surprise, the Duke knew that I had a skill or blessing other than the \u3010Wind Magic\u3011 skill.The duke predicted that I would have assassin-related blessings, or a type of skill that hides my appearance, a skill that specializes in the use of some kind of dark weapon, and the skill of \u3010No Chant\u3011 and that I would have something more.He was right for the most part.However, as expected, the blessing of the\u3016Wind God\u3017was unexpecting and surprised him a lot.And, well, that\u2019s why the Duke, who knew about my blessings and skills, decided to take me to the capital as his shadow escort.If we make a mistake here, the country will be divided, so we can\u2019t afford to lose the Duke at this point.That is why I want to do everything in my power to prevent that from happening, and take a path that will minimize the damage to the people who are just living in peace.The duke and I share the same feelings, and I\u2019m sure Anna does too.Thus, we rode to the royal capital with a fragment of hope.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I can\u2019t have a noblewoman kidnapped in my capital. I\u2019m doing my best to find her.\u201d\u201cThank you for your kindness.\u201dWhat shouldn\u2019t have happened? Your son is the one who arranged it.I\u2019m currently watching the meeting between the Duke and the King safely using \u3010Concealment\u3011. But from the first exchange, I\u2019m stressed out to no end.I wanted to punch this thick-skinned, shameless King in the face as hard as I could, but I held back.By the way, these two are smiling at each other and checking each other out, even though neither of them is serious. The Duke may look like a gorilla, but what he does is like a raccoon.\u201cWell, Your Majesty. Allen, an adventurer of the Duke of Ramslett, has asked me, his patron, the Duke of Ramslett, to give him an appropriate reward.\u201d\u201cHmm? What are you talking about? He\u2019s an adventurer under the protection of the royal family and dispatched on my order. There\u2019s no such thing, is there?\u201dNo, no. I\u2019ve heard that, but are you really saying that? Could it be that he already has degraded eyesight at that age?No matter how much you try, I can\u2019t reason with it.\u201c\u2026..But it\u2019s your Majesty who agreed to the transfer of his protection under the Duke of Ramslett\u2019s patronage, right? I have a copy of that document.\u201d\u201cHmm? What are you talking about? Do you think I\u2019ve broken my word?\u201d\u201cOh, Your Majesty. With all due respect, this is the man who represented my daughter Anastasia during the duel. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve forgotten that?\u201d\u201cDuel? Huh? What are you talking about? Though I remember there was a trivial quarrel between children, isn\u2019t it?\u201dA trivial quarrel, is it? Are you sure that\u2019s what you want to call it?\u201cIt\u2019s getting off-topic? Then let\u2019s move on to the prize.\u201dNeither of them moved an eyebrow as they talked about what had happened so far, only smiling with their eyes.As expected, it seems that even this guy doesn\u2019t lose his temper right away with the Duke.\u201cFirst of all, Allen, an adventurer of the Duke of Ramslett, was the first to destroy the enemy forces in the Bruseni region, and he has earned 50% of all the battlefield achievements, as well as many more. To reward him for this, I ask that he be granted the rank of Count.\u201dThe moment the Duke delivered his request straight away, the Great hall buzzed.As expected, 50% of the total war effort is a bit of a stretch, but I\u2019m pretty sure that if I hadn\u2019t bombed and overrun them, it would have been the Centraren Kingdom that would have lost Bruzeni.\u201cWhat are you talking about? Did Duke Ramslett lose his mind? There is no way that such a prize is possible. A mere commoner adventurer can\u2019t suddenly become a Count! A knighthood at best.\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Make unexpected demands to upset the other party, and then find a compromise.It\u2019s one of the basic tactics of negotiation, and I\u2019m sure the people around me took it as such.But this time, the Duke has no intention of giving in from here.By the way, the titles in this country are, in order from top to bottom, where the king and his sons are at the top. Of these, the Duke is a title that is given only to a branch of the royal family, so no matter how I try, I cannot become a duke.As a Count, you own a certain amount of land, and in some cases, you have a certain amount of political power, such as taking care of other lower nobles called Baronet.A knighthood, on the other hand, is a one-time nobility that cannot be passed down from generation to generation. They are also called quasi-aristocrats, and they are not given territories, and in some cases, they can buy these titles with money.Therefore, it does not matter how much the royal family distributes, it will not hurt or itch.By the way, the title of the frontier count, which was used in some countries in my previous life, does not exist. If anything, the dukes play that role.\u201cNo, not at all. I think that this level is appropriate considering his recent activities. After all, it\u2019s that Bruzeni. It\u2019s not an ordinary thing. Considering that it\u2019s possible to re-invade the Empire, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too cheap of an achievement, isn\u2019t it?\u201dThe duke is negotiating with a smile on his face, but the king\u2019s brow is wrinkled. The king seems to be making an effort to keep his composure, but it is easy to see that he is angry.By the way, this is what the Duke is requesting.Make Allen, the most meritorious count who rules the Bruzeni region that he has seized. And since Allen is under the patronage of the Dukes of Ramslett, he will naturally be made a subordinate of the Duke of Ramslett, so approve that as well.Of course, the fertile land of the Bruseni region is something that the royal family would like to have at any cost.They do not want the land to fall under the influence of the Duke of Ramslett, who is a thorn in their side.However, if we think about it realistically, we can expect an invasion by the empire, so it would not be a wrong decision for the country to keep me there as protection.However, when the king was confronted with this demand, he became furious and raised his voice, just as the duke had assumed in our prior discussions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Do you understand?\u201dHowever, the king\u2019s decision was met with a surprised \u2018Eh?\u2019 from the man next to him who seemed to be in charge of advising the king.\u201cI see. Your Majesty says that that the knighthood is enough for Allen, the adventurer of the Dukes of Ramslet, to retake the Bruseni region from the Est Empire, something no one has done in 50 years, is it?\u201dYes. If you look back at history, those who have played a major role in the war have been appointed Barons or Viscounts.As a standard, it is customary to be a Viscount when a region or an important city is regained.There is no doubt that the recapture of the Bruseni region is a far greater achievement than that.The king\u2019s assistant overhears something from the king.\u201cMmm, then let\u2019s make him a Baron.

That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking for the Count. In the first place, didn\u2019t His Majesty promise Allen, the adventurer of the Dukes of Ramslet, that he would be rewarded with whatever he wanted, gold, treasure, titles, women, etc., if he kicked the Imperial Guard to the curb and brought victory to the Centraren Kingdom?\u201d\u201cOur nation has not yet defeated the Est Empire! The war is going on!\u201d\u201cBut your Majesty said that he would be victorious if he would be able to retake the Bruseni region, and issued a written order, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cEh! So! Even so, there\u2019s no way he will be granted a Count\u2019s title! That\u2019s right\u2015\u2015\u201d(Tl:- Is he even an adult, throwing tantrums like a child? (\u256c\u2594\u76bf\u2594)\u256f)Just as I was about to shout something, the man standing next to the king overheard something.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. It\u2019s only with the help of my excellent army. Besides, no matter how successful he was in battle, he\u2019ll never get a Count\u2019s rank!\u201d\u201cThen, what should he do to get the Count\u2019s title? Would it be the head of an important person in the Est Empire?\u201d\u201cMmm? That\u2019s right. If he can single-handedly take the head of the Emperor or the Crown Prince of the Est Empire, I\u2019ll consider it.\u201dUwaa. He stepped on it with great pinpoint accuracy.Hearing this, the Duke smiled again, a black smile on his face.\u201cIs that so? By the way, do you remember that I told you at the beginning that my adventurer Allen of the Duke of Ramslett had done more than just retake the Bruseni region?\u201d\u201cMmm? Was that so? But I\u2019ve received no such report, you know?\u201d\u201cYes, I thought it would be my duty as a vassal to inform His Majesty first, including how to treat it, since it is too great a war achievement.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dWhen he said that, the Duke took out the heads of Igor, Crown Prince of the Est Empire, and G\u00fcnther, Magic Commander, which I had brought, from a high-quality magic bag with a preservation function, and laid them out in front of the King.\u201cWhat? No way?\u201d\u201cYou know these two faces, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI, Igor, \u2026\u2026the Crown Prince and G\u00fcnther, \u2026\u2026the Magic Commander?\u201d\u201cYes. Allen, an adventurer of the Duke of Ramslett, infiltrated and brought back the heads of these two men alone. The Ramslet Dukedom has been in close contact with the adventurer Allen. Based on the recent war situation, we believe that the Est Empire and the Kingdom of Xaus are linked, and we have ordered Allen to take the heads of the Est Empire\u2019s central figures. This is the reason why he left without taking part in the cleanup of the defeated soldiers after completing the recapture of Bruseni.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d(Tl:- It\u2019s quite funny how the duke is saying \u2018adventurer of the Duke of Ramslett\u2019 every time he mentions Allen\u2019s name. (*\u2267\u25bd\u2266)\uff89\uff7c)) )The king, who had been completely debunked by the duke, bit his lip and fell silent.After observing the silence for a while, the Duke called out to the King with the same expression on his face.\u201cYour Majesty?\u201d\u201cDuke, you\u2019ve been giving false reports to me, haven\u2019t you?\u201dThe king suddenly looked angry and shifted the subject.\u201cFalse report? What on earth are you talking about?\u201d\u201cYou told us that you were being attacked by 100,000 troops, yet you easily defeated them! No matter how strong your army is, there is no way you can defeat an army of 100,000. It\u2019s outrageous that you lied to me and pretended that the royal adventurer is your own adventurer!\u201dThe black smile disappeared from the Duke\u2019s face.\u201cYour Majesty, that is not a false report, it is a fact. Isn\u2019t it true that there have been other reports besides mine? And my army has repelled them at great cost. What kind of thinking is it to say that? How can you call me a liar and not even thank me for my loyal service in defending our Kingdom? This Gerhard is overwhelmed by this shock.\u201dAnd then a black smile again.\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure your Majesty will not say such a thing because you\u2019re wise.\u201d(Tl:- LOL (*\u2267\u25bd\u2266)\uff89\uff7c)) )The king was so agitated that he lost his temper and finally uttered a line that he should not have said.\u201cGu~tsu! Hey! Grab this rude man!\u201d\u201cWha, Your Majesty! No! You can\u2019t do that!\u201dThe man who was waiting next to him stopped him, but the king was heated up and would not stop.\u201cDon\u2019t stop me Chancellor! Do you want to be put in prison too!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 I apologize for my overzealousness.I see. So this guy was the Chancellor.However, the Chancellor left his seat and went straight back to the wall.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Eh? Is it okay? You\u2019re abandoning your support of the king?No, maybe he\u2019ll be really sent to prison, so he has returned to his usual nature, is it?\u201cIs that so. Then I guess negotiations have broken down. What a pity. Oh, yes. By the way, how is His Royal Highness the Crown Prince? I\u2019d like to see him fight bravely like royalty once in a while. Well then, I\u2019ll take my leave now.\u201dWith that, the duke stood up and walked towards the exit.By the way, the last irony is for the Crown Prince who did not volunteer, but it is also an irony for the King in a roundabout way.Because this guy has never been on the battlefield, even though he is surrounded by so many enemies.I guess that\u2019s what happens to the child when their parent is like this.This is why this guy decided to make the First Prince, who was born with the blessing of\u3016Hero\u3017, the Crown Prince at an early stage and spoiled him thoroughly.It is not the blessings that are given that make a person, but the efforts that are made to live up to those blessings that make a person a hero.In the game, the Crown Prince only realizes this after the destruction of the royal capital and the loss of everything.However, in this world, unlike in the game, the royal capital will not be destroyed by the hands of the villainess who has fallen into darkness, and Amy, who is supposed to support the crown prince, is not what she seems.Well, what can I say, it\u2019s partly because of me messing the plots, but it will be difficult to rehabilitate him now.\u201cWhat the hell are you doing? Get him! Get him!\u201dThe king was even more enraged when he heard the duke\u2019s words, and he shouted orders to the guard knights around him while yelling at them, the guard knights finally moved.Six of the ten guard knights were stationed around the King, which was impressive.The Duke of Ramslett has \u2018Allen, the adventurer of the Ramslett Dukedom\u2019 who has sneaked into the Imperial City alone and assassinated the Crown Prince and the Magic Commander.They probably thought that if they mess with the Duke of Ramslett, there is a good chance that his blade will now turn on the royal family of the Centraren Kingdom.But led by this king who doesn\u2019t understand such things, this Kingdom will be ruined.\u201cDuke of Ramslett, you are hereby detained on suspicion of treason.\u201d\u201cGet out of the way! Or you\u2019ll get hurt!\u201dThe Duke threatens, but the guard knights don\u2019t seem to be backing down.\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped\u201dAs the four guard knights approached the Duke to restrain him, I fired a non-lethal round at them.\u201cGa~tsu\u201d\u201cguha~tsu\u201d\u201cWha\u201d\u201cUgh\u201dThe guard knights, who had been trying to restrain the Duke, groaned and crouched down.\u201cDuke, this way.\u201cUmu\u201dI created a smokescreen and ran through the palace with the Duke.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I realized that I had reached the same level as when I had thoroughly strengthened Markus in the game.However, my physical strength is still at C, probably because I haven\u2019t been working out hard enough.\u201cIt\u2019s tremendous. Allen\u2019s wind magic.\u201dThe Duke says so as if he is impressed, but this is probably thanks to the blessings of the\u3016Wind God\u3017.I\u2019m really glad that I was able to help Jerome-kun with his wedding arrangements at that time.However, I don\u2019t have time for such sentimentality right now.\u201cDuke, over here.\u201d\u201cAh\u201dAfter meeting up with the Duke\u2019s bodyguards who were waiting in the waiting room, we pushed our way through the soldiers standing in our way and ran out into the town.Then we ran down the main street, and after a short distance, we entered an alley. After running through the intricate alleyways, we came to the entrance of the sewers.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll disturb the capital as planned. In the meantime, the Duke and the others should go through the sewers. I\u2019ll return from the sky after I escape alone.\u201d\u201cOh, be careful.\u201d\u201cDuke also, please don\u2019t make Anna sad by dying here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Oh. That\u2019s right. Can\u2019t die until I see my grandkids.\u201dThe Duke smiled and disappeared into the dark sewers without looking back.I\u2019ve already done a preliminary survey of the sewers with one of the Duke\u2019s attendants, and there\u2019s a squad hidden at the exit of the sewers to escort the Duke.All I have to do is distract the soldiers so that they don\u2019t get to know that the Duke and others are in the sewers.It\u2019s a dangerous mission, but with the \u3010Concealment\u3011 and \u3010Alchemy\u3011 skills, it\u2019s the perfect job for me.I close the entrance to this sewer and lock it with \u3010Alchemy\u3011. Since I can transform the shape of things, this is easy enough. I can only thank the Lurden Store for selling me such a cheat skill at such an unbelievable price.Now, I need to hide using \u3010Concealment\u3011 and immediately start a diversionary strategy.The first thing to do is to create a foul-smelling commotion near the center of the city. The gas, which emits a strong odour like rotten eggs, is sealed with thin ice and set off one after another around the guard posts.When this dissolves, the stench begins to drift.Although it was bad for the people on the street, the amount of gas was not harmful to their health if they were outdoors, so it was not a problem.I also poured a warm liquid that smelled strongly of ammonia on the bodies of the soldiers on guard duty.The ammonia is just a reference, but there is a prospectus that the pungent smell will make people notice it right away.This was, how to say it, very effective, although I felt like I had done a very bad thing because the people started distancing from friends immediately.Thus, after creating a commotion of stench and fake filth near the center, I moved on to the north gate.Then this time, a bomb with little or no lethal effect detonated i.e, a bomb with reduced pressure to reduce the explosive force and prevent fragments from flying around, caused a commotion.On the way, I had an idea and bought some flour and put it in the bomb, which also helped to create a fuss.The flour rising up from the ground looked like it was on fire, which made a great impact. The idea was a success as it attracted a large number of soldiers.I made sure that there was no fire, so it didn\u2019t turn into a dust explosion. However, if there was a spark somewhere and it ignited, it would have been a disaster, so I stopped at once\u2026\u2026.Umm. I guess I got a little carried away. I\u2019m sorry.By the way, there\u2019s a reason why I\u2019ve been creating a diversion from the center to the north gate.The Duke of Ramslett\u2019s territory is located to the south of Lurden. Therefore, you would normally think that the duke would break through the south gate.So the aim is to make people think that they are trying to draw the troops away from the South by creating a commotion in the North.Of course, the real goal is to divert attention away from the sewers, so it is fine if the troops gather in the north, or conversely, if they focus on the south. Furthermore, they may even search the central area thoroughly.If they get a little confused and act in a meaningless way, then my plan is a success.Satisfied that I had made commotion to some extent, I finished my mission on the north side and headed for the east gate.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aAs expected, the east gate was tightly closed. It seems that the order not to let the duke escape has been conveyed to them in one way or another.By the way, according to what I overheard, it seems they\u2019re saying that the Duke has gone mad and tried to harm the king, and that\u2019s why the capture of the entire duke\u2019s family was ordered.The fact that this order has been issued means that there is a good chance that a subjugation army will be formed against the Duke of Ramslett.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.As expected, it seems to have turned out to be the worst possible pattern.Although the situation is different from the game, it seems that the fate of the overly powerful Duke of Ramslett, who is marginalized and ostracized by that foolish king, has not changed after all.But there is no doubt that the presence of a foreign character, which is me, has greatly twisted his fate.Even though Anna had gone through something like that, I hadn\u2019t given up hope.Duke, Friedrich-san, and Elisabeth-san are still alive.If I work hard towards my goal, I can twist that fate as much as I want.Then I\u2019ll just do what I can.I approached the gate for the general public while hiding using \u3010Concealment\u3011. Then, I process a good flaming liquid on the spot, put it in the straw I had brought and lit it on fire.The lit straw burns in an instant and then spread to the wooden gate.The sudden outburst of fire sent the East Gate into a state of panic. I quietly left the scene as the soldiers scrambled left and right to put out the fire.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\u201cThey say the hens will be cackling tomorrow night. I ploughed the field yesterday.\u201d~Gacha~The door was unlocked, and I went straight into the Lurden Store.\u201cWelcome. I see you\u2019re back safe and sound. What can I get for you today?\u201d\u201cI came to Scout. Sooner or later, the royal capital will be in turmoil. Before that happens, Would you like to come to the Dukedom of Ramslett?\u201d\u201cOh, But you\u2019re the one who overthrew the Est Empire, aren\u2019t you? For the hero of the Kingdom to say such a thing, Is this a civil war?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you think, but I want to continue trading. That\u2019s what I came to say. Sorry to interrupt.\u201dThat\u2019s all I said and left the store.Then I walked through the dark back alley to the Adventurer\u2019s Guild. There, I secretly handed a letter to my master, Monica-san, and the rest of the adventurers who are my acquaintance.I might be a wanted man, so I didn\u2019t show my face. I secretly left the letter on the desk or tucked it into their pocket.The content is, of course, a request to leave the royal capital and not to be hostile to the Duke of Ramslett.Especially when it comes to war, adventurers are likely to be hired as mercenaries.If that happens, I may end up having to kill my seniors.It may be selfish of me, but I don\u2019t want any of the people who have helped me to die here.I\u2019m sure they will listen to me. It was frustrating that I could only believe that, but it was not good to stay too long.After finishing everything I had to do in the capital, I walked out of the east gate, which got burned down when the fire spread during the dayPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 81We succeeded in returning to the territory safely.Apparently the escape from the sewer was unmarked, so the Duke and his men were able to join up with the troops that had been put on standby without any problems, and succeeded in returning to the Duke\u2019s territory at once.My return method was the original Buitor that I had hidden at the airport in the forest northeast of Lurden, but after getting used to the improved model, I found the old one a little difficult to fly.After all, I was satisfied with the improvements that had been made, and at the same time, it shook my engineer\u2019s spirit to make more improvements.I don\u2019t know when it will be, but I\u2019d like to build a glider like the one I flew in a previous life, with a double seat, or a light plane with more seats.Well, I heard that the situation in the Royal Capital has not been good since then.When the lords heard the king\u2019s decision this time, their reactions were divided.First of all, the southern aristocrats, who were firmly united around the Duke of Ramslett, supported the Duke without a single defection.This was a result of the fact that the groundwork had been done quite well in advance.And the lords who are threatened by the Est Empire in the east have not made their stance clear, but many of them seem to take a position more in line with the Duke of Ramslet.There are two reasons for this. The first is that, if the food supply from the Duke of Ramslett\u2019s territory is cut off, then there will be territories that will starve.No matter how fertile the land of Bruseni is, it is obvious that the Imperial Army will mess with the kingdom.Moreover, it will take a long time for production to recover since they have expelled a significant number of residents.After all, is it still a long-standing grudge? I don\u2019t know why they drove out the inhabitants, but I hope they will learn from the Roman Empire, which treated its conquered people well.Well, in this world, there is no way to know about ancient Rome, and in the history, I learned here, there is no empire as huge as that one.Now, let\u2019s get back to the story. The other reason is my existence as an adventurer of the Duke of Ramslett\u2019s family.My one-sided bombing and overrunning of the Est Empire is already well known, especially to the soldiers who participated in the Battle of Bruseni in the east, and they have experienced its power firsthand.It\u2019s reassuring while I\u2019m on your side, but the moment I turn against you, it turns into a nightmare.After all, there was no way to shoot me down except by attacking me during takeoff and landing, also bombs and incendiary bombs were raining down from above almost without limit.With such an opponent, it was no longer a matter of maintaining morale.In fact, the Est army had clearly lost the will to fight in the middle of the battle.Now, on the other hand, the nobles in the west and north are supporting the royal family, taking the opinion that the Duke of Ramslett should be eliminated.However, many of the nobles support the current king and crown prince in the west and the second prince in the north, so while they are ostensibly condemning the Duke of Ramslett, they are also in a state of internal strife.And the king has emphasised the order of the subjugation of the Duke of Ramslett, a rebel.However, despite the king\u2019s order, when it comes to actually send troops, the lords are reluctant to lose their own soldiers or those of their own faction.It\u2019s a messy situation that I\u2019ve heard of in world history, but I\u2019d be grateful if my opponent could actually get stuck in such a situation.The Duke, on the other hand, mercilessly took action.First, he stopped the export of wheat outside his territory.The ostensible reason for this is that it was plundered as a result of the invasion by the Kingdom of Xaus, but the reality is different.In the first place, it wasn\u2019t the time to sow wheat seeds, so the damage was not as great as it was said to be, and the Ramslett Dukedom was not hurt since they got more compensation from the Kingdom of Xaus than they got plundered.As proof of this, distribution to territories that support the Duke of Ramslett, such as Margaret\u2019s Altmunt and Isabella\u2019s Luinberg, is still permitted.However, this wheat embargo cast a huge shadow on the lives of the common people living in non-Ramslett ducal territories.The price of wheat is rising day by day, and in some towns, the price of bread has already doubled within a week of the start of the embargo.I felt sorry for them, but I couldn\u2019t just sit by and let the king\u2019s arrogance get the better of me. There is no choice but to make my heart a demon here.The next thing that happened was a huge migration of adventurers.Adventurers make their living by hunting demons and conquering dungeons to gain treasure, but due to the nature of their work, they are allowed to move to other cities.When the price of wheat skyrocketed, many of these adventurers moved to the Duke of Ramslett\u2019s territory or other cities that were self-sufficient in wheat. Some of them are said to have moved to the Duke of Ramslett\u2019s territory in anticipation of the war demand.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Among them, Margaret\u2019s Altmunt is said to be particularly popular, and I\u2019ve heard that a considerable number of adventurers have travelled there for the Orc\u2019s meat that can be produced in the Great Dungeon of Orcs.I can only hope that master and others are included in this group.Well, so far we are following the plan that I discussed with the Duke.There are a few things I envision for the future, but there are still many uncertainties.In particular, it is necessary to watch how the Est Empire, which has lost two of its important people, and the United Kingdom of Norsane, which has yet to make a move on the political changes in its neighbouring countries, will emerge.Also, the situation is unpredictable as to what the non-Ramslett faction lords will do as the food situation worsens as time goes on.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aI finished my work for the day and came to Anna\u2019s room.By the way, my job is to help the Duke with his political affairs. In this situation where the duke\u2019s territory is in need of even a cat\u2019s paw, there is no room for idle play. (TL:- cat\u2019s paw is depicting shortage of personnel.)\u201cGood evening, Anna. The stars are shining beautifully today too.I called out to her, but she didn\u2019t respond at all.The maids who serve her every day make sure that she is well-groomed, and she looks fantastic, as beautiful as an elaborately made sculpture.I gently lifted Anna\u2019s body and turned her to face me, changing her position to prevent bedsores.Every time I pick up her body, which has become lighter and thinner, my heart tightens.\u201cListen, Anna? The Duke has agreed to Anna\u2019s marriage to me. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time for you to wake up?\u201dOf course, I know that won\u2019t happen. I raise her up and talk to her while I try to relax her joints so they don\u2019t stiffen.\u201cThat\u2019s right. The day after tomorrow is Anna\u2019s birthday, right? It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve been able to celebrate your birthday at the mansion, and everyone at the mansion is really excited about it. So, you know. Wake up, please.\u201dI can\u2019t. I had decided to smile and talk to her.I started to tear up a little.If Anna woke up in this state, it would worry her.\u201cAnna, good night.\u201dWhen I put her down on the bed again, I lightly kissed her on the forehead and left the room.In the moonlight, Anna\u2019s figure was still so fantastically beautiful, and so fragile that I was afraid she would disappear at any moment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I had my hair done and took the present.Okay, I\u2019m all set.Then I went to my mother\u2019s room to pick her up.By the way, ever since the Duke approved my marriage to Anna, my mother is also living in the Duke\u2019s mansion.The reason is that the mother of the duchess\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is also a target and needs to be protected.I see. Certainly, that\u2019s true.The aristocratic society is a troublesome one, but it is a path that I have prepared myself to take. I guess I have no choice.After about ten minutes of waiting, my mother came out of her room wearing a dress. She seemed to be struggling with the heels and the dress, which she was not used to, but she looked different from my usual gentle mother, and I thought she was very beautiful.I took my mother\u2019s hand and escorted her to Anna\u2019s room.The maid opened the door for me, and we went in. The Duke, Elisabeth-san, and Friedrich-san were already there, chatting happily beside Anna, who was still asleep in bed.\u201cI am late.\u201d\u201cThank you for having me here today.\u201dMom greeted them politely, while I was in my usual self.\u201cHahaha. It\u2019s not even time, yet we\u2019re all here.\u201dI glanced at my watch and saw that the Duke was right, it was still 10 minutes ago. I guess everyone was looking forward to Anna\u2019s birthday after all.\u201cOh, that\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cThen, let\u2019s start a little early.\u201dWhen the Duke said this, he coughed once and then spoke softly to Anna.\u201cAnna, happy 17th birthday!\u201dWith the words of the Duke as a cue, we quietly convey our congratulations, one by one.\u201cWell, Anna. I thought I\u2019d give you a proper update today.\u201dThe Duke took Anna\u2019s hand and said so, a look of prayer on his face.\u201cAnna, your Allen has become your fianc\u00e9e.\u201dHowever, when Anna continued to sleep like a statue, I nodded my head in disappointment.\u201cBesides, We\u2019ve prepared a lot of Anna\u2019s favourite foods for you today. Eat as much as you like, okay?\u201dThat said, he points to the gorgeous dishes lined up on the table, but Anna didn\u2019t respond and continued to sleep.\u201cHappy birthday, Anna. I\u2019ve prepared a homemade cake that you\u2019ve loved since you were a child.\u201d\u201cAnna, happy birthday. I got you that white horse you\u2019ve been asking for. It\u2019s outside. How about it? Wouldn\u2019t you like to ride it?\u201d\u201cAnastasia-sama, happy birthday. And thank you so much for choosing my son, who is still lacking in many areas. I heard that you like this.\u201dElisabeth-san gave her a memorable cake, Friedrich-san\u2019s gave her a horse that Anna wanted of which I had no idea, and my mother handed her a wrapped confectionery, but Anna was still asleep.Next is my turn.\u201cHappy birthday, Anna. I\u2019m sorry I put you through all this because I wasn\u2019t good enough. Here, this is the \u300eSky Knight sword\u300f that I promised to you.\u201dWith that said, I pulled out the sword and showed Anna the beautiful, slender, sky-blue blade. Her beautiful face was reflected in the blade.I gently put the \u300eSky Knight sword\u300f in Anna\u2019s hand.It was then.A dazzling light shone from the \u300eSky Knight sword\u300f.\u201cEh? Anna!\u201dI hurriedly reached out and grabbed Anna\u2019s hand, but it was so dazzling that I closed my eyes and turned away.Then, just as the light went out, I heard a faint voice.\u201cA, lle\u2026.n?\u201dIt was the voice I had been waiting to hear for so long.That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been hoping to happen for so long.I couldn\u2019t control my emotions and hugged the sleeping Anna as hard as I could.\u201cAnna! Anna!\u201dTears flow endlessly.Ah, damn it. Even though I was supposed to smile!Anna answered me gently in a weak voice.Visit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.\u201c\u2026len. Don\u2019t, cry.\u201dThat said, she put her left hand, which was not holding the sword, around my back, but it was terribly weak.I feel joy and security, and at the same time, my heart is tightened with sadness.\u201cAnna, I\u2019m not letting you go, ever. I won\u2019t let you go alone, no matter what anyone says.\u201d\u201cA\u2026..llen\u201dWe hugged each other. But after a while, I heard a coughing sound from behind me.\u201cAh\u201dI kissed on her forehead and slowly and unwillingly moved away from Anna.\u201cFa, ther\u2026..Mo\u2026.ther, Bro\u2026ther, this\u2026is?\u201dMaybe it\u2019s hard to speak, as she called the three people with a weak voice.\u201cOh, Oh, Anna. It\u2019s good to have you back. This is the territorial residence. Anna! Anna!\u201dThen the Duke hugged Anna while crying, and Elisabeth-san and Friedrich-san also hugged Anna while crying in the same way.After that, we all cried, and then it took us quite a while to calm down.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\u201cOnce again, happy birthday. Anna.\u201d\u201cThank you very much.\u201dThe Duke\u2019s words of congratulations were answered in a firm tone by Anna, who was sitting on the bed with only her upper body raised.After that, she drank a little water to moisten her throat, which helped her to speak more or less.The Duke continued to speak to Anna.\u201cAnna. Allen rescued you from the imperial palace alone after you were kidnapped and brought you back here.\u201d\u201cEh? Allen. You\u2026.\u201d\u201cI really wanted to do that.\u201d\u201cAllen \u2026\u201dAnna looks happy and a little sad.I\u2019m sure you\u2019re worried when you heard that I did it all by myself.\u201cAnna, the man you chose is a great man.\u201d\u201cFather\u2026. by that\u2026..?\u201dAnna rolls her eyes in surprise. I\u2019m so happy just to see such a surprised face.\u201cAnna, as promised, the Duke has acknowledged me. Will you marry me?\u201dI kneel at the bedside and take Anna\u2019s hand, proposing once again.\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes\u201dI softly wiped the tears from her cheeks as she nodded, then gently hugged and kissed her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 83From the morning after Anna\u2019s birthday, I\u2019ve been working hard and helping her with her rehabilitation in my spare time.She had been bedridden for such a long time that her body had become very weak.At first, she could not stand up properly, but now she has recovered to the point where she can walk with support.I don\u2019t know how long it will take for her to be able to wield a sword and control magic like she used to. But Anna\u2019s condition is improving day by day, and that makes me irresistibly happy.Anna really wants to use the \u300eSky Knight sword\u300f that I gave her. Of course, I\u2019m going to help her, but I don\u2019t want her to be in a situation where she has to use the sword, so I have mixed feelings about it.However, Anna is smiling next to me like this, and she\u2019s still alive.That alone makes me, no, we are happy.Moreover, fortunately, Anna doesn\u2019t remember much of what happened after the magic sword was placed in her hands. It was a blessing in disguise that she didn\u2019t suffer a deep psychological scar from the sword\u2019s mental attack.However, she is afraid of being alone in the dark. She always keeps a light nearby when she sleeps, and Elisabeth-san watches over her at her bedside until she falls asleep.I want to be able to protect her so that she can sleep early.Also, I explained to her the situation since Anna was kidnapped.As expected, Anna looked very sad when she heard that the king had defended the crown prince despite a lot of evidence and that the crown prince had never admitted his guilt, also that I killed the kidnappers, and that the Est empire used that and Anna\u2019s refusal to marriage as an excuse to start the war, that the school had been closed because of it, and that even the students had gone off to war in a student mobilization, albeit on a volunteer basis.As the daughter of the Duke of Ramslett and the future Queen of the Centraren Kingdom, Anna has been selfless in making it a better country to the extent that it seems excessive to me.And it was all done out of a sense of responsibility as a noblewoman.However, it is sad to see that what she had built up in this way has not been rewarded and that they are running towards collapse.And she was as angry as I was at the king for not recognizing my achievements and trying to get away with only knighthood.\u201cIf you don\u2019t treat people who have achieved so much properly, you don\u2019t deserve to be in the top position. In fact, isn\u2019t this the first time since the founding of the country that the whole of Bruseni is under our control?\u201d\u201cIf you ask me, that\u2019s true. There\u2019s been a struggle from the beginning.\u201d\u201cOh, yes. But I wonder when the royal family became like that. In the first place, the founding king became king by taking the lead in fighting to protect his people and defeating their enemies. If you can\u2019t fight for your people, you should quit being a king.\u201dSaying that Anna shook her head.\u201cMoreover, His Highness the Crown Prince didn\u2019t volunteer to go to war. It\u2019s the end of the line for the royal family.\u201dAnna said this and looked far away. She didn\u2019t seem to have the same \u2018for the country\u2019 will that she had before, and seemed to me to be someone else\u2019s problem.I stared at her and thought something silly like, She\u2019s so cute.\u201cHmm? What\u2019s wrong? Do I have something on my face?\u201dVisit wuxiaworld.eu for extra chapters.Anna must have noticed my gaze because she looked at me suspiciously and told me so.\u201cEh? No. Anna looking far away is also cute.\u201d\u201cWha! Stupid! What are you saying out of the blue!\u201d\u201cAnna who turns bright red after saying that is cute, and Anna who is angry is also cute.\u201d\u201cH-Hey! Allen! What\u2019s wrong with you!\u201d\u201cWell, what to say? Maybe I\u2019m sick.\u201d\u201cWhat! Get a doctor so-soon!\u201dWhen I saw Anna turn blue with impatience, I gave a small laugh.\u201cIt\u2019s an illness of wanting to watch Anna all day.\u201dWhen I said that, Anna\u2019s face turned red again.\u201cDo-Don\u2019t say stupid things! I was! I was worried about you!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. But I was hundreds of times more worried about you than you are about me. That\u2019s why I\u2019m happy that you reacted in such a cute way.\u201dWhen I said that, Anna huffed and turned bright red, but turned over and muttered quietly.\u201c\u2026\u2026Sorry\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay because you came back to me properly.\u201d\u201cAllen\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not letting you go again.\u201d\u201cOh geez, I\u2019m never leaving Allen again.\u201dI gently hugged Anna, and she hugged me back.I breathed in deeply as I felt Anna\u2019s warmth. Anna\u2019s nice scent filled my nose, and a warm feeling of gratitude for her return filled my heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAbout two weeks had passed since Anna had woken up. She had recovered to the point where she could walk on her own and was now able to take a walk in the garden.Thanks to this, her smile has increased considerably, which makes me happy as her fianc\u00e9.By the way, I have already removed the magic sealing collar. As that pervert said, the item was not much of a hassle, and I was able to destroy it quickly after processing it.Now, at last, the Centraren Kingdom has made up its mind and set out to subjugate the rebellion of the Duke of Ramslett.According to the intel of the spies, the Crown Prince was motivated for some reason, is it because he doesn\u2019t want to become unworthy?Nevertheless, troops were finally dispatched from all over the country in the form of the King\u2019s decree. The soldiers that were supposed to be stationed in Bruseni were included in the troops, which made me laugh.(T/N:- Lol (\u2267\u2207\u2266)\uff89)I\u2019m not sure what happened for them to make such a decision, but that\u2019s what they did anyway.As a side note, the Centraren Kingdom has yet to make peace with the Est Empire.Rather, they used the heads of the two men we left behind and publicized the fact that we had taken the Crown Prince\u2019s head everywhere, which sparked enthusiasm in the Est Empire to have a battle of attrition.It\u2019s a foolish thing to do, even though I was very careful not to let that happen.Well, it\u2019s none of our business.Now, the Duke of Ramslett has finally declared his independence from the royal family of Centraren and, together with the southern nobles, called themselves the Kingdom of Ramslett.And in addition to the southern nobles, several other lords have offered their allegiance to the Kingdom of Ramslett.They were nobles who had territories in steep mountainous terrain and lands full of monsters, also those who could not feed their people with their own agricultural production alone.In short, they chose a realistic approach of allegiance rather than their downfall due to rebellion caused by starving the people.Moreover, if they remained in Centraren, they would be ordered to deploy their army to defeat the Ramslett. Then, it\u2019s obvious that they\u2019ll be fighting me who destroyed the Est Empire.No one wants to lose their soldiers, who are also farmers.As a result, the Kingdom of Ramslett expanded its territory not only to the south, but also to the east and part of the west, and came to occupy 30-40% of the former Centraren Kingdom.Now, in such a situation, the Centraren Kingdom\u2019s army invaded Ramslett.The Supreme General is the Crown Prince Karlheinz. In addition, for some reason or another, Amy, Markus, Leonardo, Oscar, and the other members of Amy\u2019s reverse harem are all here.Well, it doesn\u2019t matter to me anymore.\u201cThen, Anna. I\u2019m going. You\u2019re not completely healthy yet, so go to your room and get some rest.\u201d\u201cOh. Take care of yourself.\u201dThen Anna and I embrace.As we parted, Anna stretched out and kissed me on the cheek.Woah, the tension rose quite a bit!\u201cThen let\u2019s give victory to the princess.\u201dWith a bit of coolness, I started up the wind magic engine of my Buitor Rev. and took off. I then gave a small wave to the blushing Anna and headed for the battlefield.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aLess than an hour later, I arrived at the spot where the two armies were locked in a standoff.I heard that the number on our side is 5,000, while the number for Centraren is about 30,000.Although we were at an overwhelming disadvantage in terms of numbers, there was no sense of sadness on our side.Because everyone knows that I can turn the tide of the war any way I want.And from what I could see from the air, it seems that they are still shooting arrows and magic at each other.Speaking of battle, you may imagine a spectacular cavalry charge, but the basic idea of combat is to attack with long-range weapons to reduce the numbers and then engage in close combat.Of course, there are times when the cavalry will charge through them or flank them with separate units, but this is usually the case in stare-off battles.Well, no one wants to charge where they are unilaterally attacked by arrows and magic.Now, I will bomb the enemy without worrying about who is where.What a simple job.There may have been someone familiar mixed in on the other side, but if they were enemies on the battlefield, it was unavoidable.I\u2019m prepared to do that, too.And the bombed Centraren army quickly panicked.I mercilessly dropped additional bombs on the enemies, in that state, like rain.It\u2019s just work now. The same scene is unfolding as when I devastated the soldiers of the Est Empire and the Kingdom of Xaus.After about an hour of bombing, I saw that the Centraren army was completely destroyed, and I returned to the capital.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aAs soon as I landed in the backyard of the Duke\u2019s residence, no royal palace, Anna came running up to me.\u201cAllen! Are you hurt?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m home. As you can see, everything\u2019s fine. I was just flying over the sky.\u201dAnna was relieved to hear those words.I hugged Anna and gently kissed her, and then walked into the royal palace. I feel the warmth of the precious woman in my arms.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aAs a result of my one-sided bombing overrun, the battle between our Ramslett Kingdom Army and the Centraren Kingdom Army was decided. As a result, the battle that happened at the northern border of the Ramslett Kingdom against an overwhelmingly superior number ended in the Ramslett Kingdom Army\u2019s victory.In this battle, the Centraren Kingdom lost 25,000 of its 30,000 troops, including wounded soldiers and deserters.And the history of the war was marked by the humiliating defeat of the Crown Prince Karlheinz, the Supreme General, and the heirs of the noble families who were captured as prisoners of war or killed in battle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWhy do I have to talk to those guys?\u201dI questioned the soldier who came to call me, not hiding my grumpiness.\u201cBut he insisted on it. Even though he\u2019s a prisoner of war, he\u2019s still the Crown Prince of the Centraren Kingdom, moreover, he asked me to bring his acquaintance Allen-dono. Also, I don\u2019t think there is any danger because everyone is tightly restrained.\u201d\u201cHuh, that\u2019s a hassle.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll also go with you and talk to him. Besides, even if I can\u2019t use the sword, I\u2019m already good with magic. If it comes to it, I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m most worried about Anna\u2019s personal safety\u2026.\u201dJeez.I can\u2019t believe that after all they have done, they would still want to have a word with me, even though they have turned their swords against us as an enemy.I wonder which one is the saint and which one is the villainess.So I came, unwillingly, to the room where Amy and her reverse harem were being held.When I entered the room, the five of them stared at me with eyes as if they were avenging their parents.Everyone is tightly bound behind their backs and gagged except for the Crown Prince and Amy.By the way, the soldier on guard has left the room and is waiting a short distance away from the door, as there may be some private conversation. Also, Anna has been asked to wait in front of the door instead of going inside.The Crown Prince noticed me and immediately commanded me in a condescending, pompous tone.\u201cHey. Commoner. Release us now. It\u2019s treason to rise up against the royal family!\u201dIs this guy still talking like that in this situation? Is he sane?\u201cThat\u2019s right. Do you think you can do this to me, the Saint of Charity?\u201dApparently, this woman has not yet awakened from her dream.\u201cHey? More importantly, unravel the rope?\u201dMoreover, I don\u2019t know what she was thinking, but she suddenly changed her attitude and even made seductive advances with a goofy act.Disgusting!Do you really think you can ensnare me with something like this?I ignore Amy\u2019s unpleasantness and inquire, looking straight into the Crown Prince\u2019s eyes.\u201cI would like to confirm something to Your Highness. The one to secretly sell Anastasia-sama to the Empire and forged the Jade seal was Your Highness, right?\u201dWhen I inquired about that, the Crown Prince nodded without any signs of being afraid.\u201cI\u2019m the King of the future. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this. Besides, the Empire wanted that woman. Moreover, if it brings back the Bruseni region, then that\u2019s good! That is the responsibility of the nobility!\u201d\u201cDid you make a deal with that G\u00fcnther, the Magic Division Commander?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! If only you hadn\u2019t interfered, we would have gotten Bruseni back bloodless!\u201dI see. Did you really believe that ridiculous story and got in on the deal?\u201cAmy-sama, did you know that story? No, was it Amy-sama who instigated it?\u201dAmy then snorted and said in a triumphant manner.\u201cHmph, isn\u2019t it obvious? That woman is there to be messed up and become a weapon of the empire. I\u2019d rather you praise me for doing the right thing.\u201dI wonder where the goofy act from earlier went.\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dThe Crown Prince immediately affirmed Amy\u2019s remarks, and the remaining three nodded to Amy and the Crown Prince\u2019s terrible arguments that did not even make sense.These guys are hopeless. They don\u2019t even seem to have the ability to make decent judgments anymore.No, it seems Markus and Oscar have an atmosphere of recovery.What the hell happened?\u201cIn the first place, the Est Empire didn\u2019t have any intention from the beginning to return the Bruseni region. Anastasia-sama was only one of the pretexts. In the first place, it\u2019s crazy to invite soldiers from an enemy country and trick the Duke of your own country.\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201dThe boiling point is as astonishingly low as ever. I don\u2019t think it was this bad in the game.Well, people are influenced by those close to them in their life, and the other person was that Amy, not the real heroine.On that point alone, I have sympathy for this Crown Prince.As I\u2019m thinking about this, Amy is agitating me with her usual supercilious attitude.\u201cBut that woman has fallen into the hands of the Empire. She\u2019s probably enchanted by the Demon Sword by now, you know?\u201dYou. Didn\u2019t you want me to fall for the honey trap?I\u2019m a little confused because her words are too incomprehensible.\u201cI knew it. That woman must have had enough darkness in her heart to be attracted to a magic sword.\u201dIt seems that the Crown Prince simply believes in such absurd words of Amy.\u201cEh? Are you okay? Why did you believe in the Demon Sword so easily?\u201d\u201cAmy, the Saint, is saying it! There can be no mistake!\u201dSaint, huh?The next moment, the door was opened with a clang and Anna, who had been waiting outside, entered the room.\u201cWhat? Anastasia?\u201d\u201cWhy are you here?\u201dThe two of them shouted in surprise, and the other three widened their eyes as well.\u201cIt has been a long time, Your Highness. And everyone else, too. You seem to be as full of energy as ever.\u201dAnna says hello, or rather sarcastically, and comes over to my side. I gently support her as she leans her body against me.It\u2019s not like this was meant to insinuate them. Anna can walk normally now, but she has been forbidden from overdoing it for a long time.\u201cAnd Your Highness. You\u2019re missing the title? I am now the First Princess of the Ramslett Kingdom. I have been telling you this for a long time, but as usual, you don\u2019t seem to have learned it at all.\u201d\u201cWh-what! We do not recognize the Ramslett Kingdom! You are nothing but rebels! Don\u2019t you think you should be ashamed of yourselves, to be clinging to and supported by a commoner like that, while claiming to be a Princess!\u201dThe Crown Prince\u2019s tone made me and Anna sigh at the same time.\u201cYour Highness, be careful how you speak. Even if you do not recognize the country now, you will soon be forced to recognize it. And I will not allow you to insult Allen as a commoner.\u201dAnna then stared at the Crown Prince with cold eyes. The expression on her face was different from the one she used to wear for the sake of her country as if she were looking at a piece of filth.\u201cAllen is my fianc\u00e9. Insulting my fianc\u00e9 is the same as insulting me.\u201d\u201cHuh? Engaged to a commoner? Have you lost your mind?\u201dThe Crown Prince\u2019s eyes widen in surprise.\u201cNo. Allen is the hero of the Ramslett Kingdom. He saved me from the dastardly plots of His Highness and the Empire, single-handedly destroyed most of the enemy in the battle against the Kingdom of Xaus, and also successfully destroyed the army of the Centraren Kingdom, which had invaded the Ramslett Kingdom for an unreasonable cause. It is only natural that the Princess of a country would marry such a rare hero. Looking back on past history, there are countless stories of such a marriage.\u201d\u201cWhat? So you\u2019re saying he\u2019s the cause of all those explosions? You refuse to fight fair! You coward!\u201d (T/N:- childish shit.)Anna, without changing her expression at all, says to the Crown Prince, who is startled, shouts loudly, and for some reason curses at me.\u201cIn other words, this is also a political marriage, though Allen and I are in love with each other.\u201dWhen Anna finally relaxed her expression after saying that much, I gently hugged her. Anna responded by hugging me back tightly.\u201cWell, that is why there is no release. Though I think you can go home when the agreement to end the war is signed, so you\u2019ll have to stay here and be quiet, hmm?\u201dHaving said all that, I noticed the staff on Amy\u2019s waist.\u201cHey! Why does a prisoner have a weapon?\u201dI hurriedly hid Anna behind me and stripped Amy of her staff.\u201cHey! Give it back! That\u2019s mine!\u201d\u201cN-No way, this staff is!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! It\u2019s a staff for me, a saint! You, who is not the chosen one, is not allowed to have it! Give it back!\u201dCertainly, this staff is familiar.Yes. This is none other than that staff that awakened Amy as a saint in the game!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Please, Your Highnesses, take care of Amy.\u201d\u201cO-Okay, but you\u2019re definitely coming back alive, right?\u201dAmy and the others saw Leonardo nodding broadly, and they ran off without a hitch.Damn. What the hell is going on? What are the guards who are supposed to be waiting outside doing?I manage to stand up, with Anna supporting my back, and glare at Leonardo.If you look closely, Leonardo\u2019s left wrist is crushed and bleeding profusely.I see. Apparently, he pulled himself out of the bind by force at the expense of his own left hand.And it is probably the effect of the\u3016Hero\u3017buff by the Crown Prince that made it possible.But in that condition, he should not be able to hold the sword anymore if he is not treated soon.Even though Amy is supposed to be able to use healing magic.It\u2019s a cruel thing to do.That said, I don\u2019t think I will be able to fight for much longer either, as I still have some damage from earlier and a piece of a broken chair from the first blow is lodged in my side.\u201cDie! Vile commoner!\u201dThis time Leonardo, holding a candlestick in his hand, attacked again, aiming not at me but at Anna.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me! Which one of us is the coward!\u201dI hastily draw my sword and get between him and Anna to catch the candlestick.No matter how much he has the blessing of a\u3016Knight\u3017, if he can only use one hand, I can manage. I thought so, but with the buff from\u3016Hero\u3017, this guy was a monster, to be honest.My sword is lightly flicked away, and he strikes me in the side with the candlestick in his right hand.I, who couldn\u2019t catch the blow, was blown away and slammed hard into the wall.The shock made me unable to breathe for a moment, but I desperately tried to stand up somehow.Moreover, the wound was opened because the fragment of the chair was pierced into my side, and blood was dripping.Maybe \u2026 This alone could be a fatal injury.The moment I came to that realization, I collapsed to the ground, my strength draining from my knees.It\u2019s not good! Anna! I have to \u2026 protect her! Stand up! Move!\u201cAllen! \u2026\u2026 Leonardo! How dare you!\u201d\u201cAt the commoner\u2019s side\u2013\u201cLeonardo calmly eluded Anna\u2019s angry gaze and tried to insult me again.However, Anna had finished her chanting before he could realise and invoked her magic.\u201cIce sword dance!\u201dAt that moment, countless shimmering ice swords appear, and then, in the blink of an eye, they strike Leonardo.\u201cWhat? Gahh\u2026\u201dLeonardo, unable to even move, was hit by Anna\u2019s magic and quietly collapsed without uttering a sound.\u201cAllen! Allen! hold on!\u201dAnna\u2019s worried face is in front of me.Hey, don\u2019t look like that.Ah, but \u2026 it\u2019s my fault? \u2026\u201cUgh, Anna, sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, hold on!\u201dAnna gently held my hand as I apologized for worrying her. I was covered in blood now.\u201cAnna, blood \u2026\u2026 on your hands.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care about that. Don\u2019t die! Hey! In a place like this! Hey! Allen!\u201dI know. I don\u2019t like it either. But I\u2019d rather this than Anna dying.My vision gradually became blurred.Oh, I thought this was a happy ending already.I \u2026 I wasn\u2019t careful again \u2026Anna\u2019s voice becomes more and more distant.And there is Anna\u2019s crying face in front of me.If the last thing I can see was Anna\u2019s face, then that\u2019s also possible?Oh, but as expected I want you to laugh \u2026 is that not it?Anna \u2026 I\u2019m sorry \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Oh, now that I\u2019m here and see, it\u2019s 5,000 troops?But I don\u2019t care about that!Why are we in such a bad situation in such a winning battle?Oh, God. I shouldn\u2019t have followed them.I came here because I heard it was going to be a piece of cake!At first, I thought it was an easy win because there were so many of us over here and so few over there by all appearances!When I noticed, there were explosions only on our side\u2026\u2026What is it? What\u2019s going on?Ah! That weird flying thing!That\u2019s right?\u201cKarl-sama. Isn\u2019t that thing dropping the bombs on us?\u201dThey all looked up when I said that. But they looked hopeless.\u201cH-How on earth is that thing so high up?\u201d\u201cEven with my bow, I can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cMagic also can\u2019t reach it? And what is a bomb? You mean that explosion?\u201d\u201cDamn, that\u2019s cowardly! Come down!\u201dHey, Leo! What are you talking about?It\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to come down because it\u2019s acting cowardly. You brainless idiot!That\u2019s why you lose to that nerd.Hmm? Nerd?Could it be that guy?! Are you using a knowledge cheat?Yes! That\u2019s it. He\u2019s a reincarnated person too. (T/N:- it\u2019s not like she can do anything now knowing that.)How far do you want to keep getting in my way!\u201cAmy, this is bad. Let\u2019s get out of here!\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dBy the time Karl-sama told me and I realized it, it was too late.Enemy soldiers have surrounded us.Then they tied us up and took us away.Ah!What\u2019s going to happen to me?Even though I finally became the Saint of Charity.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aNow that I think about it, the words of the Saints of Charity are powerful.I tried it out on the guard who was bringing us our food, and after a few sweet nothings, he dropped off his guard in no time.At first, they put me in a kind of small room, but soon they moved me to a decent room.Besides, when we all asked him to let us talk to that nerd, he readily agreed.It pisses me off, but it seems like I should make that guy fall for me too.There were a lot of things, but at first, he just looked at me and flinched, so I figured there\u2019s plenty of room for a little coaxing, right?And so everyone was gathered in one room.Yeah, I\u2019m glad everyone is okay.As expected, I\u2019m a prisoner of war now, though I don\u2019t want to be tied up, I don\u2019t have a choice, do I?It would be a problem if I asked for more here and was told that it was no good.Then I waited for a while and that nerd came into the room.And Karl-sama immediately complained.\u201cHey. Commoner. Release us now. It\u2019s treason to rise up against the royal family!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Do you think you can do this to me, the Saint of Charity?\u201dOops, not good. I was about to start talking like I usually do.That guy should also fall for me, right.\u201cHey? More importantly, unravel the rope?\u201dI smiled at him like I did when we first met and told him about it.Fufu, now you are done for.\u201cI would like to confirm something to Your Highness. The one to secretly sell Anastasia-sama to the Empire and forged the Jade seal was Your Highness, right?\u201dHuh? What is this guy? Did you ignore me despite being a nerd? It\u2019s irritating!\u201cAmy-sama, did you know that story? No, was it Amy-sama who instigated it?\u201dHe talks back to me, but it\u2019s about that woman.I\u2019m kind of pissed, so I\u2019m going to bully you.\u201cHmph, isn\u2019t it obvious? That woman is there to be messed up and become a weapon of the empire. I\u2019d rather you praise me for doing the right thing.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dSee! Everyone is agreeing with me.That\u2019s right. I\u2019m right!Even so, I still kept messing around with us, so I told him.\u201cBut that woman has fallen into the hands of the Empire. She\u2019s probably enchanted by the Demon Sword by now, you know?\u201dWhen I said that, he was silent. Serves you right!\u201cI knew it. That woman must have had enough darkness in her heart to be attracted to a magic sword.\u201dKarl-sama agreed with me after all.Fufu? How is it! There is no one on your side!\u201cEh? Are you okay? Why did you believe in the Demon Sword so easily?\u201d\u201cAmy, the Saint, is saying it! There can be no mistake!\u201dHe argues with me, but Karl-sama affirms me.As I was comfortably listening to Karl-sama\u2019s words, the door suddenly opened and that woman entered.Eh? What do you mean by this!?\u201cWhat? Anastasia?\u201d\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201cIt has been a long time, Your Highness. And everyone else, too. You seem to be as full of energy as ever.\u201dWhen the woman sarcastically greets us when we\u2019re surprised, she clings to that nerd.What the hell! It\u2019s like she\u2019s a prostitute!What\u2019s more, she calls herself a princess! And the commoner is her fianc\u00e9, also they are in love with each other even though it\u2019s a political marriage.It\u2019s ridiculous. Anyone can do these self-proclaimed acts!When I thought so, the nerd snatched the \u300eStaff of Divine Guidance\u300f from my waist.\u201cHey! Give it back! That\u2019s mine!\u201d\u201cN-No way, this staff is!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! It\u2019s a staff for me, a Saint! You, who is not the chosen one, are not allowed to have it! Give it back!\u201d\u201cA Saint, huh? You?\u201d\u201cYes! I was recognized by this \u300eStaff of Divine Guidance\u300f! That\u2019s why I\u2019m a Saint of Charity!\u201dEven though I say so, this nerd is looking at me with suspicion.\u201cThen, what happened to the blessing? Without that, you wouldn\u2019t qualify as a Saint.\u201d\u201cW-Well, that\u2019s that. I became a Saint.\u201dOh, geez. I\u2019m pissed. What is wrong with you!Isn\u2019t it your fault for stealing the event!And just when I thought he was staring at my staff, he pulls out some kind of rock. What on earth is he doing?As I was thinking that, the villainess took the liberty of grabbing my staff and touching it.Oh, hey! What are you doing touching my staff as if it\u2019s natural?Don\u2019t you know that it\u2019s not something that the villainess is allowed to touch?What if weird germs get attached to it?Then Karl-sama and that nerd shouted at the same time.But still, calling me a witch is beyond rude!\u201cGuaaaaaa\u201dThen Leo tore off the rope and attacked that woman.Amazing! As expected!At once, that nerd covered up for that woman but was blown away. And isn\u2019t he covered in blood?\u201cAllen! Allen!\u201dAhaha. I can hear her sorrowful screams which calms my irritation.Serves them right!Still, that nerd who is hiding that woman is \u2026 hmm. Well, not bad.He\u2019s going to die soon anyway, so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201cCome on! Let\u2019s get out of here!\u201d\u201cNo! My staff! Moreover, we have to put an end to that guy.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Ah no, no, it\u2019s better to let Amy escape.\u201dI can\u2019t believe that Karl-sama, who always listens to me, would say that!\u201cAmy, you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll stay behind to finish them and bring the staff back. Please, Your Highnesses, take care of Amy.\u201dBut if Leo says so, I guess it\u2019s safe to go?\u201cO-Okay, but you\u2019re definitely coming back alive, right?\u201dWhen I said that and prayed a little, Leo nodded deeply.Fufu. Since I, the Saint of Charity, prayed like this, Leo should be able to kill them and come back safely.That\u2019s right! I am the heroine and the Saint of Charity, so my word should be absolute!So it\u2019s okay!See ya.

Please![ O you who seek guidance! I recognize your strong desire and grant you strength. ]\u201cEh?\u201dAnd the next moment, a brilliant light enveloped my body.\u201cAh, ah, this, this is \u2026\u201dThe moment that light subsided, I was suddenly convinced.I pull out the piece of chair that is stuck in Allen\u2019s body and cast a spell.\u201cBuried in the ice are the sprouting seeds. Melted water is a blessing that brings life. O Holy ice, I command you in the name of Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett \u30fb Heal my Allen\u2019s wounds \u30fb Holy Ice Heal.\u201dI don\u2019t know why I know this magic. Why ice magic can even cure is also something I don\u2019t know.But I am convinced that I can save Allen in this way.Thus, my magic covered Allen\u2019s body with ice, and soon Allen\u2019s body was completely trapped in the ice.\u201cMy Lady! Allen-dono!\u201d\u201cTh-this is-\u201c\u201cI\u2019ll explain the situation later! Those guys are getting away. Get them now! I don\u2019t care if you have to kill them.\u201d\u201cHa-hah!\u201dThen the soldiers chased after the fleeing Crown Prince and the others. Afterwards, with father and others, who came later, I returned to my room with Allen, who I had put on ice.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\u201cWhy did you arrange a meeting? And what were the guards doing!?\u201d\u201cWell, about that. I don\u2019t know why, but when that woman said it to me, I felt like that for some reason.\u201dMy father is questioning the soldier who was on guard, but his answer is not making any sense.\u201cAt first, I laughed when that woman referred to herself as a Saint, but then I began to feel that she was right\u2026.Also, His Highness the Crown Prince, ah, the royal family of the Centraren Kingdom, said that it\u2019s natural to talk to the classmate from the same school\u2026.\u201d\u201cIs that why you had them meet?\u201d\u201cY-Yes.\u201dFather held his head and let the soldier leave.\u201cWhat the hell is going on? He would not have been foolish enough to make that decision. That\u2019s why I left it to him\u2026..\u201d\u201cFather, Allen called that woman a witch. From the looks of it, he was using a Blizzard Phoenix magic stone, so he was probably doing a character appraisal.\u201d\u201cWitch \u2026\u201dThen, after a pause, my father changed the subject.\u201cAnd Anna, what is this all about? Why did you put Allen on ice?\u201d\u201cThat is \u2026\u2026 I heard a voice from the staff that woman was holding, and then I was surrounded by light. Well, I don\u2019t know, but somehow I was convinced that if I did this, I could heal him.\u201dI look at the block of ice that enclosed Allen.\u201cIndeed, the wound seems to be healing, but\u2026\u2026\u201dYes, most of the wounds that were so severe have already closed up, and the pieces of the chair that may have remained in Allen\u2019s body seem to have been expelled from his body.\u201cI have never heard of ice healing magic. And what is with that staff?\u201d\u201cThat woman said that the staff was the sign of a Saint and that she was recognized by this staff, and had become a Saint.\u201d\u201cBut in Allen-kun\u2019s character appraisal, she was a witch.\u201d\u201cYes, maybe\u2026.\u201dFather thought for a while and then suggested to me.\u201cAnna, let\u2019s check your status. Something might have changed.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThus, I was to have my status appraised, and crystals for appraisal were brought to me. This is a very expensive magical tool, but every noble family has one of these in their house.Even without the adventurer\u2019s guild card, this crystal can be used to find out what blessings, skills, etc. one has.Of course, this could be done by registering with the guild, but aristocrats do not want the guild to have their information, so they do this to check for themselves.I held my hand over the crystal and there it appeared with surprising results.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500Name: Anastasia Clynel von RamslettAge: 17Blessings:\u3016Sky Knight\u3017\u3016Ice Saint\u3017Skills: \u3010Holy Ice Magic\u3011Place of residence: WishenLevel: 24Strength: GMagical Power: B\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u201cAh, umm?

Then immediately the ice shattered with a sound.\u201cAllen!\u201dI move my body, which is still not well, as hard as I can to get to Allen.His body was cold, but I could hear his heart beating, and as I held him tightly, I could feel the warmth slowly returning to his body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But it\u2019s kind of cold.It is cold, yet somehow it is not cold even though it should be cold. In fact, it feels warm.What is the meaning of this?I heard Anna calling me again.Then my body, which should have been cold, became warmer and warmer.This is?\u201cAllen!\u201dI was startled by the voice.When I opened my eyes, there in front of me was Anna with tears in her eyes and a relieved look on her face.\u201cHow? Dream?\u201d\u201cStupid. It can\u2019t be a dream. You\u2019re alive, Allen. I\u2019m glad. Allen!\u201dWith that said, the warmth of Anna who hugged me tightly was transmitted, and the nice scent of Anna spread all over my nose. And it was irresistible and lovely.Only then did I realize that my life was connected.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aAccording to Anna and the Duke, no, Gerhard-san, Anna healed my wounds. She said that all of a sudden she could hear voices and was able to do it.And she was given the blessing of\u3016Ice Saint\u3017, also the blessing of\u3016Ice Magic\u3017disappeared and she had the skill of \u3010Holy Ice Magic\u3011. I can imagine the cause for this, but just to be sure, I had her appraised.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u3016Sky Knight\u3017: The blessing of\u3016Knight\u3017 given to those who wish to protect people is evolved to the \u300eSky Knight sword\u300f. In addition to aptitude as a knight, aptitude for wind magic is greatly increased.\u3016Ice Saint\u3017: A woman of deep love and noble spirit who has been given a holy blessing and is a user of ice magic. She is able to handle holy power through the ice, and her aptitude for Holy Ice Magic is greatly increased. When given this blessing, the \u3010Holy Ice Magic\u3011 skill is granted, greatly increasing one\u2019s aptitude for Holy Ice Magic.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u3010Holy Ice Magic\u3011: The blessing or skill of ice magic evolves when its owner becomes the \u3016Ice Saint\u3017.

It completely encompasses the skill of \u3010Ice Magic\u3011.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u201cThat seems to be the case.\u201d\u201cA wo-woman like me is a saint\u2026.\u201dAnna\u2019s expression is one of pure bewilderment.\u201cMaybe, but Anna was blessed by the Spirit of Light, right? So, I think such a strong wish of Anna\u2019s was fulfilled by this \u300eStaff of Divine Guidance\u300f.\u201d\u201cI-Is that so?\u201dAnna still feels like it doesn\u2019t feel right when she is told that.\u201cBut thank you, Anna. You\u2019re the reason I\u2019m still alive.\u201d\u201cUh, yeah. Yes, it is. I thought my heart was going to stop, you know?\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want that to happen again, okay!\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cOh, if you understand it, that\u2019s fine then.\u201dAnna was so cute when she said that, that I hugged her again.\u201cAh, cough. It\u2019s fine that you and your fianc\u00e9 are getting along so well, but can we move on?\u201dI had just started flirting with Anna, but Gerhard-san stopped me.Gununu.\u201cSo, what\u2019s this thing about witches?\u201d\u201cYes. When I appraised that woman, Amy von Brayes, I saw the blessing of\u3016Witch of Envy\u3017. And the effect is to increase her attractiveness as a woman, and also her aptitude for the skill \u3010Kotodama\u3011 increases.\u201d\u201c\u3010Kotodama\u3011, is it? I\u2019ve heard of it in fairy tales, but it\u2019s a very nasty skill when it\u2019s used in real life. In short, if you say something to someone who reacts even slightly to your tricks, you can corrupt them in the blink of an eye.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean that she has been enticing those five people like that for a long time?\u201dAnna said with a frown.\u201cNo, I think she probably only recently acquired that power. Moreover, if she had it before, the academy would have been in a lot worse shape.\u201dHowever, in light of the strange situation at that school, it is undeniable that she may have activated the weak \u3010Kotodama\u3011 skill without any blessing or skill.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Certainly, it\u2019s no wonder that that woman would want all men to serve her. And that means Allen, too!\u201dPerhaps imagining the situation, cold air began to leak from Anna\u2019s body.(T/N:- Woah, yandere Anna. Looking forward to Manga. (\u2764 \u03c9 \u2764))\u201cA-Anna, that\u2019s not the case. Rest assured? I\u2019m just Anna\u2019s.\u201dWhile saying that, somehow cold sweat runs down my back.I would never tell her that I didn\u2019t think she was dangerous at first because she looked good that time.I don\u2019t have a desire for ruin in the first place, and above all, I\u2019m sure I would hurt Anna if I said such a thing.\u201cOh, yeah. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right, isn\u2019t it? There\u2019s no way Allen would fall for a woman like that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. My only beloved woman is Anna.\u201dI said that then took Anna\u2019s hand and looked into her eyes. Anna\u2019s expression suddenly relaxes and a slight blush appears on her cheeks.\u201cAh, cough. Are you two good?\u201d\u201c\u201dAh.\u201d\u201dWe were brought back from our worlds again.\u201cOh well. Anyway, that witch is not good. If we leave someone with such dangerous abilities unattended, the world will be in trouble. I will issue a strong order once again.\u201dGerhard-san left the room when he said that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 90": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Villager A Wants to Save the Villainess no Matter What!Chapter 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayUnfortunately, Amy and the others who escaped eventually got away.Amy apparently demonstrated her abilities as a witch to the fullest and even made some soldiers and residents listen to what she had to say by showering them with strong words.Of course, the Ramslett army did not sit back and watch.They immediately sent out a search party and succeeded in capturing Oscar, but lost sight of Amy, the Crown Prince, and Markus when they entered the forest and missed them.I don\u2019t know if those guys will make it through the forest in one piece, but if I could, I would like to see them continue to be preyed upon by demons and beasts.No, I know it\u2019s a terrible thing to say, but Amy is just too dangerous.Also, through the Adventurer\u2019s Guild, we put a bounty of 300 million on Amy with the condition of Dead or Alive, that is, it\u2019s fine even if she is killed, and that she be wanted as a witch who manipulates others with her words. She doesn\u2019t have to be caught alive, but it also means that the adventurer will definitely take her head and kill her in effect.Even in this world of colourful hairs, I don\u2019t recall seeing anyone with pink hair other than her, so maybe she\u2019ll get caught.On the other hand, it turned out that those who have been brainwashed with \u3010Kotodama\u3011 can be restored by Anna\u2019s \u3010Holy Ice Magic\u3011.Its name is Holy Ice Awakening.When this magic is used on someone who has been driven crazy by Amy\u2019s words, their head is literally put on ice. The ice breaks immediately, but that is all it takes to release the person from being under the influence of Kotodama.Well, in short, it\u2019s magic that seems to reproduce the effect that freezes your head by the dialogue \u201ccool your head\u201d that you sometimes see in manga and anime.Incidentally, Anna says that this can be done over a wide area using a blizzard.What can I say, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only one who thought I was going to sleep forever before I woke up.Well, after all that happened, our Kingdom of Ramslett has decided to hold a National Foundation Day ceremony.In preparation for this, I took the Buitor Rev. to the appropriate city in the Est Empire and the United Kingdom of Norsane and requested the Adventurer\u2019s Guild to deliver King Ramslett\u2019s letter addressed to the diplomatic offices of each country.The reason is that these two countries cannot be reached from our Ramslett Kingdom without passing through the Centraren Kingdom.Also, since the Kingdom of Xaus and the Kingdom of Westerdale are on the border, we delivered a letter to the border town of Xaus and to the port town of Westerdale where regular ships operate, from where an envoy was dispatched.The content, of course, is a notice of the founding of the country and a request for approval.In response, the Kingdom of Xaus, which had just recently been completely crushed, recognized the Kingdom of Ramslett on the condition that a peace treaty is signed.Naturally, no response has yet been received from the other countries, but we expect that the Est Empire and the United Kingdom of Norsane will probably approve, while Westerdale will dilly-dally and postpone the response.The reason we expect the Est Empire and the United Kingdom of Norsane to approve is simple: the enemy of my enemy is my friend.These two countries see the Centraren Kingdom as an enemy.And if the important southern part of the enemy country becomes independent, the power of the enemy will be reduced without doing anything.For them, there would be no such delicious story other than this.Of course, as for me, I can\u2019t forgive the Est Empire for messing with Anna, but the current Kingdom of Ramslett can\u2019t afford to expand its front to that extent.Besides, I have killed the two masterminds, so let\u2019s call it good once and for all.Next time they try to mess with me again, though, I\u2019ll turn the Imperial City into a pile of rubble!And the reason I expect the Kingdom of Westerdale to postpone their reply is because they are currently friends of the Centraren Kingdom.Nevertheless, if the Kingdom of Centraren were to fall, we believe that the Kingdom of Westerdale would be relentless in its drive to carve up the western territories.At that time, It would not be in their best interest to cut off the path to diplomatic relations with Ramslett. But that does not mean that they can\u2019t pick a fight with the Kingdom of Centraren right now.If so, then logically their response should be the postponement of their reply.In short, the relationship between nations is not beautiful.Jeez.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aThe day of the National Foundation Day ceremony arrived. The square in front of the palace in Wishen, our royal capital, was crowded with people. Although we were holding a National Foundation Day ceremony, we were still in the middle of a war of independence with the Centraren Kingdom, so we did not plan a large-scale parade. The only thing to be done is for Gerhard-san to read out the Declaration of Nation\u2019s Foundation and the introduction of the new King and his royal family.That said, since this town was originally the capital of the Duke of Ramslett, the rulers have not changed, but in short, it is a kind of clean distinction.And the other thing is to announce the engagement of me and Anna.Therefore, I am dressed in the ceremonial, glittering military uniform of the Ramslett Royal Army, and Anna is dressed like a princess in her gleaming attire.Ah, no, Anna was originally a Duke\u2019s daughter and is now the first princess of the Kingdom of Ramslett, so she being a princess is right.For me, wearing a uniform is more familiar to me, so I have no other intention.And I think Anna looks great in her dress. She\u2019s really beautiful.Also on Anna\u2019s left ring finger, she still wears the \u300eSubstitute ring\u300f I gave her. Anna said she wanted this one, so it became her engagement ring.By the way, my ring is an ordinary ring, but I had it specially made to look exactly like the \u300eSubstitute ring\u300f.Well, the ceremony went smoothly and Gerhard-san, who became the King, read the Declaration of Nation\u2019s Foundation.The content pointed out the tyranny of the royal family of the Kingdom of Centraren and denied its legitimacy. In response, the Duke of Ramslett stood up as the protectors of their people.It was a good speech, conventional but typical of the Ramslett family.\u201cAnd one more good news from me to you all. It\u2019s about my daughter, the first princess Anastasia.\u201dIt seems that Gerhard-san has finally reached the stage of introducing our engagement.\u201cI am pleased to announce the engagement of my daughter Anastasia to Allen, the hero who defended our land of Ramslett from the invaders.\u201dThis elicited a shout of joy from the audience, but at the same time, a disappointed \u201ceh\u201d could be heard.However, Gerhard-san continues his speech.\u201cBlessed by the God of Wind, Allen is a hero among heroes who has demonstrated his exceptional talents in numerous battles, single-handedly destroying 80% of the enemy army. It is no exaggeration to say that our kingdom has thus received the blessings of God.\u201dThe moment they heard this, the audience got excited at once. After all, the hero who led the war to victory seems to be popular.\u201cAllen will marry Anastasia and take the name Allen von Ramslett. I want everyone to celebrate this joyous event.\u201dWhen Gerhard-san finally said that and finished his speech, the assembled audience erupted in jubilation. Anna and I waved to the audience from the podium.I see. Is this the scenery that people on this side see? Will I ever get used to it?\u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but mutter to myself when I saw Anna smiling and waving next to me.\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. I didn\u2019t expect such a blessing. It\u2019s all thanks to Allen\u2019s hard work. Thank you.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you. But I\u2019m kind of embarrassed.\u201dYeah. I have to get used to it. I\u2019ve decided to stand next to Anna. I\u2019m not going to shy away from something like this.Anna smiled gently at my words.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aAnd after the rather simple National Foundation Day ceremony, it was time for a ball at the palace. Here came the former Centraren nobles who had been vassals to the Ramslett Kingdom and the second princess from the Kingdom of Xaus.This second princess is talking to Friedrich-san a lot, but Friedrich-san seems to be treating it appropriately. That is probably the case.By the way, since I can\u2019t dance very well, and Anna hasn\u2019t recovered yet, it\u2019s difficult to attend the party for a long time, so we\u2019ll just say hello.And we who attended the party, with both of us arm in arm, are dealing with the invited guests.I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m handling it well, but Anna\u2019s response is magnificent.Anna is smiling and chatting with me, but she is turning down all dance invitations with me as an excuse.\u201cAnna-sama, Allen-kun!\u201dThen, two familiar people arrived. They are Margaret and Isabella.They had both returned to the territory when the school was closed, and this time they had forced their parents to attend this ceremony.\u201cCongratulations on your engagement!\u201d\u201cCongratulations!\u201d\u201cOh, thank you.\u201d\u201cThank you very much.\u201dI think I was able to laugh naturally and thank them for their blessings.Thinking back, they were both friends of Anna\u2019s, but they treated me without any barriers.I guess they are also the reason why I have happy memories of the school.\u201cStill, Allen-kun, you really went through with it. You crossed many dangerous paths just to win Anna\u2019s heart. And now that the Duke, or should I say His Majesty, has recognized you, you\u2019ve created your own branch of the Ramslett family, and have been adopted as a son-in-law, what more could you ask for?\u201d\u201cBut even after all he did. Allen-san is amazing. And I\u2019m amazed that you can fly.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cEven so, Anna-sama, you are really loved, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Please tell me the secret to being loved.\u201d\u201cWha? Wait, hey? You guys?\u201dAnna\u2019s face turned red and she flinched when she was told that. Cute.\u201cI see. That\u2019s the gap.\u201d\u201cI understand, Anna-sama, we will learn from you too!\u201d\u201cEh? Margaret? Isabella? Hey, Allen, too. Say something.\u201dAnna who asks me for help is also cute.\u201cAnna is cute. I love you.\u201d\u201cWha! S-Stupid, in a place like this.\u201d\u201cAnna, I love you. I love you the most in the world.\u201d\u201cUgh, silly\u2026\u2026 me too\u2026\u2026\u201dThe two who heard this shouted with glee.Then, after a while, we were allowed to leave and the long day from the National Foundation Day ceremony was over.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 91": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Villager A Wants to Save the Villainess no Matter What!Chapter 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA short time after the National Foundation Day ceremony, information came in that the Centraren Kingdom had completely lost the Bruseni region. Considering the speed at which the information was transmitted, it is safe to assume that it was probably around the time of the founding ceremony.Well, it\u2019s a natural result. They brought troops from Bruseni, which was in balance, and attacked Ramslett.To be honest, I can only think of it as a fool.Another piece of information that came in was that the Second Prince\u2019s faction of the Centraren Kingdom had raised an army in the north with the Second Prince as the flag.On the other hand, unfortunately, the Crown Prince who survived with Amy returned to the royal capital and is ready to gather support mainly in the west and counter these movements around the royal capital.And as for us, we\u2019re going to sit tight for the time being.Apart from that, We have no intention of meddling in this conflict. We just need to be careful with Amy, who has become a witch, and are prepared to assassinate her if necessary. We don\u2019t know what she will do to us if we leave her alone.Oh yeah. Also, a messenger came from the Est Empire saying that they recognize our independence.It is the establishment of diplomatic relations between the country with the person who killed the Crown Prince and the country that kidnapped the princess.By the way, there is no reply from Norsane or Westerdale yet.As for Westerdale, it is as expected. But for Norsane, it is possible that it is just delayed due to geographical factors, but it is also possible that it is not.Assuming that Norsane is supporting the Second Prince\u2019s faction, the state approval would make the relationship with the Ramslett Kingdom strange when the Second Prince comes to power.It is only hypothetical, but if Norsane were to try to exert a strong influence on Centraren while supporting the Second Prince, then without the territory of Ramslett, the Second Prince would certainly need substantial food aid from Norsane.However, the details are not well understood at this point, so we will have to wait and see.Now, to change the subject, I was able to ask Oscar, who had his wound healed and got his head cooled with Anna\u2019s magic, about what was going on.The conversation then went something like this.\u201cOscar. Why does that woman have that staff? And don\u2019t you know that she became a witch?\u201dAnna asks Oscar, who is restrained in the interrogation room. He then began to speak without any sign of resistance.\u201cAmy suddenly said there is a staff for her in an abandoned church somewhere in this country. So I ordered a group of soldiers to go explore an abandoned church in the woods near the royal capital. And there was really a staff just like the one she described.\u201dI see. So Amy has also finally come up with the idea of getting ahead of the time, is that it?As expected, it was impossible for me alone to search for an abandoned church that I didn\u2019t even know where it was, and this staff was a very low priority for me at the time.If I think about it now, it would have been better if I had collected it first, but I was thinking of proceeding accordingly while prioritising the scenario and without making any big moves to stand out. To be honest, I thought that I had proceeded perfectly, but now that I think about it, there were probably quite a few things that were left out.\u201cSo when Amy touched the staff, there was a light emanating from it. Then Amy\u2019s body emitted a black aura or an ominous aura, perhaps. Something like that overflowed from Amy\u2019s body. It was like the apocalypse you see in church frescoes. It was like that. I thought this was bad\u2026..\u201dOscar looks down once in pain.\u201cBut I still liked Amy. Unlike the women around me who only saw my face, blessings, and my family\u2019s money, she understood my problems. Though I don\u2019t express it, I was really worried about my face, but she understood and sympathized with me without me saying a word\u2026. Because she was such a woman, I wanted to be with her even if I had to give up my position, and even if I couldn\u2019t, I wanted to be there to support her.\u201dWith that said, Oscar bites his lips.\u201cBut when you said she was a witch, it kind of made sense. It wasn\u2019t that she understood me without saying anything, but that Amy was anticipating my problems\u2026..\u201dOscar said that with a forlorn look on his face. The truth is that he didn\u2019t know about it because of the witch\u2019s power, but there is no doubt he was doubtful from the very beginning.Oscar then looked at Anna with a serious expression and apologized to her in a different serious tone than usual.\u201cPrincess Anastasia, I apologize for my many disrespectful behaviours at the school. I know that my apology will not be forgiven, but if this head will bring you any comfort, I will gladly offer it to you.\u201dI see. There seemed to be some doubts about Oscar and Markus, but it seems that was the case.That may mean that Markus has also been manipulated.\u201cOscar, I accept that apology. It is now in the past. Besides, I am happy now as a result. I have nothing against you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m grateful.\u201dOscar\u2019s acknowledgement of his wrongdoing and Anna\u2019s acceptance of his apology marked the end of her relationship with Oscar.Then I asked him to leave with plenty of words about Amy, who is now a witch, and how his will can be twisted as it is now when he hears those words with some kind of favouritism.Oh, of course, as is the custom in this world, I heard that we received plenty of ransom money.He is the eldest son of the wealthy Wimlet Marquis. I haven\u2019t heard how much, but I\u2019m sure it was a lot of money.Now, let\u2019s return the topic to the Kingdom of Centraren.So the Kingdom of Centraren can no longer afford to be concerned about us, and a truce has been reached without a hitch.We have enough production to feed our people, so we have no intention of expanding our territory any further. Therefore, we have not attacked Centraren, and temporary peace has been restored between the two countries.And as for me, I\u2019m working again today. It seems that if I officially marry Anna, they will leave some territory to Anna and me, so I\u2019m undergoing an apprenticeship that also serves as a study for that.Well, it\u2019s not very interesting because it\u2019s all paperwork, but it has an appeal because I didn\u2019t have any knowledge of how to read a ledger book.Then, after lunch with Anna, I would work again, and the day\u2019s work would end around snack time.After that, it\u2019s training with Anna.Anna has recently recovered enough to run, if only lightly, so I\u2019ve been able to spend some quality time with her, swinging my sword a bit and practising dance, which is not my favourite thing to do.By the way, today was my least favourite dance.For the time being, I managed to finish without stepping on Anna\u2019s foot, so let\u2019s praise myself that it is big progress.Well, it\u2019s hard to say that I\u2019ve improved, but I\u2019m still one step better.After spending the day in this way, it was time for dinner. Lately, we have been eating dinner together as a family, and today I am sitting around the table with the Royal Family of the Ramslett Kingdom and my mother.Today\u2019s main dish was beef fillet steak. The meat was so tender that it melted on the tongue, so it must have been high-quality meat.And so, after enjoying an exquisite dinner, Anna opened her mouth.\u201cBy the way, Allen. Do you know what day it is today?\u201d\u201cEh? Umm\u2026.\u201dShe may be referring to some kind of anniversary, but I have no recollection of it.In the first place, wasn\u2019t this the time last year when I wasn\u2019t even allowed to talk to them yet?When I was impatient, Anna gave me a dumbfounded look.Not good, did I offend her by forgetting any anniversary somehow?For a moment, I thought so, but Anna smiled and opened her mouth.\u201cAllen, happy birthday!\u201d\u201cEh?\u201dGerhard-san, Elisabeth-san, Friedrich-san, and mother congratulate me, who was surprised.\u201cT-Thank you?\u201d\u201cHey, Allen. Why the question mark? Oh, jeez. Here, this one\u2019s from me.\u201dWith that, Anna presented me with a beautifully embroidered handkerchief. The motifs were two black and white dragons, a spirit, and Buitor, which were combined to look like a coat of arms.\u201cThis, did Anna?\u201d\u201cOh. Well, you know, when I couldn\u2019t move much, at that time. So, umm, how is it?\u201d\u201cThank you. It\u2019s very nice. I will treasure it.\u201dWhen I said this, Anna looked relieved.\u201cI heard from mother-in-law, Katerina, that Allen doesn\u2019t like to celebrate himself too lavishly. So I did it like this\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, yeah. Thank you. I\u2019m not very good at balls like the last one, so I\u2019m very happy.\u201d\u201cOh, well, that\u2019s good to know.\u201dWith that, Anna gave me a beautiful smile that I wanted to look at forever.I also received gifts from everyone else, and for the first time, I experienced a birthday celebrated by someone other than my mother.Ah, I see.Is this what it\u2019s like to have a growing family?It\u2019s very\u2026.good.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m happy to have both Karl-sama and Markus with me.\u201dI said this with an upward glance, then looked down a little and said with determination.\u201cLet\u2019s go! For both of them too!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cWe must protect Amy for both of them.\u201dI nodded at their words and managed to escape back to the royal capital with my life.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aOh, God. What\u2019s really going on?Why is the second prince escaping when I\u2019ve just become a Saint of Charity? What\u2019s more, the struggle for succession is happening at a time like this!Be prepared northern aristocrats who oppose me!Also, I heard that the front with the Est Empire is being pushed back somehow. What\u2019s going on?Are the soldiers in this country a bit feckless after all?That\u2019s it! I came up with a good thing.It\u2019s a bit of a challenge, but let\u2019s go with this strategy.If so, I have to go to ask Karl-sama for help as soon as possible.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\u201cThat\u2019s great of Amy to take it upon herself to get involved in this kind of activity.\u201d\u201cReally, since becoming the Saint of Charity, Amy has grown so fast that I think we will be left behind!\u201d\u201cOh no. It\u2019s not like that. That\u2019s too many compliments. Besides, I\u2019m a saint of charity, so this much is only natural.\u201dFufu. I don\u2019t think I can capture any more, but I\u2019m getting more and more favourable feedback from both of you.\u201cWell, Amy, here we are.\u201dWith that said, Karl-sama escorted me into a large room.Fufu, there are a lot of soldiers here.Karl-sama, facing the soldiers, started giving a speech.\u201cThank you all for gathering here. As you know, our country has the Est Empire in the east, the rebel former Duke Ramslett in the south, and in the north, my foolish brother, who has been tricked into rebellion by the rebel Duke Schleistein.\u201dFufu. That\u2019s just like Karl-sama, isn\u2019t it? His speech is so cool too.\u201cBut it is because of your efforts that the royal capital and its people are able to live in peace!\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201d\u201dUoooooooo\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201cSo there! Our King\u2019s beloved Saint, Amy, has come to encourage you. She has offered to encourage each of you out of her compassionate heart. Please take your turn, line up, and speak with Amy.\u201d\u201c\u201d\u201d\u201dUoooooooo\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201dFufu, how is it? This is Operation Saint, where you can come to see me!The soldiers have already lined up in plain sight. Now all that is left is to handle this like a handshake event.\u201cI-I\u2019m Daniel. I\u2019m a knight apprentice. U-Umm, you look beautiful.\u201d\u201cWell, Daniel-sama. You are so good. Being an apprentice is hard, isn\u2019t it? Please do your best.\u201d\u201cYes! I\u2019ll do my best!\u201d\u201cThen next!\u201d\u201cWait a minute. I will give my blessing to Daniel-sama.\u201dSo I shook the hand of this dumb guy named Daniel and looked at him with upturned eyes.Then, cute. He got all red in the blink of an eye.\u201cAmy, the Saint of Charity, is always rooting for you. Please protect everyone. Daniel-sama.\u201dDaniel seemed dreamy as he left. After that, Daniel was a total fan of mine.Well, next!\u201cI-I\u2019m Oliver. I\u2019m a knight apprentice. Oh, well, you look nice.\u201dFrom here on out, it was pretty much the same conversation over and over again. It took a while, but it doesn\u2019t matter when you think you are dealing with potatoes.Plus, they\u2019re knights. Thanks to the fact that they\u2019re properly trained, they\u2019re a little bit strong, but it helps that there are no creeps.I don\u2019t think I would have been able to do the handshake event for such a long time if I had been dealing with creepy fat guys.\u201cAmy, thank you for your hard work.\u201d\u201cOh, Amy, that was great. I see the morale of the soldiers has been boosted considerably.\u201d\u201cOh no, I just did what I could do.\u201d\u201cYour humbleness is also wonderful, Amy.\u201dI shook hands with various soldiers every day. Then it was over in no time.Moreover, I\u2019ve also healed the injured, and I\u2019m already the beautiful and gentle Saint of Charity Amy-sama among the soldiers.During this time, a knight apprentice was seriously discussing how to help Amy-sama, you know?It made me laugh. I think of you guys as nothing more than potatoes.At the very least, work for me, will you?Even so, the power of the Saint of Charity is really convenient, isn\u2019t it?In the game, prayer and words weakened the last boss, the villainess. And now \u2026\u2026 oh, Leo should have defeated her, so it won\u2019t happen this time.Leo \u2026 you\u2019ll come back properly, right?\u30fb\u30fb\u30fbOh no. I got sidetracked.After this, there\u2019s the church. If I can get them to recognize me, there won\u2019t be anyone in the country who won\u2019t recognize me as a Saint.But you know what? They are stubborn.They say no because I haven\u2019t performed any miracles, or shown any proof.How can they not see that my existence is proof?It\u2019s hard to deal with people who are not very smart.

After all, she is the villainess.I\u2019m sure there are a lot of things that are confusing but wait and see.We\u2019ll make it easier soon.When I was thinking about that, I got some unbelievable news.Eh? The territory of the villainess was recognized as a country? What\u2019s more, the kingdom of Xaus, which was supposed to be fighting them, recognized it and sent a princess to the ceremony?And on top of that, the engagement of that nerd and the villainess was announced, was it?Huh? You\u2019ve got to be kidding me!At that time, Markus burst into our room.\u201cYour Highness! Something terrible happened.\u201d\u201cWhat happened Markus?\u201d\u201cLeo is!

How dare you!\u201cKarl-sama! Leo! Avenge Leo!\u201dAll right. I\u2019ll kill them for sure.That\u2019s right. We should have just killed the villainess and the nerd quickly.I\u2019m a Saint of Charity and was too nice to them, so those scum took advantage of me.(T/N:- No, you\u2019re an idiot.)I will not fail again!\u201cI know, Amy.

You are very beautiful as always..\u201d\u201cWell, thank you. You\u2019re very good.\u201dFor the time being, I answered as the Saint of Charity.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?! What\u2019s the matter?!\u201d\u201cHah. The front against the Est Empire has collapsed and all of Bruseni has been lost.\u201d\u201cWhat! What did you say!? Didn\u2019t the report say that Cardassia wouldn\u2019t fall, even if it was pushed back somewhat?!\u201d\u201cIt seems that there was a secret passageway that we did not know about, which was used to attack us from within the city walls.\u201d\u201cTch, then?\u201d\u201cHah. The sudden appearance of enemy soldiers in the castle confused our side, and we lost half of our men, who were crushed.\u201d\u201cHalf of them, you say?\u201d\u201cHah. And the Est Imperial Army, which has defeated the whole of Bruseni, is now further organizing its forces. It is likely that they will soon begin their march towards Lurden.\u201d\u201cDamn.\u201dNo way? Are you saying that the royal capital will fall even if the villainess is not there?But I, the Saint of Charity, am here, you know? Yes, that\u2019s right. we will not lose.I get it.

If we had continued to attend school, we would have graduated.So far, the Ramslett Kingdom is at peace itself, but there has been a great deal of activity in Centraren.The Est empire marched westward to Lurden, the royal capital of the Centraren Kingdom, as in the game.As in the game, the towns along the way were quickly overrun and the army closed in on Lurden, but unlike in the game, Lurden held on without falling.According to reports, Lurden\u2019s soldiers have turned into dead soldiers and are making a desperate resistance.(T/N:- Like zombies but alive.)Even when they die, they would shout \u2018long live the saint\u2019 and die. So I guess what I had feared had happened after all.It seems that the men are being holed up in order, as expected, and the male spies who might have met that woman were all taken down.However, not everything seems to be going well.In some cases, the men who have been entrapped in this way can be used as a foothold to entrap their families and lovers, but there will also be those who will be antagonistic.Now it\u2019s as if a new cult has emerged in the royal capital, with Amy as the Saint of Charity, and it has spread from the Crown Prince to the nobility and soldiers, mainly in the royal court, and is gradually spreading to the city.However, the Church does not recognize Amy as a saint.They are asking for evidence of everything, but I don\u2019t understand why they haven\u2019t done something that should be readily apparent by checking the status.But from the way she spoke at that time, she seemed convinced that she had received the blessing of the Saint of Charity, the same as the heroine of the game.I don\u2019t know if Amy is unaware of such a simple thing or if she is knowingly keeping a lid on it and ignoring it.But either way, Amy is already crazy and I don\u2019t know how many people\u2019s lives will be ruined by that woman if we let her go.In the worst-case scenario, it may become necessary to have Anna recognized by the church as the Ice Saint.However, if that were to happen, it could be said that Anna should be placed under the protection of the church. Of course, this may not happen, but it would certainly complicate matters since a saint is a symbol of authority in the church.I would like to get rid of Amy as soon as possible, but unfortunately, it is frustrating that things are not going that easily.First of all, given the current national strength of the Ramslett Kingdom, there is no way to face the Est Empire. If I bombed them, I might be able to win a small scale battle, but we don\u2019t have enough soldiers or bureaucrats.If we go to war in such a situation, we will end up exhausting the people unnecessarily, and there will be nothing to be gained for either side.That said, if we side with the Est Empire and Centraren falls, we\u2019ll be bordering the Est Empire, and that\u2019s not good for us.In the first place, It is a bad idea to lend a hand to one side and meddle with the other when the enemy and the potential enemy are fighting.Then what do we do?It is the enemy of my enemy is my friend theory.If we can\u2019t move, we just have to get someone who has the same immediate interests as us to move.That\u2019s why I came to Kielburg, the largest city in the northern part of the Centraren Kingdom, with the Buitor Rev. This area is the stronghold of the Second Prince\u2019s faction ruled by Duke Schleistein, and the Second Prince himself is said to be here.In short, we want to talk to this Second Prince\u2019s faction and get rid of the Crown Prince and Amy.I used \u3010Concealment\u3011 to get into the town without any problems, and after a quick check of the town gossip, I broke into the duke\u2019s mansion.\u201cIs that, him\u2026.\u201dA slightly younger boy, who looks much like the crown prince, is walking around the mansion with a well-dressed elderly man. Perhaps that is the second prince, Ludwig and the Duke of Schleistein. As I recall, the second prince was three years younger than the Dauphin, so he must be 13 or 14 years old now.With that in mind, I got closer to them and listened.\u201cGregor-dono, I think we should immediately take revenge on that poisonous woman and stop my brother from being driven mad by her! I don\u2019t think Oscar\u2019s story is a lie either!\u201dGregor is the name of the Duke of Schleistein. I think his real name was Gregor Julius von Schleistein.\u201cYour Highness, I understand how you feel. But for now, let them fight it out. Besides, I think that Oscar\u2019s story is a bit exaggerated. That poisonous woman indeed has the power to drive others mad, but it is also possible that Oscar has realized the gravity of what he has done after all this time and is evading responsibility.\u201dI didn\u2019t know where he went after I returned him to Centraren, but it seems that Oscar was here.\u201cBut Gregor, if this continues then Lurden will fall into their hands as it is.\u201d\u201cThere, let the self-proclaimed Saint of Charity and her congregation do their best. Besides, if Lurden were to fall, Ramslett would have to move as well. At that time, the hero will come out too. And when they have taken it from them, we will take it back again.\u201d\u201cBut that would destroy Lurden! It is the people who will suffer because of it! Shouldn\u2019t royalty fight to protect their people!?\u201dThe Second Prince\u2019s tone heats up.Still, it is surprising. How did he grow up so straight with that stupid father and brother? Is it because of him as the teacher?\u201cYour Highness, please calm down. What you say is exactly right. However, without blessings, you do not have the fighting strength of your brother or the hero. It would be difficult for His Highness to make a significant change in the war situation even if you were to appear.\u201dI see. I had never heard about the second prince\u2019s blessing. I guess it was not kept as a secret, rather he never had it in the first place.That is why the Crown Prince with the blessing of\u3016Hero\u3017was given such preferential treatment.The Second Prince is not satisfied with the situation, and he is still trying to get at the Duke of Schleistein.\u201cGgh. But! But! How many of our people do you think will be sacrificed!?\u201d\u201cYour Highness, folks are numbers. It does not matter what happens to individuals. A government cannot be formed if a person in Your Highness\u2019s position is concerned about individual people. As I have said many times, as long as things are going well as a whole, that is all that matters.\u201d\u201cBut \u2026\u201d\u201cYour Highness, if Your Highness gives alms to one needy person, you must give to others as well. But it is impossible to do so. Is that clear? Be a king who sees the whole and not the individual and rules the country.\u201d\u201cI know. I know, but \u2026\u2026\u201dI see. He doesn\u2019t know what you are implying, so you\u2019re just changing the point.Crushing political enemies and adversaries at the expense of the people is quite different from saying that royalty should not give special treatment to certain individuals.However, the fact that he is unable to properly refute this is probably a sign that the second prince is not ready yet.\u201cYour Highness, your concern for your people is very admirable. But now is the time to endure.\u201d\u201cKuh, I know \u2026\u201dThe Second Prince said so with regret.Perhaps a country with the second prince at the top might be able to come to terms. And maybe the Duke of Schleistein can be dealt with if done well.Hmmm, now what to do?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m Allen. And will it be understood if I say that next year I will be Allen von Ramslett?\u201dI say so and bow.\u201cWhat!? Is the power of the Ramslett\u2019s treasured child so much?\u201d\u201cYou know about Est, right?\u201d\u201cGu~tsu, f-for what did you come here?\u201dSchleistein turned blue when I alluded to the fact that I had taken the head of the Crown Prince of the Est Empire.Alright, the first greeting went well.\u201cPlease be assured. I have been entrusted with a letter from His Majesty, King Gerhard of the Kingdom of Ramslett. Please accept this.\u201dI took an envelope out of my pocket and put it on the desk.\u201cMmm, this wax seal is \u2026 Hmm.\u201dDuke Schleistein then opens the letter and proceeds to read it. And immediately his brow wrinkled.\u201cDoes Allen-dono know about the contents of this letter?\u201d\u201cYes, I know.\u201d\u201cSo, is it true what is written here? This case about the witch.\u201d\u201cYes. It is all true. If that woman, who is now consumed by her own greed, is left unchecked, it is possible that everyone on this continent could be controlled. And that is easier said than done by force.\u201d\u201cMmm \u2026 Then what Oscar-dono said was\u2026\u201dDuke Schleistein mutters in a groaning voice.\u201cYes. The reason I let Oscar go with that information in the first place was to make him aware of the danger of that woman. The king of your country must have already been entrapped. Your intelligence unit must have suffered a heavy blow, too, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAs expected, he doesn\u2019t admit it, but silence would be the same as affirmation.\u201cWhat would you do? If you won\u2019t do it, we will do it. But our country has no intention of giving up what we have gained through bloodshed, you see?\u201dWhen I said this, Duke Schleistein looked at the letter with an even more stern expression.\u201cYou want us to move?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI answer shortly. There is no need to give extra information. You just have to guess at your own discretion.\u201cBut can we win? Even the elite of the Est Empire is having a hard time, you know?\u201d\u201cWe will also cooperate in that. We have the power to counter that woman\u2019s brainwashing.\u201d\u201cWhat exactly is that?\u201dDuke Schleistein has been trying to find out what\u2019s the inside story, but we can\u2019t reveal our cards just yet.\u201cThat, of course, I cannot reveal here and now.\u201d\u201cGgh, what are your demands?\u201d\u201cThe unconditional recognition by the Centraren Kingdom of the Kingdom of Ramslett as an equal.\u201dDuke Schleistein thought for a moment, then grunted at me.\u201cAre you asking us to be a shield against Est?\u201d\u201cNo no, no way. We just want to protect the territory that we have and the people who are under our protection now.\u201dWhen I said this, Duke Schleistein looked as if he was biting a bitter bug.\u201cIs that power a certainty?\u201d\u201cSome of our soldiers were entrapped by that woman, but we were able to restore them thanks to this power. It also helped in breaking the brainwashing of Oscar, who I believe is under your protection.\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026\u2026\u201dThen Duke Schleistein was stifled.\u201cCan you decide now?\u201dWhen I said this, Duke Schleistein shook his head.\u201cAssuming we move, what will Ramslett do?\u201d\u201cWe will restore the soldiers who have been driven mad by that woman.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not going to send out the troops? If you don\u2019t send out your troops, you can\u2019t be considered an equal, can you?\u201dDuke Schleistein was not willing to give up and tried to negotiate, but I\u2019m already on top.\u201cWhat do you say? This is a civil war in your country. Our country is offering to help you remove the greatest obstacle in the Second Prince\u2019s path, you know?\u201d\u201cKuh\u2026\u201d\u201cBesides, if our country is going to send troops, we would like to be paid for it. We are not so friendly as to send troops to your country\u2019s civil war without any reward. That would not be equal\u2026. wouldn\u2019t it? The southern part of the west border seems to be compatible with our industry. What do you think?\u201dWhen I said that, the Duke of Schleistein looked like he had given up.\u201cIf we lose any more breadbasket areas, we will lose our country.\u201dWhen he said this, Duke Schleistein sighed heavily.\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. I\u2019ll admit it. However, upon recognition, we will ask you to sign a peace treaty. The borders will be fixed as they are now. We will not tolerate any further territorial incursions.\u201d\u201cOf course. I am glad you understand. Now I can take the steps I don\u2019t want to take\u2026\u2026 No, it\u2019s nothing. Now, could you please send me a letter of reply?\u201dHearing my line, Duke Schleistein\u2019s face scrunched up and he looked a little pale.\u201cI-I see. You should wait for a while.\u201dWith that, the Duke ran his pen through the letter, sealed it with wax, and placed the letter on the table.I put on gloves, accept the envelope, wrap it in the cloth I brought and put it in my pocket.\u201cAlso, we have some preparations to make. We will probably be able to execute the operation at the beginning of the year when it will be coldest. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d\u201cW-Wait!\u201dWhen I finished saying what I needed to tell him, I quickly left the room. Then, after making sure there was no one around, I hid using \u3010Concealment\u3011.Oh, I\u2019m tired. It takes a lot of brainpower to negotiate, and it really stiffens my shoulders to speak in such an unfamiliar way.After spending the next three days at the Duke\u2019s residence gathering information, I returned home.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Duke Schleistein has accepted the terms.\u201d\u201cYes. We were able to negotiate peacefully, without any bellows or crossing swords.\u201d\u201cI see. Looks like you did well.\u201d\u201cThanks for your advice. Also, on my way home, I saw what\u2019s going on in the royal capital.\u201d\u201cWell, what was the state of the battle?\u201d\u201cThere is no siege, and for now the standoff seems to be continuing.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s a possibility that the empire won\u2019t be able to keep the expeditionary force and pull back. What about the effects of that witch?\u201d\u201cYes. From the looks of it, it seemed that 10 to 20% of the residents were already under her influence. She went out of her way to perform healing magic in public places, and also gave speeches. I think she probably put those who could produce such things under her control.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not good.\u201dGerhard-san\u2019s expression, which had been speaking so matter-of-factly, turned quite grim.Yes, to be clear, this situation is quite bad.Amy is originally very good looking because she is the heroine of the game. She is not just the best in her class, but one in 10,000, or something like that. And now, with the blessing of\u3016Witch of Envy\u3017, her attractiveness as a woman has been enhanced.And so far, the dim-witted Amy has been thinking and acting on her own, but what would happen if someone who knows how to showcase, write scenarios and move Amy, a superb pawn, gets added to the mix?No doubt, the number of people under Amy\u2019s influence will explode. The evidence of this is that in some of the speaking engagements I\u2019ve seen, there were quite a few women in attendance.Perhaps those who are producing it, regardless of what their original intentions were, are now completely under Amy\u2019s influence, and are now exercising their wisdom for the sake of the beloved \u201cSaint of Charity\u201d.\u201cSo what does Allen think of it?\u201d\u201cPerhaps, but I believe that Centraren will depose the Imperial army. After that, Duke Schleistein\u2019s Second Prince faction will fight for the defeat of the witch as a cause.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cSo I\u2019ll be making preparations with Anna in the meantime.\u201d\u201cPreparations, you say?\u201d\u201cYes. We are going to the Dungeon of the Wind Mountain to improve Anna\u2019s level. Because that\u2019s the best place to level up.\u201d\u201cMmm, be careful.\u201dI guess they trust me these days, and they don\u2019t object to these things anymore. Anna\u2019s strength has recovered to a level where it is no longer a problem, and I want to get her level up to at least 30 while I\u2019m at it.With the two blessings of\u3016Sky Knight\u3017and\u3016Ice Saint\u3017, Anna should be unstoppable by anyone if she properly levels up.I want to be ready this time for anything in the upcoming decisive battle.\u201cBut no matter how much you want to do it for Anna, don\u2019t do anything that will cause you to throw away your own life, okay?\u201d\u201cYes. That was the last time something like that is going to happen. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201dThus, I left Gerhard-san\u2019s office and went to a certain place in the town of Wishen.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\u201cUnseasonal snow is falling on the southern island. It will rain tomorrow because it\u2019s falling from the day before yesterday.\u201dGachariI said the same unintelligible words and the door was opened.Once inside, the small, six-tatami-mat store is crammed with dubious items, just as it was in Lurden.And at the counter in the back sits a familiar old woman.\u201cOh, welcome. What are you looking for today?\u201d\u201c10 large ice stones.\u201dIce spirit stone is a special item that amplifies ice-based magic by processing the magic stone of ice-based monsters.In the game, the magic stone of the sky dragon was used to make an oversized wind spirit stone, which was then used to inflict a wind magic ranged attack on the villainess who became the last boss and the Imperial Army.And it is at this Rulu store that they can do the processing for us. It costs quite a bit of money in addition to using precious magic stones. Of course, this is also used by those who pay the bills.\u201cAs many as 10 large ice stones? I\u2019m sorry, but I only have one large ice stone in stock. It\u2019s not so easy to get Blizzard Phoenix class magic stone, you know.\u201dI took 9 Blizzard Phoenix magic stones out of my magic bag and put them on the counter.\u201cCan you prepare with this? I need it as soon as possible.\u201dThis may have been the first time I saw the surprised face of this old woman, who usually does not change her complexion.\u201cI-It\u2019s fine. As expected of Allen von Ramslett-sama. I didn\u2019t think that little boy would become such a man. I\u2019ll have it ready in two weeks, 3.6 million Rams, is that okay? \u201c\u201cOh, thank you.\u201dRams is the unit of currency of the Ramslett Kingdom. The name, of course, comes from the Rams of Ramslett. At the moment, they are exchanged at the rate of 1 cent = 1 rams, but who knows what will happen in the future.But there is no guarantee that the currency of the Centraren Kingdom, which is certain to lose territory and power, will retain its current value.By the way, I have already converted almost all of my cent assets to rams assets.I\u2019ve also rewritten my affiliation as an adventurer to Wishen, so I don\u2019t have to worry about not having the cent assets.And so I left the Rulu store.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Come on, Anna.\u201cOh, oh.\u201dThus, we followed Jerome into the temple.And when we entered the temple, the inside of the temple was unexpectedly warm, unlike the cold outside.\u201cOh, welcome, Allen-san. And your important woman is doing well, is she? That\u2019s great.\u201dMelissa-chan laid down a large amount of grass in the temple, curled up on it, and turned only her head toward us.\u201cYeah, thanks to the two of you. Anna got well, so we came to report and express our gratitude for your kindness.\u201d\u201cI see, that\u2019s very kind of you.\u201d\u201cMe too, it was thanks to Melissa-chan and Jerome-kun\u2019s help that I was able to save Anna. Thank you very much.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll never forget what you did for us. We were just returning the favour.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right, Allen-san. It\u2019s thanks to you Allen-san.\u201d\u201cStill, I\u2019m glad. Also, she\u2019s my fianc\u00e9e, Anastasia. We\u2019re getting married next fall.\u201dI introduce Anna as such and bring her forward. Then Anna took a firm ladylike bow.\u201cMy name is Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett. I am Allen\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. I apologize for not being able to greet you properly the last time we met. Melissa-sama, Jerome-sama, I heard that you both helped to rescue me from the empire and I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I am sorry that it has taken me so long to thank you despite the fact that\u2013\u201c\u201cIt\u2019s long, you know? Um, is it okay with Anna-chan? If Allen-san\u2019s precious woman is saved, that\u2019s all that matters. We didn\u2019t do much.\u201d\u201cMelissa-san\u2026\u201d\u201cBut, yes. When you are going to destroy the Imperial capital, you should tell us, right? I won\u2019t allow you to sneak off and destroy it, okay?\u201d\u201cEh? Eh?\u201dJerome-kun also nods his head excitedly.\u201cMelissa-chan, I don\u2019t have that plan for now anyway. Because I killed the two masterminds. Well, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve forgiven them.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Well, anyway, I can\u2019t go now.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to be mom and dad before Allen-san and Anna.\u201dMelissa-chan said this and moved her curled up body. Then there was a big white egg.So that\u2019s it. Was Melissa-chan keeping this egg warm for a long time?\u201cCongratulations, Melissa-chan, Jerome-kun!\u201d\u201cCongratulations!\u201d\u201cFufu, thank you. And, Anna, you don\u2019t have to talk in that strange way, okay? Why don\u2019t you speak normally? Also, you can call us as you like, both me and Jerry.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it okay? Melissa-chan says so too.\u201d\u201cOh, oh. That\u2019s right. Then Melissa, Jerome, nice to meet you.\u201d\u201cFufu. Nice to meet you.\u201dWith that said, Melissa returned to her egg-warming position.\u201cHey, hey, can I give you both my blessing? Well, so many things happened, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit it, but I\u2019ve become an Ice Saint.\u201dBlessing is one of the abilities of the Ice Saint.However, it is not as powerful as the blessing of that pervert but is said to be a good luck charm, so to speak, as it promotes healthy growth and protects a little against serious illnesses that could bring one to the verge of life or death.It seems that Anna doesn\u2019t understand this area well, so I\u2019ll investigate it one by one.\u201cOh? Is that so? Good for you. But, well, if that\u2019s the case, can I have it for my unborn child? We have the blessing of the wind god, so that\u2019s enough for us. We will face retribution if we ask for too much.\u201dMelissa responded to Anna\u2019s offer in a lighthearted manner.\u201cY-Yeah. I think so too. I\u2019d like to give it to my child.\u201d\u201cBut \u2026\u201d\u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ll come back when the baby is born, okay?\u201d\u201cOh, oh.\u201dWhen I said this, Anna backed down, albeit reluctantly.\u201cAlso, I brought you plenty of beef to thank you. And I bet you\u2019re going through a rough time right now, right?\u201dI say that and serve them the beef I\u2019ve packed in a large quantity in my magic bag.\u201cAh! Thank you! Allen-san is the best!\u201dMelissa was overjoyed when I told her this and proceeded to eat the beef as if devouring it.\u201cOh? Jerry, you don\u2019t want some? If you don\u2019t want it, I\u2019ll eat it all, okay?\u201d\u201cOh, is that okay?\u201d\u201cAllen-san brought this for both of us, you know? How could you not?\u201d\u201cI-Itadakimasu.\u201dJerome-kun, who was told that, shook his tail happily and started eating meat with Melissa-chan.By the way, I went to thank the pervert while asking her to take care of the \u300eStaff of Divine Guidance\u300f afterwards, but she said \u2018I see. Well then, I look forward to the birth of your child,\u2019 in a cat-like manner.Ah, but Anna who heard it turned bright red and was very cute.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I didn\u2019t think the power of the Saint of Charity was so strong.The king, the ministers, and the knights, all agree with me.To put it bluntly, it all seems brainwashing now.It\u2019s been a very smooth ride, especially since that Prime Minister gave in.It seems that the power of the Saint of Charity only works on those who have a liking for me.But you know what? If they like me even a little bit, it will definitely work, and if I keep on telling them, they will definitely listen to what I say and change as I say.Thanks to the Prime Minister seeing through it, all the people in the castle are mine.I told them several times that I am the Saint of Charity, that they should believe in me unconditionally and should offer their everything to me. After that, they started to believe in me.And then for the general populace. The Prime Minister gave a speech in which he simply read from a manuscript he had written, and intentionally staged the healing show of the wounded soldiers. Oh, and then doing charitable work or something.Anyway, after doing something like the act of a nice human and telling them about myself, they immediately believed that I was the Saint of Charity.I love Karl-sama and others. So I have no intention of becoming their Queen, but it\u2019s practically like my own country now.But I heard that Oscar was released, and his father, who seems to have switched sides to the second prince faction, caught him and took him somewhere.I haven\u2019t even been able to contact Claude for a long time.And don\u2019t you think it\u2019s strange that after writing letters to both of them I didn\u2019t get any response?I thought I had captured them properly.Well, I\u2019m sure we can talk about that later, right?\u201cAmy!\u201dWhile I was looking out the window by myself, Karl-sama came in after finishing his work.\u201cKarl-sama\u201dI ran to Karl-sama, and he gently embraced me. Then we kissed passionately.\u201cAmy, I missed you.\u201d\u201cMe too\u201dKarl-sama with a neat face is always nice to see.\u201cAmy\u201d\u201cOh, Markus!\u201dMarkus came to me too. Then Karl-sama let me go and left me with Markus.\u201cAmy, I missed you.\u201d\u201cMe too\u201dThen Markus also hugged me tightly and kissed me passionately, just like Karl-sama.\u201cFufu, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re both here.\u201d\u201cBecause I only have Amy. Amy\u2019s happiness is my happiness.\u201d\u201cMe too. I would do anything for Amy.\u201d\u201cThank you. Karl-sama, Markus. I love you, too. So love only me.\u201d\u201cYeah, of course.\u201d\u201cI would never look at another woman.\u201dIs that so. As I kept asking them to love only me every day, they soon became like this. Now they don\u2019t feel anything when they see any other woman but me.It\u2019s perfect. No one will complain about this kind of thing anywhere in the castle anymore. No, in fact, they\u2019ll look at you fondly.Lately, I\u2019ve been in bed with them, and it\u2019s fulfilling.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Amy. I just got word from the church that they\u2019re recognizing you as the Saint of Charity.\u201d\u201cWell, finally!\u201dI was so happy with Karl-sama\u2019s words that I let out a loud voice.\u201cYes. I was steadily persuading them.\u201d\u201cReally\u201dYes, I steadily met with priests and sisters of the church and gradually persuaded them.Especially the support for the orphanage was effective.I went to an orphanage and taught the children there that I was a saint. The children immediately believed that I was the Saint of Charity, you know? With sparkling eyes, they would say, \u201cSaint-sama, Saint-sama has come.Well, I didn\u2019t really want to be with those dirty orphans, but when I put up with it, the sisters and priests there started listening to me.So little by little, I got good rumours going, and by the time I realized it, there was no more talk of witches.And today, I was finally recognized by the Church as God\u2019s chosen Saint of Charity.Now there\u2019s no one left to bother me.Fufufu\u2026now all we have to do is to deal with those Imperials out there.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ve been cheering the soldiers over here, so they are supposed to be death-defying soldiers and quite strong, even then why?Isn\u2019t it strange, even though Karl-sama and Markus are also doing their best?Oh, maybe that nerd has a hand in it?If that\u2019s the case, then that nerd is a cold-blooded person.How much do you hate me for cooperating with the country that kidnapped your beloved villainess!But that\u2019s too bad.I, the Saint of Charity and heroine of this world, am determined to have a happy ending.Because, you know, right?This is the world of my favourite otome game.It would be strange if I don\u2019t have a happy ending even though I haven\u2019t made a mistake in my choices!When I thought so, it seemed like something was going wrong.\u201cKarl-sama. What happened?\u201d\u201cOh, Amy. Apparently, the underground sewers have been targeted by the Imperial Guard. It seems that someone has been leading the Imperial Guard through there and they\u2019re invading the city.\u201dWhat are you saying! I, the Saint of Charity, can\u2019t believe that there is a traitor in this town where I am!\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d\u201cWe will have to take them down, one by one. It\u2019s okay, Amy. We will definitely protect you.\u201dKarl-sama says so, but after all, it seems that he is impatient.What is this all about?Could this be the event where the royal city is destroyed once, as in the game?If so, that\u2019s not good.Even though I\u2019ve come this far, I can\u2019t let them get to us like this!Hang in there, me! Think about it, me!When I thought about it for a moment, my head hurt, but I came up with a good idea.\u201cKarl-sama. I have an idea!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s reliable. Is it a Saint\u2019s prophecy?\u201dKarl-sama looks at me kindly.\u201cYes, the enemy is in the sewers, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u201d\u201cThen we can pour poison gas down the sewers! Then, all the evil enemy soldiers will be killed!\u201dWhen I said that, Karl-sama\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.Fufu, as expected of myself.\u201cBut if we do that, there will be damage to the surrounding and downstream residents. \u2026\u2026\u201dEh? Is it useless?But if the royal capital is destroyed by Imperial soldiers here, then everyone will be killed, right?And if there are imperial soldiers in the underground sewers we used to escape in the game, there\u2019s no way we can escape, right?I don\u2019t even know if we can go to the Kingdom of Westerdale since Claude is not here in the first place.In that case, we have no choice but to do it.Yes. Besides, it\u2019s the commoners who will die as collateral damage from the poison anyway, right?Then they were the ones who were originally supposed to be killed by the imperial soldiers, weren\u2019t they?Huh? What the heck. Then it doesn\u2019t matter!\u201cKarl-sama, you should do it! I, the Saint of Charity, will pray for the victims! So, if you don\u2019t, all the people of the royal capital will be killed!\u201dI pleaded with tears in my eyes, and Karl-sama nodded his head.Yes, that\u2019s fine.Fufu, now we\u2019ve won.This should end the event in which the royal capital is attacked, and we can go get the \u300eScroll of Concealment\u300f later.\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0aAhaha. It worked perfectly.I heard, a little bit of the residents around the sewer inlets and outlets have died, but nothing serious.Besides, we were able to defeat the imperial soldiers without incident, and they are going to hold a memorial service for the victims soon, so all I have to do is say a prayer for them.Now, all we have to do is collect the \u300eScroll of Concealment\u300f.Huh? But who should use it?With this in mind, we came to the entrance of the sewer system in the school.Then they opened the door and I went into that little room I saw in the game.Then on the desk here\u2026Not there!Why!?\u201cAh! That guy!\u201d\u201cAmy, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cIf you need help with anything, please tell us.\u201dBoth Karl-sama and Markus told me that with concern.But you know. Now I understand everything!That nerd! You stole my \u300eScroll of Concealment\u300f!(T/N:- yep cause you\u2019re an idiot for still following the story.)That\u2019s why he was able to do that in the duel and take back the villainess that was sold to the empire!Then!

    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Villager A Wants to Save the Villainess no Matter What!Chapter 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe year has come to a close, and the cold weather is at its most severe.Apparently, the Est Imperial forces that had surrounded Lurden were defeated.It seems that all the spies who had infiltrated Lurden had already withdrawn, so we do not know the details, and our judgment is based on the information provided by the spies in the neighbouring territories.And the decisive factor in this decision to withdraw was that even the church got entangled with Amy.Many people are not very religious, but basically, all the people in the countries around here are members of the church. If she can gain the confidence of the church, there will be many who will believe that Amy is a saint, even if she is in fact a witch.If our spies get entrapped via the church, the network would be severely damaged. That is why we decided to retreat before that happened.In response to this situation, we contacted Duke Schleistein and decided on a plan to retake the royal capital and put it into action.First, the Second Prince\u2019s faction, led by Duke Schleistein\u2019s army, advanced its forces to Lurden with the Second Prince as general-in-chief. In response, our Kingdom of Ramslett provided food aid and indirect support by holding large-scale military exercises on the southern and southwestern borders of Centraren to restrain the Crown Prince\u2019s army.As a result, the forces of the Second Prince\u2019s faction easily succeeded in encircling Lurden.The troops left in Lurden, exhausted in the battle with the Est Empire, may not be at least perfect. However, it is completely unknown how much resistance the soldiers of the royal capital, who have now turned into fanatics, will put up.We finished our preparations and went to the place where the Second Prince and Duke Schleistein is, as arranged.This time I landed in the middle of the camp where Duke Schleistein and the Second Prince were, not on the Buitor Rev., but on the back of Jerome-kun.By the way, I did not ask Jerome-kun to come. I had been giving away meat with a reasonable frequency since then. So Melissa-chan ordered him to go with me.Of course, I had given her 5 Orc meat as a gift in return, so Melissa-chan\u2019s food situation should not be a problem.\u201cU-Uwaaaaaaaa!\u201d\u201cYou lots, don\u2019t break formation. This is as per the prior notice.\u201dDuke Schleistein calms the soldiers of the Second Prince\u2019s faction who panicked when they saw Jerome-kun.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time. Your Excellency the Duke.\u201dI got down from Jerome-kun with Anna in my arms, then put her down and greeted him.Today Anna is dressed in white, an easy to move around, yet still somewhat sacred dress.To use an analogy, it\u2019s like a saint became an adventurer with a sword in her hand.This, of course, carries the message that there is justice on our side and the other side is a witch.\u201cIt has been a while. Duke Schleistein, His Highness Prince Ludwig\u201d\u201cNo-No way? Sister-in-law?\u201d\u201cYour Highness! You\u2019re being rude! I didn\u2019t expect Her Highness Princess Anastasia to come herself.\u201dThe Second Prince looks at Anastasia with a stunned expression in contrast to Duke Schleistein, who kneels down after saying this, but Anna makes her displeasure clear.\u201cYour Highness Ludwig, I am not your sister-in-law or anything like that, nor do I plan to become one. Shame on you for saying such a thing to a woman with a fianc\u00e9. Or are you insulting me?\u201d\u201cEh? But?\u201d\u201cYour Highness! Apologize immediately! This is the First Princess of the Kingdom of Ramslett, who is engaged to the hero, Allen-dono. Do you intend to throw away the chance to regain the capital!\u201dThe Second Prince is surprised by Anna\u2019s obviously uncomfortable tone, but he hurriedly apologizes after being told by Duke Schleistein in a stern tone.\u201cI am sorry, Your Highness Anastasia. I apologize for my old habits. And congratulations on your engagement to the hero, Allen-dono.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine, I accept that apology. But I\u2019m Allen\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Don\u2019t forget that.\u201d\u201cOf course. My apologies.\u201dAnna said the last line looking at Duke Schleistein, not the Second Prince. She is probably nailing him not to think about anything else, but the Second Prince, who is unable to notice this, apologizes in a straightforward manner.Apparently, even if the successor turns out to be this Second Prince, the country has no choice but to walk on a difficult road.\u201cSo, what is the method of releasing the brainwashing of Amy the witch?\u201d\u201cWe are already prepared to activate this magic over the entire Lurden. However, this magic can only affect opponents who are outdoors. It has no effect on opponents inside the building.\u201d\u201cSo we have to draw as many men as we can, is it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean. If you raise the signal at the right time, we will activate the magic here. However, please note that this magic can only be used once. If you make a mistake in timing, it will be a wasted shot, and we will be left with little recourse. It is up to the judgment of the general, so please do your best.\u201dI say so and look at the Second Prince.\u201cI-I get it, hero Allen-dono. Let\u2019s carefully assess the situation and send a signal at the right time.\u201d\u201cBest regards. Neither His Majesty nor Her Highness wishes to shed any blood, that\u2019s all we wish from you. I ask you to take good care of them.\u201d\u201cUh, oh. Leave it to me.\u201dDuke Schleistein replies on behalf of the Second Prince, who does not understand why he has to be so careful.Of course, this is a declaration that we will intervene if things go wrong there.In the first place, this magic is not something that can be used only once. Besides, we are prepared to storm the castle if necessary to stop Amy, and in the worst-case scenario, we will force our way in and take Amy\u2019s head off.However, we are here to represent our country, so we need to sell the favours we can sell at the highest possible price.\u201cThat\u2019s all. Then we will move on to the preparations.\u201dAfter hearing his reply, we once again got on Jerome-kun\u2019s back and moved to the top of a small hill overlooking the battlefield.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
