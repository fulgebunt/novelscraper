My title is also Dao Huai, meaning Saberheart.It means that I will always carry the blade. My parents gave me this name because I was born embracing a divine saber.I trained with the blade at one year old and had some accomplishments at eight. I began to test my dao at fifteen and was able to become a god at thirty. Despite that, I was already referred to as the Saber God when I was ten. I didn't truly become one, of course, till I was thirty.In this world, people have always claimed to be Saber God but in my eyes, they were all just kids playing with their toy sabers.The saber is my weapon as well as my best friend. Most importantly, it is my life.Even though I was more than three hundred years old after becoming Immortal Emperor, but this was not my proudest achievement compared to becoming the Saber God. It was my lifelong pursuit. Immortal Emperor was only something I obtained after entering the dao with my saber.The world says that an Immortal Emperor was the apex of the grand dao but in my eyes, the dao of the saber is limitless.It has its own life, prettier than any beauties in this world. Even though I was also known as the wife of the most beautiful woman in the nine worlds, I am still not as pretty as the blade in my hand.In my life, if I could solve something with one slash, a second one would never need to come out. But I don't know why the inhabitants of this world only remember me as an Immortal Emperor but not my invincible saber dao. Perhaps it is because I came from the Thousand Emperors Gate as its second emperor. People recorded my royal achievement but not my unstoppable dao!I am Immortal Emperor Dao Huai, born with the blade. With it in my hands, I have nothing to fear in this world. I would even fight against the venerable Immortal Emperor Hao Hai as long as my blade is by my side!Ugh, but my blade was taken away by my wife tonight\u2026. This is why I'm here chatting with everyone\u2026Oh, I also forgot something important. This Immortal Emperor, no, this Saber God is the second prettiest beauty in the nine worlds but the truth is that I still think I'm prettier than my number one wife.Haha, I am just kidding. How could a pretty and gifted female Immortal Emperor like me have a wife? But I do have one bastard instead. Yes, it is that bastard who is always hiding. One day, I will deal with him\u2026The moon is quite round tonight. I wonder if that bastard is pretending to be a little girl again; a little swindling girl who says: \u201cHey, you and I are connected by fate\u2026\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was a place full of destiny stones. They were extremely precious and highly sought after by countless geniuses and experts.At the peak of this mountain was a particular immortal stone. It was really the king of destiny stones, the natural born ancestor of its kind. There was not a second destiny stone comparable to it in this world.Because this was one of the earliest metals since the inception of the universe, many wise sages and prodigies have vied for it to no avail. <sup>1</sup>During the beginning of the Desolate Era, a man drifted closer while shouldering both a bronze sword and the heaven on his back. Primordial chaos and the early laws floated around him. He was the rising sun at the start of this world, the bringer of an entirely new age.This was Immortal Emperor Gu Chun, the first emperor of the nine worlds, the person who started the Heaven's Will Epoch.He walked to the summit the Divine Dragon Mountain and gazed at the primal metal. He became quite happy and sat down to gently pat it. His words were the eternal universal laws: \u201cFellow Daoist, will you follow me?\u201dThe primal stone was quiet and didn't make a sound.The emperor did not force it after seeing the lack of response. He said: \u201cVery well, you and I are not meant to be. Keep on waiting for the fateful person then.\u201dWith that, he stepped into the sky and disappeared towards the horizon.The hundred races began to rise during the early Desolate Era with one emperor appearing after another. In this generation, Immortal Emperor Fei has shouldered the Heaven's Will to ascend to the throne.Today, he visited the Divine Dragon Mountain. His arrival was accompanied by the immortals and goddesses. Auspicious images emerged in the sky with peaceful laws. This was a prosperous era.He looked at the primal stone before shaking it with his hand. He wanted to forcefully take it away but despite the fact that he could shake the nine worlds, he was unable to take this stone away.He ceased his effort and said: \u201cThe price for a forceful taking is too large, the gains do not make up for the losses.\u201d With that, he crossed the myriad realms with the grand dao without any regrets. The goddesses followed him as well. <sup>2</sup>Nearing the end of the Desolate Era with myriad laws circulating, Immortal Emperor Fei Yang carried the Heaven's Will. The nine worlds trembled in fear. Even the burial grounds and ancestral earths got a headache because of him!Today, the emperor flew to the Divine Dragon Mountain, unaccompanied by laws or imperial auras. The leisure and carefree emperor wore a hemp garment with a smile on both his face and in his eyes.He sat down next to the primal ore and gently rubbed as if he was touching a lover. He smiled happily to say: \u201cBaby, my baby, how about going with me? Come with your young master, if you are a boy, then I will give you nice clothes and good food. If you are a girl, this young master's technique is number one and you will die from the pleasure.\u201dThe emperor didn't hold back with his teasing. If he wasn't unbeatable in this world, no one would believe that he was actually an Immortal Emperor.There was no reaction from the primal stone after a while either. The emperor didn't become angry. He touched the stone again with both hands like a scoundrel while chortling: \u201cMy baby, if I become your master, you will have endless benefits. I, Fei Yang, am the number one ** in the nine worlds, gifted in both literature and martial arts. With my Skyhigh Armament, I can fight against the myriad tribes and sects. If I take it off, I can deal with six thousand goddesses. What do you think?\u201d <sup>3</sup>There was still no reaction from the stone.\u201cIf you won't follow me, then I will have to punish you.\u201d He smiled and took out a divine brush. He refined the laws and polished the dao. His stroke encompassed the yin and yang as well as the six dao and the reincarnation cycle.In the blink of an eye, he drew an ugly girl on top of the primal ore before laughing and being quite pleased with himself. He then put away his brush and slowly walked away.After he left, whenever the full moon came, an ugly girl would appear from the stone and kissed it while whispering coquettishly: \u201cI'll always think of you. Come with me, love.\u201dIt wasn't until the end of Immortal Emperor Fei Yang's generation did the seal with the ugly girl left by him on the primal ore slowly dissipated away.Emperors Era. Immortal Emperor Hao Hai arrived. He stepped forward while being protected by the deities. The nine worlds were opened with heavenly images. True Dragons and Immortal Phoenixes were present painting quite a majestic scene. <sup>4</sup>The emperor looked at the stone and said: \u201cThroughout my whole life, I believe that I can catch up to Jiao Heng and Fei. It seems that I still have a long way to go. What a supreme immortal stone, unfortunately, I can't seize it.\u201d Having said that, he then left.Emperors Era. The human race was quite prosperous during this time. The moment Emperor Hong Tian came out, the myriad worlds turned dark and the heaven became suppressed!She traveled through the nine worlds and the myriad realms. As she walked in these lands, she remembered the past and reflected on old errors. This was not her first time to Divine Dragon Mountain. Before, a dark crow has led her to this place to pick a destiny stone. Alas, she was alone today.As she looked at the primal stone, his voice echoed in her head: \u201cThis immortal stone right here, wait until you become Immortal Emperor then you can probably take it away. It is simply unique, not weakened by the tenth world. With it in your possession, you will be a tiger with wings up there in the future.\u201dThe voice seemed so close yet she was by her lonesome.After gazing at the stone for a long time, she said softly eventually: \u201cWe can meet again in the tenth world. Only he in this world will be able to bring you there.\u201d With that, she left quietly with a sad expression.As time passed, one generation of Immortal Emperor came after another, but the primal ore still towered on top of the Divine Dragon Mountain just like before!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even though his face still had a youthful innocence, his forehead showed signs of a seasoned maturity.The boy was born in a very small village consisting of only several dozen families. His ancestors have all been good-natured farmers in this village.He was lost in thoughts while gazing at the cold rain that helps him forget about the past. Upon his birth was also the death of his mother while his father succumbed to the toil of life when he was eight.Fortunately, he had three decent farm plots on top of the occasional assistance from his neighbors. This allowed him to barely have clothes and a full stomach.This was the age of dreams and fantasy. Despite making just enough to eat, he still had his own dreams during this rain watch.He dreamed of the day when he could become an immortal, freed from sadness and worries, dressed with golden robes and satiated with wondrous meals, a life of freedom while soaring through the heaven and earth.He has heard the adults talk about immortals before. One hundred miles away from the village was a divine mountain with a sect called Southern Creek. Within were immortals capable of doing all the things he yearned about.His eyes lit up whenever he thought about them with an unquenchable ambition for cultivation. This was because two days ago, an amazing immortal came to Wu Qi's house. He rode the clouds and trod on the winds then descended from the sky. After his visit, he took Wu Qi in as a disciple.This immortal was called the Purepine Ancient Saint, a big character from a faraway immortal sect.Wu Qi grew up together with Ye Yunzhou. They were extremely close so Yunzhou was very happy for Wu Qi.A chilling breeze blew by causing Yunzhou to shudder. He calmed down and looked up to see that the roof of his house was leaking water. He had to slightly shift to the side.When his father was still around, his house had two rooms and one hallway but one room has collapsed now, leaving behind his own leaky room.His belly rumbled. It was another night of hunger as the boy reached into his dried food pouch. There was not much left so he had to swallow his saliva and endure this hunger to save it. When the rain ended, he could go find other food.\u201cBoom!\u201d Suddenly, a dark shadow rushed in through the window. It was a dark crow that decided to land on the string by his bed.The crow shook its body causing water to spray everywhere. Yunzhou had to dodge and couldn't do anything about the little bird.It has been staying at his place for several days now with no fear of strangers. It nonchalantly treated this place as its home.After coming inside, the crow didn't bother looking at Yunzhou at all. It lowered its head into its feathers and seemed to be sleeping.\u201cYou couldn't find any food outside?\u201d The boy asked softly. He has grown familiar with this intruder taking his room for its own and felt that this was how it should be.In the morning, the crow would leave and didn't return until now. Yunzhou actually thought that it wasn't coming back.The crow had no reaction and ignored the boy completely without moving its body.After seeing the crow's dispirited appearance, he reached into his dried food pouch and salivated. After a moment of hesitation, he still took some food out and placed it before the crow to say: \u201cEat this if you are hungry. I still have some left.\u201dThe crow still buried its head in its feathers and didn't care for the boy. He was surprised for a bit and felt that it was quite funny. Why was he trying to talk to a crow that wouldn't understand him in the first place?\u201cI forgot, how can you know what I'm saying? You're just a crow.\u201d He smiled wryly and scratched his head.But the crowd suddenly lifted its head and stared coldly at him. His smile froze after seeing this peering gaze. This crow seemed to be able to understand him!He found it inconceivable like in a dream. A crow capable of understanding humans. No one would ever believe this.After a while, he showed the food on his palm again and said: \u201cDo, do you want to eat?\u201d He wasn't certain of his hunch.However, the crow ignored him and resumed the resting position inside its feathers.He felt as if he saw a look of contempt in the crow as if it was high and mighty and wouldn't stoop down to eat his dried ration.\u201cI, I must be dreaming.\u201d He pinched his face and murmured.After being scorned by the crow, he went back to his spot and sat down with both hands hugging his knees while staring at the crow.What kind of crow was this? Could it really understand humans or was it just his illusion? In this short period, the boy let his imagination run wild.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The night rain has stopped to usher in a fresh morning.Ye Yunzhou woke up from a restless night. After washing his face, it was time to go out and find something to eat.\u201cYunzhou, Yunzhou!\u201d A loud voice interrupted him. It carried a youthful hint still.A young man rushed in from the outside. Even though they seemed to be close in age, this youth was much more muscular and taller than Yuzhun. He looked very strong already.\u201cLittle Qi.\u201d Yunzhou smiled with great excitement after seeing this youth.Wu Qi was a childhood friend. The two grew up together so their friendship was great. Despite not being blood-related, they were even closer than real brothers.\u201cYo, I brought you some food.\u201d Wu Qi quickly took out some steaming buns from his robe and handed them over to Yunzhou.Yuzhun felt warm inside after accepting the hot buns. Wu Qi has always brought him food. Well, not just him, many seniors in the village have always been nice to him.The two of them stood by the door and ate the hot buns one by one but Wu Qi seemed a bit distracted.\u201cWhat's wrong?\u201d Yunzhou was a discerning person and he knew that something was up after seeing Wu Qi's demeanor.Wu Qi took another bite and replied with an unwilling expression: \u201cI want to leave with my master to a very faraway place. I, I don't know when we will return.\u201dFor Wu Qi, it was not only being away from his playmate but also from the village he grew up in as well as his parents.Yunzhou looked up and saw a daoist standing in the distant. He had a transcending style with sleeves fluttering in the wind just like an immortal.He has seen this daoist called the Unwavering Ancient Saint. He was an immortal who came from a distant land. It was told that his sect was incredible.Yunzhou didn't want Wu Qi to leave either but he still smiled while sincerely feeling happy for his friend. He said: \u201cCome back often after you finish cultivating. This is a rare chance so you have to do your best to become an amazing immortal. When you ride the clouds back here, you have to bring me to the sky to see other immortals as well.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. I will.\u201d Yunzhou's words dispersed some of Wu Qi's unwillingness. He scratched his head and said: \u201cWell, really, it would be so nice if you can come train with me so that we can both become immortals together. But, but, my master said your talents aren't enough but I feel that you are much smarter than me. Like you read so fast while I have to spend half of a day to finish.\u201dWu Qi's family was one of the best in the village so his parents were able send him to school. Ye Yunzhou on the other hand was too poor to do so and could only secretly watch outside of the window. The teacher didn't chase him away either so he still learned a lot of things.\u201cWell, cultivation doesn't rely on reading. You are taller than me and stronger too, so you will definitely be amazing after some cultivation.\u201d Yunzhou smiled: \u201cYou must come back and make the village proud, I'll be waiting.\u201dIn fact, after meeting the Unwavering Ancient Saint, Wu Qi begged his master to take Yunzhou as a disciple as well. Alas, Unwavering found Yunzhou's talents to be lacking and refused his disciple's beseech.Wu Qi wanted to talk more but he was too young to know how to express himself and alleviate the bitter feeling in his heart. They grew up together and aspired to become immortals that could soar in the sky. This was a pact between them.But now, he was being taken away by his master to a distant place while Yunzhou had to stay back in the village.\u201cWait a bit.\u201d Wu Qi told Yunzhou and ran towards Unwavering.The two of them talked and Yunzhou was too far away to hear them.After a while, Wu Qi came back and handed an emblem to Yunzhou and said: \u201cMy master said that there is an Immortal Gate not far from us, Southern Creek School. They are actually recruiting right now so you can go take a look. Take my master's token and they will definitely take you in as a disciple.\u201dYunzhou accepted it and took a look. This was a badge with the word \u201cUnwavering\u201d carved on it. He felt warm and emotional afterward and didn't know what to say.\u201cI will definitely go. Just wait, after we become cultivators, we will fly across the nine continents and four oceans together!\u201d Yunzhou felt his nose burning up as he was holding his tears in.\u201cYes, we will definitely journey through the lands together!\u201d Wu Qi said with great excitement.The two were so young yet their aspiration was already so magnificent!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wu Qi turned away in order to leave, but he immediately turned back and slipped a few silver coins and a jade medallion to Yunzhou: \u201cTravel expenses for your trip.\u201d\u201cNo, no, I can't take this-\u201d Yunzhou was startled. The coins were one thing but this medallion was a token of good luck that Wu Qi kept with him since youth. It was very important to him.Yunzhou quickly put the coins and medallion back to Wu Qi's hand but Wu Qi immediately grabbed his hand and glared his eyes: \u201cYou and me, we don't need to be like this. Keep it as a memento, but if you feel bad, give me something back too.\u201d\u201cHmm-\u201d Yunzhou scratched his head and helplessly said: \u201cI can't be any poorer, there's nothing valuable here so what can I give you as a momento?\u201dYunzhou couldn't come up with something suitable to give Wu Qi. He only had three to five pieces of clothings that were presentable. Other items were completely worthless.At this time, Wu Qi jumped up and took an eaves tile from Yunzhou's roof and smiled: \u201cThen give me this roof tile as a memento.\u201d\u201cWait, this broken tile is worthless.\u201d Yunzhou smiled wryly. He knew that Wu Qi was doing this for his sake.\u201cYou can't say that.\u201d Wu Qi replied seriously: \u201cYour house leaks water all the time so this single tile can shield you from wind and rain. Think about it, just how important is this tile to you and your house? So when you give me it, just remember how precious and valuable it is as a treasure.\u201dWu Qi's exaggeration left Yunzhou feeling warm with his eyes becoming moist. He held Wu Qi's wrists tightly and said: \u201cWhen you look at this tile later, it is the same as seeing me!\u201d [1. This common Chinese expression can be weird if translated literally like this, but I think the point comes across just fine. A modification could have been \u201cThink of me when you look at this tile\u201d.]\u201cOf course.\u201d Wu Qi smiled and gave Li Qiye a hug: \u201cGoodbye, brother.\u201d With that, he left with his master. [2. Haha, this isn't a mistake by me. The author typed Li Qiye instead of Ye Yunzhou in this sentence]Yunzhou waved goodbye towards that direction and didn't look away until they have disappeared completely. He stood there in a daze for a while.When you look at this tile later, it is the same as seeing me - this was spoken from his heart earlier. Such simple words carried an incredible prestige later on. When he swept through the nine heavens and ten earth to become the master of the nine worlds, seeing this tile piece was the same as seeing an Immortal Emperor! It contained a boundless imperial aura!After a long time, he calmed down and looked at the badge given to him by Unwavering. He then glanced at the horizon and took a deep breath.Yes, he must go to the Southern Creek School to learn. He must gain the ability to devour rivers and spew out mists, the capability to soar to the sky. Only with that would he be able to roam freely like an immortal in order to see just how vast the world was.His heart was determined to find a teacher in order to learn. Even though he didn't know what cultivation and cultivators were, but he had a strong desire to see the outside world. A seed of dao sprouted in his heart.After confirming his thoughts, he immediately went into the room to pack up. The truth was that he didn't have to clean up too much, only his few articles of clothings.Of course, there was his pouch of dried rations as well. He firmly tied it to his waist. It was all the food he had for the journey so he definitely couldn't afford to lose it.After this preparation, he was getting to leave. However, he thought of the crow that has been staying in his bedroom and wanted to say goodbye. Alas, it was nowhere to be found when he came inside.Yunzhou smiled wryly. How could a crow say goodbye to person like him? He shook his head and discarded the silly thoughts and left the small village to begin his journey.Not long after his departure, a little sound came about as a crow landed on his shoulder. It had a nonchalant appearance and immediately buried its head into its feathered wings.Yunzhou was pleasantly surprised to see the crow. He said: \u201cIt's you, I thought you have went away already. Where do you want to go? I am on my way to study the art at the Southern Creek School.\u201dIn a distant mountain, a woman has been watching Ye Yunzhou the whole time during his trip. She wore a white dress decorated with a phoenix embroidery. Her features were kingdom-toppling with a very beautiful maid serving by her side.This peerless beauty has been watching him the whole time, carefully observing all of his actions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His cooking skills were considered the finest so even Godkings cordially called him \u201cOld Bao\u201d.For Chef Bao, the thing that he was most proud of was not his peerless cooking skills. Even though his steamed phoenix liver, broiled dragon claw, and seasoned tiger eyes were his specialties and renowned in the nine worlds, they were still not his greatest pride. His proudest achievement was to cook for Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng.This emperor shocked the entire nine worlds. He was unbeaten throughout his life before becoming emperor, completely unparalleled in all the ages.Chef Bao was ready for old age. When he would tell his glorious tales to his grandchildren, of course cooking for the emperor wouldn't be left out.He woke up very early today and prepared the emperor's favorite soup. It consisted of Nine Saints Spring, White Mist and Snow Dew, and Seven Stars Immortal Prawn.He himself was a Godking so it was no problem for him to reach the highest peak or dive deep into the ocean. Before the emperor has woken up, he has already traveled through the world in order to prepare this morning soup for him.When the sun rose, the broth was ready. He looked at the steaming soup with great satisfaction and could already imagine the emperor happily eating his favorite soup.As he was lost in his fantasy, an imperial aura surged. Even a Godking like him would immediately kneel.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d Chef Bao respectfully greeted on the ground. There was no need for him to see who he was. In this world, only Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng had this aura.A man came forward with the sun and moon circling around him along with the myriad laws. He had a natural temperament and complete freedom. A single gesture of his could cause all the existences in this world to sway; all existed to worship him.Even though his divine and imperial aura were hidden, everyone would be willing to submit to him without exception.Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng, completely unmatched in this world. In the countless eras, he alone was unbeatable!\u201cOld Bao, let's have a small breakfast today.\u201d The emperor casually handed Chef Bao a box with a beaming and unrestrained smile.Chef Bao opened the box and saw an immortal liver within. An immortal aura emerged with the hymns of the phoenix right away.\u201cShining Bird's immortal liver!\u201d Old Bao was startled to see this ingredient.\u201cI wanted to enlighten it but unfortunately, the feathery animal didn't want to listen so I had no choice but to make it into a snack.\u201d The emperor smiled.\u201cThe Fiendgod, Shining Bird\u2026\u201d Chef Bao was still in a daze.Godfiend Shining Bird was known as the strongest devil king in the nine worlds. He had half the bloodline of a phoenix. This was an existence who withstood a heavenly tribulation for three years then came back to life with the phoenix rebirth.It swept through the nine worlds without facing resistance but now, Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng killed it and took its liver to be his wine snack.The emperor stepped into the palace and took out his old scroll then began reading its sacred text.The sun shined brightly outside of the window. However, with a single glance of the emperor's pupils, the sun hanging high became very gentle with its rays falling on his body. It was the utmost comfort and leisure period; everything in this world was in tune with his personal rhythm.A moment later, Chef Bao brought up the boiled liver and matched it with the right kind of broth. This was the emperor's breakfast.The emperor tried them and nodded with a smile: \u201cOld Bao, your broth is simmered to the point of perfection, I must taste it every day.\u201dOld Bao retired from the hall happily after hearing the praise. He would only cook in this life for the emperor. Even if other gods in this world wanted a taste, they would have to ask other chefs instead!As the emperor was reading, he would laugh at the interesting parts. When he smiled, the world became splendid with the sky clearing up. An immortal aura would engulf the nine worlds.\u201cYoung noble.\u201d An old servant stepped forward during the emperor's reading hours.This old servant has always followed the emperor with absolute loyalty. He was responsible for the emperor's daily life and diet.\u201cWhat is it, Uncle Zhong?\u201d The only person addressed with this honorific and warm attitude from the emperor was this old servant alone in this world.\u201cYoung noble, Fairy Ye wishes to see you and enjoy the apricots on the Nine Immortals Peak together.\u201d The old servant explained.Fairy Ye was the number one beauty of the nine worlds. Her origin was exceptional; her features were impeccable. Her talents were peerless with exceedingly high cultivation. It was hard to find someone comparable to her. She once competed against the emperor for the Heaven's Will. After losing to him, what she gained was love.\u201cTell the fairy to go back, I wish to comprehend the dao today.\u201d The emperor was still smiling freely and answered with a casual response.\u201cYoung noble, you do that every day.\u201d The old servant angrily said: \u201cYou are already invincible in this world, it is time to rest now. Since you are in charge of the nine worlds now, it is time to pick an imperial queen.\u201dOnly this old man would dare to speak to the emperor in this manner. He was worried about his young noble's marriage.The emperor answered with a smile: \u201cA man's ambition runs far to the four seas, no need to be in a hurry.\u201d\u201cYoung noble, fine if you don't want to pick a queen just yet but you should think about passing on your bloodline to extend your lineage forever.\u201d The old servant sincerely advised.\u201cIn this world, so many goddesses and fairies want to earn your favor but none of them can enter your eyes. In the present, only a supreme character like Fairy Ye can have a nice conversation with you, so I hope that you will marry her soon and leave behind an heir for their clan.\u201d\u201cChildren and descendants are mostly unfilial, why should I, Jiao Heng, need them to prolong my legacy? For generations after, my name will still echo across the nine worlds like before!\u201d The emperor smiled: \u201cGo, tell the fairy that I'll view the apricots with her later.\u201dAfter hearing this, the old man couldn't do anything else and had to take his leave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had killed Contenders before while weaponless. [1]The world believed that she was a prime candidate for the throne. Unfortunately, Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng appeared out of nowhere and swept through his opponents.It took one whole night and the fairy also lost. Of course, she was completely convinced of his power and eventually fell in love with this peerless man.She had no lack of suitors due to her beauty and talents. Alas, these excellent prodigies couldn't win her grace, only the great emperor.Her hair draping down past her shoulders fluttered as she stood beneath a plum blossom tree. It was as if she was riding the wind and people could only look up at her.She was waiting for the emperor because he promised to enjoy the flowers with her tonight. She knew that he was a man of his words.Sure enough, he finally arrived by riding the moon in a carefree and leisurely manner. He didn't emit an impressive imperial aura at all.Plus, he didn't need these auras to be impressive. His presence made the world silent. Peace returned to the myriad realms in order to please him.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d She bowed and revealed a bright smile - one beautiful enough to sway the heart.\u201cSorry for the wait.\u201d The emperor smiled back while carefully admiring her beauty. The fairest of the nine worlds was worthy of his attention.\u201cI can wait however long just to enjoy the blossoms with you, Your Majesty.\u201d She showed no sign of bashfulness and didn't try to hide the love evident in her autumn eyes.\u201cThe blossoms here deserve a trip.\u201d The emperor smiled and raised his hand.She held it and leaned her forehead on his shoulder, looking like a cute little bird. He was the only one who could see this sweet and feminine side of her.The two of them strolled through this forest. The falling petals had a transcending presence to them. This made the peak look like a paradise for immortals. The two eventually picked a tree and sat down below to gaze at the moon.She found leaning on his shoulder to be very enjoyable. She treasured every second she could spend with him. He turned and smiled then couldn't help himself from gently stroking her soft hair.\u201cYour Majesty, you are invincible now, what other pursuits do you have?\u201d She eventually broke the silence.\u201cI'm the strongest right now but there are plenty of overlords above the nine heavens. Plus, there is no end in the search for the dao.\u201d He smiled.\u201cYou wish to ascend?\u201d She asked.\u201cYes. I shall ascend and sweep through the gods in the thirteen continents!\u201d He nodded.\u201cI'm sure you'll be able to do it.\u201d She had absolute confidence in him, thinking that he would always be unbeatable.\u201cYe Jishen, let's go back.\u201d He said gently, a very rare tone for him.\u201cYour Majesty, come to my abode, I'll serve you.\u201d She looked at him with a bashful expression - a striking contrast to her bold request.\u201cI'll do so another day but recently, I have some questions on cultivation so I'll be heading for the Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground tonight to borrow some ancient texts.\u201d He gave her a kiss and refused.\u201cI'll be waiting.\u201d She returned the kiss fiercely and left without any hesitation for he always followed his words.After sending her away, he smiled and took one step through the void to reach the burial ground.\u201cBoom!\u201d A supreme grand dao crushed the world. His imperial aura demanded respect and subservience. His majestic figure made everyone in the nine worlds drop to their knees.\u201cHis Majesty is entering the corpse ground!\u201d A kneeling spectator shouted.The Earth Immortals in there all looked up to see his peerless style as he walked slowly towards the depths of the burial ground and reached for something hidden in there.\u201cBoom!\u201d Ancient corpses leaped out. Their attires dated back to a time before the Desolate Era.They opened their mouth and devoured the power of the sun and moon. Their eyes derived the yin and yang. Their auras swept through the nine firmaments and made the Godkings tremble.They created immortal swords with enough forces to slay everything in an unstoppable manner.Alas, the emperor's hand that was reaching forward destroyed these sword formations. It continued heading for the deepest area.Bright barriers and halos instantly emerged to form walls in order to stop this hand. They crumbled with haste and he managed to look at the treasury within.\u201cBoom!\u201d The corpses were naturally furious at this sight. They conjured up a gigantic halo of darkness to imprison the nine worlds. The power of this burial ground was not to be trifled with!\u201cBoom!\u201d As they were on the verge of attacking him again, a drum from the depth with a melodious sound could be heard. The corpses calmed down after hearing this drumbeat and stopped any aggression.The emperor took out an ancient scroll from this treasury. He opened it and carefully read before shaking his head: \u201cImpressive indeed, but not what I'm looking for.He then threw it back into the treasury and left, not bothering to look at the corpses above him.After he was long gone, the corpses returned to their resting places and the burial ground regained its silence.1.

His body was currently drenched in perspiration. At thirteen years of age, a little boy like Li Qiye was using all of his might to climb this mountain range \u2014 this scene in the night sky would give a macabre sensation to just about anyone.Although the night was quiet, Li Qiye's mind was being tormented by a flame of uncertainty.Coming from a poor family, his parents were both peasants. At the age of seven, he began his life as a shepherd. His family name was Li; his name was Li Qiye because he cried for seven days and seven nights after birth. [1]Today, he had completed his daily tasks. However, during the approach of dawn, he noticed that he was missing his leading sheep. While filled with worry, he rushed back to the mountain range to search for it. After seemingly scouring the entire mountain range, he still couldn't find even a shadow of this sheep.Thinking about the missing sheep and its evil owner, Zhang Dahu, Li Qiye feared for the worst in his heart.Suddenly, Li Qiye thought of one place where the sheep might be. There was only one location that he didn't search \u2014 the Immortal Demon Grotto!As he looked towards the Immortal Demon Grotto before him, he noticed that the mountain range in the dark night resembled a fierce beast from the ancient Desolate Era; its mouth appeared to be gaping, hungering for human flesh. Hearing the howls of wolves resound from all around him, he couldn't help but shiver in fear.The Immortal Demon Grotto was considered a cursed land in the surrounding area. Legend states that an evil demon presided over this location, a demon who instantly consumed any trespassers. No one had ever made it out of the cave alive.At this moment, the sound of Zhang Dahu's whip reverberated in Li Qiye's ears. If Li Qiye truly lost the sheep, then Zhang Dahu would definitely whip his flesh to tatters.Having reached this point, Li Qiye gritted his teeth and approached the cave.His body disappeared in the night.\u201cAaaaaaaahhhhh\u2026!\u201dThe calm night was interrupted by a young boy's miserable scream.Li Qiye's frightened voice rang once again: \u201cYou, you, what do you want? \u2026 Ahh\u2026!\u201dSuddenly, the screams came to an end.An unknown amount of time later at the depths of the Immortal Demon Grotto, the silence was broken by a menacing voice: \u201cGood, good, good! My immortal Dark Crow has finally been completed. Since only a soul was missing, today, I will conveniently borrow your soul for a little bit!\u201d\u201cPhwoosh\u2026 phwoosh\u2026 phwoosh!\u201dA moment later, as each flap loudly resounded, a strange, dark crow flew away from the Immortal Demon Grotto.\u201cFly, fly, fly! I will use your soul to find all the Forbidden Burials. Fly across all the lands! As long as the Nine Worlds exist, I will find you again!\u201d From the depths of the Immortal Demon Grotto, the heavy voice came out once again and lingered in the air.From then on, throughout this heaven and earth, a Dark Crow flew across the planes. From heavenly cities to the most dangerous reaches and secret areas, it flew without a free will straight through the Nine Worlds for eras on end.As time passed, millions of years came and went. A new peerless master would rise as another fell. Slowly, the crow would disappear only to reappear later on. It wanted to escape its master, it wanted to find a purpose to its life.From the Alchemy God to Immortal Emperor Fei, Immortal Emperor Xue Xi to Immortal Emperor Min Ren, Immortal Emperor Tun Ri to Immortal Emperor Bing Yu\u2026 all the way up until the Black Dragon King. [2]Behind each of these paragons lies the shadow of a crow, one that struggled to find freedom.As these strongest beings came and went, the crow continued to mysteriously appear throughout the river of time.The crow was not willing to have his fate controlled. It wanted to oppose the most frightening character in this world.And now, millions of years has gone by with the passing of many eras\u2026Li Qiye, who was floating in a river, was suddenly dragged out by a person.\u201cAaa!\u201dAs he was being dragged out, Li Qiye suddenly woke up. His first reaction was to jump as he was unfamiliar with his own body. Unable to find his footing, he almost fell down to the ground.\u201cAh, my body!\u201d Looking down and seeing how his body had stayed the same, Li Qiye was both ecstatic and scared. Even after the thousands of struggles while fighting against the unending waves and winds, Dark Crow Li Qiye still couldn't contain his emotions after regaining his own body.Taking a deep breath, he lifted his head and found that an old man was in front of him.\u201cHehehe, it is this old man who saved you from your impending doom.\u201d The old man loudly laughed in an inglorious manner, revealing his three remaining yellow teeth. His demeanor made others feel that his smile was very sinister.Up the stream, Li Qiye could see the dim structure of the Immortal Demon Grotto. His eyes became increasingly cold and his aura exceeded anything that a thirteen year old child could exude.Li Qiye took a deep breath and then stared at the old man. After a while, he eventually asked: \u201cHow should I address you, old man?\u201d\u201cCleansing Incense Ancient Sect, Old Devil.\u201d The old man answered with his mouth agape, still revealing his three golden teeth while smiling and spitting everywhere.\u201cCleansing Incense Ancient Sect\u2026\u201d Li Qiye whispered under his breath. This name made him recall the sealed memories in his mind. These memories were from a time when he was still imprisoned in the body of the Dark Crow.Li Qiye regained his composure and asked the old man: \u201cRight now, who has the Heaven's Will?\u201dThe old man was still smiling as he replied: \u201cHeaven's Will eh? Right now, no one in this era has been able to shoulder the Heaven's Will.\u201d\u201cWhere is Immortal Emperor Ta Kong?\u201d After hearing the old man's response, Li Qiye's demeanor darkened. How long had he been asleep for? Over a hundred thousand years? [1]\u201cImmortal Emperor Ta Kong has been missing for thirty thousand years.\u201dLi Qiye inquired the old man once more: \u201cWhat about the Black Dragon King of the Heaven Protector Palace?\u201d\u201cNo one knows. The Black Dragon King went missing at the same time as Immortal Emperor Ta Kong.\u201d Old Devil shook his head.Hearing this, Li Qiye's expression drastically changed. He looked back at the Immortal Demon Grotto again and finally understood why he had regained his body.\u201cLet us go.\u201d With a saddened expression, Li Qiye turned around and started to walk away. He didn't care if Old Devil was following him or not. After experiencing pseudo-immortality, he knew exactly what he had to do.The Heaven Protector Palace was an incredibly powerful lineage in the current times. Back in that era when the Black Dragon King \u2014 a peerless master \u2014 was still alive, no one could match him across the Nine Worlds. He was respected for three whole generations!Even though he had been missing for thirty thousand years, the Heaven Protector Palace still stood arrogantly in this domain.At this moment, a young boy around the age of thirteen and a lowly old man with three golden teeth were standing outside of the Heaven Protector Palace.Just beyond the perimeter of the palace's outer city, Li Qiye burned ceremonial money while whispering: \u201cLittle Black Dragon, you don't have to worry. You have helped me regain my body, my life. One day, I will destroy the evil land to seek revenge for you.\u201dAfter the ceremony was over, Li Qiye stared at the Heaven Protector Palace in front of him. The scene was still the same, but the people were no longer there; everything had become foreign. He reminisced about the old days with the Little Black Dragon, the memory of them building this city from the ground up through their efforts was fresh in his mind.Unfortunately, after thirty thousand years, not many remembered the Dark Crow hiding behind the curtains.\u201cHeh, let us go back to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201d At this time, the old man glanced at Li Qiye and stated his purpose while revealing his three shiny golden teeth.\u201cLet us go.\u201d Li Qiye calmly nodded his head. No matter how illustrious or mysterious this old man might be, his origin could not surprise Li Qiye. Li Qiye had experienced countless difficulties and his soul had been trapped inside the Dark Crow for millions of years. Era after era, he walked together shoulder to shoulder alongside Immortal Emperors and became friends with the Alchemy God, so what could actually surprise him?As they were leaving, an extremely elegant and beautiful girl stepped out of the palace. She resembled an angel from heaven, an otherworldly goddess. The moment she stepped out, she inadvertently noticed the remains of the fire from the ceremony as well as some mysterious symbols beside it.After seeing these symbols, her expression greatly changed: \u201cWho was having a ceremony here just now?\u201dAn old servant nearby immediately went around to look for information and came back with results: \u201cThe city guards say that an old man and a young boy around the age of thirteen were here just now. They were burning ceremonial money.\u201dThe girl issued her command: \u201cGive chase and find them immediately.\u201d\u201cYour Highness is supposed to go to God's Mountain right now.\u201d The old servant hesitantly whimpered.The goddess softly yelled: \u201cFind them!\u201d Her body then disappeared as she flew across space to find the two.In the end, she was unable to find them. She dejectedly returned to the palace after her search. The symbols beside the fire remained in her head. These symbols hadn't appeared for a long time, so why was it that they appeared in the outskirts after tens of thousands of years? Were they friends or foes?An old loyal servant reported: \u201cYour Highness, we couldn't find the people who were burning the ceremonial money.\u201dThe goddess commanded with a serious demeanor: \u201cOrder everyone to keep in mind that if any news about those two people show up, immediately report back to me.\u201dThe servant was extremely surprised to hear this. With the current power of the Heaven Protector Palace and the reputation of their goddess, it would be rare for her to show such a serious expression.The servant asked: \u201cThen what about the trip to God's Mountain\u2026?\u201d\u201cCancel it!\u201d The goddess exclaimed: \u201cI have to read the ancient books that the ancestors have left behind. Something strange is happening.\u201dShe then immediately went to the deepest parts of the forbidden grounds in the Heaven Protector Palace.The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect resided in the nation of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom. This sect was an Immortal Emperor lineage with a long history. At the beginning of the Emperors Era, Immortal Emperor Min Ren proudly stood at the peak and established a sect, naming it Cleansing Incense.Unfortunately, after millions of years, it could not withstand the test of time and its unforgiving nature. The sect was no longer of the Immortal Emperor rank and could no longer rule the land like in the past. No matter how hard it tried, it could neither regain their ancient glory nor prevent their unrelenting and slow demise.\u201cElder, I have bad news. A mortal said that he wants us to accept him as the prime disciple.\u201d A disciple hurriedly reported to the first elder of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect as this elder was stepping outside.\u201cKick him off the mountain!\u201d Without giving the disciple a glance, the first elder continued: \u201cWhy would you even report something so ridiculous?\u201dA mortal wanting to become the prime disciple of their sect? What a joke. A prime disciple was the same as the sect master's protege, the one with the highest chance of becoming the future sect master. Of course, when the sect master wasn't present, the first elder could still personally take care of these matters.The disciple stuttered: \u201cBut, but he was recommended by Old Devil.\u201dRaising his eyebrows, the first elder unhappily repeated: \u201cOld Devil? Was he bribed by liquor? Is that why he is recommending a mortal?\u201dOld Devil belonged to the sect, but the sect did not want to recognize this geezer.Although the name sounded very heroic, this old man had caused the sect to lose all face.Old Devil had three \u201cgood\u201d qualities to him. He was very good at spending money, lying, and fooling around in brothels. This was why they called him Old Devil. [2]He had not cultivated any methods to the end, but he did have a very shocking background within the sect. Rumor has it that he was the bastard child of the previous sect master. This was why, when the last sect master passed away, he asked for the current sect master to take care of Old Devil.However, there was another rumor stating that Old Devil was a bastard from the sect master two generations ago. Because the previous sect master owed this person a great favor, he had no choice but to accept this piece of trash and unwillingly took care of Old Devil. Before the previous sect master passed away, he also asked the current sect master to take care of Old Devil.No matter who his father was, the whole sect and its upper echelons had no love for the old man. They detested the unflattering words regarding Old Devil's character and didn't care about the rumors in the world.From the elders to the lowest ranking disciples, the entire sect did not welcome this old man without any cultivation.The first elder yelled out in annoyance: \u201cSo what if it was Old Devil's recommendation? Kick the mortal off the mountain!\u201d His morning and good mood had been ruined by this event.\u201cBut, but he said he has the Cleansing Incense Ancient Order from Old Devil.\u201d The disciple stuttered once again out of fear.\u201cCleansing Incense Ancient Order?!\u201d After hearing these words, the first elder's expression darkened. After quietly contemplating the situation, he quickly ordered: \u201cGather all of the elders and tell the mortal to wait outside of the grand chamber.\u201dThe Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had a total of six elders. After hearing the four words \u201cCleansing Incense Ancient Order\u201d, the other five quickly came to the meeting.The patriarch of the sect was Immortal Emperor Min Ren, the one who left behind three of these orders. Two had been reclaimed by the sect, but the third one fell into the hands of Old Devil.Outside of the request from the previous sect master to take care of Old Devil, the second reason why the elders were helpless against him was because he possessed the last order.The order represented Immortal Emperor Min Ren; the holder could request anything from the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.Sitting in the grand chamber of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect while staring at an elusive statue covered in golden smoke, Li Qiye couldn't help but recall many stories from the past.The statue of Immortal Emperor Min Ren stood strong at the highest point of this location. Although many years had passed, the statue still carried an ancient aura seemingly capable of piercing the nine heavens. Spectators couldn't help but worship this statue; it was as if the emperor was actually in front of them.Li Qiye didn't know how to describe his feelings as he stared at this statue. The emperor was gone, but Li Qiye was still alive and forever will be. Although he had achieved his goal and regained his body, all of his old acquaintances had slowly disappeared in the river of time.1. Qi meaning seven, Ye meaning night2.

    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Emperor\u2019s DominationEmperor's Domination Chapter 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Qiye recalled that when the Ancient Ming Era was coming to an end and the Emperors Era began, his soul was still trapped in the body of the Dark Crow. And now, he was in this new era, an era where he temporarily regained his sanity and control of himself from the Immortal Demon Grotto after an eternity of struggle.When he first met Immortal Emperor Min Ren, Min Ren was still a little boy who was in love with martial arts, someone who had no knowledge of the grand cultivational world.The time between now and when he led Immortal Emperor Min Ren into the cultivation world was already many, many years. Many generations of experts had appeared and disappeared within the mysterious ocean of time.Inadvertently looking at the obsidian colored wooden stick next to the altar below the statue, Li Qiye couldn't help but slightly chuckle at the sight of it. He couldn't believe that the stick still existed after so many years.In the past, he made great use of it and disciplined that group of energetic children, including the Immortal Emperor, until they cried for their fathers and mothers.At this moment, the six elders from the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had all been gathered. Even though they were old, their blood energies were still as apparent as a rainbow with bright lights surrounding their bodies.Even though the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had declined, it was still an Immortal Emperor lineage. If the elders accepted the titles from the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, then they would all be Named Heroes.At this moment, the sharp gazes of these six elders were fixated on Li Qiye, as if they intended to uncover his secrets. However, Li Qiye remained calm and quietly sat in this uncomfortable atmosphere.Eventually, the first elder gravely inquired: \u201cWhere's the Cleansing Incense Ancient Order?\u201d The order was extremely important because it was an object left behind by their founding Immortal Emperor.Li Qiye slowly opened his palm to reveal the ancient order. He was surprised when Old Devil took him to the town below the sect's mountain and then ran off to a brothel. Before leaving, he casually threw the order into Li Qiye's hands. It was unbelievable that a person like this old man would have an ancient order.In the past, when Li Qiye was trapped inside the Dark Crow and when Min Ren shouldered the Heaven's Will, he gave the three ancient orders to Li Qiye. Later on, Li Qiye then gave these orders to different people. After millions of years, Li Qiye nostalgically stared at the order in his hand. In the past, he did not need them, but today, he had no choice but to rely on its authority.The six elders passed around the order and carefully examined it to confirm that it was indeed authentic. The truth was that the sect had wanted to reclaim the order for a long time, but they did not have a way to force it from Old Devil's hands. Old Devil knew that the order was equivalent to another life, thus he held onto it with his dear life. Who would have predicted that it would fall into the hands of a mortal without any reputation?The first elder coldly asked: \u201cWhere is Old Devil?\u201d In reality, the first elder harbored no love for Old Devil, a person who could only spend money, lie, and play with women. To him, it did not matter if Old Devil was the son of the previous sect master or not.Li Qiye calmly answered: \u201cHe went to Cui Hong Brothel.\u201dShadows could be seen on the six elders' faces. Even though they didn't like Old Devil, the thought of someone from their honorable sect visiting the most famous and popular brothel within a thousand mile radius was a source of great shame. And it wasn't like it was his first time visiting this brothel either. The elders had pent up anger and didn't know how to release it. They could only hope that such a notorious player wouldn't be part of their sect in the future.A different elder loudly asked: \u201cWhat is your demand?\u201d They didn't know the method Li Qiye employed to obtain it, but the truth was that the order in front of them was definitely not fake.Li Qiye slowly responded: \u201cI heard that the prime disciple position of the sect is still unoccupied. Since Old Devil fervently recommended me due to my talents, I have no choice but to ask for this position.\u201dAfter hearing his answer, the six elders started to curse Old Devil. That goddamned bastard, what rights did he have to recommend someone to become the prime disciple of their sect? It was an extremely important position, so the sect had to carefully select the right individual. Otherwise, the spot would have already been occupied.An elder spoke with a cold voice: \u201cDon't treat the prime disciple position as a joke!\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Li Qiye calmly and slowly enunciated his words without fear: \u201cHowever, the person who carries the order has the right to demand any request \u2014 this was the rule established by Immortal Emperor Min Ren.\u201dThe first elder interjected with a threatening question: \u201cWhat if you used an underhanded method to obtain this order?\u201d This position wasn't something that could be joked about or given out without any thought.Li Qiye replied in a domineering manner: \u201cI understand. Elders fear that I might have used dishonest means to force the order from the hands of Old Devil. Since you six do not trust me, you can send people to Cui Hong Brothel for confirmation.\u201dDeep in their hearts, the elders cried out in pain every time they heard the name \u201cCui Hong Brothel.\u201d In the end, they had no choice but to send disciples to confirm the what Li Qiye said.A moment later, a disciple confirmed that Li Qiye's words were indeed true. The disciple tried his best to leave out information regarding Old Devil's joyful and debaucherous situation with the girls right now. Otherwise, the elders might have gone crazy.Unwilling as they may be, the elders had to follow the rules given to them by the patriarch. Even if the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect has fallen, their lineage was still that of an Immortal Emperor's. Thus, they could not dishonor the reputation left behind by their ancestor.Ultimately, the elders issued a command: \u201cBring out the Truth Mirror.\u201dThe Truth Mirror shone on Li Qiye's body. Any mortal who wanted to join a sect for cultivation purposes had to be judged by this type of mirror. It tested for one's physique, life wheel, and fate palace.Within the mirror, Li Qiye's reflection appeared. It was a hazy, unstable shadow that seemed as if it would disappear at a moment's notice. Behind this reflection's head, an illusive blood halo appeared, and above this halo was a dim light \u2014 both were extremely feeble.\u201cA mortal physique, a mortal life wheel, and his destiny shows that he has a mortal fate palace.\u201d The disciple reported the Truth Mirror's findings on Li Qiye's innate talents and physical condition.Every person had a physique, life wheel, and fate palace. The physique directly affected one's physical strength, the life wheel indicated one's longevity, and the fate palace showed one's innate talent for cultivation.Li Qiye's mortal physique, mortal life wheel, and mortal fate palace silenced the elders. He was the most average of men; the sect could go outside and grab any commoner from the streets and they would also have the same talents.\u201cIf you want to become the prime disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, then forget about King and Saint Physiques, at the very least, you would need to have a Xiantian Physique. Your life wheel also has to be around the same level. Your abilities are not fit for this position.\u201d The first elder directly rejected Li Qiye.\u201cI am aware of my talents.\u201d Li Qiye didn't want to think too much of it and casually spoke: \u201cBut I still want to be the prime disciple.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The elders were extremely aggravated by these words. This person was not qualified to even become a normal disciple, let alone the prime disciple! This was one of the most unreasonable requests they had ever heard.\u201cI trust that the descendants of the Immortal Emperor would neither go back on their words nor violate the ancestral rule and bring shame to the sect and lineage.\u201d Li Qiye played around with the order in his hand and slowly continued: \u201cIf this order were to fall into another's hands, the result would be unimaginable.\u201dHearing this, the expressions of the six elders froze. The first elder gazed at him and coldly retorted: \u201cEven if such a thing happened, anyone who wants to become the prime disciple of our sect has to be tested in all aspects. This ranges from their origin to their background as well as their innate talents. After all, the sect will not allow an unqualified candidate to take the position.\u201d\u201cThat is your problem.\u201d Li Qiye stared at the six elders and said: \u201cIf you think another sect sent me to steal your Immortal Emperor's heritage, then let me tell you that I would not need to become the prime disciple. Due to this virtuous order, I can just ask for them; there would be no need to bother becoming the prime disciple. You should know this better than myself! If I wanted to harm the sect, it would not be a difficult feat with the power of this order.\u201dLi Qiye's words made the elders glance at each other. Even though they were a bit ambivalent, they didn't entirely trust Li Qiye.\u201cHe is not exactly without reason.\u201d Elder Cao, one of the six elders, slowly responded: \u201cIf the order keeps on wandering around outside, wouldn't that be a hidden danger to us? We cannot refuse anyone with the order, so we might as well accept his request.\u201dThe first elder coldly replied: \u201cHmph\u2026 This matter cannot be taken lightly!\u201dAnother elder mused: \u201cFrom the past till now, the prime disciple has always been the disciple directly under the sect master. Whether we accept his request or not, either way, we must first ask for the sect master's opinion regarding this decision, then make the choice afterward.\u201d\u201cThis makes sense. In the end, the prime disciple would be the direct disciple of the sect master.\u201d The remaining elders agreed.After the six elders finished debating, the first elder immediately commanded: \u201cSend a letter to the sect master.\u201dThe letter was quickly sent to Sect Master Su Yonghuang, and the six elders received a reply very quickly. To their surprise, the reply was that the sect master had actually allowed for Li Qiye to become the prime disciple.The first elder read the letter three times and confirmed that he didn't misread, so he angrily yelled: \u201cTruly unbelievable! The sect master is being too rash!\u201dElder Cao persuaded with words: \u201cBrother Gu, if the sect master has agreed, then why are we still debating? In the end, the prime disciple is still the direct disciple of the sect master, so the choice is in the sect master's hands.\u201d\u201cThe sect master is being too rash, ah!\u201d Another elder shook his head and sighed.Elder Cao forcefully smiled: \u201cSo be it, we have no other choice. Ultimately, if we can recover the order, then we will have done a great service to the sect.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He only chuckled out loud: \u201cMe becoming the prime disciple should warrant a weapon or two for my personal safety, right?\u201dAll the elders were surprised to see how comfortable he was under this heavy atmosphere. In the end, the boy was only thirteen years old, but his calm demeanor resembled that of a tyrant's that dominated one sphere with everything under their control. How could a mortal like him have such a courageous spirit?The first elder took a glance at Li Qiye and shook his head while telling him: \u201cAlthough we accepted you as the prime disciple, we can only give you a normal weapon. If you desire a formidable treasure or an Immortal Emperor Merit Law, you will have to contribute to the sect.\u201dLi Qiye only smirked. His goal was certainly not an Immortal Emperor Merit Law or a peerless technique. His true aim was the black wooden stick lying on the pedestal. While averting his gaze to the stick, Li Qiye pressed on: \u201cFine, I want that wooden stick.\u201d\u201cThat wooden stick?\u201d The six elders' bodies shook in surprise.The stick was only used for gathering the ashes after a ceremonial burning to honor the ancestors. It had always been there, and no one had any interest in it.The elders thought that Li Qiye would ask for treasures using his new status, but he simply wanted a wooden stick. This request was outside of their expectations.Li Qiye spoke in an unrestrained manner: \u201cSince I am the prime disciple, my position is worthy of respect. The stick belongs to the grand chamber, and this is the Ancestral Grand Chamber of the entire sect. It represents the power of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, so it is worthy of my current position as the prime disciple\u2026\u201dAfter hearing Li Qiye's logic, the six elders looked at each other with their eyes wide open. They thought to themselves: 'This idiotic brat and that goddamned playboy Old Devil definitely belong together, just like how an ox seeks another ox while a horse would find another horse.' [1. Stupid people come together would be the meaning here.]\u201cSo be it, we shall bestow this stick upon you.\u201d The first elder was happy to give this worthless stick to Li Qiye if it meant that he didn't have to hear any more of Li Qiye's incessant babbling. To him, this stick was only a regular wooden stick meant to move the ashes; they might as well give it to Li Qiye.\u201cMany thanks to Honorable Elders.\u201d Li Qiye was eagerly waiting for those words. Before his words finished coming out of his mouth, his hands were already holding the stick. This action, in the eyes of the six elders, was seen as being very naive.\u201cHuairen, take him to his resting quarters.\u201d An elder finally became impatient and told a nearby disciple to send Li Qiye away.Today's events had greatly stressed the six elders. A wastrel has become the prime disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect... Even if the sect had long passed its glory days, it was not destitute enough to accept a waste of a human being as the prime disciple.Led by the disciple, Li Qiye approached a solitary peak. It was not small; on top of it laid a small villa the size of 36,000 square meters.It was apparent that the villa had been abandoned for a long time due to the weeds and wild plants that surrounded it. Although this peak was far from everything, it was still part of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.After opening the doors, the disciple immediately said: \u201cJunior Brot\u2014, no, First Brother, this place will be your home from now on.\u201dHe only spoke two words before he quickly realized his mistake.Based on the time Li Qiye joined the sect, Li Qiye would be his junior. However, because he was the prime disciple, anyone within the third generation \u2013 no matter how young or old \u2013 would have to call him First Brother.Li Qiye gave this wily disciple a glance and looked around before nodding his head: \u201cThis peak that's so distant from the rest of the sect is a suitable location.\u201dThe disciple smilingly spoke: \u201cIt has a very fitting name, Lonely Peak.\u201d He peeked at Li Qiye a few times before continuing: \u201cYou will be the master of this peak in the future.\u201dThe truth was that according to the rules of the sect, the prime disciple had the right to live on the peak closest to the ancestral ground. The sect owned many peaks, and the prime disciple could choose any peak for himself.However, most of the main peaks of the sect were occupied. Moreover, all six elders were unhappy with Li Qiye. Thus, Li Qiye was exiled to this faraway place, away from the main peaks.The main peaks located near the ancestral ground contained a thicker worldly essence than the outside mountains and inferior peaks.Li Qiye naturally stated: \u201cThis place will be just fine.\u201d He was not a petty man that would place importance on such trivial matters.\u201cI have brought over all the daily necessities for First Brother earlier.\u201d This junior brother thoroughly handled matters with ease and experience. After taking care of all the items necessary for Li Qiye's daily needs, he politely said: \u201cIf you need anything else, just come to the outer court to find me.\u201dBefore the disciple departed, Li Qiye casually asked: \u201cWhat is your name?\u201dThe disciple was surprised by the sudden question. He did not think highly of Li Qiye. His talents were lacking to the point that he would not even be accepted as a regular disciple.Li Qiye's actions earlier in the chamber caused others to feel that he was stupid. However, the current Li Qiye who was calm and natural made this disciple feel perplexed inside; he didn't know whether Li Qiye was crazy or if he had thought through everything beforehand.This disciple quickly regained his wits and answered Li Qiye: \u201cFirst Brother, this junior brother's name is Nan Huairen. I am a caretaker of the outer court.\u201d\u201cMy name is Li Qiye.\u201d Li Qiye gently nodded.In the last million years, the ones who knew his true origin and name could be counted one's fingers.After Nan Huairen's departure, Li Qiye did not sit idle. He began to clean up the yard and tidied up the whole mountain. After completing the task to an acceptable standard, the deserted mountain resembled more of a home.Li Qiye did everything in a systematic and neat manner, slow but steady. If any accidental passersby were to witness his cleaning actions, they wouldn't believe that he was only thirteen years old.The sky had darkened by the time the tedious task was completed. Li Qiye felt tired and hungry. He slowly sat down in front of the villa. Taking in a deep breath, he took out the wooden stick that was now placed by his waist. He carefully observed the stick that people used to move ashes. His memories slowly came back to him, causing him to show a bitter smile.The world believed that if an Immortal Emperor succeeded in shouldering the Heaven's Will, they would become immortal. However, if that was the case, then where were Immortal Emperor Min Ren, Immortal Emperor Tun Ri, and all the other peerless cultivators from each era? Where did they go?Li Qiye slowly regained his composure and removed the dust and ash from the stick, eventually revealing its true form. This was a stick that measured one meter. Even after being doused in fire for thousands of years, it had retained its original form without faults. In the eyes of others, however, this was only an ordinary wooden stick without any magical properties.Li Qiye whispered as he gently wiped the wooden stick: \u201cSerpent Punishing Stick!\u201dWith this wooden stick in his hand, his memories caused him to feel unexplainable emotions.Back in those days when Min Ren was without the Heaven's Will, Li Qiye, as the master of this future Immortal Emperor, had taught a group of children that would be the loyal generals of Min Ren. Since Li Qiye wanted to groom them well, he specifically took the Serpent Punishing Stick from the Demon Forest.Those teenagers that would stomp the Nine Worlds under their feet were all victims of this stick. After concluding their training, he left the stick here in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, and here it has remained until now.Gripping the stick tightly, Li Qiye immersed himself even deeper within his memories. Escaping the Immortal Demon Grotto was a success, and he finally regained his body and soul from the control of the Dark Crow.However, time was not merciful. Everyone who used to be his friends and families, such as the Alchemy God, Immortal Emperor Xue Xi, Immortal Emperor Min Ren\u2026 and even the illustrious Black Dragon King that survived three eras, have all left this world.At the beginning of the Desolate Era, he was only a young shepherd. In order to find a lost sheep, he went into the grotto and became imprisoned by the Immortal Demon Grotto. He was forced to follow the path his master envisioned in his crow body from era to era.At that moment, Li Qiye was very scared. He flew without rest across the Forbidden Burials, traveling across the nine lands, across the Nine Worlds\u2026 And in the end, he still had no choice but to return to the Immortal Demon Grotto.However, because of this, he had experienced the countless dangers and mysteries of the worlds. He trod through lands that even an unbeatable Virtuous Paragon would stay away from. His willpower, basked in hardships throughout the eras, became unshakable.From then on, he was unwilling to forever stay as a slave of the Immortal Demon Grotto. He formulated a grand plan to cut off all the immortal spirit seals and formations within his soul.In order to escape the body of the Dark Crow, for his own freedom and to regain his body, he continuously led many geniuses on the road of cultivation. The greatest of these young ones were able to fight on the peerless road under the sky to obtain the Heaven's Will.But today, when Li Qiye returned to his old body to become human once again, all his friends had left him.Taking his last, deep breath to set aside his pain, he once again strengthened his resolve to destroy all obstacles and shatter the souls of those in the Immortal Demon Grotto.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The upper echelons were unhappy, but they couldn't do anything with regards to this matter due to the ancient order. A useless person like Li Qiye was only lucky, that was all.However, the third generation was extremely riled up. The prime disciple would have originally been one of them and would have to be the one with the greatest contributions as well as one who passed all the tests given by the elders.He would be blessed with the sect master's teachings and gain exposure to emperor level techniques. Ultimately, he would most likely become the sect master in the future.In the current situation, no one within the second generation of disciples was chosen, meaning that the prime disciple would definitely be chosen from the third generation disciples.The ones that rebelled the most were the most gifted disciples with the highest aptitudes and origins; they felt cheated by Li Qiye. Thus, the commotion in the sect was chaotic.A few geniuses angrily declared: \u201cA mortal with a mortal physique, mortal life wheel, and mortal fate palace has no right to be the prime disciple.\u201dAnother talented youth added: \u201cHe is the biggest disgrace to our sect.\u201d\u201cWho can blame him for obtaining the Cleansing Incense Ancient Order? Even the elders have accepted it.\u201d A few of the older geniuses lamented, but they could only accept the situation.\u201cHmph, he is only the prime disciple for now. One without talent and strength cannot compete for the sect master's seat. Who is to say that the prime disciple will certainly become the next sect master?\u201d The most arrogant and confident disciples shared this sentiment.Someone who was a bit eager spoke: \u201cIf he doesn't know right from wrong, I wouldn't mind teaching him a little bit.\u201dEven when Li Qiye really didn't have the qualifications to compete for the sect master's seat, all the disciples still felt cheated inside when they have to call a useless youth like Li Qiye \u201cFirst Brother\u201d.A disciple curiously asked: \u201cIsn't the last remaining Cleansing Incense Ancient Order in the hands of Old Devil? How did it fall into the hands of that little brat?\u201dThe fact that Old Devil possessed the last order was not a big secret. The sect had always wanted to reclaim it, but Old Devil never agreed. This was why everyone was perplexed about it coming into Li Qiye's possession.Another disciple coldly replied: \u201cHehe, I heard that this brat has some wit, I just don't know how he fooled the perverted old man.\u201cI heard that when the elders ordered people to confirm this matter, Old Devil was having fun in the brothel. It could very well be that the brat invited him to play as much as he wanted in order to trade for the ancient order.\u201d Here, this disciple scowled and felt nauseous.Hearing this story, the other disciples contemptuously exclaimed: \u201cSo he and that perverted old man are the same!\u201dEven though rumor has it that Old Devil was a child of a certain sect master, the entire sect did not welcome such a perverted old man that only knew how to spend money and fool around. This was especially true for the third generation disciples, they did not have the slightest bit of respect for him. If it wasn't for the will of the last sect master, he would have been kicked out of the sect already.If Li Qiye and Old Devil were the same type of people, then they would find Li Qiye even more distasteful.Three days has yet to pass and Li Qiye had not yet greeted the ancestor, but the sect received an invitation from the Nine Saint Demon Gate.\u201cWhat! The Nine Saint Demon Gate wants to test Li Qiye?\u201d After receiving the news, the six elders were shocked.One of the elders became increasingly paranoid and lamentably spoke: \u201cThey've heard the news so quickly. He only became the prime disciple recently, yet they already want to test him.\u201dAnother elder chimed in: \u201cIt seems like they want to escape the promise of the past. A piece of trash like Li Qiye will never pass their test. That is why they want to force and expedite the issue.\u201d\u201cWe no longer have a choice.\u201d The first elder reluctantly spoke: \u201cRight now, the Nine Saint Demon Gate rules an entire country. We cannot compare to them, so we are not in a position to negotiate.\u201dHis words caused everyone to fall into silence. In the beginning of the Emperors Era, their sect was invincible, their reputation intoxicated the Nine Worlds, and their strength allowed them to rule an ancient kingdom. All other sects submitted to their might. No existence in the entire world could have been a threat to the position of the old Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.However, the glories of old disappeared with the passage of time. They no longer had the power to rule a regular country, let alone an ancient kingdom. They lost the privilege of granting titles such as Named Hero or Royal Noble to their followers.Another elder asked: \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201dAll of the elders knew that a mortal like Li Qiye had no chance of passing the examination from the Nine Saint Demon Gate.\u201cCure a dead horse into a living one, there's no other choice!\u201d Another elder answered: \u201cIf he somehow succeeds, then we would become in-laws with the Nine Saint Demon Gate. If this were to be the case, then the Heavenly God Sect and the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom would not dare to look down upon us.\u201dTowards this impossible dream, the six elders could only forcefully laugh. No matter what, they still had to try.Li Qiye was waiting in his villa for the ancestor's ceremony when Nan Huairen approached him.Nan Huairen quickly reported: \u201cFirst Brother, the elders are calling for you in the grand chamber.\u201dLi Qiye nonchalantly asked: \u201cDid something major happen?\u201dNan Huairen was a bit surprised, but he didn't hide anything. He nodded and replied: \u201cI will not lie to you, First Brother. The Nine Saint Demon Gate sent us an invitation.\u201dHe paused for a second and glanced at Li Qiye before continuing: \u201cI heard your fiancee wants to test your abilities.\u201d\u201cNine Saint Demon Gate!\u201d Li Qiye suddenly recalled an old memory when he heard this name.Nan Huairen thought Li Qiye didn't know of this sect, so he quickly explained: \u201cThe Nine Saint Demon Gate is one of the biggest sects in the Grand Middle Territory. They rule over the Old Ox Country and has the rights to grant titles. Our two sects used to have an amicable and close relationship. The original patriarch of Nine Saint used to be called the Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon. He was the number one general under our Immortal Emperor Min Ren and followed him to sweep through the Nine Worlds. When we ruled over an ancient kingdom, even the Nine Saint Demon Gate had to pay tributes to us.\u201d\u201cI have heard of the sect.\u201d Li Qiye gently smiled. How could he not know about the sect? Moreover, he had met the Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon as well.During the early days of the Emperors Era, Li Qiye spent an absurd amount of time and energy to trap this demonic monster named Nine Saint and forced him to be Min Ren's fate protector.Li Qiye asked: \u201cWhere did this fiancee come from?\u201dNan Huairen answered: \u201cFrom the legends of when our patriarch accepted the Heaven's Will and became the Immortal Emperor, the Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon formed a pact with us. If their prime descendant was female while ours was male, we would become in-laws.\u201dAfter pausing for a moment, he dejectedly sighed: \u201cAt that time, they were climbing up the ranks.\u201d\u201cI think that in the past, the Old Chicken had a female disciple.\u201d After listening, Li Qiye quietly mumbled once again while recalled the past. He had forgotten about it after falling into deep sleep as it wasn't a matter of great importance.\u201cWhat did you say, Great Brother?\u201d Nan Huairen inquired since he didn't hear it.Li Qiye smoothly averted the inquiry: \u201cNothing. So their prime descendant right now is a woman?\u201d\u201cIt is known that between the two of our sects, there has not existed any in-law relationships for a long time. In this era, their prime descendant is indeed a woman.\u201d He paused for a second to look at Li Qiye's expression: \u201cI also hear that their descendant, Li Shuangyan, has an innate king physique.\u201dHearing Nan Huairen's story, Li Qiye had a complete understanding of the situation. The Nine Saint Demon Gate naturally didn't want to marry off a descendant with such an aptitude and potential to a disciple of a declining sect.Li Qiye slightly chuckled: \u201cThat makes things a little more interesting.\u201dNan Huairen shockingly stared at the calm Li Qiye. He felt strange that an ordinary boy at the age of thirteen was able to face everything like a Royal Noble who had gone through numerous trials.If it was someone else having heard Nan Huairen's words, they would become anxious, frightened even. However, Li Qiye completely betrayed common sense and carried on with his nonchalant attitude.The first elder coldly asked once Li Qiye entered the ancestral chamber: \u201cHas Nan Huairen informed you of the current situation?\u201dTruth be told, the six elders did not welcome a wastrel like Li Qiye. However, due to the current situation, they hoped that he wouldn't be completely useless and that he could pass the trial of the Nine Saint Demon Gate through sheer luck. At this moment, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect truly needed a strong backing, such as becoming in-laws with a giant like the Nine Saint Demon Gate. Even though the chance of success was extremely small, they still wanted to try.Li Qiye lightly nodded his head: \u201cHonorable Elder, I understand completely.\u201d\u201cGood! As long as you can pass the trial, we will handsomely reward you.\u201d The first elder's tone was as cold as ice as if to mock Li Qiye's calm demeanor.Li Qiye elegantly smiled and politely said: \u201cI am very willing to attend the trial, but I have three conditions.\u201d\u201cImpudent!\u201d One of the elders yelled: \u201cYou dare to negotiate in front of the elders?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If I were to actually pass the trials, it would be a great contribution to the sect. The hardworking should be rewarded, no? It should only be natural for me to provide some conditions considering the danger of the task.\u201dThis elder was extremely unhappy with Li Qiye's attitude, so he roared his response: \u201cThen wait until you have passed the trial, we can discuss them then!\u201d\u201cSo be it!\u201d The first elder nodded his head then continued: \u201cDon't you worry. As long as you pass the trial, you are free to select any cultivation methods with the exception of Heaven's Will Secret Laws and Immortal Emperor merit laws. I don't think the other elders will have any objections to this.\u201dThe six elders glanced at each other and contemplated the notion. If he indeed passes the trial, then the elder's suggestion was completely reasonable.\u201cThe other conditions can wait until after the trial.\u201d Li Qiye finally smiled: \u201cHowever, there is one condition that I must state beforehand so that there will be ample time for preparation. Once I reach the Physique Accumulation level, I require a medicinal paste of the Saint grade.\"After hearing Li Qiye's request, the faces of all six elders turned sour; they collectively yelled out at the same time: \u201cHow greedy can you be?\u201dLi Qiye pretended to not hear their loud yell and continued while slowly enunciating each word: \u201cElders, the marriage between our two sects is a great matter. If things go well, it would be an enormous contribution to the sect. A Saint grade medicinal paste might be precious, but I believe that it is a fair trade.\u201dThis elder was unhappy and coldly snorted: \u201cHmmph, you think a medicinal paste of the Saint grade is so easily obtainable?!\u201dThe first elder then glanced at Li Qiye and said: \"If you are successful, then rewarding a Saint grade paste isn't too outrageous. But right now, we cannot accommodate you because we lack certain integral efficacious medicines for the Saint paste recipe.\u201dLooking at the elder's body language, Li Qiye secretly sighed in disappointment. He was thinking too highly of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. In the past, its treasure trove was practically boundless. It even contained Immortal grade pastes, so Saint pastes were trivial in comparison.\u201cFine, I will take one step back; I want the highest grade of King paste!\u201dThe elders glanced at each other. Eventually, the first elder conceded: \u201cThis I can accept, but the condition is that you will still have to be successful.\u201dLi Qiye smiled at the first elder and replied: \u201cOutside of this, I have another small request before I leave for the Nine Saint Demon Gate. Without knowing how dangerous it will be, I will need to learn some techniques and have one or two defensive weapons.\u201dElder Cao, one of the six elders, spoke with discontent: \u201cHa, so it seems that you are still a bit wily and trying to taking advantage of this situation for personal gains.\u201dThe first elder actually sympathized with this notion and nodded his head: \u201cHow about this, in the inner sect are techniques and weapons, you can pick one and only one. What do the other elders think?\u201dEven though the other elders didn't want to accommodate Li Qiye, they still agreed with the first elder. They knew the chance of success for Li Qiye was near zero. Even if they gave him weapons and techniques, it wouldn't raise the probability by much, but a bit is better than none.\u201cElders are worrying too much, I'm not that greedy.\u201d Li Qiye naturally knew the thoughts of the elders and calmly smiled: \u201cI heard that we have a technique named the 'Invisible Dual Blades' that can be learned in no time at all. I want this technique as well as a pair of blades to accompany it. Would this be acceptable?\u201dThe elders rolled their eyes from surprise after hearing Li Qiye. They originally thought that this greedy boy would ask for Emperor level techniques, but it turned out that he actually wanted a normal technique.\u201cInvisible Dual Blades eh?\u201d The first elder stroked his beard.Another elder quickly responded: \u201cFirst Elder, it is only a martial technique and insufficient for practical use. In the world of cultivation, even the simplest merit law would outperform any martial art.\u201d This elder was responsible for merit law assignments in the sect, so he was very knowledgeable with regards to their manuals.\u201cThat is not a problem! Nan Huairen, bring the 'Invisible Dual Blades' to his peak and give him the best pair of dual blades.\u201d The first elder was happy with this simple request. His opinion of Li Qiye decreased from Li Qiye's unwise decision. One would think that the sect would want to give all the assistance they could afford to help Li Qiye, but deep down inside, all the elders knew that no matter what techniques and weapons they give to him, completing the trial would still be impossible. They only aimed to minimize the losses for their sect.Seeing Li Qiye not being greedy, an elder was satisfied and generously asked: \u201cDo you have any other requests?\u201dLi Qiye humbly replied: \u201cThis little one does not need anything else at this moment.\u201dThe first elder gravely said: \u201cGood, go back and prepare, you shall depart in three days. After your return, you can complete the ancestral ceremony to ascend to your position.\u201dOf course, that's only if he could return alive . The elders had great doubts.Nan Huairen brought the technique and blades to Li Qiye's peak right after he returned.He was satisfied with the Crescent Moon Blades. The blades' curves occasionally shone with sharpness. However, these were merely of Mortal grade and not fit for cultivators. No matter how sharp the edges were, it couldn't compare to magical armaments.After Nan Huairen left, Li Qiye slowly read the \u201cInvisible Dual Blades\u201d technique. Every word and phrase spoken by him would be replicated in his mind.Back then when he was still the Dark Crow, even though he had successfully escaped the Immortal Demon Grotto, his situation has yet to stabilize. Sometimes would still be affected by the grotto. Whenever he felt like this, he would immediately seal himself and force his soul to fall into a deep slumber.He had spent many tortuous years in each era to go to the most dangerous locations. He had fallen to the hands of many masters and had to surpass many tribulations, but because of this, he was able to see many merit laws, even Emperor merit laws and immortal methods.Because he was afraid that one day he wouldn't be able to control himself and be summoned back to the Immortal Demon Grotto, he always removed his memories regarding the methods and techniques he had learned to avoid them falling into the hands of the grotto. However, the Alchemy God and Immortal Emperor Xue Xi came up with a mysterious method that allowed Li Qiye to quickly understand the truths of these supreme techniques the moment he saw them again.Right now, everything that was pertinent to mastering the \u201cInvisible Dual Blades\u201d had been recalled. Taking a deep breath and comparing the manual in his head against the version written in front of him, he found that the technique was lacking a certain something \u2014 this worried him greatly.In reality, it was normal for techniques such as the Invisible Dual Blades to be missing parts. In the end, it was not enough to reach the apex. In the eyes of cultivators, this was only a minor art. After millions of years, no many people in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect actually learned this technique.Focusing his mind once again, Li Qiye finally understood the hidden truths behind the technique and softly smiled.Even though his physique, life wheel, and fate palace were all of Mortal grade, his knowledge and willpower were above what all geniuses had.What was even more important was that when he was the Dark Crow, he underwent numerous methods of torture. There was a time when he was imprisoned for ten thousand years without seeing the sun, so his willpower was extremely fortified. Nothing could ever shake it, and no difficulties could ever make him take a step back.He gently patted the manual. His attempt at mastering the technique had awakened his memory of the past, a secret that no disciple knew in the current era.That year, the young Min Ren used to practice the \u201cInvisible Dual Blades\u201d technique. Later, when he became an Immortal Emperor that ruled over the Nine Worlds, he reminisced about this technique. He once again cultivated it, slowly perfecting the normal martial technique.Of course, this normal technique was not comparable to the Emperor merit laws that he had created as well, let alone the Heaven's Will Secret Laws. Min Ren himself did not want his descendants to practice this technique, either. Thus, the technique had lied dormant in the library of the sect for millenniums. No one had understood the illustrious truths behind the technique moulded by an Immortal Emperor post ascension.When Li Qiye saw Min Ren perfecting the technique, he would always tease him. Even if this martial technique was cultivated to its apex and was capable of slaying Royal Nobles, no one would want to use it. Normal cultivators could only see the external qualities, thus this martial technique resided in the darkness.Even after being teased by Li Qiye, Immortal Emperor Min Ren only smiled. It was unexpected that Li Qiye actually guessed correctly about the fate of this martial art.Emptying his mind of unnecessary thoughts, he picked up the dual blades and started to practice. He was extremely strict with himself. He slowly swung each stroke within the manual; each swing required perfection before moving on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He demanded perfection, but it was difficult to reach.However, Li Qiye was not deterred. He kept on practicing the martial art that became more refined after each swing. After one night, he had swung the blades more than three hundred times and slowly grasped the profound truth. Slowly, each of his blades became more and more accurate.Even though he had innumerable memories and heaven-frightening secrets, he understood that if he wanted to completely decimate the Immortal Demon Grotto, he must increase his efforts by ten fold, no, a hundred fold in order to achieve his goal. No one understood the Immortal Demon Grotto better than him in the current era.In these three days, Li Qiye had not left his villa. He imprisoned himself in the inner sanctum to perfect his blades. There were too many uncertainties in life, so he must be in peak shape to combat any disaster that may come.Three days later, the journey to the Nine Saint Demon Gate was about to begun. Only Nan Huairen and a sect protector with the surname Mo were coming along.The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had a total of six elders, twelve protectors, and thirty-six sectional leaders. To visit a grand sect such as the Nine Saint Demon Gate with only three people, the highest ranked member being a mere protector... there were no words to describe this.Before the departure, Li Qiye looked at the shabby members and asked: \u201cOnly us three?\u201dProtector Mo, the master of Nan Huairen, was very frugal with his words. After he heard the question, he only glanced at Li Qiye without answering.Opposite of his master, Nan Huairen was a playful fellow; he coughed once in shame and opened his mouth: \u201cFirst Brother, all of the elders are in secluded cultivation; they could not make the trip.\u201dLi Qiye perked his lips and coldly declared: \u201cSecluded cultivation? They are only afraid of losing face. In the end, they believe I have no chance of passing the trial. Me not passing is a small matter to them, but them being there and losing face would be a big deal, right?\u201dNan Huairen couldn't say anything and only shamefully smiled. How could a mortal expect to pass the trial of an Emperor level sect? The elders had the same thoughts. This was why they refused to go, since the result was already clear as day.\u201cDon't worry, Honorable Brother.\u201d Nan Huairen kept his positive attitude: \u201cThe Nine Saint Demon Gate has kept its distance from us in recent times, this is why the elders don't want to go and create unnecessary conflicts.\u201d\u201cHmmph, it is only the Nine Saint Demon Gate, they can't reach the apex. In that era, even if the Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon was alive, they would still have to bow down to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201dProtector Mo could only ignore Li Qiye's arrogance. He only coldly snort, not bothering to say anything.Nan Huairen was afraid that Li Qiye would say even more outrageous things, so he interrupted: \u201cFirst Brother, this is my master, a protector of the sect.\u201d\u201cPlease take care of me on this trip.\" Li Qiye bowed with just the right amount of courtesy and respect \u2014 not too forced yet not too weak.Protector Mo gave him another glance and said: \u201cLet us go.\u201dFinished with his words, he turned around and walked away. Protector Mo was one of the older protectors, so his cultivation was above average. However, he doesn't know how to socially interact with others. Thus, his position in the sect was quite low relative to the other protectors. Otherwise, he would not be a part of this great expedition that was doomed from the start.The upper echelons of the sect knew that this trip would become a comedic play with Li Qiye as the main character. If the audience was not happy, death might be inevitable, and that was another reason why the six elders evaded it. The other protectors were not willing to lead this group, so this assignment eventually fell on the shoulders of Protector Mo.Protector Mo also thought that no positive results would come out of this trip, which was why his mood had been even sourer than normal.The long trip was filled with silence until they reached the grand temple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. The grand temple was huge and could contain ten thousand people. Looking through all of the Grand Middle Territory, it would be difficult to find a comparable temple within the other heritages.The jade-colored temple was extremely ancient. It was built with heavenly stones and crystals. Up above was calligraphy personally carved by Immortal Emperor Min Ren. The words exuded a courageous aura, deep beyond fathoming. Each word and phrase seemed as if it could erase existences. From this grand temple, one could appreciate the old power of the dying sect.This temple was the starting point for all of the conquests the great Emperor took part in. Min Ren would conduct ceremonies here before embarking on his expeditions that would encompass the entire Nine Worlds. Only an Immortal Emperor sect could possess such a temple.\u201cBang\u2026\u201d As the entrance was opened, a gateway could be seen inside. Colored and tempered by divine crystals, the hulk was covered by empty holes and Immortal Emperor carvings. The empty holes were there to be filled with refined jades.Refined jades were formed by the natural spiritual power of the heaven and earth, the very essence of what makes cultivation possible. Its main purpose was to operate gateways in order to traverse far distances. The distance of travel was determined by the quantity and quality of the refined jades.Unfortunately, the current gateway only had a few refined jades inside. Once again, Li Qiye was saddened by how far the sect had fallen. In the past, this gateway, with its abundance of jades, had brought many armies to faraway places in the Nine Worlds. Any location was possible as long as the coordinates were known.They entered the gateway and, in the blink of an eye, warped to a different location.The Grand Middle Territory was huge and spanned billions of miles. There were countless sects spread across fifteen countries. However, there were gigantic monsters like Kingdoms and Ancient Kingdoms that spanned billions of miles by themselves.If one wanted to cross a country by flying, it would take many years unless they were an Enlightened Being or Heavenly King. Any Named Hero or Royal Noble would be wise enough not to attempt this feat. Plus, the Grand Middle Territory was only one part of the Mortal Emperor World.The Mortal Emperor World was also known as the Emperor Boundary or Emperor Country and consisted of five different regions. In the north lies the Northern Grand Sea, the south has the Barren Earth, the east forms the Hundred Cities, the west contains the Desolate Wasteland, and the middle was the Grand Middle Territory.\u201cBang\u2026\u201d Li Qiye and his companions arrived at the gateway of the Nine Saint Demon Gate.As they stepped out, they felt that the natural spirit essence was denser than any place they had been to. This was truly a heavenly sect as far as the eye could see.The location of the Nine Saint Demon Gate spanned for millions of miles. It was filled with mountains and rivers with majestic waterfalls and heavenly trees that could pierce the heavens. There were also marble palaces floating and hiding in the clouds as far as the eye could see. In the deepest recesses, one could find penetrating auras that radiantly shone across the land. One would believe that the origin of these auras stemmed from shocking heavenly treasures.This was the picture of a powerful sect. With this atmosphere and location, it was no wonder why it could rule over a country. In comparison, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was akin to a destitute old man at the end of his life.\u201cI see that it is Older Brother Mo, long time no see.\u201d When the three of them left the gateway, an old man could be seen leading his disciples for the welcoming party.The man was a sectional leader of their sect. His last name was Fu, the owner of a cold and stoic face. His eyes contained a powerful gaze and his body radiated a shining aura. His natural disposition was one that could instill fear in weaker souls.Even though he was only a sectional leader, he possessed the strength of a Named Hero made evident by the aura being exuded from his body. In the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, only an elder would be eligible for the title of Named Hero.\u201cIs this your prime disciple?\u201d\u201cThat is correct, Li Qiye is the prime disciple of my sect.\u201d Protector Mo bitterly smiled. Li Qiye's talents and constitution were nothing to be proud of.\u201cThe trial, it is but a friendly competition. Brother Mo does not have to worry about it.\u201d Sectional Leader Fu showed a gentle smile.Li Qiye smiled back at Sectional Leader Fu and elegantly expressed his feelings: \u201cOnly a trial, it can't reach the peak.\u201dSectional Leader Fu ignored Li Qiye's sly remark and conversed with Protector Mo instead: \u201cBrother Mo, please follow me.\u201dIn his mind, a Named Hero arguing with a junior like Li Qiye would be unbecoming for a man of his status.Protector Mo, on the other hand, angrily glared at Li Qiye.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Such a room was only used for entertaining guests without great importance. For an event as influential as the marriage between two sects, the Nine Saint Demon Gate was letting a mere sectional leader take care of negotiations. Not only that, the courtesy they showed was the same for normal guests, making it obvious that they did not place heavy emphasis on the event.After settling the guests into their resting area, Sectional Leader Fu spoke some flowery language without sincerity and quickly left. Protector Mo was mentally prepared for the lack of hospitality, so he was not angry, merely solemn.Sectional Leader Fu headed straight into the inner sanctuary of his sect after helping settle Protector Mo's group. Approaching an ancient temple, he met an elder. The elder was floating in the air and a heavenly halo was above his head. While it rotated non-stop, each strand of the world's truths that took on a physical form was visibly covering his body; nothing was comparable to his pressure. A god was seemingly among us.\u201cHow is the prime disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect?\u201d The thunderous voice of this elder struck the surroundings, but this voice that instilled fear into the hearts of others could only be heard within the temple.When outside, Sectional Leader Fu was extremely arrogant with his title of Named Hero. However, he could only quiver in fear right now. He went down on his knees and spoke: \u201cDear Elder, it was but an ant, a mere mortal, an ignorant and arrogant young brat that is not worthy of discussion.\u201d\u201cI see, take your leave.\u201d The thunderous voice rang again. It was capable of instilling fear into others even when the elder's eyes were shut.Sectional Leader Fu politely bowed one more time and carefully left the temple. His body was sweaty after leaving. He was only a sectional leader, so he did not have the qualifications or status to meet an elder. Even a Royal Noble would need to be summoned before they could have the honor.After Sectional Leader Fu left, the elder started to speak with someone else in the empty temple: \u201cPicking a mortal with a Mortal physique, Mortal life wheel, and Mortal fate palace to be the prime disciple... there is no saving the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201d\u201cIt is truly a shame for the emperor techniques of Immortal Emperor Min Ren. There is a good chance that they still reside in that sect.\u201d A mysterious and noble voice rang in the air.The elder continued: \u201cYour Majesty, as long as Immortal Emperor Min Ren's techniques remain there, it is only a matter of time for us to obtain them in one fell swoop! That mortal is not worthy of our prime descendant.\u201dThe mysterious voice remained silent, as did the elder. If there were spectators, they would be shocked by the appearance of the Demon King. One has to know that the Demon King was an extremely dangerous character.Legend states that his origin and true form were extremely formidable. The sect, under his lead, became increasingly radiant. Nothing could shake his tyrannical rule. Within the Old Ox Country, no one dared to oppose his heavenly reign.Protector Mo remained seated in silence, but Nan Huairen had wittingly escaped the torturous room with the uncomfortable atmosphere.Meanwhile, Li Qiye had left for his own room. He started to practice the \u201cInvisible Dual Blades\u201d technique without wasting a second. He wanted to ingrain the technique into his body and mind.Over the years, Li Qiye had learned that it was one thing to understand the illustrious truths behind a technique, but another to reach the apex. Actually utilizing them was yet another aspect. Even a peerless genius with comprehensive knowledge of Immortal Emperor merit laws could not perform them without excruciating levels of practice.\u201cWhoosh, whoosh, wooooshh\u2026\u201d The two blades left Li Qiye's hands and gracefully traveled through the air like a pair of butterfly wings. They intersected each other multiple times before ultimately returning to Li Qiye's hands. He had practiced this particular move many times, but it still contained flaws.\u201cWhat impeccable swordplay. First Brother is so diligent, I feel ashamed to compare myself to your great efforts.\u201d At this second, Nan Huairen came into the room. There was another teen next to his side.Nan Huairen couldn't help but sigh with regret. He truly respected Li Qiye's earnest efforts. It was truly unfortunate that his innate talents were so underwhelming.\u201cTo reach the apex, one must never stop self-improving.\u201d Li Qiye sheathed his blades. Although he was sweaty and tired, his posture and expression remain at ease.Nan Huairen respectfully smiled: \u201cI will remember these words and strive to improve myself as well.\u201dHe then introduced the young man standing next to him: \u201cThis is Big Brother Zhang, a good friend of mine.\u201dNan Huairen had good talents, but he could not be considered a genius. However, he was different from his master. His ability to socialize allowed for a huge network; he had friends everywhere.This Disciple Zhang was very similar, but in his eyes, a mortal like Li Qiye was not worthy of respect. He nodded his head toward Li Qiye because of his relationship with Nan Huairen. To him, whatever martial techniques Li Qiye practiced were meaningless.\u201cThis is the first time First Brother is visiting the Nine Saint Demon Gate, so how about we walk around so that you can become accustomed to the scenery?\u201dLi Qiye suddenly remembered an event, so he smiled and responded: \u201cSure.\u201dNan Huairen turned around to the disciple named Zhang: \u201cBrother Zhang, this time we will have to impose upon you.\u201d\u201cBrother Nan, you are too reserved.\" Disciple Zhang had no choice but to nod his head. Unwilling as he may be, he did not want to strain their friendship. After all, he had no desire of taking the scenic route with Li Qiye.The Nine Saint Demon Gate was the host, so they should be taking Li Qiye around in order to positively promote their relationship. However, since they did not consider Li Qiye to be worthy, courtesy and rules were set aside.While Disciple Zhang led them around the premise, he only conversed with Nan Huairen and treated Li Qiye as if he wasn't there. Their presence created a lot of clamor amongst the disciples.\u201cIsn't that the prime disciple of that old sect?\u201d From a distance, a disciple frowned after seeing that Li Qiye was only a mortal.Another disciple of the sect scornfully laughed: \u201cHeh, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect is only a second-rate establishment. If even a mortal can become their prime disciple, this position can be considered nothing but worthless.\u201d\u201cA mortal wanting to marry Senior Li? Rotten chopsticks wanting a gold bowl; why not look in a mirror to see how lowly you are?\u201d [1. The former sentence is a Chinese proverb, similar to how a frog wants to eat swan meat.]Li Shuangyan was the prime descendant of the Nine Saint Demon Gate. Not only was she gifted in her talents, she was also extremely beautiful. Countless young talents in the sect had her as their secret desire. The numerous geniuses from other heritages that seeked to court her could form a line from one edge of the nation to the other. And the one thing they all had in common was the desire to spit onto Li Qiye's face for being so shameless.Disciple Zhang was even more embarrassed; he could see the hostility from the eyes of his fellow disciples. He started to walk faster to maintain a distance with Li Qiye, eventually leaving him behind. However, Li Qiye seemed to pay no mind to his actions. He continued at his own pace in a calm and carefree manner as he absorbed the heavenly scenery of the Nine Saint Demon Gate.Nan Huairen earnestly reminded Li Qiye: \u201cFirst Brother, you have to be careful. Many people are courting your fianc\u00e9, and they will not hesitate to cause trouble for you.\u201dLi Qiye calmly answered: \u201cIt is only a girl, there is no need for such a commotion.\u201d He had seen many country-destroying beauties, so he didn't keep his potential fianc\u00e9 in mind; it was only a minor matter to him.Unknowingly, they reached the training ground of the sect. This was a place where all of the disciples could enter. Once one was inside, they would truly feel tiny in comparison to the gigantic battle stage; they were like ants on top of a massive hill.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Each stone was inscribed with the words of many Virtuous Paragons; mysterious and powerful energies were being exuded from them continuously. It was this energy that protected the battle stage, rendering it impervious to any damage the contestants may inflict.\u201cA battle stage of the Virtuous Paragon level!\u201dEven though this was not his first time witnessing it, the battle stage still instilled Nan Huairen with awe.Disciple Zhang was very proud and started to brag: \u201cThis battle stage was created by our Great Elder; it can even withstand the destructive power from multiple Virtuous Paragons.\u201dNan Huairen couldn't help but mumble in a low volume: \u201cIn the past, our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect also had a battle stage\u2026\u201dThe truth was that the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect also had a battle stage, but it was not of the Virtuous Paragon level. Some say that it was nearly at the Immortal Emperor level, so it could withstand a fight between Heavenly Kings and Immortal Emperors alike. It was found by Immortal Emperor Min Ren in the depths of an unknown space.Unfortunately, no one knew why this battle stage was sealed. From then on, no one was able to enter the arena.\u201cGreat Four Stone Golems!\u201d Li Qiye was there, but he missed the conversation completely. His eyes were focused on the four gigantic statues located at the four corners of the arena.Each of them towered over one hundred meters tall. All of them had different expressions, yet they were all very realistic. It was apparent that they were carved by the hands of a renowned expert with a blade technique that was very natural and perfect.This was what he wanted to see. After the death of the Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon, he had never visited this sect. It was surprising to see the four statues after all these years.When Nan Huairen and Disciple Zhang were chatting, no one noticed Li Qiye. A moment later, Disciple Zhang finally saw what Li Qiye was trying to do. He raised his eyebrows and asked: \u201cWhat is this idiot doing?\u201dNan Huairen noticed that Li Qiye was trying to climb on top of the eastern statue. However, because of his weak cultivation, he couldn't make it to the top.Right now, many students were surrounding the battle stage. They all watched Li Qiye struggle like a village boy that was visiting the capital for the first time. Laughter erupted and jeers filled the arena.Nan Huairen was so embarrassed that he wanted to dig a hole and hide in it forever. He could not see what was special about these four statues that prompted Li Qiye to take action.Li Qiye signaled for Nan Huairen to come over. Nan Huairen couldn't say no to the prime disciple, especially when the person was being singled out by an entire sect. He dejectedly walked over to Li Qiye under the scrutinizing gazes of all the disciples.Li Qiye calmly commanded: \u201cThis statue is too high, take me up there.\u201d\u201cHah?!\u201d Nan Huairen was dumbfounded. He was silently questioning whether Li Qiye had become insane. Climbing up the statue in front of this many Nine Saint Demon Gate disciples \u2014 this was a great slap to their faces.\u201cAre you going to take me up, or do you want to continue watching my monkey show?\u201d Li Qiye nonchalantly commented as if all of this had nothing to do with him.Without any other options, Nan Huairen grabbed Li Qiye and jumped. In one swoop, they arrived at the top of the statue.Li Qiye sat on the shoulder of the statue and leisurely stared into the distance, embracing the scene in front of his eyes.Nan Huairen wasn't quite as thick as Li Qiye. He immediately jumped down then waited at the bottom of the statue. He stood there, waiting, in case something did happen. He simply couldn't just abandon his fellow disciple.Disciple Zhang, however, did not want to stand there for a second longer. He immediately left without a departing salutation.\u201cDoes he think that he is a big shot, sitting on top of the statue?\u201d\u201cThis country bumpkin is being way too rude!\u201dIgnoring the comments the disciples of the Nine Saint Demon Gate were spewing, Li Qiye remained seated on the statue's shoulder. He whispered to it as if he was having a conversation with it.The crazy and nonsensical actions of Li Qiye caused the spectators to question their sanity. This was truly an idiot without fear. However, no one attempted to stop him. They felt that it was below them to interfere with a madman.Eventually, Li Qiye seemed to have become bored of sitting. He once again waved his hand to signal for Nan Huairen. It was as if a boulder had been lifted off his shoulders; Nan Huairen was incredibly relieved that this madness had come to an end as he brought Li Qiye down to the ground.\u201cFirst Brother, the sun has set. Shall we go back and rest?\u201d Nan Huairen was praying with all of his heart that this prime disciple could spare him from further embarrassment. Who knows what other things he would do if they were to continue their tour?Noticing how Nan Huairen looked like a dead puppy, Li Qiye chuckled and nodded his head in agreement.\u201cYour mother!\u201d A disciple couldn't help but yell out after seeing Li Qiye's devilish grin: \u201cThe Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect is a third-rate sect. You're merely a toad that wants to eat swan meat! Pah! A dumb black turtle has the nerve to court our senior.\u201dSeeing that someone was challenging him directly, Li Qiye slowly turned around and said: \u201cCourt your senior? Don't think too highly of yourselves. Even if a heavenly angel or godly fairy wanted to marry me, they would have to pray for my acceptance. As for your senior? It is a long line until it is her turn.\"\u201cYour mother, you are tired of living!\u201d All of the male disciples roared after hearing Li Qiye's shameless words.\u201cCalm down, calm down, everyone should value peace and prosperity!\u201d The current situation sent chills down Nan Huairen's spine. He immediately took Li Qiye and left. He couldn't leave this madman outside for a second longer.After safely arriving at their guest house, Nan Huairen cried: \u201cFirst Brother, please! This isn't a place where we can say and do whatever we wish. Take a step back and appreciate the high sky and deep sea. Please keep yourself under control.\u201d\u201cHold back?\u201d Li Qiye nonchalantly proclaimed: \u201cA general shall stop an incoming army, a dam will deter the incoming current!\u201d [1. This is another Chinese proverb. It tells someone to not worry, almost like que sera sera. It sounds really good in Chinese since it only consists of 8 words; 4 for each prose with the same tonal structure.]Nan Huairen froze. Taking care of someone like Li Qiye was akin to finding trouble for oneself. He was truly regretting taking on this mission to go to the Nine Saint Demon Gate.After the events at the battle stage, many of the Nine Saint Demon Gate disciples were outraged. Du Yuanguang was one of those who truly wanted to kill Li Qiye. He was an outer disciple, but his innate talents were above average, so many referred to him as the \u201cLittle Genius\u201d. He had only joined the sect for five years, but he had already reached the pinnacle stage of Provisional Palace. As long as he could successfully pass this year's examination, he could become an inner disciple.Du Yuanguang had a strong crush for Li Shuangyan. During his entrance exam, she was one of the main organizers. It was love at first sight. He also thought that she recognized his skills and talents since she accepted him.He had great confidence in his abilities and wished for her to become his dao partner, so Li Qiye's very being naturally became a thorn in his eyes.Du Yuanguang's eyes revealed his killing intent as he murmured to himself: \u201cThis mortal does not know his own limits. If I don't teach him a little lesson, he will continue to think that he is above the heaven and earth.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He wanted to see if there was anything left from his era lying around.Nan Huairen did not want to go at all. It didn't matter whether Li Qiye was crazy or stupid, his intuition told him that Li Qiye would definitely cause trouble; going with him was simply masochistic.Unfortunately, Li Qiye already turned around and began his trip around the sect. Nan Huairen had no choice but to follow him. The most important event during this trip was the marriage trial. If something actually happened to Li Qiye, he wouldn't be able to escape unscathed.However, not long after their departure, they were surrounded by Du Yuanguang and his outer disciple friends. These disciples didn't see eye-to-eye with Li Qiye. With Du Yuanguang leading the way, it was a wondrous opportunity to teach this arrogant bastard a lesson.\u201cAh, it is Brother Du, I have heard of your great reputation long ago.\u201d Nan Huairen knew that trouble was coming, but he still kept his calm and friendliness.Du Yuanguang only gave Nan Huairen a short glance and said: \u201cNan Huairen, you don't have any business here. Move to the side or we'll deal with you as well.\u201dNan Huairen's expression darkened, but he knew that the strong ate the weak. Thus, he slightly bowed and asked: \u201cBrother Du, what is the meaning of this?\u201dDu Yuanguang completely ignored Nan Huairen this time around. He gave an icy cold look toward Li Qiye that was full of killing intent.With his usual carefree attitude, Li Qiye stepped forward towards Du Yuanguang and said: \u201cA smart dog does not block the road. If you don't want to be a dog, then get out of my way.\u201dAfter he heard this, Nan Huairen knew that everything was ruined. Especially when he saw the thirst for blood in Du Yuanguang's eyes, he knew that this would not end without conflict.An angry disciple yelled out: \u201cDo you not want to live? The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect no longer has the qualifications to be considered an Immortal Emperor lineage. You dare to jump around like a clown in front of us? A mere ant dares to be disrespectful?\u201dLi Qiye was ready to retort, but Nan Huairen quickly stopped him and whispered: \u201cForget about it, First Brother. Don't worry about them. Du Yuanguang is an outer disciple that is getting a lot of attention. He is also the latest disciple of Protector Hua. If he passes the yearly examination, he will immediately become an inner disciple.\u201dNan Huairen's intention was to remind Li Qiye that they could not afford to antagonize someone like Du Yuanguang. He had the support of a protector from the Nine Saint Demon Gate. A protector in this sect had a higher standing than an elder of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.Du Yuanguang did not make a move, he only coldly said: \u201cWe of the Nine Saint Demon Gate rule the Old Ox Country. Even if you are from a small sect, you are still a guest; we would like to treat you with the minimum courtesy befitting our status. However, one of my brothers has recently lost a treasure \u2014 this is not a common occurrence in our honorable sect.\u201dNan Huairen's complexion sank as he started to panic: \u201cBrother Du, what is the meaning of your words?\u201dDu Yuanguang glanced over at Li Qiye and said: \u201cIn the last two days, there were no other guests besides the people from your sect.\u201dDu Yuanguang clearly implied that the thief was from the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. This matter did not only affect one person because it also greatly influences the reputation of an entire sect. Even someone as wily as Nan Huairen couldn't help but show an ugly expression.\u201cBrother Du, please watch what you say!\u201d Nan Huairen wanted to treat this matter diplomatically, but it now concerned the reputation of his own sect. He would not stand for such insults.\u201cWatch what I say? Your sect is desolate and as poor as a beggar, who could guarantee that a thief did not infiltrate your sect? Your prime disciple is just a piece of trash, so to say that your sect recruited thieves would not be unreasonable.\u201dNan Huairen's face reddened with rage. As a person who truly cared for his sect, he could not stand for this mockery, so he replied: \u201cBrother Du, we want to meet with Sectional Leader Fu of your sect. No matter what happens, we demand an answer from your sect regarding this baseless accusation.\u201dDu Yuanguang exploded in laughter for a while before he confidently replied: \u201cMeet Sectional Leader Fu? Nan Huairen, it's not that I don't want to reserve some dignity for you, but you and this trash do not have the qualifications to request a meeting with Sectional Leader Fu. Our sectional leaders are capable of being bestowed the title of Named Hero, and it is unknown whether your elders are capable of the same feat. Maybe your elders are qualified to meet with Sectional Leader Fu, but you and this trash? Don't even think about it.\u201dAfter he finished his speech, Du Yuanguang coldly stared at Li Qiye. The other disciples clapped in agreement and started to taunt Li Qiye with nasty words again.Nan Huairen was shaking from anger, but Li Qiye maintained his composure and carefully retorted: \u201cTo me, it doesn't matter if this plan stems from you, the leader, or even your protector. To be frank, it is because you are smitten with your senior; I think her name was Li Shuangyan? Even though I have never seen her before, you are too petty. The engagement of your prime descendant, Li Shuangyan, is merely a one-sided affair. Because I respect your sect's current status, I would consider having her as a maid.\u201d\u201cAnd as for you?\u201d Li Qiye continued: \u201cYou are too naive. If your goddess had such talents, she wouldn't put you in her sight. I already don't care for her, so why would you try to compete with me for her like a fool? Get out of the way, you should find a place with shade and take a break to cool off your hot head.\u201d\u201cYou bastard! If you want to die this badly, I'll gladly show you to your death!\u201d Du Yuanguang, enraged by those words, summoned his sword as well as his aura.\u201cDu Yuanguang, if you want to fight, I will not turn a blind eye.\u201d Having witnessed Li Qiye's bravery, Nan Huairen, who was burning with rage, felt a lot better. However, he knew that Li Qiye had never cultivated before, so he immediately stood guard in front of him.\u201cFine, I will take care of you first, then I'll kill the little bastard!\u201d Fiery anger was being exuded from Du Yuanguang's eyes. To him, Li Shuangyan was an untouchable goddess, yet Li Qiye dared to insult her.Li Qiye slowly pushed Nan Huairen back and calmly said: \u201cHuairen, if someone wants to take my life, I'll be the one to put an end to him. You should stand back and watch.\u201d\u201cGood! Good! Excellent!\u201d Du Yuanguang was no longer angry and instead burst out into laughter: \u201cThis is the funniest thing I have ever heard. A piece of trash like you wants to kill someone who is at the Provisional Palace stage like me? So be it, I will give you a chance to fight!\u201dKnowing that he was a mortal, everyone knew that Li Qiye could not use any merit laws. The other disciples pitied Li Qiye: \u201cMartial techniques versus merit laws? You don't even know the basics, yet your arrogance is through the roof. It is such a pity.\u201dLi Qiye could not be bothered by such comments. He calmly stated: \u201cThat is fine, everyone can witness this battle.\u201d With that said, he walked towards the battle stage.\u201cYou can't!\u201d Nan Huairen was filled with fear. He grabbed Li Qiye and said: \u201cFirst Brother! This is impossible! Du Yuanguang has reached the pinnacle of the Provisional Palace stage. You cannot be his match.\u201d\u201cIt's fine, he's only at Provisional Palace and not Royal Noble! And even if a Royal Noble of the Nine Saint Demon Gate dares to mess with me, I would mince him into tiny pieces all the same depending on my mood.\u201dLi Qiye lightly smirked then pushed Nan Huairen away.Nan Huairen's head started to hurt. His first thought was that his first brother had gone senile. Li Qiye had only joined the sect for a few days and had yet to begin practicing even the most basic of cultivation techniques. He only had access to the \u201cInvisible Dual Blades\u201d martial technique.A person who only practiced martial arts could not fight against a cultivator. Comparing martial techniques to merit laws was the same as comparing the heaven and earth. Not to mention, Du Yuanguang was also an expert at the Provisional Palace stage.Nan Huairen regained his wits and immediately went to find his master, Protector Mo. He knew that if this fight takes place, only death would be the result.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Word of this quickly traveled throughout the entire sect.Du Yuanguang possessed considerable influence and was fairly popular within the sect for reaching Provisional Palace in just five years after he was admitted. Here, he was considered a genius; at the current Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, he would be a genius among geniuses.Even the seniors who heard about this challenge were surprised: \u201cChallenging Du Yuanguang?\u201dSome of the disciples who had never heard of Li Qiye were quite intrigued: \u201cHe is the latest disciple of Protector Hua. Even though his Golden Wolf Physique has only reached Houtian, it is still a formidable type of physique. What is the current cultivation of the prime disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect?\u201dA disciple mockingly answered: \u201cHa, Senior Sheng worries too much! That sect is average at best and without any experts. Their prime disciple is a piece of trash with a Mortal physique, Mortal life wheel, and Mortal fate palace. He had only joined the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect for two days, so he only had the time to practice martial techniques. Even the most elementary merit laws elude him.\u201dAfter hearing this news, the seniors who didn't know Li Qiye before became even more perplexed. A martial artist challenging a cultivator? He must be tired of living!\u201cThis is the same as a calf not being afraid of a tiger, how sad!\u201d [1. Another proverb, meaning that a person is too naive to recognize danger.]A lot of the seniors lost their interest because they believed the fight would end after a single move.Du Yuanguang only needed one swing and everything would be finished.This news also reached the ears of a few sectional leaders and protectors. They shook their heads while contemplating the implications.One of the protectors spoke in an aloof and cold manner: \u201cMaybe this is a blessing in disguise. Killing a piece of trash isn't something to be proud of, but if the idiotic juniors of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect wish to challenge us, then let this be a lesson.\u201dThis comment caused some protectors and sectional leaders to knit their eyebrows. It was still an Immortal Emperor sect, after all. Currently, it still had Emperor level cultivation methods and, more importantly, the inheritance of Immortal Emperor Min Ren. Everyone had been watching that sect like hungry tigers waiting for the right moment to strike.Realistically, the Nine Saint Demon Gate only had to mobilize their protectors to rob the Emperor merit laws, but the current Demon King had never revealed his thoughts on this topic. This caused the upper echelons to remain silent as well. If the Demon King gave the order, someone would immediately leave and destroy the sect with zero hesitation.While the upper echelons were still deliberating, Li Qiye was already standing on the battle stage. Quite a crowd gathered for this event. They just wanted to see what kind of torture Du Yuanguang would employ.When Du Yuanguang stepped onto the battle stage, a disciple loudly yelled: \u201cSenior Du, use one slash to chop off his head!\u201dAnother chimed in: \u201cOne sword strike is too merciful for him. He dared to insult Senior Li and our sect, so you have to flay him piece by piece.\u201dA senior opened his mouth: \u201cDeath is the only result for insulting our sect. Junior Du, do not rush things. Slice off his hands and feet, but do not kill him. Wait for the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect to come and apologize. Let the whole Grand Middle Territory, no, the whole Mortal Emperor World know the consequences of opposing us.\u201dOn the battle stage, Li Qiye stared at Du Yuanguang and teased: \u201cCan the Nine Saint Demon Gate's disciples only use words? You lot are indeed experts at using your mouths.\u201d\u201cIdiotic animal, I only need one sword strike to remove your head from your body.\u201d Du Yuanguang lifted his chin, clearly looking down on his opponent.Li Qiye casually responded: \u201cIf you want to fight, then fight. Stop wasting so much time!\u201d His left hand tightly griped his blade. He lifted it horizontally and pointed the edge towards Du Yuanguang then proclaimed: \u201cMake your move.\u201d\u201cDie!\u201d Infuriated by Li Qiye's fearless attitude, Du Yuanguang made his move. A sword strike that felt like it could destroy the surrounding space lashed out; it was as fast as lightning. The sharp attack accompanied with the boundless anger of Du Yuanguang pounced for Li Qiye's heart.Li Qiye did not take a step back. Instead, he moved forward. With each step he took, the blade in his left hand danced like a heavenly serpent and swiftly deflected Du Yuanguang's sword technique.A crisp noise resounded in the arena, indicating that flesh had been cut. Although Du Yuanguang's sword didn't pierce Li Qiye's heart, it had pierced his left shoulder.\u201cInsect\u2026\u201d Du Yuanguang smirked. However, just a moment later while his sword was still lodged in Li Qiye's left shoulder, his opponent's right hand started to move. In the blink of an eye, even Du Yuanguang did not see the movement of Li Qiye's blades.\u201cGood\u2026\u201d The blades were too swift; they invoked mysterious truths that nothing could compare to. No one saw the trajectory of the blades. The Nine Saint Demon Gate disciples were loudly cheering when they saw Du Yuanguang's sword connect.However\u2026That very second when the sword met Li Qiye's left shoulder, Nan Huairen and Protector Mo arrived. Protector Mo saw the sword connect and yelled out: \u201cPlease lower your sword and spare him!\u201dA moment later, blood began to drip from Du Yuanguang's throat. All of a sudden, blood spurted out as Du Yuanguang's body slowly fell to the ground. Li Qiye had mercilessly thrown both of his blades using the \u201cInvisible Dual Blades\u201d technique.\u201cPlop\u2026 Plop\u2026\u201d Du Yuanguang's body was slashed by the two blades as they magically intersected each other, dividing his body into five pieces before it hit the ground. Blood filled the arena.Du Yuanguang's eyes flashed hints of bewilderment and regret. He did not understand how he had fallen. How could he have known that Li Qiye's technique was honed by Immortal Emperor Min Ren himself? Although it could not compare to Emperor level merit laws, a martial technique sharpened by an Immortal Emperor could not be underestimated.What was even more frightening was how Li Qiye had grasped the mysterious truths of this technique. Even since that ancient era, only the emperor and Li Qiye had fully understood the principles behind this technique. At this level, the technique could even slay a Royal Noble.Du Yuanguang went into the match while underestimating his opponent, so he did not prepare any defenses. There was no way he could dodge the peerless strike. Li Qiye traded his left shoulder to execute this move.Right now, the whole battle stage was completely silent. The laughter and jeers disappeared. It seemed that time itself froze.Nan Huairen's jaws dropped to the floor. He hurried here in order to save Li Qiye. Not even in his wildest dreams would he expect for Li Qiye to only need one slash to dismember his opponent.Li Qiye was slowly removing the magical sword from his shoulder. The noise of the sword scraping against his bone softly shrieked, but Li Qiye showed no signs of pain. After all, he had experienced much worse in the past. He threw the sword away then stepped outside of the ring. He then took a quick look at the crowd and, with a dejected and regretful expression, murmured: \u201cIt seems that my blade technique is still missing something. I had to trade a blow and injured myself...\u201dRecalling what had just occurred, Nan Huairen's jaws were still hugging the floor. It wouldn't be surprising for it to be dislocated after staying agape for so long. One blade to kill a cultivator and he was pretending to be sad? This fella was shameless!As for the Nine Saint Demon Gate disciples, their souls had yet to return to their bodies. Du Yuanguang was a genius among his peers, but he was instantly mutilated by his opponent!Protector Mo was the first to regain his composure. He immediately covered Li Qiye's wound to stop the blood flow and gravely said: \u201cGo, now.\u201dHe carried Li Qiye and left the arena with Nan Huairen right behind them.After settling Li Qiye down, Protector Mo just sat there aimlessly. Right now, he didn't have the time to think about how Li Qiye killed Du Yuanguang. He was devastated since he knew the consequences of killing a disciple from the Nine Saint Demon Gate. This was a huge disaster.Nan Huairen, on the other hand, was treating Li Qiye's wound with a special silver paste. Next, he applied bandages around the shoulder. The entire time, he wondered about what happened.\u201cHow is it possible for a martial technique to kill a Provisional Palace expert?\u201d He had seen Li Qiye practice the move before. Although it was admirable, he didn't truly care for it since it was only a martial technique.\u201cThat is only because you do not understand the truth.\u201d Comfortably relaxing in his chair, Li Qiye was pleased with Nan Huairen's confused expression.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Otherwise, he wouldn't be a hall master among all the other disciples. He had read the \u201cInvisible Dual Blades\u201d manual before. In his eyes, it was only a normal martial technique, but in Li Qiye's hands, it had a fearful offensive power.He carefully looked at Li Qiye. As a wily person, he was capable of discerning characteristics and emotions from a person at a glance. However, he could not see through the thirteen-year-old Li Qiye in front of him. Thirteen years of age was when youths joined a sect; it was still an age where they would be emotionally provocable. However, Li Qiye possessed a calm aura that was as deep as an ocean. It was difficult to describe with words.His Mortal physique, Mortal life wheel, and Mortal fate palace made the elders and Nan Huairen doubt him. In reality, Nan Huairen thought that Li Qiye had a mental illness during their first contact, a mental illness that made one act arrogant and carefree under all circumstances. However, after these last few days, he was starting to understand that arrogance and calmness were naturally a part of who Li Qiye was.\u201cThis is a big disaster!\u201d Protector Mo panicked since he was without a solution: \u201cThe trial is over! We have to return to our sect!\"Staying here right now was the same as lingering in a lion's den or a dragon's cave. The only thought in his mind right now was to flee.\u201cIt is only a small matter, why do we have to run?\u201d As the culprit, Li Qiye was lazily sitting in his chair. He slowly spoke: \u201cTo me, there is no place safer than the Nine Saint Demon Gate.\u201dProtector Mo angrily glared at Li Qiye. He really wanted to slap him a few times. However, he then remembered that a disaster was approaching and lost all of his desire to teach this brat a lesson.\u201cWhat do you know!\u201d Someone who was normally reserved and quiet like Protector Mo couldn't help but reprimand Li Qiye: \u201cDo you think you are peerless under the heavens after you got lucky in killing Du Yuanguang? You don't know the strength of the Nine Saint Demon Gate. Not to mention the Demon King, even an elder is enough to deal with our six elders. The Nine Saint Demon Gate destroying us is akin to killing an ant.\u201dThe words were humble but realistic. In reality, if the six elders were to be given titles, they would only be Named Heroes, equivalent to the Nine Saint Demon Gate's protectors. The elders in the Nine Saint Demon Gate were all Royal Nobles at the very least, and the Demon King was one that had created countless miracles and legends in the last thirty thousand years. His strength was deep without a ceiling.\u201cMy dear Protector Mo, do not worry yourself.\u201d Li Qiye spoke in an aloof manner: \u201cIf this was anywhere else, I would be a bit troubled, but we're here at the Nine Saint Demon Gate. We will see who will kill who. Named Heroes? Royal Nobles? Those fools can't reach the apex!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d: Protector Mo was at a loss for words. This little kid just said that Named Heroes and Royal Nobles couldn't reach the apex when their elders were only Named Heroes.At this very moment, something sounded outside. Nan Huairen's expression instantly soured. He went out to check and quickly ran back inside while screaming with horror: \u201cNot good! There is a blockade outside of the building!\u201dA crowd entered the building, led by Sectional Leader Fu. His expression, right now, was very ugly.Seeing Fu's expression, Protector Mo knew that one couldn't hide from the sun forever. He took a deep breath and went to greet him: \u201cBrother Fu, this is only a little misunderstanding.\u201d\u201cMisunderstanding? Then you can explain it to our junior, Xu Hui!\u201dSectional Leader Fu stood to the side and a young man came next to him.This young man wore golden robes. His body was surrounded by a bloody aura and a translucent golden light was situated above his head. He was only twenty, but his aura was already formidable.When he saw the young man, Protector Mo couldn't help but shiver. The man in front of him had most likely reached the stage of Heaven's Mandate. It was quite unbelievable; it took Protector Mo fifty years to reach Heaven's Mandate.Sectional Leader Fu coldly said: \u201cThis is Xu Hui, the first disciple of Protector Hua. Du Yuanguang was Protector Hua's latest disciple, but he is now dead. Junior Xu Hui wants reparations.\u201dXu Hui stepped forward. His eyes exuded a golden light, making him seem like a sword that had been unsheathed. He possessed a tyrannical aura, an aura that felt as if it wanted to devour others.Xu Hui was, of course, a lot stronger than Du Yuanguang. Even if he was not the ultimate genius, he was considered to be well-established within the sect, so many responsibilities were given to him.\u201cMurder must be punished by death; a blood feud has to be paid with blood. There is nothing else to say.\u201d Xu Hui stared at Li Qiye like an animal that wanted to rip his prey apart into many pieces.Protector Mo quickly mediated: \u201cJunior Xu, this is a misunderstanding. My sect's disciple didn't want to kill him, it was only an accident.\u201dXu Hui gravely responded: \u201cThere is no room for discussion. Hand over the criminal right now, do not commit another mistake. Otherwise, you all will be seeking death. If you're not careful, this might bring about the end for your sect.\u201d\u201cNo wonder\u2026\u201d Li Qiye slowly rose from his chair and gracefully walked forward while glaring at Xu Hui: \u201cIt is no wonder why the atmosphere of the Nine Saint Demon Gate was so grim, it is because of idiots like you.\u201dBoth Nan Huairen and Protector Mo gulped in amazement. Nan Huairen screamed inside: 'Oh my god, my great ancestor, speaking one or two less sentences wouldn't kill you now, would it? You calling him an idiot to his face is akin to pouring oil into a fire.'\u201cThose words alone makes you worthy of being killed a thousand times over!\u201dXu Hui's killing intent erupted as he was filled with rage; he made a move towards Li Qiye.Protector Mo interfered. He grabbed Xu Hui's hand to stop him from rampaging.\u201cProtector Mo, don't make another mistake!\u201d Sectional Leader Fu channeled his energy; his body started to exude a golden light. When he took a step forward, his aura alone made it difficult for Protector Mo to breathe.\u201cSectional Leader Fu, is this how you treat your guests at the Nine Saint Demon Gate?\u201d Protector Mo was surprised by the difference in strength between him and Fu. Fu was a Named Hero; unless an Elder was here to combat him, there was no one here who could stop him.Sectional Leader Fu showed no emotions as he proclaimed: \u201cIf you hand over the criminal, you will still be considered an esteemed guest of our sect. However, if you think your sect has the strength to become our enemy and continue to harbor the criminal, then not only will your life be forfeited, your entire sect will meet its demise!\u201d\u201cDemise?\u201d Li Qiye, who was being protected by Protector Mo, lightly chuckled and said: \u201cThe Nine Saint Demon Gate has become too arrogant. If there was the danger of a sect's demise, it would be yours!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was as if he was taking a stroll on an empty street. From outside the room, he calmly proclaimed: \u201cI don't care who the current master of the Nine Saint Demon Gate is. Demon King or Virtuous Paragon, whatever. If you want to follow general courtesy, fine. If not, then don't, I will gladly reciprocate the treatment. Today, I will massacre all of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, I will send all of you down to meet the old chicken head.\u201d\u201cGood! Good! How courageous! I will pull out your ligaments then flay your skin! Then we will see just how you are going to destroy our sect.\u201d Xu Hui was at a loss for words. This was the most comedic event he had ever witnessed. This was the first time he had seen such an arrogant and ignorant individual.Right now, Protector Mo and Nan Huairen wanted to dig a hole to hide in. A mortal proclaiming to destroy the Nine Saint Demon Gate? This was a sect that was extremely strong even when considering the Grand Middle Territory in its entirety. As a sect that ruled over a whole nation, who could actually massacre them?Li Qiye ignored Xu Hui and kept on walking outside in a graceless manner.\u201cBastard! Die!\u201d Xu Hui soared into the air and sent his sword's energy towards Li Qiye.\u201cStand down!\u201d A voice akin to thunder rang across the whole sect. No one could resist the authority that it contained. This was a might that went straight to the soul.Due to this voice, even Xu Hui and Sectional Leader Fu couldn't help but shiver as their limbs went limp.\u201cFirst Elder...\u201d Sectional Leader Fu recognized this voice and was tremling in fear. He found himself unable to believe that such a small matter caught the attention of the first elder.The voice continued to roar across the sky: \u201cIt was a fair competition. When killed, one can only blame oneself for not being as skilled.\u201dLegend states that the first elder was an Enlightened Being. This was a character whose strength was only below the Demon King himself. His presence today made everyone think that there was more to the mortal than meets the eye.\u201cOur marriage alliance between the Nine Saint Demon Gate and the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect is our sect's tradition.\u201d The first elder, ignoring the death of Du Yuanguang, let his thunderous voice strike again: \u201cHowever, marriage is not a small matter. If the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect wants to marry our prime descendant, he has to prove that he is worthy.\u201dAfter hearing the words of the first elder, Li Qiye regained his tranquility and said: \u201cFinally, the Nine Saint Demon Gate still has someone who will take responsibility. If you want to follow the tradition, then I shall do the same. You want to test me? So be it, I accept. Picking a day is not as good as meeting the day; we shall conduct the test right now. To marry your descendant is my choice. If anyone dares to disrespect me, I will teach them a lesson.\u201d [1. Another proverb saying that there is no reason to wait.]After he finished his words, Li Qiye walked right outside.\u201cIt will be today.\u201d With this sentence, the sky returned to its serene state.Everyone started to scatter since no one dared to disrespect the first elder's command. However, the consensus here was that Li Qiye did not know that the sky was high and the earth was wide. His arrogance seemed to know no bounds.Protector Mo no longer cared for his image. He grabbed Li Qiye and carried him back into the room.\u201cYou fool. If you want to die, please don't bring our sect down with you.\u201d\u201cProtector Mo, do you have to be so scared?\u201d Li Qiye, unwilling to be carried back to the room, pushed Protector Mo's hands away.\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026 You\u2026\u201d Protector Mo couldn't help himself anymore and started to hyperventilate.Nan Huairen cried like a mistreated bride: \u201cSenior, do you know how strong the Nine Saint Demon Gate is right now? Let alone their elders and the Demon King, all of their protectors have the qualification to become Royal Nobles. Demon King Lun Ri could bring disaster to our sect with a single wave of his sleep. Back when their first elder was disarming the conflict, you should have taken the chance to nullify the problem.\u201dLi Qiye coldly replied: \u201cIs that how it is? It is too late now. Plus, I prefer to talk with my fists.\u201dOf course, Li Qiye could not reveal his secrets. If the Nine Saint Demon Gate wanted to cause trouble, he would use this opportunity to test the integrity of the sect. Although he promised the Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon that he would take care of his descendants that year, if they didn't know their rightful place, Li Qiye would be happy to cure them of their corruption.It would also justify him taking the treasures of the Nine Saint Demon Gate.Nan Huairen gave up, no longer wanting to speak or look at Li Qiye. He felt like he was conducting music for an ox. It was a waste of his energy. [2. Basically, an ox can't hear or appreciate music, just like a dumb person can't be appealed with reasoning.]Protector Mo eventually regained his voice, but he could only scornfully say: \u201cYou better follow the rules and attend the trial. If you keep causing trouble, you won't have to worry about returning to the sect. No one can save you then.\u201dThe trial was taking place in an ancient pavilion where two protectors acted as mediators. One of them was Protector Hua, the master of Xu Hui, and the other was Grand Protector Yu He, the strongest protector in the Nine Saint Demon Gate.Visible auras surrounded the body of Protector Hua. It was as if his body was made out of a golden metal. As for the grand protector, his aura was much more intimidating. His Royal Noble strength seeped out in a sanguine color instead of a golden one.Many disciples surrounded the pavilion because cultivating could be lonely and mundane at times. They were all eager for the opportunity to watch an entertaining spectacle. So many people were here that even a fly wouldn't be able to pass.The group that opposed this marriage the most mainly consisted of male disciples. They all hoped for Li Qiye to fail his trial because they believed that he doesn't have the qualifications to become the husband of their goddess.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Of course, this was understandable since he did threaten to destroy the Nine Saint Demon Gate. The fire and hatred in their eyes could kill Li Qiye a hundred times over.They started to converse amongst themselves: \u201cLet us kill him as well as the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201d\u201cNo, we have to cut off his arms and feet then use his head as a candle holder.\u201d\u201cA candle holder? That is too humane. This ant wants to marry our princess? We have to imprison him on top of Hawk Cliff. Let the hawks peck at him for a hundred years while we keep him alive with medicinal techniques.\u201dThe conversations quickly turned rowdy; the crowd fueled itself with their anger and hatred for Li Qiye. Both Protector Mo and Nan Huairen were shaking in fear. Their teeth couldn't stop clattering.Li Qiye removed himself from the surroundings. He calmly walked around the pavilion with an arrogant flair. Anyone would have fainted from being surrounded by so many people that want to eat them alive.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d At this moment, Grand Protector Yu He coughed. This seemingly quiet cough overpowered the crowd. No matter how loud the surroundings were, everyone heard it and immediately stopped talking. The aura of a Royal Noble once again dominated the air.At this time, Protector Hua began to talk: \u201cIf you can successfully complete the trial, then our two sects will become in-laws in accordance to the ancient tradition. If you can't pass or if you die during the test, then it is a shame that you are not skillful enough.\u201dLi Qiye sat down on a chair and turned towards Protector Hua. He slowly shook his head and smiled: \u201cOne can only say the Nine Saint Demon Gate is not as eminent as it once was. In that era, why did the Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon make that promise? Why did the two sects become in-laws and allies? Back then, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was worshipped by the heavens and ruled the Nine Worlds. Simply put, the Nine Saint Demon Gate only wanted the protection of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, to have a backing in order to grow.\u201dLi Qiye did not know all of the stories of the past because his condition was not fully stable at that time. The marriage between the two was not proposed by Immortal Emperor Ming Ren and the Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon, it was proposed by their descendants.Li Qiye continued: \u201cNow, the era has changed and you want to relinquish the promise after having benefitted from it. Your current generation is incomparable to your ancestors.\u201dProtector Hua interjected: \u201cHmmph, it is as you have said, eras change. If you want to say that the current generation is worse than the past, then this statement applies to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, not us. We currently rule the country. The Emperor lineages who want to become our in-laws number more than just one or two, yet you think someone like you is worthy of our princess?\u201dGrand Protector Yu He started to speak: \u201cJust let the past go, you can't change anything by quarreling.\u201d\u201cWe are giving you a chance to honor the promise of past. If you are afraid, then you can leave now. We will not stop or bother you, and the promise of that year will end.\u201d\u201cSince I am already here, I might as well accept the challenge. What is the trial?\u201d Li Qiye preferred Yu He's attitude a lot more.\u201cSince your cultivation is not ideal, Our Highness has decided to give you a better chance. The first test will not be combat oriented, but the second will be.\u201dYu He continued after a short pause: \u201cThe first test is very simple. You will have to go into the Chaotic Heart Forest with one of our disciples; the one that travels the furthest wins. The second test is even simpler; it will be a solo fight to determine the victor. There is also a third test, but you only need to pass two tests to pass the trial. The third test consists of\u2014\u201dLi Qiye cut off the protector: \u201cThere's no need to continue, two tests will suffice.\u201d\u201cHow arrogant!\u201d Protector Hua yelled at him for being too arrogant. He started to exert his pressure towards Li Qiye: \u201cThe test hasn't even started yet you want to fight already?\u201dLi Qiye narrowed his eyes. He found great joy in aggravating people he did not like.Grand Protector Yu He coughed once again. This cough severed the pressure that Protector Hua was exerting, angering Protector Hua. He could kill Li Qiye by simply lifting his finger. There has never been an insect that dared to talk to him like this before.\u201cAlright, let us being the tests.\" Li Qiye rose from his seat: \u201cBoth tests are fine, I want to see the abilities of your princess.\u201dXu Hui contemptuously laughed: \u201cYou don't have the qualifications for Senior Li to participate in person. I will be the one that you will go up against.\u201dYu He nodded in agreement: \u201cI heard that you have only recently joined the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. We will not cheat you. If the princess personally delivers the test, you would have no chance at all. Here, when it comes to inner talents and potential, the princess is number one. When it comes to battle capabilities, Junior Leng is the best. If one of them comes to test you, you would claim that it was unfair after failing. Junior Xu Hui has average talents among our inner disciples, so using him to test the prime disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect should not be too demeaning to your status.\u201dBy not sending out their best disciples, the Nine Saint Demon Gate was giving Li Qiye a sliver of hope. If the strongest disciple or Li Shuangyan participated, then even the six elders would have problems.Li Qiye didn't bother to look at Xu Hui. He stared at Yu He and formally said: \u201cIf this is the case, then at least your Nine Saint Demon Gate still has some hope. Although you went back on the original promise, you still managed to save a little bit of face and dignity. Fine, since you are allowing me to walk an extra step, I will spare you a yard just so that in the future, you can't say that I have bullied the sect.\u201dA character like Yu He had spent many years experiencing everything life had to offer, but when he looked at Li Qiye, it still puzzled him how there could be someone who was this arrogant and confusing. Does he not know of our strength? Does he have zero concept of cultivation levels? Yu He broke his stoic demeanor with a small chuckle: \u201cGo to the Chaotic Heart Forest. The one that can walk the farthest will win.\u201dSeeing that the test had finally begun, people started going towards the Chaotic Heart Forest. In a split second, the forest was instantly surrounded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 21": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Emperor\u2019s DominationEmperor's Domination Chapter 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHmmph, entering the Chaotic Heart Forest? What can that trash hope to accomplish?\u201dIn the outskirts of the forest, jeering conversations began again.Another disciple voiced another thought: \u201cIn the last examination, Senior Xu made it to level five of the forest. Now that he has reached Heaven's Mandate and started preparing to cultivate in the Warrior Canopy stage, his cultivation and willpower are much stronger than before. I predict that he can get to the seventh level.\u201dThe stages for cultivators are as follows: Palace Foundation, Palace Expansion, Physique Accumulation, Provisional Palace, Inner Longevity, Heaven's Mandate, Warrior Canopy, Purified Rebirth, Heaven's Primal, and Soul Creation.Once one has reached the unbeatable stage and receives the Heaven's Will, one will be dubbed an Immortal Emperor.There were no immortals in this world, so one might ask, why was there an emperor for immortals? Why does this title exist? It was because of a saying \u2014 my fate is mine alone, it's not up to the heavens to decide.The Heaven's Will serves as a shackle and encompasses and traps all living beings. Once a cultivator reaches the pinnacle, their goal is to control the Heaven's Will so that they will finally be freed from this prison.This was why one will be called an Immortal Emperor once they obtain the Heaven's Will. However, no one truly knows if true immortality was possible; this remains a mystery to this day.Each generation only has one Heaven's Will, so each generation can only have one Immortal Emperor.The Chaotic Heart Forest was where the Nine Saint Demon Gate judged a disciple's innate talents, affinity for cultivation, and willpower. Here, the most important quality was one's willpower.The forest consists of fourteen levels. From an outside perspective, there were no discernable differences between this and a normal forest. However, this seemingly normal forest was created by the Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon.Intruders would be shown realistic illusions. Even the ones that possessed mystical eyes could not see through the technique unless they were stronger than the Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon. Otherwise, the technique would become reality for all who steps inside.For example, one could find themselves trapped in a sea of fire. Their body would feel as if it was actually trapped and the mind would clearly feel pain. The higher the level, the stronger the illusion would be.Of course, you could still use cultivation techniques to mitigate the pain and merit laws to prevent the fire from reaching your body. The only thing was that you couldn't escape the forest using any movement techniques.\u201cIdiotic little boy, hurry up and enter!\u201d Outside of the forest, Xu Hui contemptuously smirked at Li Qiye. He believed that with his current abilities, it would be no problem to enter the eighth level.Li Qiye looked at the forest and slightly grinned. That year, the old chicken created the Chaotic Heart Forest himself; it was indeed a good location to test one's willpower.\u201cMe?\u201d Li Qiye clearly spoke: \u201cTraversing the Chaotic Heart Forest holds no meaning to me. If I were to enter, you wouldn't even have the chance to show your worth. You should go first so that later on, you can't say I didn't give you a chance.\u201dLi Qiye's arrogant comments made everyone shiver in contempt once more. Protector Mo and Nan Huairen wanted to lock up his mouth forever. Would he die if he said fewer sentences?! How could he spout lies all the time\u2026Protector Hua exclaimed: \u201cIdiot!\u201d\u201cYou are just a piece of trash that doesn't know what the willpower to cultivate is, yet you still run your mouth without shame.\u201d Xu Hui couldn't believe that a mere mortal was looking down on him and frowned: \u201cGood, good, such strong words! I have to see how many levels you can pass.\u201d\u201cHow many levels? How meaningless, going through fourteen isn't a big deal at all.\u201d Li Qiye continued: \u201cWhich is why I'm letting you go first, so you won't be so shocked!\u201dAnother disciple couldn't stand it anymore and yelled out: \u201cDo all people from the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect lie like you without any hesitation?\u201dEveryone knew that going through level seven of the Chaotic Heart Forest was considered a wondrous feat for the younger generation. To complete level seven, one would have to have a tenacious willpower or a high cultivation.Even the calm Grand Protector Yu He couldn't help but shake his head. Why was Li Qiye the prime disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect? Going through fourteen levels? Was it that easy? Even he couldn't pass all fourteen levels at his current level.\u201cFourteen levels?\u201d Xu Hui exploded into laughter: \u201cIf you can pass all fourteen levels, I will call you 'Father'!\u201dLi Qiye retorted: \u201cI wouldn't have an unfilial son like you!\u201d\u201cGood, if you are this confident with your mouth, do you dare to make a bet?\u201dLi Qiye happily smiled and asked: \u201cBet, eh? What will we bet?\u201d\u201cIf you can pass all fourteen levels, I will voluntarily concede! If you can't, then you will have to crawl under my crotch.\u201d [2. This is an extremely shameful punishment. Can be found today; crawling under a table after losing in a card game.]This bet caused the expressions of Protector Mo and Nan Huairen to instantly darken. This wasn't a test, it was a facade to shame Li Qiye and the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. However, they could only dejectedly shake their heads; Li Qiye brought this upon himself.Li Qiye asked: \u201cWould you do the same if I pass the fourteenth level? You will crawl under my crotch, right?\u201dProtector Hua interjected: \u201cIf you can pass the fourteenth level, he will do it and vice versa!\u201d Due to the killing of Du Yuanguang, Protector Hua wanted to kill Li Qiye with his bare hands. Since the opportunity wasn't right, the best he could do was to shame Li Qiye.Li Qiye looked back at Protector Hua and then formally nodded his head: \u201cFine, if this is your condition, I shall accept!\u201dThe disciples of the Nine Saint Demon Gate all loudly yelled: \u201cSenior Xu, destroy him! Accept the bet!\u201dXu Hui coldly replied: \u201cI'll be waiting for you to crawl beneath me.\u201dHe then turned and left for the Chaotic Heart Forest.A disciple creepily laughed: \u201cThis time, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect will lose all face. Their prime disciple will have to perform such an act! Haha!\u201dXu Hui took his first step into the forest. The surroundings immediately darkened. He found himself in a demonic world, an area that spanned for ten thousand miles. Demonic energy filled the air. The sounds of rattling bones could be heard even before the bodies began to leave the ground.Xu Hui inhaled and calmed himself. He channeled his energy and strengthened himself with his cultivation while steeling his willpower. He ignored the demons and passed them with ease.\u201cThe first level!\u201d Everyone outside carefully watched without blinking. Without any complications, Xu Hui successfully passed the first level.\u201cSecond level, third level\u2026\u201dXu Hui was definitely not average, his cultivation and willpower were both excellent. His speed at breaking through the first three levels was, indeed, very swift.At the fourth level, however, his speed began to slow down. Fierce Silver Skeleton Kings began to attack him. In the beginning, he chose to evade and parry them, but after his hands were crushed, prompting him to cry out in pain, he used his body to destroy them instead. He possessed a silver body that warded off invaders on its own. However, this took a lot of energy.Once he reached the fifth level, he was completely surrounded by the skeletons. He loudly roared and summoned his defensive artifact. His magical sword flew straight into the sky; its blade spewed out true energy. This form of energy consisted of the dao of truths and it conquered the four directions.His crimson red life wheel appeared behind his head and exuded a blood energy that encompassesed the sky. It used unparalleled laws of power that destroyed everything in the surrounding area.Cultivation techniques that allowed for one to use their life wheel as an offensive tool were often stronger than certain physique techniques. This life wheel technique specialized in destruction and was left behind by the Virtuous Paragon. It was not of the paragon level, but it was still quite formidable. [2. Physique forming techniques are another cultivation method; they specialize in strengthening the body, which is why his arms were broken multiple times. His life wheel makes up for it.]Li Qiye slightly shook his head when he saw Xu Hui killing his way through the fifth level. Chaotic Heart Forest \u2014 if your heart is chaotic, then killing will only increase uncertainties and exacerbate the illusions. The Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon's goal was to train the willpower of his students, not their physical or combat strength.\u201cLevel seven.\u201dXu Hui annihilated his way to the seventh level, filling all the spectators with awe.Even Protector Hua felt satisfied. Xu Hui was his disciple and his pride. Although Xu Hui's aptitude could not compare to Li Shuangyan's and his strength was lacking against Leng Chengfeng, his progress today had pleased his master.\u201cBang!\u201d Xu Hui had just made it to the seventh level, but his strength had been expended. He couldn't handle the pressure of the Chaotic Heart Forest any longer and was promptly removed.\u201cJust a little bit more\u2026\u201d After the forceful ejection, it took Xu Hui a moment to regain his consciousness. He couldn't help but yell out his regret. He thought that he could have at least made it to level eight, but he had underestimated the difficulty of the Chaotic Heart Forest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It's not too late to give up.\u201dThen, Xu Hui spread out his legs and showed a shady smile: \u201cIf you do it now, I won't make things hard for you later on. If you wait until after you have failed the test, then it would be difficult to predict what your fate will be.\u201dLi Qiye ignored the taunts and entered the Chaotic Heart Forest step by step.In front of him was a sea of fire. It was a world filled with lava and fiery crackles. Inside this illusion, his feet were burnt to a crisp. No one could imagine how much pain he was feeling, but Li Qiye just strutted on without muttering a single groan.Li Qiye did not mind the Chaotic Heart Forest. During the Desolate Era, he spent his time being tortured while his soul was severed from his body. He had suffered at the hands of heavenly demons and trapped by the Ancient Ming. He spent what felt like an eternity without sunlight and underwent many torturous ordeals. Although the body of the Dark Crow was immortal, pain could still be felt.One million years passed. He traveled through all of the Forbidden Burials, spent time in the land of immortals, and fell into the realm of ghosts and devils \u2014 these were the most dangerous places in this world. Compared to those places, the Chaotic Heart Forest was nothing more than a short stroll. It couldn't break his willpower.In the blink of an eye, he had passed the first level. In the illusion, the sea of fire disappeared. Li Qiye was now in a frozen world, surrounded by the icy cold gales of a tundra.Outside of the forest, countless disciples were waiting for Li Qiye to be kicked out. Protector Mo and Nan Huairen still had their gazes turned away as they were unwilling to see Li Qiye being humiliated. However, as moments passed, a silence encroached the surroundings. One could hear the drop of a needle from a mile away. Surprised by the lack of jeers and cheers from Li Qiye's failure, the two turned their heads around. What entered their sight was an unimaginable scene.A disciple softly whimpered in shock: \u201cLevel\u2026 level\u2026 level eight\u2026\u201d\u201cLevel nine, ten, eleven\u2026\u201dLi Qiye paraded through the levels as if he was walking in an empty street. His speed remained as swift as it was during the first level.\u201cLevel\u2026 level\u2026 fourteen\u2026\u201dIn the end, Li Qiye went straight through the Chaotic Heart Forest with full confidence, and he leisurely stepped out of the last level.Everyone was now frozen. Passing through the fourteen levels of the Chaotic Heart Forest \u2014 this was an impossible feat. From the ancient past until now, none from the younger generation of the Nine Saint Demon Gate had ever accomplished it. Even Li Shuangyan, who had the highest aptitude and most fortified willpower, couldn't accomplish such a feat.\u201cThis is impossible\u2026 simply impossible! This cannot be!\u201d Xu Hui fell deep into confusion, but this was the reality that laid before his eyes.Protector Hua had his mouth wide open as well. He couldn't close it due to his bewilderment.Even the sect master could not pass the fourteenth level of the Chaotic Heart Forest. What kind of willpower was this?Li Qiye came back and casually spoke: \u201cEh, this is only the appetizer.\u201d It was as if he had just taken a walk in the comfort of his own garden.Li Qiye glanced at Xu Hui and casually declared: \u201cOkay, kneel and start crawling!\u201dXu Hui loudly howled: \u201cNo\u2026 No, this cannot be happening!\u201d It wasn't only him, everyone else here also found themselves in disbelief.Protector Hua wondered: \u201cWas there something wrong with the Chaotic Heart Forest?\u201d\u201cSurely, surely that is the case. Maybe the prohibiting spells of the forest have lost their power.\u201d It was as if Xu Hui was trying to find a tree branch while drowning. He quickly added: \u201cIt doesn't count, the Chaotic Heart Forest has lost its effect.\u201d\u201cThere is no chance it has lost its power.\u201d A while later, Grand Protector Yu He gathered his thoughts, shook his head, and continued: \u201cFrom the creation of the sect, the forest has never been ineffective. I will go and check.\u201dFinished with his words, he personally entered the Chaotic Heart Forest.Yu He was indeed formidable and befitting his Grand Protector status. His willpower was substantial, he easily made it through the first nine levels. After reaching the tenth level, his speed decreased.A loud noise roared through the air. Yu He could not pass all the levels of the forest. He was kicked out before reaching the eleventh level.\u201cThe Chaotic Heart Forest did not lose its power.\u201d Yu He stated this with complete confidence. He stared at Li Qiye with curious eyes, not understanding the event that had transpired.Li Qiye, who was only thirteen years old, was capable of finishing the Chaotic Heart Forest? Unless there was a mysterious force at work here, his cultivation willpower was immutable. However, a mere thirteen-year-old boy could not possibly have this level of willpower. It required centuries and millenniums to have such a mind. Although he had a mortal body and inferior innate talents, it would only be a matter of time before he became a Virtuous Paragon through sheer willpower.Protector Hua inquired: \u201cYou, are you carrying a sacred treasure?\u201dXu Hui raises his voice: \u201cThat has to be the case. The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect is an Immortal Emperor level sect, maybe he is hiding an Immortal Emperor sacred treasure.\u201dThis was indeed the most logical explanation. Right now, everyone was thinking that this was the case. Ultimately, even though the sect was now weak, it was not unreasonable to think that one or two Immortal Emperor sacred treasures were left behind. If he used just one of them, then he could indeed pass the Chaotic Heart Forest unharmed.Protector Hua boldly proclaimed: \u201cUsing a sacred treasure to cheat, this bet does not count!\u201dHe was sure that Li Qiye had committed foul play.\u201cProtector Hua, that is unfair.\u201d Protector Mo had no time to think about how Li Qiye passed the trial. He gravely said: \u201cThis is a test designed by your sect. You cannot lose and then relinquish the test.\u201dProtector Hua replied: \u201cIf you use a treasure to cheat, then of course it won't count.\u201dTaking Li Qiye's side, Protector Mo continued: \u201cIt does not matter whether he used external tools or not. Your sect did not declare that he could not use treasures to pass the test. Our disciple has gone through the forest, this round is ours.\u201dProtector Mo did not want to waste time, so he turned to Yu he and asked: \u201cProtector Yu, did the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect win this round or not?\u201d\u201cAbout this matter\u2026\u201d Yu He could not decide. He did not believe that Li Qiye had actually passed the forest without external help. However, the Nine Saint Demon Gate also did not state the rule that one couldn't use sacred treasures.\u201cI walk my route straight and sit tall; my heart has no shameful secrets to the heavens. Unlike the people of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, betting and losing and then being unable to accept the loss. If you think I am hiding a treasure, then try and find it. If you can find it, then I will give it to you.\u201dYu He contemplated for a moment, lifted his head, and then spoke to Li Qiye: \u201cIf you want to prove your innocence, we have a solution. The great ancestor left behind a treasure named the Immortal Bone Mirror; it can see through all hidden objects. If you are willing to let us use it, then we can tell whether you bear a treasure or not.\u201d\u201cI agree to the usage of the Immortal Bone Mirror.\u201d Protector Hua was the first to speak: \u201cIf the mirror cannot find anything, then it will mean that he did not carry a hidden treasure.\u201dThe disciples banded together and roared: \u201cYes! If you don't want to, then it means that you cheated.\u201d\u201cI pity you lot.\u201d Li Qiye stared at them and agreed: \u201cI will allow the mirror test. Bring it out.\u201dYu He sent people to grab the mirror. This mirror had a deep history; it was said that its heritage dated back to the Desolate Era and that it had been honed by an Immortal Emperor. The Immortal Bone Mirror was much stronger than the mirror that was used by the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect to test new disciples.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The shiny glass had flowing immortal patterns that exuded an aura of a living creature. Even Yu He was fearful of its power.The Immortal Bone Mirror flashed on the body of Li Qiye, forcing his life wheel and fate palace to appear. His life wheel slowly turned with a lack of pressure, and his fate palace had not yet been opened.Yu He concluded: \u201cHe has a Mortal Physique, Mortal Life Wheel, and a Mortal Fate Palace that has not been opened; he has not started cultivating. Also, there are no hidden treasures on his body.\u201dThe lowest level of cultivation was the Palace Foundation level. Once one started to cultivate, even the lowest of talents could open their fate palace in one day if fast, ten days if slow.Under the gaze of the Immortal Bone Mirror, Li Qiye couldn't hide anything. All that he is was revealed to the eyes of the spectators.Protector Mo solemnly questioned: \u201cProtector Hua, Protector Yu, are you satisfied now?\u201d Being subjected to the Immortal Bone Mirror was a shameful matter to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201cOur apologies.\u201d Yu He was a man of character. He nodded his head and politely said: \u201cLi Qiye did not cheat.\u201dAfter hearing the confirmation from Yu He, the crowd had no more comments to make. They couldn't believe that a mortal with these characteristics was able to pass the forest.Xu Hui was the most devastated of them all: \u201cBut how can this be true!\u201dLi Qiye leered at him and spoke: \u201cIt seems that you are not convinced, but that is quite alright. I will make it so that you will crawl without hesitation. It is a mere Chaotic Heart Forest, only an idiot like you would barely reach level seven. Open your eyes to see your grandpa go once again.\u201dAfter his taunt, Li Qiye entered the forest once more.All eyes were intensely focused on the forest, no one wanted to miss a single detail. They wanted to reach a logical conclusion that their minds could accept. If Li Qiye succeeds again, then they would have no choice but to change their view of the world. But if he failed, then all was good with the world.\u201cLevel fourteen!\u201d Nan Huairen was keeping count as Li Qiye went through the levels. Even though this was the second time, he was just as shocked as the first.Yu He truly understood now. Although Li Qiye's cultivation aptitude and physique could not reach the apex, he possessed unfaltering willpower. A thirteen-year-old had a stronger mind that he did after a thousand years of cultivation.\u201cStart crawling.\u201d Li Qiye came back and mischievously spread his legs in front of Xu Hui.\u201cYou!\u201d Xu Hui trampled the ground in shame and his expression turned pure white. If he had to crawl beneath Li Qiye in front of all these spectators, then he would lose all face in the future.\u201cOur Nine Saint Demon Gate has our honor. If you lose a bet, you have to bear the consequences.\u201d Yu He nodded: \u201cXu Hui, you were the one who wanted this bet in the first place. Now carry out your end of the bargain.\u201dXi Hui almost fainted on the spot. If Protector Yu had spoken, then even his master could not save him. He ground his teeth and unwillingly knelt before Li Qiye. His body froze for a minute; this was the most shameful event of his life.Eventually, he started to crawl through Li Qiye's legs. Li Qiye looked down and spoke: \u201cWhen people show me an ounce of respect, I will treat them well, but if anyone dares to cross me, then I will repay them tenfold. A genius disciple of the Nine Saint Demon Gate is nothing in my eyes!\u201dFinished speaking, Li Qiye turned around and walked away.\u201cUgh!\u201d Xu Hui fell down to the ground. He puked out blood from anger and went unconscious.\u201cHui'er!\u201d Protector Hua quickly grabbed Xu Hui and massaged his meridians.After returning to the pavilion, Protector Hua and Yu He found their seats. Li Qiye was already sitting there arrogantly like a king. This made the other disciples feel the urge to beat him up.Protector Hua leered at Li Qiye with great hatred in his eyes. When the master's disciple was shamed, of course they would share the enemy. Shaming his disciple was the same as slapping him in the face.Li Qiye playfully knocked on the table and said: \u201cThe first test has been completed, let us get started with the second.\u201dBefore, Yu He thought that Li Qiye was ignorantly arrogant. However, after having thought about it again, maybe he had some secret tricks.A mortal without the basics of cultivation... what was his backing that allowed for him to challenge the Nine Saint Demon Gate? Could it be that the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect still had hidden secrets not yet revealed?Yu He quickly dismissed his last thought. As the grand protector, he was fully aware of the current position of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. If it had any secrets left, then it wouldn't be submitting to the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom.The second piece of information was that Li Qiye had only joined the sect for a few days, and he forcefully used the Cleansing Incense Ancient Order to become the prime disciple. Even the six elders there did not welcome him.Yu He had no idea what hidden mysteries this person was hiding, especially when he didn't have any support.Returning to the matter at hand, Yu He clearly spoke: \u201cRight now, Xu Hui is not in his best condition. If you want to take the test, then we will have to change your opponent.\u201d\u201cHonorable Protector, I am fine.\u201d Xu Hui, all of a sudden, stood up straight. Despite his pale complexion, he violently leered at Li Qiye; a killing intent could be found in his eyes. He swore to himself that he would be the one to kill Li Qiye and use his blood to wash away his shame.He used his proud posture to maintain and announce his confidence. He lifted his head high and proclaimed: \u201cProtector, I can still fight!\u201dYu He slightly frowned. He knew exactly what Xu Hui was thinking, so he gently spoke: \u201cJunior Xu, your current condition is not fit for combat.\u201dThis matter was very important for the Nine Saint Demon Gate, and Li Qiye had already won the first match.\u201cSenior Yu, this kid has a strong will, a minor setback will not deter him. Please give him another chance.\u201d Protector Hua tried to support his disciple's wish.Xu Hui ground his teeth and said with extreme determination: \u201cProtector, if I make a single mistake, I will pay for it with my life.\u201dYu He contemplated for a moment. Within the younger disciples, Xu Hui had reached Heaven's Mandate and was close to the Warrior Canopy stage. It would be difficult to find another who was as strong as him. Plus, his cultivation included the life wheel technique \u201cFierce Slaughter Sword.\u201dYu He understood the strength of this technique; it was created by a Virtuous Paragon of their sect. If Xu Hui used his life wheel without hesitation, then none of his peers would be able to defeat him in a life or death contest, barring the strongest ones. If Xu Hui didn't fight, then the safe choices would be Li Shuangyan or Leng Chengfeng. However, those two weren't options they could choose.Yu He was no longer underestimating Li Qiye, but he couldn't think of a way for a mortal to defeat a Heaven's Mandate cultivator with a Virtuous Paragon technique.\u201cGood, you will fight then!\u201d After careful consideration, he agreed with the choice of Xu Hui.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He wanted to pull out his muscles, flay his skin, and smash his body into a thousand pieces.Nan Huairen and Protector Mo wanted to believe in Li Qiye. Although the chance of him winning was slim, he had continuously performed miracles.\u201cHey, can he really beat Senior Xu?\u201d Ever since Li Qiye went through the Chaotic Heart Forest in one go, the disciples of the Nine Saint Demon Gate considered him a real opponent.An older senior shook his head: \u201cThe difference between them is too great. It is a mortal versus a Heaven's Mandate cultivator. Li Qiye won't be able to win unless he was somehow given an Immortal Emperor True Treasure, but even that isn't realistic. Even with it, he wouldn't have enough blood energy to activate its power.\u201d\u201cThat's right, a mortal cannot activate an Immortal Emperor True Treasure. The 'Fierce Slaughter Sword' technique of Junior Xu is overly powerful due to its mysterious truths. A life or death battle with that technique would not bode well for his opponent.\u201d A disciple that had previously sparred with Xu Hui offered his opinion: \u201cAnd don't forget about his Golden Hawk Physique. Although it is only a Houtian Physique, it has considerable speed. If you combine both his speed and power, you can say that his offensive power is nearly unmatched in our generation.\u201dCultivators valued physiques very highly. There were six stages of physiques \u2014 Mortal Physique, Houtian Physique, Xiantian Physique, King Physique, Saint Physique, and lastly, the Immortal Physique.The majority of the world had a Mortal Physique, including Li Qiye. It was the weakest both in terms of physical strength and blood energy.Xu Hui roared. Sword energies began to rotate around his body in an upward manner. They became a giant, impenetrable fortress of visible, radiant swords, all pointing towards Li Qiye. The technique served as a defensive measure as he was channeling his energy.\u201cOpen!\u201dA heavenly sword came out from Xu Hui's mouth and split into eight different heavenly swords. These swords were gigantic, towering at two hundred meters each. A single strike could split the earth itself.A disciple couldn't help but voice their jealousy: \u201cFierce Slaughter Sword, Heavenly Sword Yan Jin!\u201d\u201cXu Hui's true energy is formed by Yan Jin's Heavenly Sword due to its completely magical pattern. Yan Jin's Heavenly Sword for offense and Fierce Slaughter Sword for defense. Within our generation, he is nearly unbeatable.\"Witnessing the scene, Protector Mo was humbled. Xu Hui proved to be more powerful than expected, especially when he had the possession of the Yan Jin sword. Protector Mo himself wouldn't be able to penetrate Xu Hui's defenses. After his failed attack, the Yan Jing sword formation would immediately counterattack when he was the most vulnerable.Xu Hui maneuvered his swords at Li Qiye and maniacally yelled: \u201cCome here you bastard. Today, I will slice you into a thousand pieces!\u201d\u201cPhoo, phoo!\u201d Li Qiye spat into his palms and then rubbed them together. This rather crude gesture was completely different from his normally elegant bearing.Li Qiye repeated: \u201cA thousand pieces?\"Then he slowly took out the Serpent Punishing Stick: \"You, alone, are not enough. Let me beat you into a pig's head. Even your parents will not recognize who you are after I am done.\u201dNan Huairen almost went unconscious. Wasn't that the stick from the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's grand chamber's fireplace? He was expecting Li Qiye to use the \u201cInvisible Dual Blades\u201d technique, maybe its miraculous power would help him tie the fight.However, Li Qiye wasn't using the blades but a wooden stick instead\u2026 The Yan Jin sword would split that thing in half in a mere second.Protector Mo's only thought at this moment was to save Li Qiye's life the moment it was in danger, no matter the cost.\u201cUsing a wooden stick to fight against the Yan Jin sword? Could it be an Immortal Emperor weapon?\u201d Yu He squinted his eyes and opened his heavenly eye in order to see through the wooden stick. He was indeed worried that the stick was a treasure made by an Immortal Emperor.However, despite his numerous techniques, the wooden stick was determined to be just a wooden stick. There were no magical enchantments nor cultivation techniques to utilize. A wooden stick versus a Heaven's Mandate level sword... Yu He was at a loss for words.Protector Hua was not as skeptical as Yu He, he only wanted to witness Li Qiye's death.Li Qiye pointed his Serpent Punishing Stick at Xu Hui like a ruffian and said: \u201cLittle boy, come here. Let this grandpa shatter your butt!\u201d\u201cI'll kill you!\u201d Xu Hui screamed as the eight heavenly swords became one. Straight from the sky, the Yan Jin sword \u2014 surrounded by a gigantic amount of energy \u2014 swung down towards Li Qiye. Its path was filled with fire; the battle stage was now bathed in a sea of flames.\u201cThis is the end!\u201d Nan Huairen turned around, not wanting to see the result of this monstrous strike. It seemed like Xu Hui wanted to finish this in one move; he used his most powerful technique.\u201cGood!\u201d Li Qiye paid it no mind. He shouted in a strange manner and jumped forward with a random motion while swinging his stick.The scene that everyone was expecting did not happen.The Serpent Punishing Stick met the weakest part of the Yan Jin sword in the middle of its trajectory. The sword's energy dissipated and the physical sword plunged to the ground. It was as if the sword was bitten by a poisonous snake and became unable to obey Xu Hui's commands.\u201cLittle boy, I will beat you into a pig's head!\u201d Xu Hui hadn't regained his composure when Li Qiye was already in front of him. The stick passed through his sword fortress and rained blows directly onto his body.\u201cDie!\u201d Xu Hui didn't retreat. He gathered his sword energy once more and surrounded Li Qiye with it.\u201cGather!\u201d However, his Virtuous Paragon sword technique had no effect. The Serpent Punishing Stick continuously struck at the formation's weakest points, successfully negating the blows. Finally, it struck Xu Hui's face. This one blow made Xu Hui's face redden with blood. He became disoriented with stars in his eyes and thunder in his ears.\u201cBam, Bam, Bam!\u201d In the blink of an eye, Li Qiye had pummeled Xu Hui ten times, all of them hitting his meridians and weakest spots. Xu Hui was like a snake without its skeletal body; he was no longer able to stand. His blood energy was in disarray and his cultivation techniques were unusable. He fell to the ground with a busted face.Hitting a snake required one to aim for its head \u2014 this was true for the blows Li Qiye struck. They had to hit the weak points and holes in the opponents defense. Unless the opponent had reached the Heaven's Primal stage, they wouldn't be able to escape the blows. This was because they wouldn't have perfected their own understanding of the defensive mysterious truths. One of the requirements for Heaven's Primal is a rebirth of one's body and the understanding of techniques as well as a body protection aura that would render the Serpent Punishing Stick useless. However, since Xu Hui was far from Heaven's Primal, the wooden stick was his nemesis.Keep in mind that even Immortal Emperor Min Ren was beaten by the stick repeatedly, and the same applied to all of his strongest generals, including the Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon.The Serpent Punishing Stick was not a treasure or divine artifact. It was only a regular branch grown from a small tree in the Ghost Forest and basked by a demonic aura for ages. However, this made it anything but ordinary; the Ghost Forest was one of the few burial grounds.A stick of this level was exceedingly rare. At the beginning of the Emperors Era, the Dark Crow entered the Ghost Forest and spent countless efforts to obtain this stick.The stick also had another property that made it appealing to Li Qiye. No matter how many times a person is struck by it, they would not die from its blows. It was a stick specifically meant for punishment and teaching. This made it very appropriate for Li Qiye when dealing with the powerful geniuses under his tutelage like Immortal Emperor Min Ren.\u201cBang, Bang, Bang!\u201d After Xu Hui fell to the ground unconscious, Li Qiye did not show any mercy. He kept on striking Xu Hui's body. His body was now covered in wounds, and no one could tell if he was dead or alive.This scene jolted the spectators. Yu He activated his heavenly eye again to look at the Serpent Punishing Stick, but he still couldn't find anything special about it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since ancient times, the number of people that had seen it with their own eyes was few. Without his knowledge from traversing the ominous grounds, he too would not have known the secret and magical properties of the Serpent Punishing Stick.If one could not discern its characteristics, then it would only be a wooden stick in their eyes.\u201cI'll kill you!\u201d Although his body was tattered with wounds, his Silver Eagle Physique activated automatically. Below Xu Hui's ribs, two sharp claws came out and went for Li Qiye's heart.Xu Hui had the Silver Eagle Physique because his father was a Silver Eagle that transformed into a human from having an accomplished cultivation. The pair of claws were always hiding inside his body in case he ever needed to suddenly surprise his enemies.\u201cPhanh!\u201d The wooden stick easily stopped the silver eagle claws, forcing them back into Xu Hui's body.Li Qiye coldly proclaimed: \u201cYou seek your own death!\u201d\u201cWhoosh whoosh.\u201d Two blades immediately pierce through Xu Hui's shoulders and pinched him into the ground, immobilizing his body.\u201cDo you think it is that easy to kill me? Today, I'm going to hit you without mercy.\u201d Li Qiye continued to hit Xu Hui with the wooden stick. He felt cheated by the event that had just transpired.At this moment, Protector Hua could no longer keep watching. He jumped into the battle stage and yelled: \u201cThat is enough!\u201dLi Qiye glanced at him and said: \u201cWhat now? If the child can't win, the old man wants to join in as well?\u201d\u201cYoung one, don't be so delusional!\u201d His eyes contained anger and hatred as he gravely said: \u201cLet him go, or I will personally kill you today.\u201d\u201cI was going to spare him, but\u2026\u201d After finishing, Li Qiye sliced the two blades across Xu Hui's body, severing him into multiple pieces. The blades that struck through to the floor created a rain of blood and sparks.\u201cHui'er! You little bastard, accept your death!\u201d Protector Hua lost all restraint and his blood force punctured the sky. A magical sword, towering twenty thousand meters, flew towards Li Qiye.Protector Mo couldn't react in time, his mind was full of panic.\u201cBang!\u201d As the sky-piercing sword appeared, a gigantic foot from the heavens suddenly stomped down with an unstoppable force. No one could stop this blow. Not a Named Hero, not a Royal Noble, not even an Enlightened Being or a Heavenly King would have been able to. All living beings were just ants in the face of the might of this foot.\u201cNoooo!\u201d Protector Hua only managed to let out a pitiful scream. His body, under the giant foot, became meat paste; he couldn't be any more dead.Everyone was shocked because the foot did not belong to Li Qiye; it was from one of the four gigantic statues situated at the four corners of this battle stage. It was unbelievable that a Royal Noble like Protector Hua was killed in one stomp.\u201cYou can't\u2026\u201d Everything happened too fast. Grand Protector Yu He had ignited his blood force and flung it towards the foot in order to save Protector Hua.However, the foot that stomped down did not take any damage and performed another stomp instead.\u201cBang!\u201d Yu He was smashed straight into the main mountain. His blood wouldn't stop flowing.\u201cDon't you dare!\u201d A thunderous cry roared up in the sky; it was as if it was encompassing all of the mysterious truths of the heaven and earth. Heavenly auras illuminated the sky. A person suddenly appeared in the distance, floating in the air. Behind his head was a heavenly blinding aura that could burn the world.All of the Nine Saint Demon Gate disciples yelled out in bewilderment: \u201cFirst Elder!\u201d The first elder raised his palm and immediately flipped it towards the statue. This palm technique that carried incomparable might flew towards the statue.\u201cBang!\u201d Another deafening sound blasted into the air. This time, the statue used its hand to meet the palm strike. It annihilated the technique; the first elder's blood painted the sky's color. Even someone as formidable as he could not handle a single strike from the statue.Everyone was at a loss for words. The statues at the battle stage suddenly made a move, killing Protector Hua, kicking Yu He away, and used one punch to defeat the first elder.Afterward, the statue remained still like nothing had happened.Li Qiye, in the middle of the arena, casually opened his mouth: \u201cLike I said, if the Nine Saint Demon Gate does not follow the rules, I have no qualms in flipping your sect upside down.\u201d\u201cHmmmph\u2026\u201d The first elder, although wounded, had his blood force that was still going strong. He immediately flew to the sky, wanting to use all of his might against the statues. He was afraid inside because he did not know why their own statues would rebel against the sect.\u201cElder, don't make any more moves. These four statues are the Heavenly Guardians of the Nine Saint Demon Gate.\u201dA commanding voice filled with nobility rang from the deepest part of the Nine Saint Demon Gate.\u201cSect Master!\u201dHearing this voice, everyone from the Nine Saint Demon Gate knew who it belonged to. This was the sect master, Demon King Lun Ri, the leader of a whole generation of geniuses in the Grand Middle Territory.The first elder stopped immediately. He kept staring at the four statues while pondering many questions.All of the disciples were surprised as well. They have never heard anyone talk about the sect having Heavenly Guardians, let alone Heavenly Guardians that could harm their own sect.\u201cElder, Protector Yu He, please invite Young Master Li into the sky chamber to talk.\u201dAfter hearing the invitation, Li Qiye smirked and answered: \u201cFinally, someone who can see with their eyes. A little talk won't hurt.\u201dGrand Protector Yu He quickly came to Li Qiye and respectfully gestured him towards the sky chamber. The more he stared at Li Qiye, the more afraid he became. This thirteen-year-old was too frightening.The sky chamber was an important location in the Nine Saint Demon Gate. All major decisions were discussed and made there, and only elders had the qualifications to enter.Of course, Protector Mo and Nan Huairen could not enter. Since the sky chamber was situated in the deepest part of the sect and Li QI Ye could not fly, a grand Royal Noble like Yu He had to bend down to fly him over on his back.Right now, all of the elders were present in the chamber. Heavenly auras came from all of their bodies and their Life Wheels bounced up and down. Mysterious patterns of laws that resembled the creation of a new world crossed their bodies. They had all reached the stage of Enlightened Being and were definitely not Royal Nobles.One Royal Noble could destroy the entire Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, so one can imagine just how strong an Enlightened Being was. The hidden strength of the Nine Saint Demon Gate was truly staggering when seen; it was no wonder they were the rulers of Old Ox Country.Despite all of this, Li Qiye was not surprised one bit and sat down gracefully in the sky chamber.\u201cSince the ancient times, no one had ever connected with our Heavenly Guardians.\u201dThe Demon King's voice appeared, but no one could see him.Li Qiye shook his head and said: \u201cI don't like talking to people who hide their face behind a veil.\u201dThe elders were not pleased with his words. Demon King Lun Ri was a monstrous man, and all of the elders here deeply respected and feared him. However, this Li Qiye wasn't minding his words towards the King at all.Demon King Lun Ri patiently explained: \u201cIt is not that I don't want to see Young Master Li. Unfortunately, I am still in the middle of closed cultivation, so I can't personally meet you.\u201dLi Qiye nodded his head and smiled: \u201cFine, I won't make it hard for you. At the very least, I am a very reasonable man.\u201dLun Ri politely inquired: \u201cI want to hear how you were able to connect with our Heavenly Guardians.\u201dAll the elders were surprised as well. They never knew that their sect had Heavenly Guardians.At this moment, Lun Ri started to explain: \u201cThe Nine Saint Demon Gate has four Heavenly Guardians which are the four statues at the battle stage. They were invited by the patriarch to protect our sect. Not only that, they also guard the heaven vein and earth vein between the battle stage, the bloodline of our sect. However, they have never made a move until today.\u201dHis voice grew serious as he went on during his explanation. Once finished, all the elders' eyes were on Li Qiye. They didn't understand why the forever-immobile Heavenly Guardians helped Li Qiye today.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why was it that a person with a mortal physique, mortal life wheel, and mortal fate palace like Li Qiye was capable of communicating with their Heavenly Guardians? The gods were so unfair!If he was a disciple of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, then it would be borderline acceptable. However, he was from a different sect. Why would their Heavenly Guardians protect an outsider and harm their own sect?Demon King Lun Ri started to speak once again after the lengthy pause: \u201cThis being said, can you please tell us about the technique you used to control the Heavenly Guardians?\u201dLi Qiye hesitantly smiled: \u201cCommunication technique? I don't have any techniques. These are your Heavenly Guardians, you should know more about them than me.\u201dLi Qiye naturally couldn't tell them the secrets behind the event. As the Dark Crow during the Desolate Era, he paid in blood to formulate a successful plan to escape the Immortal Demon Grotto. After millions of years, he finally understood this particular logic: if you want to control your own destiny, you must personally possess formidable power.Although he possessed considerable power as the Dark Crow, it was not his own power. Luckily, after entering places that no one else dared to venture, he had found out many mysterious and magical secrets. From then on, he formulated a plan for his own personal cultivation if he were to ever return to his body.The four Heavenly Guardians of the Nine Saint Demon Gate were one of his secret preparations in the past for self-preservation. That year, he found them at the Ancestral Earth after countless efforts. They protected him for countless years in the past.The Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon had always wanted the four statues. He followed and begged Li Qiye for them nonstop. Since Nine Saint made many considerable contributions as Min Ren's fate protector, often at the risk of his own life, Li Qiye let him borrow them for his descendants.After successfully guilting Li Qiye out of them, Nine Saint immediately stationed them to protect the heaven and earth veins of the Nine Saint Demon Gate. At the same time, he allowed them to use the natural energy here to further strengthen themselves.However, the two had an agreement. Unless the Nine Saint Demon Gate was on the verge of sect destruction, the statues would never take action. They were neither slaves nor servants of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, and they would not be the fate protectors of any descendant of the sect.Since the Nine Saint Demon Gate also had a monster like the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect as its backing, it grew in power without much hindrance. Later on, during the decline of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, the Nine Saint Demon Gate became an independent existence, so it didn't suffer together. Due to this, the Nine Saint Demon Gate had never faced a disaster where the statues had to mobilize.The statues were personally taken by Li Qiye from the Land of the Old Bloods, so of course he knew how to communicate with them. This was why when he took the time to get on the shoulder of one of them, he conversed with them.\u201cIf Young Master Li is willing to part with the technique, the Nine Saint Demon Gate will definitely not mistreat you. Anything Young Master Li wants, just say the word and we will assist you to the utmost of our abilities.\u201dDemon King Lun Ri had not given up, he knew the real value of the Heavenly Guardians. The sect would become extremely powerful if the guardians could be controlled.All of the elders eagerly waited for Li Qiye's answer. If one statue was able to defeat the first elder, then what would be the combined power of all four be?\u201cYou know, there really isn't a technique. I was simply gossiping with the statues; just talking about things like home and life, that's all.\u201d Li Qiye answered in a playful manner with a coyish expression, acting like an innocent child.Of course, the Demon King and the elders did not believe Li Qiye's answer, but they couldn't do anything about it. They definitely couldn't force Li Qiye into giving them the technique as they would bring upon themselves an unprecedented disaster.Seeing the King's quiet contemplation, Li Qiye changed his demeanor and coldly added: \u201cHowever, I do need to say one thing. I need to perform a blood rite with the four statues.\u201dBoth the Demon King and elders were shocked. This had a completely different meaning. To perform a blood rite with their Heavenly Guardians was comparable to a linking technique.Demon King Lun Ri frankly responded: \u201cThe four statues are our Heavenly Guardians.\u201dLi Qiye aloofly played with his sleeves while he answered: \u201cThey can still be your Heavenly Guardians. The only thing is, I might need to borrow them for certain things in the future, just for a little bit.\u201dAn elder couldn't help but exclaim: \u201cThe four statues belong to our sect. Unless it is someone of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, no one has the rights to use them.\u201d There was no such thing as letting someone borrow your Heavenly Guardians. It was simply too unreasonable.Li Qiye glared at the elder and said: \u201cThis is not up to you. If you have a problem with it, then go cry to your guardians.\u201dDue to the promise that year, Li Qiye had to be patient when dealing with the Nine Saint Demon Gate. Otherwise, he would have just taken the statues and left.Demon King Lun Ri suddenly interjected to calm down the elder and Li Qiye: \u201cSince Young Master Li can communicate with the guardians, having them wake up and put into action isn't a bad thing.\u201dIn reality, everyone here knew that the Nine Saint Demon Gate did not have a choice in this matter. Although the Nine Saint Demon Gate was powerful, it was still a bit lacking when compared to the four statues. Remember, when four individuals work together in a formation, the power increase wouldn't be additive, it would be multiplicative.If it was only one statue, then they would be able to handle it. However, with the four of them combined, especially when they were situated on top of the heaven and earth veins of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, the risk was too high.\u201cThis is something a smart person would say.\u201d Li Qiye smiled and continued: \u201cDon't think that I will immediately cause trouble for the Nine Saint Demon Gate after I perform the rite with your Heavenly Guardians. If I wanted to, all of you wouldn't even have the opportunity to sit here. If I wanted to trample the Nine Saint Demon Gate, no one can stop my advance, not even if your patriarch rises from his grave.\u201dThe elders weren't happy with Li Qiye's attitude, but they couldn't say anything. The juxtaposition between the elders' raging faces and Li Qiye's nonchalantly attitude was quite amusing.\u201cSince this is the case, Young Master Li go ahead with the blood rite.\u201d Lun Ri agreed to Li Qiye's demand. Although he didn't know why a mortal like Li Qiye could control the four statues, this was his only option.Li Qiye responded: \u201cIf your sect follows the rules, so will I. The four statues will remain as your Heavenly Guardians.\u201dAfter a moment of contemplation, Lun Ri started speaking again: \u201cYoung Master Li! Our Nine Saint Demon Gate also has a sacred ground that no one has been able to open. Would you be interested in giving it a look?\u201d\u201cYour Highness, this can't happen!\u201d An elder immediately tried to stop the King.\u201cIt is fine for Young Master Li to have a look.\u201d Lun Ri quickly prevented the elder from saying more; his commanding voice did not allow for negotiation.Li Qiye's eyes turned bright as he asked: \u201cAre you talking about the Saint Cavern that your patriarch left behind?\u201dHe suddenly remembered an event from the past.That year, the old chicken head had once mentioned this cave to Li Qiye, but this was after Immortal Emperor Min Ren had received the Heaven's Will. Li Qiye's disposition was unstable at the time as well, so he wanted to enter deep slumber. Although he listened to the wily old chicken head's story, he didn't pay attention to it.\u201cThat's correct!\u201d Li Qiye's knowledge of this fact rattled Lun Ri's spirit. He quickly suggested: \u201cIf Young Master Li can open the Saint Cavern, we will give you considerable thanks.\u201dLi Qiye attempted to remember what the old chicken head once told him in the past and asserted: \u201cI can try to open the Saint Cavern once. If I am successful, then I want to take one item from it, the rest can stay with your sect.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d After hearing Li Qiye's words, Lun Ri required some time to think.An elder spoke up: \u201cYour Highness, this requires a careful discussion.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Find me when you are ready, I will be taking my leave.\u201d Li Qiye turned around and left the sky chamber. Yu He had to, once again, unwillingly carry him on his back.After Li Qiye's departure, an elder couldn't help express: \u201cYour Highness, this decision regarding the Saint Cavern feels a bit rushed.\u201d\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d The voice of Lun Ri came again: \u201cSince our inception, the Saint Cavern has always been isolated. No one has successfully opened the cave as of yet. This is a good opportunity for us, and it was in line with the patriarch's will.\u201dAn elder curiously inquired: \u201cYour Highness, what about the Heavenly Guardians? How come we have never heard of them before? What are they \u2014 Heavenly Beasts or Longevity Spirits?\u201d\u201cI'm not quite sure myself.\u201d Demon King Lun Ri stated: \u201cOur knowledge and writings regarding the Heavenly Guardians are quite lacking. Only the ancient scroll of the patriarch mentioned something about them. Unless we are at the brink of destruction, they will not activate by themselves. Only the sect masters are allowed to see this scroll.\u201dAnother elder conveyed: \u201cBut they showed their might today.\u201dLun Ri replied: \u201cI do not understand it either, but if they have chosen him, they must have their own reasons for doing so.\u201d\u201cThis kid, he is too scary.\u201d The first elder opened his mouth: \u201cAccording to Yu He, he went through the Chaotic Heart Forest twice, easily. This is truly unthinkable! Now the Heavenly Guardians have chosen him as well, this world really isn't fair.\u201dAnother elder lamented: \u201cThis is indeed an alarming fact. Ever since we came to be, we have always focused on cultivating the younger talents. Junior Leng is our strongest in terms of strength, and the princess is number one in terms of raw aptitude. However, the Heavenly Guardians didn't choose them, they chose a mortal boy with a mortal physique, mortal life wheel, and mortal fate palace instead.\u201d\u201cOf the numerous things in this world, we cannot understand all of them.\u201d In the end, although Lun Ri felt cheated as well, he could only acquiesce.An elder inquired: \u201cYour Highness, if he can actually open the Saint Cavern, are we really giving him anything he wants?\u201dAn unwilling Elder exclaimed: \u201cThat's right. It's rumored that in the Saint Cavern, there is a big chance of an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure hiding in there.\u201d\u201cIf he can actually open it, then it is the heaven's will.\u201d Lun Ri responded: \"According to Elder Jian, none of us in this generation will be able to open the Saint Cavern. Li Qiye has done many unthinkable deeds during his short stay here, so maybe he can open the cavern.\u201dAfter hearing the name Elder Jian, no one dared to open their mouths. This was because no one within the sect had more power and influence than Elder Jian, including even the sect master.In the end, the King declared: \u201cSend the order, if any disciple were to reveal what happened today, they will be heavily punished. This is an iron law!\u201dThey didn't want outsiders to know too much regarding their Heavenly Guardians.After Li Qiye returned, his group had been moved to a different guest location. This was a place meant for the visiting rulers of Kingdoms and emperors of Ancient Kingdoms \u2014 the highest level of hospitality and respect.This treatment made Nan Huairen and Protector Mo feel afraid of receiving too much love. They understood it was because of Li Qiye that they were able to receive such a warm reception.They had many questions to ask Li Qiye, but they didn't know where to start. They were afraid of his mysterious abilities and kept staring at him like he was an ancient monster, one that had never been seen before. One thing Nan Huairen did figure out was that the day when Li Qiye went up the statue's shoulder, it was in preparation for today.\u201cSay whatever you want to say.\u201d Seeing the master and disciple combo being so uncomfortable and confused, Li Qiye was very much amused while sitting in his chair.Protector Mo opened his mouth like he had something say, but he didn't know where to start. He was a quiet person in the first place, so he gave up and just sat back down.In contrast to Protector Mo, Nan Huairen was just waiting for the opportunity to speak up. He gathered up his courage and stuttered: \u201cThat, that thing, was it successful?\u201d\u201cWhat thing?\u201d It was Li Qiye's turn to be confused; he had no idea what Nan Huairen was implying.\u201cYou, you know. The thing about the marriage \u2014 marrying Princess Li.\u201d\u201cOh, you are talking about Li Shuangyan.\u201d Li Qiye chuckled, shook his head, and said: \u201cI did not inquire about this since I do not care about it. I can't reach the apex if I were to worry about matters regarding women.\u201dLi Qiye opened his big mouth once more, leaving Nan Huairen at a loss for words. Remember that Li Shuangyan was the prime descendant of the Nine Saint Demon Gate. Not only was she beautiful, she also had a King Physique, King Life Wheel, and most importantly, a Fate Palace of the Saint level. In the Grand Middle Territory, there were countless young geniuses that wanted to propose to Li Shuangyan, but in the end, Nan Huairen realized that he should not question Li Qiye's words.His eyes turned to the Serpent Punishing Stick instead. This regular wooden stick had beaten a Heaven's Mandate expert to the ground, leaving a deep impression in Nan Huairen's mind.\u201cHere. If you want to look at it, go ahead.\u201d Li Qiye noticed the peculiar gaze and generously threw the stick to him.Nan Huairen caught it, held it carefully in his hands, and thoroughly examined it. Even Protector Mo couldn't contain himself anymore and joined in on the fun. The two analyzed it together.However, no matter what they did, the only conclusion they could arrive at was that it was only a regular stick.Nan Huairen inquired: \u201cThis really is the wooden stick from the grand chamber, right?\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201d Li Qiye nodded his head.Nan Huairen swallowed and daringly asked Li Qiye: \u201cSenior, can I play around with it?\u201d\u201cLook at your silly self, do whatever you want to do.\u201d Li Qiye burst out laughing.Nan Huairen immediately lifted the stick to the sky and started swinging it around. However, it didn't carry the same force and grace like it did in the hands of Li Qiye.\u201cSenior, why is there such a difference between our swordplay?\u201dNan Huairen didn't understand how this regular stick was so magical when used by Li Qiye.Li Qiye glanced at him and sincerely answered: \u201cTruly believe and it will happen.\u201dHe stopped there; he couldn't easily explain the mystical truths behind the Serpent Punishing techniques to other people.[1] Not the actual Heaven's Will required to become an Immortal Emperor, but more of a comment regarding fate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yu He personally became Li Qiye's chaperone to take him to the deepest location of the Nine Saint Demon Gate.With Yu He's strength and cultivation, even in the entirety of Old Ox Country, he would be an influential powerhouse. However, he was now the chaperone of Li Qiye \u2014 no one would believe this even if rumors were to be spread.At the end of the Nine Saint Demon Gate was a lone mountain, and under the mountain was a sealed cave. It was unknown how long the cave had been sealed for. This cave was covered with wild grass and mushrooms, and the front of the cave showed signs of being tested by time.This was the forbidden zone of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, only elders and above could come here.Legend states that although the Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon left behind his cultivation manuals for the sect, there were still certain treasures he stored in the cave. It goes on to say that because he feared that his descendants would be weak and vain, he created the Saint Cavern so that there would always be a chance for revival should the sect be destroyed.One thing all the sect masters and elders were sure of, though, was that there existed at least one Immortal Emperor Life Treasure in there.When Immortal Emperor Min Ren received the Heaven's Will, it was told that he gave the Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure for his accomplishments as Min Ren's fate protector. However, the descendants of the Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon did not have it in their possession. This was why everyone believed that the treasure was located in the Saint Cavern.The Immortal Emperor Life Treasure was a weapon that Min Ren personally created during his conquest of the Nine Worlds. This Life Treasure was many times stronger than even a Virtuous Paragon True Treasure.Although this was not an Immortal Emperor True Treasure, a Life Treasure was enough to inspire greed from everyone and anyone.There were writings engraved on the side of the cave. The characters were radiant and alive in contrast to its surroundings.Only Demon under the heavens \u2014 these words exerted a powerful and majestic atmosphere. Each vivid and vibrant word had its own spirit, highlighted by the impeccable penmanship. It was as if these heavenly words were ready to pierce the heavens at any moment like a flying dragon or dancing phoenix. Tested by the vicissitudes of time, the aura of the Virtuous Paragon remained even after many moons.These words were left behind by the Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon himself. The descendants of the Nine Saint Demon Gate all believed that this was the key to opening the Saint Cavern.To the left side was \u201cOnly Demon under the heavens\u201d, but the right side was left empty. That was why the descendants believed that if they could correctly match the wordplay on the left side, the cavern could be opened.However, there were others who thought that the words \u201cOnly Demon under the heavens\u201d was the real key. It hid untraceable mysterious truths. Each stroke involved supreme merit laws. As long as one could understand its meanings, they could open the cave by themselves.Both of these predictions were tested by disciples throughout the ages. There was one disciple with very high innate aptitudes in the Nine Saint Demon Gate who cultivated next to these words in order to understand the true meanings. Another time, the sect master personally went to the mortal world; he found a peerless expert of literature, hoping that this person could write a matching prose to the right.However, the cavern remained closed despite trying all of these methods throughout the years.As for Li Qiye, after seeing the cavern and the words written to the left, he immediately knew how to open the cavern. However, because there were elders watching him, he couldn't immediately open it.He stepped up to the wall, moving side to side. He randomly knocked on the walls, bent down to the ground, then dejectedly shook his head as if the answer was not where he thought it was. After a while, he focused on the words \u201cOnly Demon under the heavens.\"Seeing Li Qiye's actions not bearing fruit made the elders restless. However, they didn't dare to say anything. They were all just holding their breaths while anxiously watching Li Qiye's every movement.Eventually, Li Qiye sat in a meditative pose in front of the cave. Time slowly passed. From morning to noon and from noon to the fall of the sun in the west... The sun reddened the sky, but Li Qiye remained motionless.Li Qiye meditating for a whole day made the elders lose their patience.An elder spoke to himself: \u201cWill he be successful?\u201d\u201cIs this little devil just pretending?\u201d Seeing that there was no connection between Li Qiye and the cave, their trust in him started to waver. Maybe his miracles with the Chaotic Heart Forest and the four Heavenly Guardians were just that \u2014 miracles.\u201cHmmph, maybe he got lucky.\u201d This Elder didn't actually trust what he was saying. He knew Li Qiye had secrets, he was only voicing his dissatisfaction of having an outsider in their sacred ground.When the elders were rambling among themselves, Li Qiye immediately stood up and said: \u201cPen and ink!\" After having sat here for a whole day, his butt was in agonizing pain.An elder brought him a calligraphy pen and a bottle of ink. Li Qiye then began to act mysteriously. He shook his head and lamented: \u201cSo that's how it is, that's how it is! The Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon is indeed unfathomable.\u201dHe then carefully dipped the pen into the ink while holding his sleeve gracefully and started writing on the right wall of the cave.\u201cMere Chicken above the earth.\"He was not an expert calligrapher, so he hastily wrote these words. They contained no aura at all in stark contrast to the words of the Virtuous Paragon.\u201cOnly Demon under the heavens, Mere Chicken above the earth.\u201dThe two lines had such conflicting meanings that they didn't mesh well together.After Li Qiye was finished, the elders' faces went black because these words were simply dishonoring their patriarch. Li Qiye's words were not worthy to be paired with the phrase \u201cOnly Demon under the heavens.\u201dAn elder gave a deafening roar: \u201cHow bold, to shame our Nine Saint Demon Gate!\u201dLi Qiye glared at him and retorted: \u201cYou are only an ordinary cultivator, what do you know about the enigmatic meanings behind literature? You don't even know the thoughtfulness of your ancestor, yet you dare to stand there and scream?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d After hearing Li Qiye's response, the red-faced elder was ready to explode.\u201cCreak\u2026 creak\u2026 rumble...\u201d Rumbles could be heard as the Saint Cavern started to open.The elders rolled their eyes. They couldn't believe what they were seeing! How could the words \u201cMere Chicken above the earth\u201d open the cave?\u201cHow is this possible?\u201dLi Qiye perched his lips and explained: \u201cBecause your patriarch was a chicken that reached the apex to become a demon, that is why I wrote those words.\u201dHe naturally didn't tell them the real secret. The Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon didn't have this name in the beginning, he used to be known as the Nine Saint Heavenly Demon, a name of great arrogance. When the Dark Crow asked him to become a fate protector for Min Ren, he immediately refused. He praised himself as the \u201cOnly Demon under the heavens,\u201d which was why he chose not to be under anyone.Li Qiye was angered since he dared to rudely refuse his invitation. Li Qiye beat up the Virtuous Paragon, forced him back to his original form, and plucked all of his feathers out of anger as he laughed: \u201cHaha, Mere Chicken above the earth.\u201d[1] This wasn't made explicitly clear before, but there are two types of treasures: True and Life. True is a much stronger version than Life because it is imbued with true energy from its master.[2] This is a historical Chinese poetry play; each word has to either match or have an opposite meaning for their corresponding counterpart in the same order, and the two lines also need to have the same or opposite meaning as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At one point, he had gloriously swept through the Nine Worlds; his illustrious and arrogant name spread to the four corners of the world. However, he still lost to Li Qiye in the end and had no choice but to become the fate protector of Immortal Emperor Min Ren.\u201cOnly Demon under the heavens\u201d was the slogan of the Virtuous Paragon while \u201cMere Chicken above the earth\u201d was Li Qiye's line to tease him.Many generations of sect masters and geniuses of the Nine Saint Demon Gate tried to complete the second phrase, but they had always failed. No one would have guessed that it was such a silly line.Li Qiye calling their patriarch an old chicken was very rude. However, if one really thought about it, it was simply the truth.\u201cLet's see if your ancestor left behind anything good.\u201d Li Qiye happily smiled and went into the cave, not caring about the elders.The elders regained their wits and quickly followed him in.Only one compartment was within the holy cave. Inside, dazzling lights brilliantly shone from all the treasures. There were life treasures, immortal metals, and heavenly jewels in the central area. To the right were priceless cultivation manuals and ancient scrolls. The whole room, ornamented with powerful treasures, blinded the elders.Li Qiye's eyes swept across the cave as he murmured: \u201cThe old chicken head's treasures are quite plentiful.\u201d The Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon's reputation was well deserved; his lifelong treasures were terrifying.An elder nearby heard him whispering and asked: \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dLi Qiye shook his head and replied: \u201cNothing, I was just talking to myself.\u201dThis answer made all the elders suspiciously stare at Li Qiye; even the grand elder thought the little boy was too mysterious.\u201cViolet Dragon Dual Sword!\u201d An elder looked at the many life treasures floating in the air and couldn't help but exclaim: \u201cDemon Extinguishing Pagoda, Nine Galaxy Spoon, Heavenly Wooden Vessel \u2014 these are all treasures that have been recorded in an ancient scroll of the sect.\u201d\u201cThis is the Qing Mu Ancient Tablet\u2026\u201d Another elder was looking at the cultivation manuals and found a startling ancient technique.At this moment, the elders of the Nine Saint Demon Gate were dazzled. It seemed that their patriarch only left half of his treasures with the actual sect when he passed away.\u201cImmortal\u2026 Immortal Emperor Life Treasure!\u201d At this time, the first elder's eyes moved towards a jade table in the middle of the room. There lied an ancient sealed box, but its Immortal Emperor aura was still leaking outside.Even though it only revealed a strand of its power, it could be compared to the might of the high heavens. This power made them feel as if they were being pressured by all nine skies. The aura of the Heaven's Will could be found all around it. All worldly creatures must bow down to this remnant of an Immortal Emperor's breath.\u201cImmortal Emperor Life Treasure!\u201d The rest of the elders that finally saw the item were shaken with anticipation. This was an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure left behind by an authentic Immortal Emperor created by Min Ren himself.As the elders were drowning in their excitement, Li Qiye opened his mouth: \u201cDon't forget, I have the right to pick the first item.\u201d These words were like throwing a bucket of cold water over all their heads.Burning red eyes were staring straight at Li Qiye. If he was to take this treasure, wouldn't their dreams be instantly shattered?Despite the numerous death stares, Li Qiye remained standing there casually. He wasn't afraid of them changing their minds. Even if all the elders were present, he would still act the same.In the end, the first elder took a deep breath and stated: \u201cOur Nine Saint Demon Gate will do what we say; if the King has made an agreement with you, we will definitely not eat our words!\u201dAfter he was done, his mouth felt bitter with regret. This was an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure, but he couldn't go back on his sect master's decision.\u201cIt seems that you lot are still quite honorable.\u201d Li Qiye was as calm as a tranquil well as he slowly spoke: \u201cI actually do appreciate your King, Lun Ri.\u201dThese arrogant words made the elders speechless. Their King was a peerless hero. His whole life was filled with numerous achievements not only in the Grand Middle Territory, but the whole Mortal Emperor World.However, here was a thirteen-year-old boy running his mouth. He even dared to say that he \u201cappreciated\u201d Demon King Lun Ri! If outsiders were to hear this, they would laugh until their teeth fell off. However, this wasn't the first time the elders heard Li Qiye say something outrageous, so what could they do outside of staying silent?\u201cClap, clap, clap.\u201d Li Qiye clapped his hands three times and a mysterious ancient box from a cabinet immediately flew into his hands. Li Qiye glared at the elders and stored the box in his shirt before saying: \u201cIt is only an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure, there's no need to be so alarmed.\u201d Finished speaking, he turned around and left.The elders of the Nine Saint Demon Gate were shocked due to two reasons. The first was because Li Qiye only clapped his hands three times for the ancient box to fly into his hands \u2014 this event was very strange. It also happened far too quickly; they couldn't do anything but watch and be curious about what was inside the box. Second, in the mouth of Li Qiye, an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure was something unimportant. This was an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure, everyone knew what this represented, but in the mouth of Li Qiye, this type of treasure was akin to clouds in the sky.As the elders were still adjusting to the event that just transpired, Li Qiye had already left the cave. The elders quickly counted all the treasures and began preparing them to be stored in the Nine Saint Demon Gate.It took three days for them to accomplish the task. Yu He, once again, had to carry Li Qiye on his back. However, he was no longer ashamed or angry this time; he knew how important Li Qiye was to the sect.In the Sky Chamber, all the elders were present. Only Demon King Lun Ri wasn't there in person. When Li Qiye sat in his chair, Lun Ri's voice appeared in the chamber: \u201cI am still in the midst of my isolated meditation. It is truly unfortunate that I cannot meet you.\u201dAlthough powerful and influential, Demon King Lun Ri was very courteous towards this thirteen-year-old boy.Li Qiye calmly answered: \u201cWe still have a lot of time, there's no need to rush.\u201dDemon King Lun Ri was silent for a moment, then he requested: \u201cYoung Master Li, would you be willing to stay at the Nine Saint Demon Gate? Whatever the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect can offer you, we can do the same!\u201dThe elders were not surprised by their King's words. It was as if they had already discussed this situation.This proposition made Li Qiye contemplate for some time. The Nine Saint Demon Gate definitely had a huge advantage over the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, many times over, even. Any cultivator, especially the younger ones, would pick the Nine Saint Demon Gate without a doubt.\u201cThank you for your kind intentions, but I have a fateful connection with the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Since I am currently the prime disciple, I will forever be a disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201d Li Qiye had too many emotional attachments to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, even if he didn't like all the sect masters, especially Min Ren's first disciple. This was why after Immortal Emperor Min Ren passed away, he never returned to the sect.The key factor for his decision was that he wanted to rebuild the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. If he didn't choose the Heaven Protector Palace, then it was even more unlikely that he would choose the Nine Saint Demon Gate.An Elder was unhappy with the response and coldly exclaimed: \u201cHmmph, it's only the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, how can it compare to out Nine Saint Demon Gate?!\u201dMany people wanted to join the Nine Saint Demon Gate since it was the most powerful sect in the Old Ox Country. However, Li Qiye had rejected the Demon King's personal invitation \u2014 this was not giving them any face.Li Qiye smirked before responding: \u201cA true peerless master will not care whether a sect is strong or weak. The apex does not care whether one comes from peasantry or royalty!\u201dThis answer made the elder bite his tongue because it was an incredibly natural response, yet it contained confidence and strength.Everyone stared at this thirteen-year-old boy who just spoke a line that contained the wisdom and willpower required for one to reach the apex.[1] The vessel here means a boat/ship. It is the same type of treasure as the boat in Spirit Vessel.[2] The word appreciate here has the connotation of an older/more powerful person praising a junior in Chinese.[3] Heaven Protector Palace was in chapter 1; it is the sect of the Black Dragon King.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No matter how heaven defying a genius is, they have nothing to brag about in front of me!\u201dThis thirteen year old boy kept saying outrageous things; however, it seemed natural when it was he who was the one speaking \u2013 like it was a matter of fact.Demon King Lun Ri gave his heavenly order: \u201cShuang'er, come out and meet young master Li.\u201dWhen prime descendant Li Shuangyan appeared in the Sky Chamber, her beauty brightened the place; a peerless beauty in this generation that people could not stop offering praises to.This was a girl around the age of eighteen. Her features resembled a masterpiece painting; her thinly plucked eyebrows were arched perfectly around her shining crescent eyes. Her charming little crimson lips accentuated her alluring face. However, her expression was as cold as ice and arrogance could be contrived from the aura between her eyebrows and her pure white robe.Li Shuangyan was the prime descendant of the Nine Saint Demon Gate as well as the number one beauty in Old Ox country. Not only that, her aptitude and cultivation level match her peerless looks as well.Such a child blessed by the heavens, it would be natural for her not wanting to be wed to a person that only had a mortal Physique, mortal Life Wheel, and mortal Fate Palace. Plus, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had already gone downhill, his position as the Prime Disciple was meaningless.Li Qiye wasn't overly surprised by the peerless beauty and pride-worthy talents of Li Shuangyan. As he floated through the endless currents of time, he had seen many beauties. When it came to talents and beauty, how many women could compare to Immortal Emperor Xiu Shu and Immortal Emperor Bing Yu?After taking a close look at Li Shuangyan, Li Qiye nodded his head: \u201cNot too bad.\u201dLi Shuangyan had a favorable opinion of Li Qiye after his first sentence, but the second enraged her. Li Qiye continued his thought: \u201cShe is still a bit lacking to be my wife. Saint Fate Palace is also moderately acceptable. I am currently lacking a sword maid; you can be my sword maid then.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Not only Li Shuangyan, but the Elders were enraged as well. Li Shuangyan was not only the prime descendant, but she was also their pride. The whole Nine Saint Demon Gate put their hopes onto her. However, today, Li Qiye dared to arrogantly announce that he wanted her to be his sword slave; this was a complete slap to the face for them.Not waiting for their retorts, Li Qiye slowly continued: \u201cI don't like to force anyone. Think over it carefully; if you agree, then you can find me at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201dHe stopped and stared at Li Shuangyan.After hearing his words, she was shakingly maddened. Everywhere she went, she was the moon surrounded by the stars. Young geniuses that wanted to marry her could form a waiting line from the east to the west of Old Ox country.However, right now, a boy that had not grown hair dared to presumptuously ask her to be his sword maid? The boy looks very cute on the outside but in Li Shuangyan's eyes, he was extremely unlikable.The elders exclaimed: \u201cYou are being too arrogant!\u201d A descendant of the Nine Saint Demon Gate was only worthy of being a sword maid? The boy was clearly trying to humiliate the Nine Saint Demon Gate.\u201cIt is up to you to take a chance. I have given you the opportunity; whether you can grasp it or not will depend on your fate.\u201d Li Qiye ignored the Elders, took one last glance at Li Shuangyan, and then left.Li Shuangyan's icy expression was overtaken by red anger, and her milky breasts bounced from heavy breathing. She had met many arrogant people, but someone like Li Qiye was the first. The worst thing was that he was only thirteen. She was five years older than him, yet he dared to act that way in front of her. People say children are cute, but Li Qiye was anything but cute in Li Shuangyan's eyes.\u201cYour highness, he dared to disrespect us like this; we can't easily forgive him!\u201d An Elder raged indignantly.Demon King Lun Ri quietly answered: \u201cA true dragon will fly to the nine heavens; a godly phoenix will sweep the nine worlds. A dragon or a phoenix, my eyes are eager to see!\u201dAfter coming back to his guest house, Nan Huairen quickly ran over and asked: \u201cSenior, how is your marriage with princess Li?\u201dProtector Mo was also curious. He also knew that the Nine Saint Demon Gate highly valued Li Qiye; there was a high chance that this arranged marriage would be successful.Today, when the Nine Saint Demon Gate formally invited Li Qiye, he thought chances were that they wanted to talk about the marriage.\u201cWhat marriage?\u201d Li Qi ye stared at Nan Huairen and said: \u201cI never said I was going to marry her. If she was willing, I would take her in as a maid.\u201d\u201cMai\u2026 Mai\u2026 Mai\u2026 Maid!\u201d Nan Huairen started stuttering; Li Qiye's words had shocked him.\u201cYou were truly confused!\u201d If this was before, he would be reprimanding Li Qiye. However, now, when he was standing in front of him, he felt that his position was naturally lower. Protector Mo didn't dare to scold him from the perspective of a senior.\u201cShe is only a girl, no need to be so terrified.\u201d Li Qiye essentially didn't mind. Li Shuangyan was indeed worthy of his tutelage; however, when compared to Immortal Emperor Bing Yu, she was quite lacking.Afterward, Li Qiye had finally completed his blood rite with the four statues. With this done, this trip had been a complete success, so he wanted to return to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.During this time, the Elders did not show their face; same for Li Shuangyan. Li Qiye did not really care for what they were planning.\u201cIf we return, what do we report on this?\u201d Before the departure, Protector Mo hesitantly asked Li Qiye.Li Qiye glanced back and smiled: \u201cThis depends on your choice; do you want to be on my side or the Elders'?\u201dThese were simple words, but they scared Protector Mo. He was not a dumb person; to become a Protector, he had to surpass many difficulties and encounters.Nan Huairen couldn't help but stare at his master. He was even more wily than Protector Mo and he knew how to pick the opportunity and read people's intentions.Their positions in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect couldn't be considered low. One was a hall master, and the other was one of the twelve Protectors. Protector Mo was only below the Elders and the Sect Master. If he was to join a new disciple, anyone would say that was an unwise decision.Protector Mo hadn't responded yet, but Nan Huairen saw the light in this moment. He saw a new door opening right in front of him.\u201cMaster!\u201d Nan Huairen took a deep breath and reminded Protector Mo.Protector Mo's heart was swaying. As his master, how could he not know what his disciple's thoughts were? However, this was such an unbelievable story; he, as a Protector, having to be under the command of a new disciple? This was crazy!\u201cWhatever you say, I will immediately do just that!\u201d In the end, Protector Mo, heavily so, made the most important decision of his life at that moment; one that would carry special significance.Protector Mo thought he was becoming senile; he couldn't believe he had just become an underling to a new disciple. Not only that, he had to hide the many events that had happened, recently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Only a crazy person or a fool would do such a thing. Protector Mo felt like he belonged to one of those two groups. However, his intuition told him that in the future, they would have unlimited potential if they were to follow this thirteen year old boy. However, in the end, this was only based on intuition.Nan Huairen's heart was startled as well. This was a very significant life choice, and his master had already chosen his destiny. Nan Huairen knew what his answer would be: \u201cWith just one word from senior, and I will jump through any fire and water without hesitation!\u201dNan Huairen said in an utmost and serious manner after heavy inhaling.Before, when he called Li Qiye \u201csenior\u201d, it had a different meaning. It was because it was part of the sect's custom. Now, the word \u201csenior\u201d had a different connotation.A thirteen year old almost turned the Nine Saint Demon Gate upside down, he dared to underestimate the Elders that were crowned Royal Nobles, and he was able to speak calmly in front of the Demon King! Other people would think Li Qiye was too arrogant, or he did not know his own strength; however, that was because they did not see him traversing the Chaotic Heart Forest and killing Protector Hua and his disciple. Nan Huairen understood that other people's perception of Li Qiye was completely inaccurate.Li Qiye, as the Prime Disciple of Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, dared to kill a Protector and asked for the Nine Saint Demon Gate's princess to be a maid. He had already planned everything before stepping into the Nine Saint Demon Gate, knowing that he could walk out unscathed.Nan Huairen was very smart, and he thought about it carefully. Even if he tried his hardest his whole life, his peak would be becoming an Elder for the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Maybe Li Qiye's appearance would change his destiny.Seeing these two join his ranks, Li Qiye nodded his head and boldly announced: \u201cOne day, you two will understand how wise of a decision you have made today.\u201d\u201cWhat should we report when we return to the sect?\u201d Protector Mo prudently asked. The events linked to the trial and marriage have too much significance; he did not know what was okay to say.Li Qiye smiled at Protector Mo and answered: \u201cIf Elder Yun wants to speak with you, then in my opinion, you should do the following\u2026\u201dWhat Li Qiye told him to do made Protector Mo feel uneasy. Before their departure, the First Elder of the Nine Saint Demon Gate had met him and asked that the story regarding the Heavenly Guardians be kept a secret. At that moment, Protector Mo had not agreed to the request.\u201cI understand.\u201d Protector Mo knew what he should and shouldn't say as long as the chosen rhetoric benefitted him and Li Qiye.Finally, the three of them left the Nine Saint Demon Gate. Grand Protector Yu He personally went to see them off. In recent times, no one from the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had ever received such an honor.The gateway was opened, and the portal between the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and Nine Saint Demon Gate activated. Finally, the group of three had returned home. After leaving the temple, they took a deep breath and basked in the heavenly spirits of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; they thought about the events that transpired and felt like they had just woken up from a dream.Returning to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, as the one who was leading the trip for the trial between the two sects, Protector Mo immediately went to meet the Six Elders to give his report. Li Qiye went back to his mountain peak.Li Qiye stood quietly on top of his peak, overlooking the entirety of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. He remembered when Immortal Emperor Min Ren was still alive; the area of the sect spanned a million miles, and its refined energy was as expansive as the ocean.Now, not only had the area governed by the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect decreased, but its refined energy from the surroundings was slowly drying. Anyone standing in this land would feel that the world essence of the sect had become very thin.Today, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was like a flickering candle in the wind or an elderly man that could meet his end at any moment.Li Qiye sighed in his heart. He did not pick the Heaven Protector City or the War God Temple; not even the Nine Saint Demon Gate. He ultimately chose the ever declining Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.As aforementioned, he did not like the previous Sect Masters of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. That year, he hoped that Min Ren would pick a different disciple to become the next Sect Master, even when this disciple's talents were not as strong as the first disciple. Li Qiye valued him greatly for his character instead. Unfortunately, after he woke up from his deep slumber, he found that the first disciple had became the new Sect Master and proclaimed his sect to be the traditional orthodox sect.Li Qiye had never liked the type of people who considered themselves as the only ones who were orthodox, which was why he had never returned to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect or cared about its ups and downs.However, in this era, where he had regained his true body, it was fateful that the first person he met was Old Devil from the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Li Qiye had single-handedly taught Min Ren; in a sense, he was the true creator of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. He was confident that he could reignite its old glory. One day, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, under his command, would sweep through the heavens and earth, reigning over the Nine Worlds.Li Qiye was so lost in his thoughts that he did not notice Nan Huairen's arrival.\u201cSenior, the Elders wish to see you.\u201d Nan Huairen waited until Li Qiye was finished contemplating before he spoke.Li Qiye slightly nodded his head and followed Nan Huairen into the Grand Chamber. The Six Elders had gathered there beforehand, and all of them had their eyes set on Li Qiye.The atmosphere in the Grand Chamber suddenly became strangely dignified and calm. Everyone had their own thoughts.The Six Elders previously had heard Protector Mo's report on the events regarding the trials, but Protector Mo did not reveal everything. He concentrated on Li Qiye's passing through the Chaotic Heart Forest, he purposely left the fight with Xu Hui intentionally vague, he did not mention the Serpent Punishing Stick, or Li Qiye's control of the four Heavenly Guardians. In the end, he even concluded that Li Qiye's victory over Xu Hui was pure luck.\u201cYou have successfully passed the trial?\u201d The First Elder formally asked Li Qi ye. The truth was, the Six Elders did not have any confidence regarding this arranged marriage, but the impossible had happened. Li Qiye passed the trial, but the more surprising detail was that he could go through the Chaotic Heart Forest.Li Qiye ignored the serious atmosphere in the chamber, and exclaimed: \u201cHonorable Elder, that is right! It seems like I should be getting the rewards promised to me, yes?\u201d\u201cOf course there will be rewards, but I need you to explain one thing.\u201d First Elder inquired: \u201cFrom what I've heard, Xu Hui was a renown young disciple from the Nine Saint Demon Gate. His cultivation was the same as a sectional leader in our sect. You just joined our sect and had never cultivated before, how did you manage to defeat him?\u201d\u201cHonorable Elder, Merit Laws are complex; martial arts are simple. I practiced the \u201cInvisible Dual Blade\u201d technique in a strange manner; as long as the opponent revealed a weakness in their defense, he will immediately receive a death blow. When it comes to a life and death battle, the brave person will win.\u201d Li Qiye calmly answered.\u201cNonsense!\u201d An Elder named Xiong suddenly yelled and coldly continued:\u201cA mortal proclaiming that he had killed a Heaven's Mandate cultivator through sheer techniques is ridiculous.\u201d This Elder Xiong before had supported Li Qiye; however, today, he spoke coldly, and he was even unhappy; the before and after was like the sky against the depths.Li Qiye looked at Elder Xiong and spoke slowly: \u201cDear Elder, I had only spoken the truth. What other people can't do does not mean that I can't as well.\u201dHe then looked at the remaining Elders in the room: \u201cDear Elders, today, I am a hero from the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. If the Elders truly think that I had cheated in some way, then you guys can question the people who saw it with their own eyes; people like Protector Mo or the people of the Nine Saint Demon Gate.\u201d\u201cAll of the Elders know, in your hearts, that this trip to the Nine Saint Demon Gate was dangerously ominous. By going to the Nine Saint Demon Gate, we were essentially going to our own demise. However, because of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's reputation, even if I were to lose my life, I would have done the same again. Today, I come back as a hero. what is the reasoning behind your suspicions of me? This is how you treat a hero? If this is the reality, then the people's hearts will become cold; who will want to sacrifice themselves for the sect anymore?\u201d Li Qiye paused a moment and then he went on: \u201cBefore our departure, we had an agreement; do you honorable Elders wish to retract your words? If that is the case, then I can only say my joining of this sect was a mistake. Our Cleansing Incense Ancient Act is of Immortal Emperor lineage for many era; if the elders are not true to their words, then how can we remain trustworthy as a sect?\u201d\u201cWhether our sect is trustworthy or not, it is not up to you to comment.\u201d An Elder loudly yelled.Li Qiye ignored the reaction of this Elder and kept going on: \u201cI risked my life going into the Nine Saint Demon Gate and came out with a complete success. If the Elders carried out the promise from that day without accusing me of lying, I would not be criticizing. Otherwise, I will cry 'unfair' because the success of this trip was potentially traded with my life.\u201dFinished speaking, Li Qiye coldly glared at the Six Elders.\u201cYou have said too much!\u201d At this moment, an Elder coughed. His expression contained a little bit of shame.The First Elder started speaking: \"Li Qiye, it is not that we wanted to berate you; the thing is, this whole thing is just a little strange. Let's set aside the Xu Hui thing; I want to hear how you successfully passed the Chaotic Heart Forest.\u201dThe First Elder's eyes brightened up and stared at Li Qiye as if he wanted to see through the little boy.[1] This is another proverb, comparing the two great extremes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If killing Xu Hui could be attributed to luck, then it was also due to his arrogance that Li Qiye was able to sneak an attack on him. Fate was unpredictable, and a person could be lucky sometimes.However, the Chaotic Heart Forest was not like that at all. The Six Elders were aware that during the last one hundred thousand years, no one from the young generation had successfully passed through all of the levels, unless that person was of the Virtuous Paragon level.Being pressured by the Six Elders' gazes, Protector Mo and Nan Huairen were sweating in place of Li Qiye.\u201cHonorable Elders, the Chaotic Heart Forest was meant as a way to test the minds of those who have entered. It can't be considered a cultivation strength test. As long as one's spiritual willpower is enough, then he can cross through the whole forest; it has nothing to do with one's cultivation.\u201d Li Qiye responded to the First Elder's question.\u201cHmmmph, your mortal spiritual willpower is stronger than a Royal Noble's?\u201d Elder Xiong unhappily exclaimed.Li Qiye furrowed his brows, and said: \u201cElder, spiritual power has nothing to do with cultivation strength. A high cultivation achievement does not equate to strong willpower. Throughout the ages, plenty of Enlightened Beings and Heavenly Kings, due to their unstable willpower, have suffered a pitiful death from Qi Deviation.\u201d\u201cThis thing\u2026 who doesn't know how high the sky is or the vastness of the earth? A person like you dares to criticize Enlightened Beings and Heavenly Kings?\u201d Elder Xiong quietly spoke.Li Qiye impatiently said: \u201cI've only spoken the truth. If the Elders want to keep on thinking that I am lying, then you can go to the Nine Saint Demon Gate and verify the truth!\u201dSeeing Li Qiye losing his patience, Elder Xiong rolled his eyes and a storm was about to brew, but the First Elder coughed and interjected: \u201cWe'll let this go as well. How about your marriage with Princess Li?\u201dEven though they weren't content with his explanations regarding Xu Hui and the Chaotic Heart Forest, the most important thing was the marriage. The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the Nine Saint Demon Gate needed to be in laws! The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect needed a strong backing like Nine Saint Demon Gate.\u201cThis matter you will have to ask the Nine Saint Demon Gate; it is not my decision.\u201d Li Qiye no longer wanted to continue this conversation, and he abruptly answered: \u201cThe discussion concludes here!\u201dThe First Elder had no choice but to give up. They couldn't force Li Shuangyan to marry Li Qiye; they lacked the strength to negotiate with the Nine Saint Demon Gate.The First Elder continued: \u201cYou have done a great deed for the sect. According to our prior agreement, anything that was promised will be given to you\u2026\u201d\u201cBrother Gu\u2026\u201d Elder Xiong wanted to interject, but the First Elder softly gestured with his sleeves, telling Elder Xiong to be quiet.The First Elder stared at Li Qiye and continued: \u201cFirst, once you have reached the stage of Physique Accumulation, we will grant you a King Grade medicinal paste. Second, for Physique, Life Wheel, and Fate Palace techniques; you will get to pick one cultivation method for each of the three. Of course, you can also pick different techniques, but you may pick no more than three manuals. Are you satisfied with this?\u201d\u201cThat is fine! However, I still have one more request.\u201d Li Qiye nodded his head.The First Elder responded: \u201cYou may, tell us.\u201d\u201cI still need a weapon, so I want to pick a Life Treasure or a True Treasure!\u201d Li Qiye replied.The First Elder agreed: \u201cFine. From the Life Treasures, True Treasures, and Life Wheel Treasures below the third floor, you can pick any of them.\u201d\u201cMy gratitude, Elder.\u201d Li Qiye respectfully gestured his hands, and then turned around to leave.\u201cHuairen, you go with Qi Ye!\u201d The First Elder commanded Nan Huairen after Li Qiye had left.After Li Qiye's departure, Elder Xiong proclaimed: \u201cBrother Gu, I'm afraid this boy is problematic. He might be a spy sent from the Nine Saint Demon Gate.\u201d\u201cHow can you say that brother Cao Xiong?\u201d A different Elder slowly shook his head and disagreed: \u201cPersonally, I don't think that is the case. The Nine Saint Demon Gate currently is many times stronger than we are. They are reigning over the Old Ox country and are already a gigantic monster; why would they need to have a spy in our sect?\u201d\u201cBrother Sun speaks with reason.\u201d An Elder agreed: \u201cThe Nine Saint Demon Gate has no need to be devious against us.\u201d\u201cThat is not for certain; maybe the Nine Saint Demon Gate covets our Emperor Merit Laws or even our Heaven's Will Merit Laws.\u201d Elder Xiong spoke with a grave manner.After hearing these words, the rest of the five Elders stared at each other.\u201cI don't think that would be necessary.\u201d Fourth Elder Sun shook his head and said: \u201cLi Qiye had the Cleansing Incense Ancient Order. If he wanted our Emperor Merit Laws, he only needed to open his mouth and we couldn't say no. Take a step back; if the Nine Saint Demon Gate truly wanted our Emperor Merit Laws, who here could stop Demon King Lun Ri in our sect?\u201dThis resonated with the rest of the Elders, and they contemplated silently. If the Nine Saint Demon Gate truly wanted the Emperor Merit Laws, then they could annihilate all of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. If Demon King Lun Ri personally took action, no one in the sect could stop him. In reality, even the Elders of the Nine Saint Demon Gate would have been enough.In the end, Elder Xiong quietly stated: \u201cBrother Gu, I feel like we cannot be careless; precautions are necessary.\u201d\u201cThis has to be reported to the Sect Master!\u201d The First Elder formally announced; he didn't show his feelings regarding the topic.\u201cSo be it!\u201d Elder Xiong slightly scowled; his voice contained unfavorable opinions regarding the Sect Master.\"The Elders think you are a spy from the Nine Saint Demon Gate.\" After leaving the chamber, Nan Huairen whispered to Li Qiye. He was a sharp person; his best discipline was predicting the thoughts of other people; of course, he knew what the Six Elders were thinking.\u201cThey can think whatever they want.\u201d Li Qiye only smiled. The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's weakening was not without reasons. Although the six are Elders, their cultivation couldn't be higher than Royal Nobles. More importantly, they couldn't work independently and make decisive decisions.Regarding this topic, Li Qiye asked: \u201cWhat about Elder Xiong?\u201dThat day, when he wanted to be the Prime Disciple, Elder Xiong was supporting him. However, his behavior today was contrasting the past.\u201cBe careful of Elder Xiong.\u201d Nan Huairen looked left and right, then he whispered: \u201cSecond Elder Cao Xiong was competing for the Sect Master position with the current Sect Master, but he failed. Later on, he wanted his disciple, Leng Shizhi, to become the Prime Disciple, but he was rejected by the Sect Master. Regarding the Sect Master position, he had always wanted it. Even if he couldn't climb to the position, he would wish for his disciple to become the Sect Master. Plus, Cao Xiong's backing included the guest masters.\u201d\u201cI understand. If I was a piece of trash, then I couldn't become the Sect Master; even if I were the Prime Disciple. If I have relations with Li Shuangyan, then it is another matter.\u201d Li Qiye understood Elder Xiong's contrasting intentions.Nan Huairen nodded his head and added: \u201cElder Xiong has always paid attention to the Sect Master; he feared that the Sect Master would take in a genius Prime Disciple. Due to the Prime Disciple seat having always been empty, he had discussed with the Elders numerous times about promoting Leng Shizhi. However, the Sect Master has always declined.\u201d\u201cWell, where is the Sect Master?\u201d Li Qiye felt it was strange that after him joining the sect, he had never met the Sect Master, Su Yonghuang.Nan Huairen didn't know the answer: \u201cSect Master had never stayed within the sect. She had always cultivated outside; in reality, I've only met her a couple of times.\u201dNan Huairen started whispering because he saw people nearby: \u201cThere is a rumor within the sect. It is that Sect Master was forced to leave by the Elders. No one knew the specifics. In short, when the Sect Master left the sect, she also brought along some Protectors and Leaders as well.\u201dLi Qiye stroke his chin, and conjectured: \u201cFrom this, it seems like there are a lot of internal fighting within the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. It appears that the current situation of the sect is a lot more complicated than I first thought.\u201d\u201cSome say there are four factions.\u201d Nan Huairen answered: \u201cThere are a number of Protectors and Leaders with the Sect Master. Some Leaders are with Elder Xiong, and they hope that Elder Xiong will become the Sect Master. Another group belongs to the First Elder while the remaining four Elders have always been neutral.\u201d\u201cThe First Elder also wants to be the Sect Master?\u201d Li Qiye inquired.Nan Huairen shook his head: \u201cNo one knows what the First Elder is thinking. He had not supported the Sect Master completely, but he also had never competed for the role. However, his influence is great in the sect. He controls the disciplinary squad in the sect and is very strict. Thus, the majority of the disciples are scared of him.\u201dFrom Nan Huairen's words, Li Qiye had a grasp of the current situation of the sect. Thinking about it, Li Qiye lightly chuckled and did not speak on it anymore.Heavenly Crow Peak was an important location of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Some even said that it was a forbidden ground. WIthout permission from the Sect Master or the Elders, no disciple could enter the peak.Also, the Heavenly Crow Peak was the highest mountain in all of the sect. On top of it was a triangular old building. In here lies all the manuals, techniques, life treasures, jewels, metals, and everything valuable of the sect.The mountain was heavily fortified. There were patrols every three steps as well as a defense post every five; even a mosquito wouldn't be able to get through. The entirety of the peak was also protected by the elite disciples and two rotating Elders of the sect.To the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, the Heavenly Crow Peak was too important. The most valuable things of the sect were all located on this mountain.In addition, there was also a legend regarding the Heavenly Crow Peak. It was said that before Immortal Emperor Min Ren's ascension, he was blessed by the will of the heavens. The heavens sent him a godly crow from the sky. It arrived at the top of this peak, and Min Ren was taught by this crow. This was why the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was situated on this mountain.[1] I will use Qi Deviation here. The literal translation is \u201cbursting into fire and joining the demons\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The name, simply put, was coined by Min Ren's generals to commemorate him.The Ancient Triangular School on top of the peak was not too great in size, but the whole building was pure black; it was as if it was crafted with black steel and had a heavy feeling to it. In reality, no one in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect knew what the building was made out of.Once Li Qiye and Nan Huairen had arrived in front of the black building, Li Qiye's heart was shaken. Many years had passed, but this building still stood strong; its secret origin exceeded the imaginations of contemporaries.During his moments of reminiscing, his eyes were attracted to a big shrine in front of the black building. From his memories, this shrine had not existed here during the time when the black building was established.In front of the shrine, a man with great stature could be found sitting down in a cultivating position. One couldn't guess his age because of his long, messy hair and untrimmed beard that covered his entire face. There were weeds and grass that had grown around his body; who knows how long the man had been sitting there?The eyes of the man remained shut; if it wasn't for his regular and consistent breathing, people would have thought that this was a dried up corpse.However, the most surprising thing was that his arms and legs were constrained by huge, metal chains. Other people may not know, but Li Qiye recognized that these chains were made from Black Spider Consolidated Steel, an extremely rare metal of immortal grade.What kind of person would be worthy of having chains made from Black Spider steel? Not only that, it seemed that the man in front of him was willing to be imprisoned instead of being forced.Seeing Li Qiye's interest towards the man in front of the shrine, Nan Huairen softly whispered: \u201cThis is the protector of the triangular building; no one knows his background or origin.\u201d\u201cWhy is he chained there?\u201d Li Qiye questioned while staring at the man.Nan Huairen shook his head and responded: \u201cNo one knows; I'm afraid no one in the entire sect knows the answer to that question. It is said that he had been chained there for a long time; my master doesn't even know why. Some say that he was a disciple of the sect; however, he had committed a grave offense, and that is why he is chained there.\u201dLi Qiye tilted his head and stopped the conversation. He instead, went into the triangular building with Nan Huairen.Once they were in the building, the chained man opened his eyes. The ensuing gaze possessed an extremely fearful atmosphere; it was as if he could see through the infinity and tear open the primordial cosmos. This gaze would make Royal Nobles and Enlightened Beings tremble with fear. However, he then closed his eyes; it was like nothing had happened.From an outside view, the triangular building appeared to be small. However, once inside, there was a big, open area ranging many hundreds of acres. Three majestic pagodas were built together closely to form this triangular formation. Without a trace of doubt, this building was built and crafted with an unrivaled technique for it to have its own magical space.\u201cOver here is the Scripture Library, that one is the Weapon Armory, and over there is the Treasure House. These three pagodas of the triangular building are divided into three sections, each for techniques, weapons, and treasures.\u201d After entering the building, Nan Huairen explained: \"Each pagoda will have an assigned protector. Any student who wants an item would have to pass through the protector's inspection.\"Here, he asked Li Qiye: \u201cWhere does Senior want to go first?\u201d\u201cLet us start at the Scripture Library.\u201d Li Qiye quickly glanced over the three pagodas and made his decision.There were eight inner disciples protecting the Scripture Library alongside a protector. Once Nan Huairen and Li Qiye showed them the Elder's order, they were immediately allowed to enter.Then, came the indescribable feeling that arose from entering the majestic library. Inside, one couldn't see the end of the sections. The incomparable vastness of this library was tantamount to the old glory days of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.There were quite a few disciples present that were searching for suitable techniques. Nan Huairen was a social person, thus he went to make conversations with each of the disciples.Li Qiye was different; he was new, and the disciples here didn't like him in the first place. Even though the sect had fallen, it was still of Immortal Emperor lineage; it was not normal for a mortal to be accepted into the sect, let alone becoming the Prime Disciple.The more outrageous thing was that he was considered to be a piece of trash with a Mortal Physique, a Mortal Life Wheel, and a Mortal Fate Palace. The Prime Disciple should be the strongest of all and respected by his peers. This position was coveted by many, who had spent their time and talents contributing to the sect. However, they were not chosen by the Sect Master. This, rightfully infuriated the disciples; to see someone so undeserving to occupy the position.Even though they didn't dare to question the Elder's decision, they were definitely not going to be courteous to Li Qiye.\u201cThat person is Li Qiye.\u201d A disciple looked at Li Qiye from top to bottom; it was as if he was looking at a monster. In reality, many people wanted to steal the Cleansing Incense Ancient Order, even within the sect, but no one had ever been successful. However, all of a sudden, that old man decided to give such a treasure to Li Qiye; no one could make heads or tails out of this.\u201cThat's him. I heard he invited Old Devil to the brothel for ten days and ten nights.\u201d A disciple presumptuously added.A disciple acted as if he knew more about this situation and shook his head: \u201cYou are incorrect; it wasn't just ten days and ten nights. He bought the old man a pair of twins who were still virgins that had only recently joined the brothel. He bought them for the next three years to service the old man; this was why that perverted geezer agreed to give him the Order.\u201dSome stories slowly became more and more embellished. One person even said that Li Qiye paid the brothel to service Old Devil for the next ten years; which allowed him to do whatever deeds he wanted to do. Although there were minor differences, the main points of the topics all revolved around Li Qiye using an underhanded method to fool Old Devil for the sake of obtaining the order.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This kid is truly a disgrace of our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201d A student yelled out.Another student thought something was strange and inquired: \u201cIsn't he currently going through the trial at the Nine Saint Demon Gate? Why is he back so early?\u201d\u201cHah, of course the trial was a failure. How could such a person become the partner of the Nine Saint Demon Gate princess. It is like dreaming during the day; clearly, he is a frog wanting to eat swan's meat.\u201d Another student pompously commented.The Six Elders haven't announced Li Qiye's success in the trial because they haven't yet understood the Nine Saint Demon Gate's intentions behind the order. Without their agreement, the Elders didn't dare to announce the marriage between Li Qiye and Li Shuangyan. If Li Shuangyan actually didn't agree to the wedding, and they had announced it; it would be a blur on her purity, and such an action could enrage the Nine Saint Demon Gate.After hearing the comments from the other disciples in the sect, Nan Huairen was both embarrassed and indignant, but he couldn't reveal the secrets regarding what had actually occurred at the Nine Saint Demon Gate.As for the victim of these negative remarks, Li Qiye himself was strolling, unaffected, through the library. He acted as if he didn't hear a single word; he continued on to calmly look through the many manuals on the shelves, one by one.Tiger's Power law, Heavenly Cocoon Life technique, Revolving Moon law, Iron Ox King Physique\u2026 Each of these manuals were placed on the shelves. Some were the original versions while some were copied by hand. Others were restored from ruined manuals, and some were inscribed on stone tablets. There were manuals for all purposes: from physique building techniques to longevity laws to increase blood energy as well as cultivational methods to build the Fate Palace\u2026\u201cThere are many different manuals here, collected by many generations of paragons; some were even created by them. The others were taken from other sects or different inheritances.\u201d Nan Huairen spoke to Li Qiye: \u201cIf senior wants an Emperor level manual, senior would have to go up to the third level. The manuals in the first level are the elementary techniques, anyone can learn these. The second level has manuals meant for disciples with contributions to the sect or the different sectional leaders.\u201dLi Qiye was not in a rush; he continued on skimping the different manuals, but he already had some in mind. He started from the first level all the way to level three. During the way, he saw one or two Emperor level manuals, but they were not formidable ones.During this process, he found out one thing. The higher up he went, the shelves started to contain less manuals. Some of the shelves were classified, but they did not have any manuals. This meant that there used to be scrolls here, but they were now gone.\u201cThere is no way that these manuals were given or lent away?\u201d Li Qiye looked around on the third level and inquired.Nan Huairen shook his head: \u201cI heard that we have lost a numerous amount of manuals.\u201dHere, he looked around for a moment, then whispered: \u201cMy master told me, the truth is, our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect does not have that many Emperor manuals left. The most crucial ones are at the end of this building, but there are only around three to five left. If we lose these manuals, then we would be an Immortal Emperor sect only in title.\u201dAfter Min Ren's ascension, he spent most of his life creating numerous Emperor level techniques and Merit Laws. Some of his manuals had the abilities to connect with the heavens; there were rumors that he even left behind Heaven's Will Secret Laws.\u201cDid other people ransack us?\u201d Li Qiye naturally knew how many Emperor level manuals the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had. It didn't only contain the ones that Min Ren had created, but also those that Li Qiye himself personally stole from other people. Some dated back to the Desolate Era, and some were from the hands of Heavenly Devils, Blood Tribes, Stone Golems, Charming Spirits, and Ancient Ming\u2026 To sum it up, in short, Li Qiye had pillaged many secrets from the inhabitants of the Nine Worlds.\u201cI don't know the exact details of the ordeal. I heard that fifty thousand years ago, our genius ancestor lost a fight, and we suffered a great disaster. Another sky-shattering accident happened thirty thousand years ago, and we lost many manuals from that as well. Another rumor has it that some of our Emperor manuals were sealed in the last three levels by Grand Elder Mu; however, some said that the Heavenly God Sect took all of our manuals when they defeated us in the last thirty thousand years war.\u201d\u201cYou are talking about Mu Shaodi?\u201d The words of Nan Huairen reminded Li Qiye of fifty thousand years ago, there was a great genius in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201cYes, it was Grand Elder Mu.\u201d When it came to Mu Shaodi, Nan Huairen's blood boiled in pride; he passionately continued: \u201cFrom the legends, fifty thousand years ago, Grand Elder Mu had the greatest potential to become an Immortal Emperor in our sect after Immortal Emperor Min Ren. He was the strongest rival of Immortal Emperor Ta Kong. I heard that when Grand Elder Mu was competing with Immortal Emperor Ta Kong to win the Heaven's Will, he won three times and lost three times. Even with his heavenly aptitude, Immortal Emperor Ta Kong still lost three times to Grand Elder Mu. That year, we were at our strongest after the era of Immortal Emperor Min Ren. We were able to dominate all of the Mortal Emperor world, not just the Grand Middle Territory.\u201dNan Huairen couldn't stop speaking regarding Mu Shaodi because he was the biggest pride of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect after Immortal Emperor Min Ren.Opposite of Nan Huairen's excitement, Li Qiye simply said: \u201cBut in the end, the one that had received the Heaven's Will was still Immortal Emperor Ta Kong.\u201dLi Qiye's words were like a cold water bucket hitting the face of Nan Huairen. He suddenly lost his will to speak and dejectedly said: \u201cIt was rumored that they had one last fight, and then Grand Elder Mu never appeared again. Some say that he died during the battle, others said that he met his origin inside the sect.\u201d\u201cWhat about the three middle levels, do they contain anything?\u201d Li Qiye looked up and asked. He was only given the rights to the first three levels.\u201cMaster said that he had been through there twice, but the number of manuals there can be counted on one's fingers.\u201dLi Qiye was silent. It seemed like the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was only a name; what kind of Immortal Emperor lineage only had a few Emperor level manuals? This was also part of why it started its decline.Finally, Li Qiye, at the third level, chose an offensive technique manual, a Life Wheel technique in the second, and a bunch of different scrolls from the first.Nan Huairen saw a total of one hundred and twenty different manuals, and he silently said: \u201cSenior, these manuals are just martial arts, and they are not worth mentioning. Anyone in the sect can look at them; do you want to change to something else?\u201d\u201cI have my own calculations.\u201d Li Qiye shook his head.Nan Huairen quickly gathered these techniques to check them out. Nan Huairen knew that Li Qiye was very methodical, and everything he did had a clear logic behind it.When Li Qiye and Nan Huairen carried the numerous manuals to the front, the other disciples looked at him as if they saw the village fool. Even the disciples responsible for checking out looked at him weirdly.\u201cElder said you could only pick three different manuals.\u201d One of the disciples checked the order from Li Qiye again and said.Li Qiye slowly answered: \u201cI know. I only picked one cultivation technique and one Life Wheel method, and the third I did not pick. As for these martial arts manuals, Huairen said that anyone could look at them. This includes me right?\u201dThe disciples looked around and ended their gaze at the protector in command, waiting for his decision.They counted the different books: \u201cTotal there are forty-four specialized martial arts manuals, thirty-six hybrid martial arts manuals, and forty body training manuals.\u201dThese martial arts, here, had no value even when compared to other martial art manuals. The disciples were surprised at Li Qiye's choices.From the dust collected on these manuals, it was clear that no one had ever read them before.The spectating disciples couldn't help but start laughing at Li Qiye and his choosing more than one hundred martial arts manuals.\u201cThe idiot can't tell what's good and bad. Even if you study all of the martial arts in the world, you will still only become an average person at best.\u201d A student said in a condescending manner.Another one joined the fray: \u201cSenior Wang, this is called knowing your own limits. Cultivational Merit Laws aren't meant for those with a Mortal Physique, Mortal Life Wheel, and Mortal Fate Palace. He knew that he wouldn't be able to cultivate to the foundation level in even ten years, so he took a step back to learn martial arts instead!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 35": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Emperor\u2019s DominationEmperor's Domination Chapter 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Scripture Library had contained these martial arts manuals for a long time. However, it's just that, in the past, not many disciples chose to read these mortal manuals, let alone one hundred and twenty of them.Li Qiye coldly glared at the laughing spectators. Nan Huairen, next to his side, was extremely worried for them. Other people did not know, but it was clear to him that Li Qiye was an executioner that killed people without blinking his eyes. Even Du Yuanguang and Xu Hui were severed on the spot, these disciples are nothing.A second generation disciple, with good intentions, politely told him: \u201cThese martial art manuals, only look at them for fun; you shouldn't focus too heavily on them.\u201dLi Qiye respectfully replied to this disciple: \u201cMy first practiced technique was the \u201cInvisible Dual Blade\u201d; it was just a regular martial art, but its power was considerable. Maybe if I practice all of these manuals here, then I would become peerless in this world.\u201dThe good intention disciple shook his head, and said in a serious tone: \u201cMartial arts is only a side road. If you want to learn, only pick one or two. Picking one hundred is a waste of your energy, and it will slow down your cultivation!\u201d\u201cYoung uncle senior, he doesn't want to listen to your good advice. You should just ignore him; don't waste your breath.\u201d In other people's eyes, Li Qiye looked very foolish right now for wanting to practice martial art techniques.Of course, if Li Qiye purposely wanted to read these manuals, then the good intentioned disciple wouldn't stop him. He continued the procedure for Li Qiye.When Li Qiye gave him the second manual, this disciple nodded his head and said: \u201cNow this is right, you chose a decent cultivation manual: \u201cKun Peng's minor sixth form\u201d. \u201cKun Peng's minor sixth form\u201d is an incomplete law originating from the Emperor law: \u201cKung Peng's Six Variants\u201d. If you successfully cultivate this technique, then maybe in the future, you would have the opportunity to learn the \u201cKung Pen's Six Variants\u201d; it will mold a great basic foundation.\u201cAfter hearing these words, the other disciples were envious and jealous. This was an Emperor law; even if it is only an incomplete version, its effect was still greater than a regular merit law. Even a Virtuous Paragon law couldn't compare to it.\u201cWhy does he get to cultivate an Immortal law?\u201d\u201cHmmph, he is only a useless person. Such an Immortal law\u2026 you shouldn't even dream of successfully completing it during this lifetime.\u201dAll of these students clamored, but they quickly shut their mouths seeing the glare of the protector nearby.Li Qiye had the order of the Six Elders. Unless they wanted to question the Six Elders' decision, otherwise, the only thing they can do was be envious of Li Qiye.Li Qiye took out the last manual. This manual was extremely ancient. It had survived through many generations, and no one knew what it was made out of to have such good, long-lasting quality. It had been read many times without any signs of deterioration.\u201cRevolving Crescent Sun Merit Law!\u201d The disciple performing the check-out saw this manual. He looked at Li Qiye and then the protector.Even the protector who saw this technique furrowed his brows: \u201cRevolving Crescent Sun Merit Law\u2026\u201dThe other disciples could only whisper among themselves now. \u201cIt is another fool who wants to rush things. Cultivation, on this earth, who can rush it?\u201d\u201cHeh, he wants to be a genius after one night though.\u201d\u201cEven if he was to cultivate the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law, he wouldn't be unbeatable after just one night. Geniuses and trash are determined by the heavens, no matter what kind of methods a piece of trash used, he wouldn't be able to become a genius.\u201d A student bitterly said.\u201cIt is better to not cultivate this Merit Law, it will harm you in the end.\u201d The protector shook his head: \u201cEven though the first stage of this Merit Law can help your cultivation speed, but, based on your Mortal Life Wheel, the best you can do is reach the Inner Longevity Stage. After that, you cannot use this technique to reach the following level. We had a genius in the past that had a Saint Life Wheel; however, because he chose this technique, he couldn't cultivate past the Heaven's Primal stage; he ruined his dream of becoming an emperor.\u201dRevolving Crescent Sun was notorious in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect because cultivators could quickly improve in its first stage. It used one's blood energy to increase one's cultivation speed; however, once that person had reached a particular stage, he couldn't continue. This is because he sacrificed his blood energy to increase his cultivation strength, so they became imbalanced. It rendered going to the next stage next to impossible.This was why it was considered the fastest cultivation merit law, but its other name was the disabled merit law; many geniuses had tried it but all had failed.\u201cThank you for your guidance, honorable protector. I know when to stop.\u201d Li Qiye smiled.Seeing that Li Qiye didn't want to listen, the protector closed his eyes. He didn't want to waste more energy on Li Qiye. If Li Qiye was a genius, one with great innate talents, then he would have stopped Li Qiye from choosing it for certain.In the end, Li Qiye and Nan Huairen left the Scripture Library under the jeers of the other disciples back to his peak.Once they've returned, the sun was already down. Li Qi ye said: \u201cTomorrow, we'll choose a treasure.\u201dNan Huairen agreed. He didn't know why Li Qiye chose so many techniques, but he didn't want to question Li Qiye's actions. He said: \u201cWith so many manuals, tomorrow, I will ask the outer sector to give you a dimensional pouch; it will be more convenient for you.\u201dLi Qiye nodded. Seeing that Nan Huairen was about to leave, he asked: \u201cWhat is the name of the second generation disciple at the library?\u201dNan Huairen answered: \u201cQu Daoli, he used to be a third generation disciple just like us. His innate talents are very good, and he was willing to stay at the Scripture Library; thus, he was promoted to a second generation disciple.\u201dLi Qiye smiled without saying anything else, so Nan Huairen took his leave.Li Qiye closed the door. He went to get some pen and ink, and he arranged the one hundred and twenty manuals in an order that no one else would understand.With a serious expression on his face, he opened the first page of each manual and wrote one word from each of them, then he opened the second page\u2026Li Qiye was meticulous in each step; because other than him, no one knew the sky shattering secret hidden in these manuals.When asked what is the strongest cultivation manual in the world, anyone would without a doubt say Heaven's Will Secret Law. Every era, when an Immortal Emperor received the Heaven's Will, they would be able to create their own Heaven's Will Secret Law. It was a technique that communicated with the Heaven's Will. It connected one to the azure heaven, and its power was endless.In this world, no one would be able to think of a technique that was more powerful than the Heaven's Will Secret Law, unless it was something from an extremely ancient era.If there was indeed one, then it would be a Heavenly Scripture from the Nine Grand Heavenly Scriptures.During the Desolate Era, there was a legend: before there were heavens and earth, in its infancy stage, the universe's primordial chaos arrived. From the primordial chaos, the grand beginning spawned. The grand beginning gave birth to the Nine Words, the Nine Words created the Nine Treasures, and from the Nine Treasures came the Nine Scriptures.The Heavenly Scriptures were the Nine Scriptures in the legend, but no one had ever seen the Nine Grand Heavenly Scriptures in the past.However, Li Qiye had indeed seen the Nine Grand Heavenly Scriptures. In his crow form, he saw one of the Nine Scriptures, the Physique Scripture, during the Desolate Era. After rigorous planning, spilling blood, and one hundred thousand years later, he was able to obtain it.Because of how powerful the Physique Scripture was, he was threatened and pressured by many powerful beings. Many people chased and tried to kill him; even cultivators of the Immortal Emperor level.After owning the Physique Scripture, Li Qiye learned the mysterious secrets of the heavens from it. Because of the understanding of these mysterious truths, he was exceedingly powerful even without having to cultivate the scripture in his crow form.Through this scripture, many Immortal Emperors, such as Tun Ri and Ba Mie, were all related to him. Of course, Min Ren was a given since he was personally groomed by Li Qiye.Using Min Ren as an example, everyone in later generations thought that his Solar Immortal Physique was innate; his descendants thought so as well.[1] Kun Peng is a giant bird/fish from Chinese Daoist mythology, it is known for its power, size, and speed.[2] Chinese's Origin myths and terminologies.[3] Min means sun and ren means human; it matches his immortal physique.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Emperor\u2019s DominationEmperor's Domination Chapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySolar Immortal Physique was one of the twelve Immortal Physiques; no one in this world could be born with an Immortal Physique. Immortal Emperor Min Ren's Solar Immortal Physique was from the Physique Scripture currently within the hands of Li Qiye.Li Qiye knew that the Physique Scripture was craved by all, so he had it hidden. He was also afraid that he would lose it one day. He had to find a way to preserve it since his memories regarding it would be erased so that the Demon Heaven Grotto wouldn't get it.In preparation for that day, he hid the mysterious truths of the Physique Scripture in the martial arts manuals that all cultivators look down upon. He separated it into three parts, hid them in three different types of martial arts manuals, spanning one hundred and twenty manuals containing ten thousand different techniques.Li Qiye used a particular order that only he knew about to hide them in the manuals, so, even if someone knew where it was, they wouldn't be able to piece it together.At that time, he separated the three types of martial arts into three different eras, so they had no relation with each other.Within these three eras, he mass produced and separated them everywhere in all of the Nine Worlds, not just the Mortal Emperor World. There were at least a hundred thousand copies in each world.With the help of the other Immortal Emperors and the Alchemy God, although he erased his memories of the techniques, the order of these martial arts manuals remained. From the past until now, no cultivator had read all one hundred and twenty manuals.Li Qiye purposely left all one hundred and twenty manuals in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect so, if a disciple was able to discern this secret, he would be able to cultivate an Immortal Physique. Maybe then, the sect would have another Immortal Emperor or at least, a Virtuous Paragon with an Immortal Physique.Unfortunately, no one would even look at these manuals, let alone taking the time to research them. This was why after Min Ren, there was no second person with an Immortal Physique.Li Qiye spent the whole night copying the Physique Scripture from the manuals. After reading what he wrote, Li Qi ye couldn't help but satisfyingly smile. As he read each word, his lost memories of the Scripture slowly appeared in his mind. Eventually, the entirety of the Scripture had been completed.After remembering the whole thing, he burned his written copy. He knew the value of the Physique Scripture. If someone knew that he was in possession of it, there would be a calamity to endure. He could only hide it in his head.The truth was that the original Physique Scripture had been hidden by Li Qiye, and no one else in the world knew where it was. However, Li Qiye was not in a hurry to get it because the Scriptures were also related to another secret; they weren't just cultivational techniques. Afterward, Li Qiye rested for a little bit before the morning. Nan Huairen came early to the peak to meet Li Qiye.\u201cSenior, I'm afraid I can't go with you to the Weapon Armory today. The Elders told me to go report the events regarding the marriage to the Sect Master; I have to leave the sect.\u201d Nan Huairen said.Nan Huairen was valued by the Elders for his intelligence, so he was given an important mission.\u201cGo; I'm not in a rush for a weapon.\u201d Li Qiye nodded slightly, he wanted to use this time to reorganize the techniques and methods inside his mind.After Nan Huairen left, Li Qiye didn't continue sleeping. He took out the Kun Peng's Minor Sixth Form manual. It was highly regarded by the third generation disciples because it was still part of an Emperor merit law.Each Immortal Emperor had always created formidable merit laws. Some were longevity cultivation methods that could increase one life's span and blood energy. Others were Fate Palace techniques meant for offensive and defensive potentials. Last were the different ways to strengthen one's Physique. These three were the general types of merit laws that were crafted by Immortal Emperors; they also included Heaven's Will Secret Laws.In his life, Min Ren had founded many different Emperor manuals, and Li Qiye was familiar with them; after all, he participated in the formation of these manuals.During his last hibernation, his memories were erased by the Black Dragon King of Heaven Protector City, but he could still regain them.Kun Peng's Minor Sixth Form was a subsidiary of the Emperor Merit Law \u201cKun Peng's Six Variants\u201d. It was the strongest Fate Palace Merit Law created by Min Ren.Right now, Li Qiye didn't have access to the high-level Emperor merit laws in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, so he didn't know if the Six Variants was still available. However, he could use the minor sixth form to regain his old memories regarding the actual Six Variants.Slowly reading the minor sixth form, Li Qiye found that the manual only had six simple movements, not enough to be considered a legitimate Emperor merit law. But the Six Variants were derived from these six simple actions.Li Qiye, in the past, had brought Min Ren to watch a Kun Peng from far away. Min Ren's observation eventually turned into six basic movements, and they were used to create the infamous Emperor Fate Law \u2013 Kun Peng's Six Variants.The six actions slowly appeared in Li Qiye's head. Sometimes it was an eagle flying in the nine firmaments where a single flap of its wings would take it three thousand miles away. Another was a fast descent into the ground with enough force to pierce through the layers of hell. The third was in the depths of the sea; it transformed into a giant Kun, and its heavy tail caused endless tsunamis.Sometimes it was an eagle; sometimes a Kun. The transformation became faster and faster to the point that one couldn't differentiate whether it was an eagle or a Kun. The Kun became an eagle and ascended to the heavens; stumbling on the grand truth. Kun and Peng were ever changing like the sun and the moon's rotations; it was as if they were one with the primordial orders of the heavens and earth.\u201cBang!\u201d A loud noise rang in the room, and Li Qiye initiated Kun Peng's power. In the blink of an eye, Li Qiye's whole body heavily jolted, and the gigantic Kun Peng that was thousands of miles tall suddenly disappeared. The heavy tornados and tsunamis that were accompanying the beast also subsided. These images slowly become strands of consciousness, slowly gathering into one grand truth. What emerged from this grand truth were the symbols from the erased memories that were now returning to Li Qiye's mind.In the end, when the eagle was no longer an eagle, and the Kun was no longer a Kun, only one grand mysterious truth remained. A complete Kun Peng was formed, and the Kun Peng's Six Variants, without flaws, had appeared in Li Qiye's mind.Li Qiye was extremely ecstatic; the heavens didn't let him down. He had finally regained his Kun Peng's Six Variants.An unknown amount of time had passed, and Li Qiye recovered his thoughts from his deep cultivation. Although he had regained a completed merit law, and it was an extremely powerful one even among those at the same level, Li Qiye did not become complacent or arrogant. He knew his original body more than anyone else. When compared to the other geniuses, his Physique, Life Wheel, and Fate Palace were all lacking. He had to cultivate a hundred times harder to catch up to others; he had to be patient. Only then, could he obtain the Heaven's Will of this era to sweep the nine heavens and earth.With the qualification of someone who had taught Immortal Emperors and powerful beings, he knew the principles behind the mysterious truths more than anyone else. His greatest strength and advantage was having a perfect cultivation procedure.He started to research the Revolving Crescent Sun method. It was classified as a Life Wheel cultivation method used to train the Life Wheel and to increase lifespan and blood energy.Every cultivator, and even mortals, all have an innate longevity gauge. Any living beings that have formed intelligence will have three things: the first was a Physique, the second was a Life Wheel, and the third was a Fate Palace.Physique didn't need much explanation. This was the thing that contained one's life force. Without this physical base, there was no life. Even a mortal would have a mortal body. The general shape of the human race with its bones, bloods, and muscles was considered one of the best physical bases to contain life.There was a saying regarding the Life Wheel. A tree had its growth rings, and a human has the Life Wheel. The Life Wheel was located inside the body, but it was not of physical form. It was a light that was continuously spinning. At first, without any special external tools, only the cultivator himself could see his Life Wheel. However, after successful cultivation, the Life Wheel would appear behind one's head; its shape and light would determine the strength of one's blood energy and longevity.If a mortal lived his life without any accident, then the Life Wheel would determine his lifespan. Li Qiye's Mortal Life Wheel for example, would allow him to live to the age of sixty without any cultivation.Physiques, Life Wheels, and Fate Palaces all have the following ranking from lowest to highest: \u201cMortal, Houtian, Xiantian, King, Saint, and Immortal.\u201dAll three share the same ranking system; however, under normal circumstances, cultivators couldn't change or increase their Life Wheel and Fate Palace level; these two were innately gifted to you by the heavens. As for the body, one's physique could be cultivated. For example, a person with a Xiantian's physique, through cultivation and effort, could raise it to the next rank.Author's Note from the Daoist's classic Zhuangzi:In the northern darkness there is a fish and his name is Kun. The Kun is so huge I don't know how many thousand li he measures. He changes and becomes a bird whose name is Peng. The back of the Peng measures I don't know how many thousand li across and, when he rises up and flies off, his wings are like clouds all over the sky. When the sea begins to move, this bird sets off for the southern darkness, which is the .[1] Kun resembles a whale, Peng is the eagle form, I suggest googling Kun Peng if you want an image.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 37": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Emperor\u2019s DominationEmperor's Domination Chapter 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was the opposite case for the Life Wheel and Fate Palace. One could not naturally increase their innate ranking of the Life Wheel and Fate Palace. Even if one became an Immortal Emperor, the Life Wheel and Fate Palace would be the same as they were at the time of their birth.All three of them were extremely important for the purpose of cultivation. The Physique determined one's bone and muscular structures, the Life Wheel dealt with one's blood energy, and the Fate Palace indicated one's innate aptitude and natural enlightenment.For example, if a person had a Saint Life Wheel, then his blood energy would be as abundant as the desert sands; when trained using a Life Wheel method, his speed would be extremely swift; the effect would be greater as well.Li Qiye slowly read the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law in order to find the mysterious truths of this method. The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had a completed version of this merit law, but what Li Qiye was aiming for was more complex than the manual.To talk about the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law was to talk about its exceptional origin of how Li Qiye struggled to obtain this merit law. At the beginning of the Emperor's Era, he contemplated about letting Min Ren cultivate this method, but he changed his mind.In the old Desolate Era, both humans and demons were extremely weak species. Many immortal sages spent their lives creating suitable merit laws and cultivation methods for these unfortunate beings; eventually, they were able to form a new flourishing era.There was a formidable immortal sage that created a Life Wheel merit law that allowed for one to cultivate quickly; it was named Revolving Crescent Sun. In the beginning stages of this merit law, cultivators were able to use their blood energy to build their Fate Palace, and their cultivation levels quickly rose.However, the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law had a fatal weakness. The beginning stage allowed for the blood energy to carry one's cultivation level, but, as his cultivation level increased, his weak blood energy was no longer sufficient. The result was that the person would be left in a stage where his blood energy was weak and his cultivation was unable to grow. If he was to force the technique, his longevity would decrease from over-exerting his lifeblood.When Li Qiye had obtained this method, he passed it down to many people. However, none of them were able to perfectly utilize it. For the sake of perfecting this technique, Li Qiye gathered many Immortal Emperors; including Immortal Emperor Xue Xi, Immortal Emperor Min Ren, and Immortal Emperor Tun Ri.It wasn't until the era of the Black Dragon King that Li Qiye had perfected this technique. Today, as he was researching the technique, his old memories containing the mysterious truths within the merit law came back to him.After recovering the completed and revised Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law, Li Qiye took a deep breath.In this world, not many people knew the effort he had spent on this technique across the eras. Who would know how many immortal sages of humanity spent their lives to develop the method?The truth was, after Li Qiye left this method behind in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, many geniuses had tried it; however, none of them could reach grand completion.Li Qiye spent three days and three nights to research the Kun Peng's Six Variants and the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law. Nan Huairen still had not returned; since Li Qiye was not in a rush, he chose to stay on the peak to further cultivate.Once his two methods were ready, Li Qiye was ready to formally start his cultivation. One could say that Li Qiye's experience and knowledge regarding cultivation were rich even if his innate aptitude was subpar.Even though the two methods were heaven-defying, he did not rush toward completion. He wanted quality in his cultivation. He knew that rushing would only leave behind hidden dangers and flaws for one's long path of cultivation.Li Qiye was cultivating both at the same time, but the two methods were not related or in sync with each other. The Kun Peng's Six Variants was about using the Fate Palace while the Revolving Crescent Sun was a Life Wheel Technique. One could cultivate both in the beginning without complications.There was a fourth type of method outside of the three already mentioned ones; some people called it the foundation method. This method did not focus on the Physique, Life Wheel, or Fate Palace individually, but rather, it focused on all three of them at the same time. Although this fourth type had many uses, and its theoretical effects seemed great, it was hard to cultivate such a method to a higher rank.There were also different rankings for merit laws and methods. For example, if Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon was to create a method, his method would be of the Virtuous Paragon ranking. As for an Immortal Emperor's creation, it would be named an Immortal Emperor method.Of course, merit laws and cultivation methods weren't everything. Without a strong willpower, in the end, everything would be gone like the clouds in the wind. Many geniuses, in the past, started their cultivation with heaven shattering methods. This entitled them a smooth road until they suffered from Qigong Deviation. Other geniuses were spoiled in their beginnings, and they were given Immortal Emperor methods at the start; however, when it was time for them to compete for the Heaven's Will, they weren't able to cultivate their own Heaven Will's Secret Law; they lacked the experience and toughness from their past easy roads.After thinking about all of the nuisances regarding cultivation, Li Qiye channeled his Life Wheel using the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law; the effect was clear. Behind Li Qiye's head was a wheel of light rotating without breaks, and his blood energy began to move within the light.The blood energy was flowing through the Life Wheel as if it was a stream controlled by its current, never stopping.Li Qiye was born with a Mortal Life Wheel; he had no advantage regarding this area. Because his blood energy was weak, his blood current was not strong in his Life Wheel's rotation.If another with a Tianxian Life Wheel or Emperor Life Wheel were to cultivate the same merit law, their current would be a large river. A Saint Life Wheel's current would be as great as the ocean itself.Li Qiye initiated the incantations of the Kun Peng's Six Variants, and he began to activate his Fate Palace in a particular order.The Fate Palace was the home of one's fate; it carried the three souls and seven spirits. The Fate Palace was hidden inside the Shang Dantian, so Li Qiye started to use the Six Variants to knock on the Palace door. The Fate Palace slowly appeared in his Shang Dantian.[1. Shang Dantian is a meridian located on top of the forehead)The Fate Palace had an ancient design, and it was crystal clear. However, because his Fate Palace was only of mortal rank, the light radiating from it was dim.Normally, the Fate Palace was closed, and the soul and spirits were at rest. One had to knock on the Fate Palace to wake the souls and spirits up in order to channel their power, then one could start to cultivate.This was why the first level of cultivation was known as Palace Foundation. This level itself was divided into three separate stages: First Entrance, Second Awareness, and Third Bloodsurge.First Entrance was the process of knocking on the Fate Palace, allowing the incantations of the cultivating methods to enter the Fate palace. During this process, it was akin to a monk knocking on his wooden plate to connect to Buddha. One had to do it nonstop and faithfully, and, only then, would the Fate Palace answer by opening its doors.\u201cBang, Bang, Bang.\u201d Li Qiye used the Six Variants incantations to knock on his Fate Palace nonstop. He had forgotten how many times he had done it, but the Fate Palace would not answer him. This, however, did not deter Li Qiye.For a genius, especially someone with a Saint Fate Palace, the process of opening the Fate Palace was extremely easy because their souls and spirits were formidable. Legends have it that there was a person with a Saint Fate Palace that only had to knock once before opening his Palace.This person would be a genius among geniuses; however, Li Qiye was not part of this group. He had to be patient and put in countless amounts of effort; that was his only road to success.Even though Li Qiye knew a few different methods to open the Fate Palace with just one knock, such as using the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law to gather all of his blood energy to improve the incantations of his Kun Peng's Six Variants in order to strike a hard blow to the Palace Door, he didn't want to do it.His Life Wheel was only of mortal grade, and his blood energy was thin. If he overexerted his blood energy, then his Life Wheel would be damaged. Not only that, but such a powerful blow would frighten his souls and spirit, and that would leave behind complications in the future.Knowing his weakness, Li Qiye was determined to create a solid foundation without any imperfections. He kept on knocking on his Palace Door; even if it was ten thousand times or a hundred thousand times, he would continue until the Palace Door opened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It showed how your low inner talents were. However, Li Qiye had an unwavering willpower; even if he had to knock for a million times, he would keep on going.\u201cBANG!\u201d After five days and five nights, a small sound resounded. Under the patient knocking of Li Qiye, his Fate Palace was finally opened.Entering the door, one could see the power of the souls and spirits. However, his Mortal Fate Palace was extremely limiting. At this time, the Kun Peng's Six Variants incantations flew into the Fate Palace along with Li Qiye's consciousness.The space inside the Fate Palace was very vast, approaching infinity. In the middle of Li Qiye's Fate Palace were mysterious incantations in the form of calligraphy; they flew around in a natural order around a radiant light as if wanting to wake it up.This light was the soul. To others, it was the three souls and seven spirits or even the True Fate. This was the thing that determined a person's fate through their life.Only by cultivating could one activate the True Fate and the souls. Once they were awakened, the cultivators would gain their magical power. They would also be able to connect to the heavens and earth, borrowing their energy.Kun Peng's Six Variants was a Fate Palace merit law; it had to wake up the souls and use them as the foundation of cultivation for Li Qiye. This was why the incantation calligraphies that represent the mysterious truths of the Six Variants were twisting the souls nonstop to wake them up. These words sometimes were an eagle flying, other times, they were a Kun playing in an ocean, or even a completed Kun Peng. These beasts caused Li Qiye's Fate Palace to resemble a wide sky and deep sea, and his Fate Palace light was heavily affected by their presence.This process was the second step named, Second Awareness. Because of Li Qiye's low innate talents, this event would also take longer compared to other geniuses despite having an Immortal Emperor merit law.His Fate Palace grew wider and bigger in size; one could not see the boundaries. Even if the awakening process was completed, he wouldn't be able to see through all of his Fate Palace. However, he felt an existence far away in his Fate Palace.Towards the extreme side, in the east direction, it was as if there was a gigantic spring; however, it was dried out; there was no water running.This Spring of Life was one of the Fate Palace Four Symbols. There are many theories regarding it; some immortal sages believe that it was the source of life and fate energy.To the far west, Li Qiye felt an image of a huge cauldron, but, at this moment, it was extremely cold.This was the Cauldron of life. It's flame was capable of burning and dissolving any existence. People believed that the source of its flame were the souls, hence the name, Soul Fire.Towards the south was a gigantic tree piercing the sky itself. This tree was massive; however, it showed no sign of life as if it had died ages ago.The Tree of Life was the most mysterious object in the Fate Palace. Legends told that it could steal from the heavens and obtain great fortunes.At the distant north was a towering pillar that connected the heavens and the earth. The pillars were engraved by countless mysterious symbols. It looked as if it had been standing there since the beginning of time.Pillar of Life, it was also known as the source of life. Without it, nothing would exist.The Fate Palace Four Symbols included: the Spring of Life, the Cauldron of Life, the Tree of Life, and the Pillar of Life. These were the most enigmatic entities in the world. Many ancient sages tried to understand the four symbols in order to get a better sense of cultivation.The world believed that if one could understand the truths of all four symbols, he would be able to obtain the Heaven's Will and become an Immortal Emperor.Li Qiye was still letting the Six Variants method stimulate the souls while his Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law was cultivating his Life Wheel; this resulted in a strange and mysterious state during his cultivation.He kept the same pace without hastiness because he had absolute trust in himself. No one, or anything, could ever shake his willpower.After ten days, Nan Huairen had finally returned. He immediately went to meet Li Qiye and apologized: \u201cSenior, sorry about letting you wait so long. Sect Master was in isolated cultivation; I had to wait till she came out before I could finish my report.\u201d\u201cIt is not a big deal.\u201d Li Qiye calmly answered.Seeing Li Qiye's nonchalant disposition, Nan Huairen paused for a second and then voiced his concern:\u201cSenior, from what I've gathered while listening to the Sect Master, second brother is returning to the sect.\u201d He hesitantly added: \u201cSecond brother is the Sect Master's disciple.\u201dWhen 'second brother' was mentioned, Nan Huairen's eyes were a little strange. He remained silent afterwards.\u201cSecond brother?\u201d Li Qiye noticed the strange gaze of Nan Huairen so he inquired.Nan Huairen scratched his head and said: \u201cSenior, to tell you the truth, I don't know how to explain it. Once you meet second brother, you will understand.\u201dFinally, he added another sentence. \u201cSecond brother's circumstances are a bit special.\u201dLi Qiye only smiled and did not interrogate. This matter, to him, was not very important. He couldn't care less about the circumstances of the second brother. Ultimately, the second brother could be sent here to teach him or to monitor him; it had nothing to do with Li Qiye.Li Qiye's determination to rebuild the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect would not be interrupted by anyone. Once the time was right, he would reinvigorate the sect. On this road, no one could stop his footstep. Anyone who tried to stop him would meet their death. If Buddha was in the way, slay Buddha; if God was in the way, slay God.That year, under his tutelage, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had swept over the Nine Worlds. In this life, he would do the same. His Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect would rule over the Nine Worlds and destroy the Immortal Demon Grotto.Nan Huairen was already used to Li Qiye's temperament even when facing the Demon King Lun Ri; thus, he was not surprised by how carefree Li Qiye was about the return of the second brother.Nan Huairen stared at Li Qiye a little bit, and he suddenly noticed that he had started his cultivation.Nan Huairen happily exclaimed: \u201cSenior, you had opened your Fate Palace? How long did it take?\u201d\u201cNot too long; it only took five days and fight nights.\u201d Li Qiye said slowly.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Nan Huairen was at a loss for words after he heard the answer. Five days and five nights? You dared to say it wasn't a long time? In any sect, if a disciple was to take even three days and three nights to open the Fate Palace, he would be scolded by the seniors as being incompetent; so much so that he wouldn't be able to raise his head anymore. For taking five days and five nights, he would be considered trash among trash. If people knew Li Qiye took such a long time, he would become the biggest laughingstock in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.The worst disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had only taken three days and three nights, yet Li Qiye required five days and fight nights.However, Nan Huairen could tell from Li Qiye's expression that he didn't consider spending five days and five nights as something to be ashamed about.If other students took that long, their self-esteem would be at an all-time low. However, Li Qiye didn't feel inferior or pride from it; it was just another day to him.Thinking about the deaths of Xu Hui and Protector Hua, Nan Huairen trembled. A person that was considered idiotic by the world had an unstoppable aura; he possessed a calm and elegant demeanor at all times, and the utmost self-confidence as well as his unshakable willpower that showed through his ability to kill people without any remorse; people like Li Qiye would be the most frightening of existences.Nan Huairen stopped here with that thought, and he tagged along with Li Qiye to select his treasure.Once they reached the Ancient Triangular School, Li Qiye and Nan Huairen carried the order to the Weapon Armory. Here, they saw an extremely large statue standing in the middle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Its claws were gripping two dual blades made out of mortal steel. These blades were the same type used to practice \u201cInvisible Dual Blade\u201d.No one knew how long these dual blades had been here for. They did not survive the torture of time; rust covered the blades' edges, and it looked like both blades were on the verge of breaking at any moment.Li Qiye stared at the statue in a daze. Maybe he had forgotten this pose, but Immortal Emperor Min Ren never had. Nan Huairen, seeing Li Qiye's solemn moment, he whispered: \u201cSenior, this is the statue of the Crow God in the legends. When our patriarch was young, the Crow God had taught him on this peak. This is why our sect was established here; this statue was erected after our patriarch's ascension as a memorial.\u201dLi Qiye smiled at the story. Of course, he knew this because the Crow God and he were one in the same. He also knew that the whole story was a lie; the real reason why the sect was established here was a secret that only he was aware of.However, the action depicted by this statue was not false. The first time he met the courageous little boy that loved martial arts, he used his claws to steal the blades from the boy's hands.Even though he had became an Immortal Emperor, Min Ren had never forgotten their first meeting.\u201cLet us go inside.\u201d Li Qiye regained his composure and went inside the Weapon Armory.Inside the armory, there were all types of different Life Treasures and Longevity Treasures. The first level had ten thousand different weapons, but these were only made from steel mixed with low level metals. These were treasures with relatively low grades.A cultivator's weapon was divided into four types: first, the common weapons; second, Longevity weapons; third, Life weapons; and lastly, True weapons.The common weapons were meant for new disciples. These weapons were extremely common because they were made from mortal steel mixed with magical metals; they were not made from any excessively rare material. Even though these weapons, in the eyes of mortals, would be considered to be heavenly weapons that could cut through steel like mud, cultivators did not think highly of them. They couldn't fully utilize the power of the mysterious truths coming from the Grand Dao.Technically, Longevity weapons were not considered to be traditional weapons. They were rather, treasures, instead; even if they took the shape of a weapon. They were meant to prolong one's lifespan and feed the blood energy of the user. One could say, every cultivator would have at least one Longevity Treasure because it would feed their Life Wheel. It could also have a pivotal support role in combat since it could quickly replenish the Life Wheel that was depleted during battle.Life and True weapons were the real force of cultivators. They have great usage in both defensive and offensive means.Within the lifespan of a cultivator, they could possess many different Life Treasures and even inherit a Life Treasure from someone else. However, they could only have one True Treasure because this treasure was directly connected to their True Soul; the True Treasure and True Soul directly reinforced and supported each other, and the True Treasure, once linked to a cultivator, couldn't be inherited by another cultivator.Even though a cultivator had to create his own True Treasure and use it for the rest of his life, the power of a True Treasure greatly exceeded a regular Life Treasure. Even if it was the same grade, a True Treasure would annihilate a Life Treasure in the blink of an eye.Some of the weapons from the first level were common weapons such as the Profound Steel Sword, the Icy Crescent Saber, and the Meteoric Claws while the Life weapons ranged from the Shan He Pagoda and the Demon Slaying Circle, to the Jiang Jiao Staff.There were also a few True weapons such as the Heavenly God Stone, the Bloody Sky Rope, and the Fierce Sun Calligraphy Pen.All of these Life and True Treasures had a very low grade; thus, any third generation disciple was able to pick from them. The disciples with contributions were able to pick from the second level instead.While strolling in the first level, Li Qiye noticed the killing aura from these treasures and their ability to absorb the energy of the Grand Dao.He took his time looking at each one, and he then casually went to the second level. The second level only contained Life and True weapons with a higher ranking than the first level.However, Li Qiye also only looked at each weapon once. He did not select any of them, and they went on to level three.Seeing Li Qiye entering the third level, many disciples who were choosing their weapons were jealous. One couldn't help but say: \u201cI went to South mountain and decapitated a Longevity Spirit and made many contributions to the sect, and I only got to pick a level two True Treasure. Why does he get to go to level three?\u201dLevel three of the Weapon Armory was reserved for disciples with great contributions to the sect. Li Qiye's ability to enter it made the other disciples feel cheated. \u201cHe has the order from the Elders.\u201dLi Qiye turned around toward the angry disciples and slowly said: \u201cIf you have the ability to question the Elders, go and do it. Chirping here is only a waste of time.\u201dLi Qiye's words enraged the third generation students. Many of them here had a high status within their own peer group, but they were looked down on by a piece of trash.\u201cLet us see how long you can be arrogant for! One day, I will teach you a lesson!\u201d A disciple angrily yelled.Li Qiye ignored him and kept on walking to the third level. Nan Huairen lamented the fact that these disciples could only see an outside appearance. Do they actually think that Li Qiye was an idiot?Once they stepped inside the third level of the Weapon Armory, there was a blinding light enumerated from the many dazzling auras. The Life and True weapons surrounded by the rotation lights of their own auras made heavenly noises and exerted the energy of the Grand Dao like an unstoppable tsunami; it was as if all of these treasures were alive.Without a doubt, these weapons, here, had a higher grade and status than the ones in the second level.\u201cSenior, all the Life and True weapons here are exceptional versus the ones below. The lowest grade here is Inner Longevity and the highest is Heaven's Primal. There is even a True Deity True Treasure here in the Weapon Armory.\u201d Nan Huairen explained to Li Qiye.Life weapons and True weapons were connected to the cultivators using them. It was better for an Inner Longevity cultivator to pick an Inner Longevity weapon.\u201cLook, this is Jiu Lu Longevity Wheel!\u201d Nan Huairen introduced: \u201cSenior, this wheel was made from the life rings of a Jiu Lu Longevity beast, and it inherited the strength of this beast; if you use this wheel to feed your life essence, it will purify your blood force.\u201d\u201cAnd this is Jiang Fei Heavenly Rope.\u201dNan Huairen explained in a way that showed Li Qiye that he completely memorized the details on the contents of this third level treasure room.\u201cThis treasure was created from the bones of a Heavenly beast in the Warrior Canopy rank. I believe that this beast was a Twin Headed Half-Dragon. Once you are connected to this treasure, you could use it to activate the original truths of the dragon bones.\u201d\u201cOver there is the Hell Breaker Axe, it was forged from a piece of Star Spirit Immortal Steel\u2026\u201dNan Huairen seemed as if he knew all of the Life and True weapons on this third level; he couldn't stop introducing all of them to Li Qiye.Li Qiye glanced at him and praised: \u201cIt seems like you are really familiar with this place.\u201dNan Huairen blushed and replied to Li Qiye's remark: \u201cI always ask to tag along each time my master had to go to the Weapon Armory, so I know a little bit about this place. The fourth level, however, I only went up there once with my ancestor.\u201dBecause Nan Huairen was amicable and social, unlike his master, Elder Sun liked him a lot.\u201cThe floor above\u2026 what Life and True Treasures does it have?\u201d Li Qiye casually asked.The Weapon Armory has nine levels, but he was only, currently, at the third floor.\u201cI've only been in the fourth level once; the treasures there were of the Royal Nobles level. As for the above floors, I do not know the exact details for each.\u201d Nan Huairen shook his head.\u201cWould level nine contain an Immortal Emperor True Weapon?\u201d Li Qiye voiced his question. Min Ren had created many True Weapons throughout his life, and Li Qiye knew that Min Ren had left a few behind to protect the sect.Nan Huairen looked around and whispered: \u201cI heard that we no longer have any Immortal Emperor Life Treasures. So naturally, we also don't have any Immortal Emperor True Treasures either.\u201d\u201cThere is nothing left?\u201d Li Qiye found that hard to believe because Min Ren didn't just leave one. No matter how unfilial his descendants might be, they couldn't just throw them all away.Nan Huairen shook his head and softly answered: \u201cI don't know the exact details, not even my master knows. Like I told you before, thirty thousand years ago, we fought the Heavenly God Sect. In that battle, we lost the right to our Ancient Kingdom that we had been reigning for hundred thousands of years as well as our last Immortal Emperor True Treasure.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, after one hundred thousand years, the sect currently has zero Life Treasures.Now Li Qiye truly understood; the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect didn't decline for no reason at all. The Emperor merit laws were missing and the Immortal Emperor Life Treasures were gone as well. Plus, there was no wise leader to guide them. It would be against the heaven's will if they didn't decline.\u201cSenior, do you want to select a Longevity Treasure or a Life Treasure? Or maybe a True Treasure?\u201d Seeing Li Qiye in a daze, Nan Huairen reminded him.Although Li Qiye had made one round in the third level, there was not a single treasure that he found suitable.Nan Huairen didn't understand why Li Qiye didn't like the weapons stored here. The third level was not the best, but these weapons would still make all of the disciples within the sect drool with desire.However, Li Qiye didn't settle for any of the weapons here, and Nan Huairen didn't dare to say anything. He knew Li Qiye had his reasons, so he followed Li Qiye down, leaving the third level.All of the disciples that ridiculed Li Qiye, previously, were still there. Seeing his empty hands, they sneered: \u201cLook! Our Prime Disciple's eyes are too high. So\u2026 Even the third level didn't meet his needs!\u201d\u201cHeh. You don't know this, but only Immortal Emperor Life Treasures are worthy of him; he doesn't care about the other things.\u201d Another disciple, with a high pitched voice, commented: \u201cWhy doesn't he look into the mirror and realize his place? A piece of trash like him being allowed to select a weapon from level three is already a great privilege given by the Elders.\u201dOne student, that was extremely angry, said: \u201cHe is only a useless person. Even if we bring an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure before him, he would only think that it was scrapped metal. A person that has eyes but can't see isn't qualified to wield a Life Treasure.\u201dHaving heard all the tauntings from the disciples, Nan Hai Ren heavily furrowed his brows while Li Qiye casually said: \u201cIt seems like all of you are very dissatisfied with me.\u201dA disciple harshly replied: \u201cHmmph! Someone like you, who isn't qualified, shouldn't be our Prime Disciple!\u201d\u201cWhat a shame; I am still your Prime Disciple.\u201d Li Qiye slowly spoke: \u201cContinuously being disrespectful; it seems that I would be unfit for this position if I don't break your dog legs, today.\u201dAfter hearing Li Qiye, a disciple stood out from the crowd and straightened his posture; he then coldly proclaimed: \u201cOh? The great Prime Disciple wants to scold all of us? As your junior, I would love to learn from your many techniques.\u201dHearing these words, the other disciples clamored and laughed loudly. All of them presumptuously thought that Li Qiye, with his Mortal Physique, Mortal Life Wheel, and Mortal Fate Palace, could be easily taken care of with just the use of one hand.\u201cHuairen, beat them until they crawl outside.\u201d Li Qiye glared at them and commanded Huairen.The other disciples didn't know, but Huairen did; how did Du Yuanguang die? Xu Hui met his end how? Suddenly, he wiped the cold sweat from his forehead. If Li Qiye truly became angry, he would dismember all of these little boys.A command was a command; Nan Huairen sighed and stepped forward. He gazed at the disciples and calmly said: \u201cYou guys have committed the crime of being disrespectful to prime senior; I am here to carry out the sentence!\u201d\u201cNan Huairen, you\u2026!\u201d Seeing Nan Huairen's interference, some of the disciples angrily yelled.A disciple said without hesitation: \u201cSenior Nan, you are a favorite among the Elders; to follow such a loser is to ruin your good name\u2026\u201d\u201cBang!\u201d This disciple, who had not finished his words, was knocked away by Nan Huairen.In the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, Huairen's talents weren't the best; however, as the disciple of Protector Mo, it was easy for him to deal with these average disciples.\u201cYou said too much! Not knowing when to keep your mouth shut will bring the impending threat of death!\u201d After punching the student away, Nan Huairen pointed his finger at the other students and said: \u201cAll of you come forward; don't say I am bullying you!\u201dThe other disciples were both afraid and angry. They jumped forward together, but Nan Huairen did not show mercy; he beat them all, left and right, to the floor.It seemed as if Nan Huairen had used too much force; however, he was just saving their lives. At worst, he was just causing them physical pain without long-term complications.If Li Qiye personally handled it, then there might be decapitated bodies on the floor, instead. Nan Huairen knew that Li Qiye, in fact, didn't care for the disciples, or anyone, who disrespected him. Incidentally, Nan Huairen hoped that his brutal beating of them was enough to appease Li Qiye.As for the disciples protecting the Weapon Armory, their job was to protect it; other quarrels had nothing to do with them, so they closed their eyes and ignored it.\u201cI want the dual blades over there.\u201d As Nan Huairen was throwing the disciples out of the Weapon Armory, Li Qiye was talking with the protector in charge.The protector's brow furrowed, and he asked: \u201cThe dual blades under the Crow God's feet?\u201d\u201cThat is correct.\u201d Li Qiye replied.\u201cRecently, I have been practicing the Invisible Dual Blade technique, and on a second look, the dual blades are perfect for me; so, I want them.\u201d The protector and guarding disciples all thought that Li Qiye's request was very strange; they looked at him as if he was a mental patient.The two blades over there were basically two normal blades that have been rusting. Don't even compare it to the Life and True weapons on the third level; they weren't even comparable to the common weapons in level one.They believed that not picking a treasure from the third level was already strange, but he then picked the two rusted blades, not worth a cent, made from mortal steel. If this guy didn't have mental problems, then he would be an idiot for not knowing good from bad.When Nan Huairen saw Li Qiye's choice, the first thing that came up in his mind was the Serpent Punishing Stick. His heart was excited because he remembered when Li Qiye wanted the old stick from the fire place in the Grand Chamber; all the Elders, and himself, included, thought Li Qiye was ignorant for valuing a regular stick so highly.However, that stick had beaten a genius, like Xu Hui, as if he was defenseless. Now, Li Qiye suddenly wanted those two blades? It might not be just a coincidence. He probably had his eyes on them since they had stepped inside the Weapon Armory.A student who was thrown out by Nan Huairen was both angry and afraid; he yelled: \u201cNan Huairen! You\u2026 you dare hit me? I will report this to the Elders about\u2026\u201d\u201cSlap him. Slap him until he cannot speak anymore.\u201d Li Qiye mercilessly said.From those simple words, Nan Huairen could feel a strand of anger building inside Li Qiye. It seemed like this senior was becoming agitated. \u201cMy apologies.\u201dNan Huairen slapped the disciple three times, without hesitation. \u201dSlap, slap, slap.\u201d Nan Huairen knew that this wasn't just him saving the disciple's life; this was also a trial that Li Qiye was using to test him.Li Qiye left this matter alone, and he turned back to the protector: \u201cThe Elders have agreed on me picking a weapon, so I would like to choose these blades.\u201dThe protector rolled his eyes at Li Qiye. This kid didn't look like an idiot, so why was he so insistent on doing something so foolish?The protector hesitated for a moment, but he then, finally, nodded his head: \u201cThis is possible!\u201dThese were only two mortal blades; they were not a renowned treasure. Li Qiye came with the order from the Elders, and them giving him two regular blades wasn't a big deal.Li Qiye personally took down the two blades, so that the protector could write it down on the checkout list. Although Li Qiye's request was strange, the protector didn't really know what to say.Finishing his task, Li Qiye left the Weapon Armory with his blades. Coming across the disciples who were beaten senselessly by Nan Huairen, he slowed his steps and angrily said: \u201cYou guys need to be grateful toward Nan Huairen for saving your lives. If you have any complaints about my actions, you should go and report it to the Elders. However, don't let me personally deal with you because the result would not be preferable on your end.\u201dNan Huairen's intention was revealed by Li Qiye, and he could only smile sheepishly.The beaten students were frozen with fear. This person, before them, was a frightening man; there was no resemblance of a thirteen-year-old boy.Li Qiye walked back to his peak after speaking his mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn't know why Li Qiye wanted these blades, but he couldn't just ask right away either.Holding the blades, Nan Huairen stopped being so courteous, and he meticulously observed them; however, he couldn't see anything extraordinary from them.The two blades in his hands seemed to be just mortal weapons made from regular steel, and the rust on them was proof that they couldn't withstand the test of time.\u201cWhy did senior choose these blades?\u201d Nan Huairen believed that Li Qiye had already decided to go for these blades when he first entered the Weapon Armory.Li Qiye smiled and answered: \u201cIf you, or anyone in the sect, could see through their mysteriousness, then they wouldn't have been in the Weapon Armory for so long.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of treasure is this?\u201d Nan Huairen politely inquired. He truly could not see the magical properties.\u201cThey're not treasures.\u201d Li Qiye answered: \u201cThey're only two normal dual blades made out of steel. In fact, the material these are made out of are worth less than the two silver coins over there.\u201d\u201cBut why\u2026\u201d Li Qiye's answer confused Nan Huairen. If they were truly like Li Qiye described, then why did he pick them?Li Qiye interrupted his question: \u201cHowever, they can cut through the weapons of Royal Nobles and Enlightened Beings as if they were cutting through tofu.\u201d\u201cHow is that possible?!\u201d Nan Huairen's heart shook when he heard this. Royal Nobles were extremely strong, let alone Enlightened Beings. Since thirty thousand years ago, there hasn't been a single disciple who was capable of reaching the Enlightened Being stage in the sect.Li Qiye liked to see Nan Huairen's surprised expressions, and he slowly proclaimed: \u201cYou are smart, and you can clearly understand the current situation. I will not mistreat you. Emperor merit laws or Saint level treasures; if you want them, you will have them. If you do a good job and contribute greatly, I will even let you cultivate merit laws that are far more formidable than Emperor laws.\u201dLi Qiye's words were like steel rods beating on the drum that was Nan Huairen's heart. His master, or even Elder Sun, wouldn't be able to make such a promise because there weren't that many known Emperor laws in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. \u201cThank you brother.\u201dNan Huairen gathered his wits and bowed toward Li Qiye, and Li Qiye naturally accepted his gesture.After Nan Huairen left, Li Qiye held the blades in his hand; he caressed the edges. He sighed and started to remember his past.So what if one could become an unbeatable Immortal Emperor? Little boy Min Ren was groomed by him, so he was able to accept the Heaven's Will. His whole life, peerless in all the Nine Worlds, and he successfully cultivated the Solar Immortal Physique as well. However, in the end, he was still slowly erased by the river of time.Li Qiye removed the rust from the blades, bringing them back to their original form. The two blades had a normal appearance, but they now exuded an ancient aura.Using his hand to lightly touch the edges, Li Qiye felt a cold energy emanate from the blades. Everyone was correct in their judgment; these blades were indeed just mortal blades. However, they were the blades that were once used by Min Ren, personally, when he was a little boy.Based on the materials, these blades were trash; however, they used to be the main weapons of an Immortal Emperor. Even after he started cultivating, he was not willing to part with these blades; he always had them with him. Even after his ascension, they were still by his side.Every time he reminisced, he would take out the blades and caress them as if he wanted to share his feelings with the blades' soul.Even though Min Ren never forged the blades, they were blessed with an Immortal Emperor's touch and groomed by an Immortal Emperor's blood energy; thus, even if they were made of mortal steel, they were still exceptional. How powerful was an Immortal Emperor? This was the person that carried the Heaven's Will and reigned over the universe and the Nine Worlds.The true value of the blades was not in its material or sharpness, but the Immortal consciousness and thoughts hidden within the blades.An Immortal Emperor's consciousness was extremely frightening. Even though the two blades were not comparable to a Life Treasure or True Treasure, they were indefinitely stronger than a treasure from a Royal Noble or an Enlightened Being, many times over. One strand of offensive consciousness from an Immortal Emperor could cut through anything.Li Qiye slowly tried to connect with the leftover Immortal consciousness hidden in the blades.Of course, within a short amount of time, he couldn't easily communicate with this Immortal consciousness; this required patience and careful procedure. Li Qiye wasn't in a rush; he slowly felt the consciousness in the blades' body.In this world, no one was more familiar with Min Ren than Li Qiye. Thus, there was no one more familiar with this Immortal consciousness that belongs to Min Ren than Li Qiye.In the two following days, Li Qiye was still cultivating his Kun Peng's Six Variants and Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law, and he spent the rest of his time trying to communicate with the dual blades.Even though he was the Prime Disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, no one, except Protector Mo and Nan Huairen, had ever questioned his cultivation.Li Qiye was like a translucent shadow living in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Even the Elders didn't want to know his situation, let alone other people. To them, having Li Qiye was fine, but they would have no problem being without him.This made Nan Huairen the most familiar guest at Li Qiye's peak. Whenever he had time, he would come to check up on Li Qiye. He took care of his daily necessities; this ranged from mortal tools to a dimensional pouch.Protector Mo also tried to teach Li Qiye cultivation tips; however, Li Qiye seemed to know and understood everything, so Protector Mo eventually removed that thought from his head.Three months had passed. During one of Li Qiye's cultivation session, he felt a force rampaging through his body. Within a second, his Fate Palace released and absorbed multiple circular auras, and his eyes shot out a luminous flash.Right after, his Fate Palace underwent a momentous change. The Spring of Life to the East was suddenly flooded with the Water of Life. It traveled to all of the corners and caves, slowly creating a small spring.To the west, a bright fire burned the sky. The Cauldron of Life's flame was ignited, and the Soul Fire within it was lit aflame; it was as if it was capable of melting any existence in the world.The south did not want to lose to the others. The Tree of Life radiated many circular golden auras, and its leaves started to spring to life. Countless Life Energy surrounded the Tree of Life; it was as if it was a sleeping dragon being woken up from a long slumber. It let out a loud roar filled with infinite power.Lastly, to the north, there were also loud commotions. The Pillar of Life exerted a heavy presence; it was as if it was ready to connect the heaven to the earth. The mysterious Dao symbols on its body started to move around like they had their own consciousness.The Second Awakening! The second level of Palace Foundation was the Second Awakening stage. It took him three months to complete the first level.At the same time, all of the symbols and Dao truths from the Kun Peng's Six Variants happily came to life. Sometimes it was Kun Peng playing with Li Qiye's True Fate by flying to and going inside it. At other times, it became a Kun, and it swam in the surrounding water, jumped up and down, and caused huge tsunamis.Li Qiye's heart was filled with excitement. He took a deep breath; finally! He did not waste his time!! To go ten thousand miles, one starts with a half step. This was a great beginning!If other cultivators had to spend three months to get to the second stage, they wouldn't be as excited; they would have even thought that he was trash.After his True Fate went back into its slumber, Li Qiye left his excitement behind. He started to cultivate to a higher level. The slow had to start early, and the talentless had to be diligent. Throughout his life, he had seen many cultivators with average aptitudes become extremely strong masters; they were undefeated their whole lives, and they did this by being hard workers. He had also seen many geniuses fall into deep despair, without a chance to lift their heads.A cultivator's talents and physique aren't enough; one also needs a strong Dao willpower, and a will strong enough to follow the road to the end. One day, he would be the last one smiling, and he would be the one to stand at the highest peak, looking down on humanity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 42": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Emperor\u2019s DominationEmperor's Domination Chapter 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Third Bloodsurge was the last level of Palace Foundation. This level was just like its name suggested; from when the blood of a cultivator finally condensed into a single drop of longevity blood, this was the sign of a successful bloodsurge.There was a widespread saying in the world of cultivation: The Physique grows one's Blood, the Blood feeds one's Life Wheel, the Life Wheel strengthens one's Fate Palace, the Fate Palace, in turn, helps strengthen one's Life Wheel, the Life Wheel, then, supplements one's Blood, the Blood augments one's Physique, and the Physique, then, protects one's Fate Palace.Physique, Life Wheel, and Fate Palace; these three existences have always benefited and synergized with each other. One could not be missing from any of these.A strong Physique allowed the blood energy to be strong. The strong blood energy would prolong the lifespan, the longer the lifespan, the stronger the Fate Palace would be, and a formidable Fate Palace allowed the cultivator to obtain an even stronger Physique.The Fate Palace also lent its power to the Life Wheel. The Life Wheel would create Longevity Blood, the Longevity Blood would strengthen the Physique, and, then, the stronger Physique can protect the Fate Palace.However, no matter how this system worked, all three were surely dependent on one's blood energy. If a cultivator's rank was too high, a weaker blood energy would not be able to support his formidable Physique, Life Wheel, and Fate Palace; thus, there was a need for the blood energy to become Longevity Blood.Longevity Blood was extremely valuable to any cultivator. Each drop of Longevity Blood was created through many purification cycles. They were not only the pinnacle of blood energy, but they also contained the mysterious grand Dao.There was another saying regarding the blood: \u201cTen thousand blood, one longevity; one blood, ten thousand years longevity.\u201d Many cultivators interpreted this differently during their training.However, there was a common theme with their interpretations. It was that one drop of Longevity Blood required ten thousand bits of blood energy to form, and one Longevity Blood drop of an Immortal Emperor could allow a mortal to live for ten thousand years.Although no one had tried to use an Immortal Emperor Longevity Blood on a mere mortal to prolong his lifespan; the above phrase should make it clear on how valuable it was regarding each drop of Longevity Blood.To reach the stage of Third Bloodsurge wasn't anything impressive; a normal cultivator only needed a few months.The crucial point of this stage was to use a Longevity merit law to improve the blood energy, and Li Qiye was doing just that.The Life Wheel behind his back radiated its heavenly light while it rotated Li Qiye's blood energies in a circular pattern. Also, in the center of the rotation was a vortex. Once this vortex appeared, his blood energy became stronger and faster; it flowed like a torrential downpour.Because of his Mortal Physique and Mortal Life Wheel, his blood energy was originally anything but impressive; however, at this particular juncture, his blood energy was reaching the level of Xiantian Physique and Life Wheel.His blood energy flowed like a river, never stopping. It quickly finished one revolution around his Upper Dantian to his Lower Dantian. It became faster and faster until there was a giant vortex forming in Li Qiye's body, shaped like a round bloody crescent sun.This was the magical and frightening part of the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law; this method could turn one's blood energy into an extremely powerful flow. Because of this unbelievable speed, the Fate Palace within Li Qiye's True Fate suddenly came to life.In this moment, Li Qiye's True Fate had been completely awoken. It was akin to a huge Kun sucking up the blood vortex that was rotating because of his Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law.The Kun kept on sucking in the vortex with extreme speed; the written incantations of the Kun Peng's Six Variants came into life with blinding lights. These incantations completely crushed the incoming vortex into smaller pieces in the refining process.After the process, the blood energy became even purer and thicker with crystallized shinings. Then, the tempered blood was thrown back into the Life Wheel. The True Fate became even stronger as well as the Kun Peng's incantations. Each incantation resembled the Kun Peng as if they were made from real flesh; it slowly split into even smaller Kun Peng's as they flew to the four directions, filled with life.The whole operation was very natural like this was how it always had been.Li Qiye's Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law was actually purifying the blood energy, making it stronger, as well as using it to power the incantations within his Fate Palace.Throughout the years, countless disciples had tried to cultivate the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law; however, they failed because their method was flawed and imperfect. They could only lament in failure.Li Qiye's version was perfected through sheer effort and patience across the years. It was something that he couldn't have done by himself; however, he succeeded with the help of people like Min Ren, Tun Ri, and the Black Dragon King, amongst others\u2026After one day and one night of blood purification, he suddenly heard a thud; it was as if an extremely heavy object had fallen into his Life Wheel. At this moment, he felt like his mind was enlightened; everything was clear to him. His whole body was relaxed and surrounded with golden aura, and his blood aura, in the back of his Life Wheel, was brighter than ever before.Li Qiye examined his body; he found a drop of flashing Longevity Blood; it was crimson like fire and extremely beautiful like it was a creation from the heavens appearing in the Life Wheel.This drop of blood was the proof that Li Qiye had successfully broken through the stage of Palace Foundation and officially step into the Palace Expansion stage.If one was to say that Li Qiye took three months to reach the Second Awakening stage within the Palace Foundation, then no one would believe that it only took him one day and one night to create a drop of Longevity Blood; however, this was the frightening power of the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law.A genius could reach the Second Awakening within a day, but it would take him at least ten days to form one drop of Longevity Blood. However, Li Qiye only required one day to accomplish this task; no one would be calm after hearing this news.This was also why many geniuses chose the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law despite its flaws, in the past, because of its unbelievable speed for cultivation.The next day, when Nan Huairen saw Li Qiye, he was very surprised and asked: \u201cSenior\u2026 You\u2026 You\u2026 You have reached Palace Expansion already?\u201d\u201cI reached it last night.\u201d Li Qiye insipidly stated.If it was another person, he would be very proud; only the most heaven shattering geniuses would be able to form a Longevity Blood drop in one day; however, Li Qiye knew that this was all because of his merit law. He, personally, didn't have anything to be proud of.After hearing Li Qiye's answer, Nan Huairen, in a daze, said: \"Senior! I still remember that a few days ago, your True Face had still not reached the Second Awakening.\"\u201cTwo days ago, I reached Second Awakening.\u201d Li Qiye was still as calm like water in a well, and he answered.\u201cYou\u2026 You truly took three months to reach Second Awakening, but you only took one day to purify your first Longevity Blood drop?\u201d After knowing the full story, Nan Huairen's frozen body weakly asked.Li Qiye only smiled, without words. After a moment, Nan Huairen was both afraid and marveled by the speed: \u201cThe Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law is truly a wondrous method; no wonder many disciples in the past had tried to cultivate it.\u201dHis voice, filled with regrets, also rang again: \u201cIt is so unfortunate that the flaw of the method is also a fatal wound. Many geniuses tried to perfect this method, but no one had succeeded.\u201dNan Huairen curiously asked again: \u201cAt what stage will you switch to a different Life Wheel method?\u201dFrom his knowledge, he knew that one couldn't cultivate with the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law forever because of its unfixable flaw.The best way to cultivate from the beginning to end, no matter if it was a Life Wheel law or Fate law, was to use the same method throughout; this was how one truly improved his cultivation.A cultivator could change their existing cultivation method, but that would leave behind irreparable defects in the future for their grand Dao road. One day, when a calamity comes, this defect would be a fatal weakness.However, for many cultivators, not many were exposed to the best merit laws when they first started their cultivation paths. If a person started with an Emperor merit law and stuck with it for his whole life, it was a good thing; However, if he started with a lower rank merit law, then his future achievement would be extremely limited.From Nan Huairen's perspective, even though Li Qiye had cultivated the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law, in the future, he would need to change his method. Otherwise, he would ultimately be ruined by this merit law.Because of this, Nan Huairen politely reminded Li Qiye: \u201cSenior, you should quickly switch from this merit law; the sooner the better. Once you reach the dead end, it will be much harder to change; you will be unable to sever the control of this method from your blood energy.\u201d[1] Palace Foundation, Palace Expansion, Physique Accumulation, Provision Palace, Inner Longevity, Heaven's Mandate, Warrior Canopy, Purified Rebirth, Heaven's Primal.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were many talented beginners that believed in the same idea. First, cultivate using the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law to sprint through the early stages; then, wait until the merit law was no longer effective; lastly, change to a different merit law. However, once these geniuses were trapped in this ideology, they could never shake off the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law because the way this merit law moved blood energy was completely different from any other Life Wheel merit laws.This was the reason why, later on, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect no longer agreed for disciples to practice this method. Disciples with great inner talents were completely forbidden from doing so.\u201cI have my own plan.\u201d Li Qiye smiled and didn't say anything else. Of course, he couldn't reveal the secret of this merit law. If other people knew that he had perfected the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law, then the consequences could only be imagined!Nan Huairen knew that Li Qiye wasn't an ignorant person, nor arrogant, but he didn't understand where Li Qiye's confidence was coming from regarding this topic.\u201cI heard second brother is coming in a few days!\u201d Nan Huairen mainly came today to bring Li Qiye this message.Li Qiye lightly nodded and didn't inquire further. He was not concerned about this second brother, the disciple of the Sect Master, that Nan Huairen spoke of.After Nan Huairen's departure, Li Qiye, once again, diligently immersed himself in his cultivation. Although he already had the unparalleled arts of the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law and the Kun Peng's Six Variants, he was not lazy in the slightest.Palace Expansion also had three stages. First, Merit Law's Building; second, Essence Development; third, Earth's Extension.A grand completion of Palace Foundation meant that: both Life Wheel and Fate Palace merit laws were finalized, and the Dao basics of the Life Wheel and Fate Palace were successfully forged.At this moment, Li Qiye could choose to cultivate different merit laws, no matter if it was a Fate Palace, Life Wheel, or Physique method.The next method would be dependent on the finalized merit laws; this was why cultivators called the first stage, Merit Law's Building.However, Li Qiye wasn't in a rush to start a new method; he wanted to perfect the Invisible Dual Blades as well as strengthening his Physique, making it powerful.To a cultivator, a powerful Life Wheel and Fate Palace were not enough, he would also need a powerful Physique.The Life Wheel and Fate Palace were determined by the heavens, no one could change that; but the Physique was different, it could be improved through cultivation.Natural Physiques also varied greatly. The Mortal Physique was the weakest while the Immortal Physique was the best. Cultivators differentiated between Physiques from weak to strong with the following: Mortal Physique, Houtian Physique, Xiantian Physique, King Physique, Saint Physique, and Immortal Physique.One could be born with a Mortal Physique, Houtian Physique, Xiantian Physique, King Physique, or Saint Physique; but it could not be an Immortal Physique, because it was the pinnacle of all Physiques. From the ancient times until the present, no one had ever heard of a natural Immortal Physique.For the constitution, the Xiantian Physique was the determining factor of whether one could successfully cultivate his physique to a higher level. If this was the case, then there was a chance that one could eventually successfully cultivate into a King Physique, Saint Physique, or even an Immortal Physique.However, the Houtian Physique did not have that possibility. For example, the Golden Hawk Physique of Xu Hui belonged to the Sky Eagle Physique family and was considered to be a powerful Houtian Physique.Through cultivation, the Golden Hawk Physique could eventually reach the state of Heavenly Hawk Physique or even its highest state, Immortal Hawk Physique. Although this last state was not weaker than a King Physique, this Houtian type of Physique would never be able to obtain the pinnacle state of Immortal Physique.Evolving from the Golden Hawk Physique to Heavenly Hawk Physique was a strengthening process while going from a Xiantian Physique to a King Physique was a rise in rank and essence.King Physiques and Saint Physiques also had many limitations. For example, the Golden Bull Physique was a strong Physique within its family and could rise to the rank of Tyrannical Physique through cultivation, but cultivators could not cultivate it into their own special Physique, even if it was the same rank.Physiques given by the body would remain the same type, even with cultivation; no merit law nor high ranking Physique method could change that.However, the Heaven's creations were mysterious and magical! Although the Golden Hawk Physique and Golden Bull Physique couldn't escape their limitations no matter how heaven-defying the cultivation method was; there was one Physique capable of the ordeal. A Physique that was dismissed by many people, the Mortal Physique!One could cultivate the Mortal Physique into the Golden Hawk Physique, the Golden Bull Physique, and even an Immortal Physique in the legends. Before cultivation, the mortal body was not limited by any factors.Whereas the Houtian Physique, with a natural fire attribute, must find a method with a similar affinity. If a fire attribute picked a water Physique cultivation method, it would create a fatal dissonance for one's cultivation.The Mortal Physique did not have such a requirement; before the cultivation road, one could pick any Physique building method.Of course, to rise from a Mortal Physique to a Houtian or Xiantian Physique was not an easy task. The cultivator required a formidable Physique method, as well as a willpower that was ten times higher than others; lastly, a high-grade Physique paste was necessary. The higher the grade and quantity, the better.This was why, to successfully increase the rank of a Mortal Physique into a Xiantian Physique, would be a monumental task; monstrous efforts must be exerted.This was the reason no one in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect wished to invest in someone with a Mortal Physique, Mortal Life Wheel, and Mortal Fate Palace like Li Qiye; any Physique method or high-grade Physique pastes used on such an average person would be a waste.Li Qiye realized that his chosen road would be extremely torturous, but his heart had not wavered ever since he got his hands on the Physique Scripture, one of the Nine Grand Heavenly Scriptures; a treasure that was craved even by Immortal Emperors.If someone had successfully done it in the past, then Li Qiye knew that he was capable as well. The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's Immortal Emperor Min Ren had many descendants; they believed that his Immortal Physique was natural gifted by the heavens, but Li Qiye knew that these words were complete nonsense. He single-handedly nurtured Min Ren so he was aware of all the facts, that Immortal Emperor Min Ren was not born with a King Physique, or a Saint Physique, but a Mortal Physique. This fact would be hard for the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect to accept, but this was the truth. When Min Ren was younger, Li Qiye taught him one of the Nine Heavenly Scriptures. The word \u201cYang\u201d, meaning the sun, was the chosen Physique method for Immortal Emperor Min Ren. Thus, he successfully cultivated one of the twelve Immortal Physiques.Today, Li Qiye opened the Physique Scripture; all of the esoteric incantations regarding it appeared in his mind. From the past till the present, no one had ever grasped the mysteries of the Physique Scripture more than Li Qiye; thus, he was able to create a number of legends.From the Desolate Era until now, he was never lax when it came to researching the Physique Scripture. Especially during the time when the Black Dragon King ruled the land, this was when his mastery reached its peak. Until later, his situation had a complication and thus, he had no choice but to command the Black Dragon King to erase all of his memories regarding the Physique Scripture.The Physique Scripture had a total of six incantations: Yin and Yang, Hardness and Softness, Pure and Taint!Even though the Physique Scripture only had six incantations, they were the ultimate evolution of the mysterious truths in all of the Physiques. In the distant era, there were twelve Immortal Physiques, but no one knew that they originated from the Physique Scripture.Once one reached the grand understanding for any of the six words; each word would give birth to two different Immortal Physiques and a cultivator could only pick one of the two.For example, Immortal Emperor Min Ren was taught the word \u201cYang\u201d by Li Qiye. There were two Immortal Physiques that stemmed from the word \u201cYang\u201d at grand completion; Immortal Solar Physique and Immortal Light Physique. Min Ren was able to cultivate the Immortal Solar Physique.After generations of deductions and numerous years of studies and understanding, Li Qiye realized that the Physique Scripture could cultivate any Physique, but there were no Physiques stronger than the twelve Immortal Physiques.At this moment, Li Qiye had decided to cultivate the word \u201cTaint\u201d to grand completion, to the extreme. He wanted to cultivate the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique from the twelve Immortal Physiques.Li Qiye knew that the process to reach grand completion for the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique would be very long; it was not something that could be done in one day and one night. A fast completion would be a few hundred years, while a slow completion would be a few thousand to ten thousands of years.However, he had extreme confidence in himself. Even if he was born with a Mortal Physique, through perseverance and willpower, one day, he would be a practitioner with the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique.The Physique Scripture surfaced in the mind of Li Qiye. He controlled the incantations of the word \u201cTaint\u201d like an unstoppable river into his Fate Palace.His True Fate that was absorbing the blood energy earlier was now also absorbing the mysterious truths of the word \u201cTaint\u201d. Polished by the True Fate, the mysteries of the word \u201cTaint\u201d were being integrated into his blood. At this point, his body was startled, and it seemed like everything had become slow as if time had stopped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law was an absolutely outstanding law, even through the eons; it turned the blood energy into a ferocious vortex.Right when the incantations of the word \u201cTaint\u201d appeared in the blood of Li Qiye, his blood became extremely heavy; the blood flow slowed down due to this.However, no one could underestimate the magic of the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law. After the mysterious truths of the word \u201cTaint\u201d slowed down the blood flow, the merit law angrily acted up, using its full power, controlled the Life Wheel, and roared with all of the impacts in the world.The stagnating blood flow suddenly became faster with the push from the Life Wheel and the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law. The blood flow in Li Qiye's body, at this moment, was like a gigantic dragon that was rampaging, fierce and immense.The overbearing blood went on a rampage, tearing apart Li Qiye's meridians, destroying his bones, and burning down his Fate Palace. Within a short moment, Li Qiye's Physique was nearly ruined.Li Qiye, in agony, spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. This was a great pain that he almost couldn't handle. Suddenly, there was a crack that appeared in his body, and in the next second, his whole body began to shatter like a piece of porcelain.The power of the mysterious truths within the word \u201cTaint\u201d was more than people could ever imagine. The blood, with tremendous weight under the pull of the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law, could overwhelmingly destroy anything.Li Qiye's body was severely crushed; his Mortal Physique could not withstand the power of divinity from the conflicting force inside his body! However, the word \u201cTaint\u201d was certainly not trying to kill Li Qiye. If the mysterious truths of the Physique Scripture was nothing more than this, then it would not be coveted for many eons by Immortal Emperors.Li Qiye's palace was also destroyed by the force of the vigorous blood, but as his body was crushed, many songs of the Grand Dao started to sing. Countless mysterious truths from his Fate Palace came into action; his True Fate was absorbing the endless incantation runes, and these runes made his True Fate radiate Life Energy throughout his body.At this moment, under the effect of the word \u201cTaint\u201d, the Spring of Life gushed out a raging Water of Life; it was as if a tsunami had appeared. The Cauldron of Life immediately burned with Soul Fire; the Soul Fire brightly shook the heaven and earth.The thousand leaves of the Tree of Life stretched brilliantly toward the four directions; they emitted countless Life Energy. Afterward, the Leaves of Life fell down to the ground and the deepest root of the Tree of Life connected to the deepest part of Li Qiye's Fate Palace. All of the roots eventually tied Li Qiye's whole body, locking together his shattered remnants.The Pillar of Life used its mysterious incantations to connect to the word \u201cTaint\u201d, as well as the heaven and earth. The incantations ran endlessly and started to borrow the power of the world to make the body of Li Qiye pierce the Nine Heavens and drill into the Nine Earths.At this time, the Water of Life, Soul Fire, Leaves of Life, and the incantations of the Pillar of Life were refined by the word \u201cTaint\u201d while surrounded by Li Qiye's blood. They turned into Primordial Chaos energy which wrapped around the entire, broken body of Li Qiye.At this moment, Li Qiye's body was tormented by the heavy blood on the inside, which weighed as much as ten thousand mountains, while the Primordial Chaos energy was surrounding him like a mud paste in a blockade. The whole process was extremely painful.However, despite the pain, Li Qiye was still holding on. Li Qiye was enduring so that the blood with the \u201cTaint\u201d mysterious truths would refine and recreate his body; because the Primordial Chaos energy was encompassing his body, his completely shattered body didn't break into pieces onto the ground.Blood, once again, disintegrated Li Qiye's body. The \u201cTaint\u201d mysterious truths, time and time again, destroyed Li Qiye's body; this process was like a giant hammer smashing into Li Qiye time and time again while the Water of Life, Soul Fire, Leaves of Life, and Pillar of Life's incantations combined into Primordial Chaos energy, and was recast to the broken areas in order to rebuild Li Qiye's body.If outsiders could see this scene, they would be shocked to witness the power of the Fate Palace Four Symbols: the Spring of Life, the Tree of Life, the Cauldron of Life, and the Pillar of Life.For eons, countless sages wondered and studied the mysterious truths of the Fate Palace Four Symbols to no avail. It was believed that only Immortal Emperors could comprehend the entirety of the truths within the Four Symbols.However, at this moment, a thirteen-year-old boy was able to communicate with the Four Symbols; it was simply unthinkable.In fact, since ancient times, regarding the mastery of the Fate Palace Four Symbols, no one went as far as Li Qiye did, including Immortal Emperors. He spent endless years researching the Physique Scripture, how could there be someone else who had the same grasp of mastery as he did?Suffering time and time again, the refinement continued. Li Qiye did not know how long the process had been; the pain had made him numb.Ever since he had chosen the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law and the Physique Scripture, this result had been within the expectations of Li Qiye.Although he could have also cultivated the Physique Scripture without the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law, in this world, there was only this merit law that was capable of driving the mysterious truths behind the word \u201cTaint\u201d within the blood flow.Because of the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique, he needed the power of the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law; not only to completely destroy his body but also to reshape it into a higher rank.An unknown amount of time had passed; Li Qiye felt an itch throughout his body. The body reshaping had been completed, his shattered body pieces were connected once again. His pain had totally disappeared and when he opened his eyes again, his body was without damage. It was hard to believe that Li Qiye's body, which was fragmented and split, was now without the slightest wound; it exceeded people's imaginations.There were different advantages and disadvantages for different Physique methods; each method for the formation of different Physiques vary, but in this world, there was no other Physique method that was flawless like this Physique Scripture. To be able to completely destroy a body, then reform it perfectly; in the entire process, there was no lasting harm.When Li Qiye stood up and took a step, the brick below him was instantly shattered. He did not activate his blood energy, nor exercise his merit laws; it was purely due to his body movement. The effect of the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique from the word \u201cTaint\u201d was frightening.When a cultivator practiced the word \u201cTaint\u201d to grand completion, two different Immortal Physiques would appear. They were the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique and the Sky Destroyer Immortal Physique.Although they came from the same word \u201cTaint\u201d, these two Immortal Physiques were completely different.The Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique made it so that the body was as heavy as a thousand mountains. Once a cultivator reached grand completion of this Physique, it was said that he could crush everything with his own body, including the galaxy itself.There was a saying: the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique was immeasurably heavy; one lift of the foot could stomp to death both Immortals and Demons. From this saying, one could only imagine how heavy the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique truly was.The Sky Destroyer Immortal Physique turned the body into a mighty, infinite power. When completed, a cultivator could rip apart the earth barehanded and wrestle a real dragon; these were easy matters.Li Qiye had been cultivating on the peak while using this self-torturing method for more than a month. With the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law rotating his blood non-stop, Li Qiye had broken through two small stages within just a month. The last two stages, Essence Development and Earth's Extension, were not a challenge to him.When he was about to pass the Essence Development stage, his merit law led the Life Wheel to spin. His heavy blood energy bellowed out roars and turned into a huge vortex, sucking blood up and down inside it.This vortex, combined with the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law and the Kun Peng's Six Variants, frantically absorbed the world's spirit energy. The Kun Peng inside his Fate Palace, the world's largest creature, opened its mouth and satisfyingly swallowed the spirit energy from the heavens like an endless pit.In the blink of an eye, Li Qiye nearly absorbed all of the spirit energy surrounding his old peak. Fortunately, there were no other people around; otherwise, this would cause a great shock.This spirit energy from the world was moved into his True Fate where it was refined. The more spirit energy there was, the stronger the True Fate; the stronger the True Fate, the stronger the Dao foundation; the stronger the Dao foundation, the stronger the cultivation level.After the True Fate had absorbed enough of the world's spirit energy, it radiated an aura with enough force to tear away the vast fogs from the four oceans. At this moment, the True Fate wanted to break away its own boundary, to turn this vast space into its own territory. This process was called Earth's Extension.Nan Huairen was shocked to find out that it only took Li Qiye a month to break through the two stages of Essence Development and Earth's Extension.\u201cWithin a month, to enter the Physique Accumulation stage, senior is too crazy!\u201dNan Huairen was envious from watching; this speed could be comparable to geniuses.Of course, Nan Huairen didn't know that if Li Qiye didn't cultivate the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique and didn't have the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law to carry his blood which weighed thousands of pounds, he wouldn't have such a satisfying result.[1] The word \u201cTaint\u201d is the same as the first letter in \u201cPrimordial Chaos\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everyone knew that cultivating this method would result in a trap, set up by its effect that was impossible to get out of, becoming a piece of trash in the end.Seeing Nan Huairen's expression, Li Qiye only smiled and didn't say anything else.The next day, Li Qiye woke up early, as usual, to cultivate. However, when he opened the door, he was startled because there was a man standing quietly outside.It was an old man, around the age of fifty to sixty. He was wearing a robe made out of vines, his face was lean without any facial hair, but his eyes were extremely alive. Although he was old, his back was straight and his spirit was high.\u201cSenior, good morning!\u201d The old man respectfully clapped his hands when he saw Li Qiye.\u201cUh!\u201d Li Qiye didn't know what to say. He was always calm and collective while looking at life, but he was at a loss with the current event. If the boy Nan Huairen called him \u201csenior,\u201d it would be acceptable; however, this was an old man, around fifty to sixty years old, respectfully calling a thirteen year old boy like him, \u201csenior\u201d; such a strange thing.Li Qiye regathered his wit and said: \u201cElder, you must be mistaken, I am not your senior.\u201dThe old man looked around, and turned his gaze back to Li Qiye and asked: \u201cThis place is the Prime Disciple's peak?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Li Qiye truthfully answered. If this old man didn't have such a good spirit, he would think this was an encounter with a mentally ill patient.\u201cYou are the Prime Disciple of our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, correct?\u201dLi Qiye obediently answered honestly again: \u201cYes, I am Li Qiye.\u201dThe old man smiled and formally bowed his head, then said: \u201cThen it is correct. This is your peak and you are the Prime Disciple, which means that you are my senior.\u201d\u201cUh!\u201d Li Qiye suddenly became silent, he was certain that the old man didn't have the wrong person. But in the end, to have such an old man calling him senior felt very strange and uncomfortable.\u201cSorry, sorry, I'm late!\u201d At this time, Nan Huairen breathlessly rushed in from the outside and smiled.When Nan Huairen arrived, he saw Li Qiye and the old man standing still in front of the door. He coughed awkwardly, then did their introductions: \u201cBig brother, this is second brother. Second brother, this is\u2026\u201d\u201cI know, he is big brother!\u201d Before Nan Huairen could finish, the old man interrupted him and earnestly replied.\u201cUh, nice to meet you, second younger brother!\u201d Li Qiye hesitantly gave out a courteous response.The old man nodded, revealing a very nice smile, and said: \"Senior, this younger brother's name is Tu Buyu. I am also the second disciple of the Sect Master. Since you are the Prime Disciple, you are the eldest brother of all of our third generation disciples.\"Seeing his kind smile, Li Qiye's head was shaking. He wanted to yell: Uncle, I am only thirteen years old and you are fifty to sixty years old, please don't play coy in front of me and call yourself \u201cyounger brother.\u201dFinally, Li Qiye invited Tu Buyu inside the house, then he dragged Nan Huairen to the side and asked: \u201cWhat is going on?\u201dHaving a younger brother like this old man, Li Qiye was at a loss for words.\u201cUh!\u201d This time, it was Nan Huairen's turn to not know how to answer. It took a while before he calmly responded: \u201cBrother, a couple of days ago, I already told you that second brother was coming back.\u201dLi Qiye, of course, knew about the second brother coming back because Nan Huairen had told him this, but he didn't pay attention. He thought that the second disciple of Sect Master Su Yonghuang would be around thirty years old, at the most forty. But this younger brother in front of him was at least fifty years old. He was surprised and startled to have a younger brother this old.\u201cBrother, he is indeed Tu Buyu, the second disciple of the Sect Master.\u201d Nan Huairen said with confidence. The truth was, before, the Sect Master only had Tu Buyu as a disciple; Li Qiye had only recently went under the Sect Master's wing.Li Qiye contemplated for a moment. He had not met his master yet, but only this fifty-year-old second brother.However, it was true that he was the Prime Disciple and with that status, all third generation disciples \u2013 despite their age \u2013 had to call him \u201cbig brother.\u201d\u201cHow many older disciples do we have here at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect?\u201d Li Qiye glanced at Nan Huairen and asked. Imagining a scene where a bunch of old men gathered around him and respectfully called him \u201cbig brother,\u201d Li Qiye could not stand it.\u201cOnly one person like that\u2026\u201d Nan Huairen quietly laughed.After hearing the response, Li Qiye sighed in relief and walked toward Tu Buyu: \u201cWhen did Junior Tu come back? Did master come back with you?\u201d\u201cDear big brother, this young brother came back alone. I only\u2026\u201d Tu Buyu said in a serious manner and an exposing kind smile.Li Qiye immediately interrupted him and said: \u201cYounger brother, you are sixty; please don't be so courteous, you are shortening my life.\u201d\u201cDear big brother, I am only one thousand six hundred and seventy-five years old this year.\u201d Tu Buyu, while keeping his amicable smile, seriously answered.\u201cCrash!\u201d Li Qiye staggered, almost falling over after hearing the answer. Not only him, but even Nan Huairen couldn't stand straight.\u201cCould, could you repeat that\u2026\u201d Li Qiye was almost choked to death by his own saliva. A one thousand year old man called him big brother. Dear heavens, does one really need a younger brother this old?\u201cThis young brother is one thousand six hundred and seventy-five years old.\u201d Tu Buyu slowly repeated without changing his tone.Li Qiye glared at Nan Huairen, and Nan Huairen could only innocently smile; he, himself, didn't know that Tu Buyu was so old.\u201cBig brother, are you okay? Do you want this young brother to get you a cup of water\u2026\u201d Seeing Li Qiye's choking expression, Tu Buyu kindly offered.Li Qiye recovered and broke Tu Buyu's words mid-sentence: \u201cGrandpa, please stop calling yourself young brother, I'm getting goosebumps. First, I am only thirteen years old, you are above one thousand; you calling me big brother is only shortening my life. Second, this is the main point, why are you trying to be cute in front of me, calling yourself young brother? Are you implying that I am really old compared to my age? Do I look that old? Huairen, do I look that old?\u201dLi Qiye crazily spoke nonstop, Nan Huairen was smiling on the inside. This was the first time he had seen this senior unable to hold onto his calm emotions.However, under the killing glare of Li Qiye, Nan Huairen could only smile and pretend to look elsewhere.\u201cIf this is big brother's command, this young brother\u2026 no, I will respectfully obey.\u201d Tu Buyu was receptive, with a smile on his face.\u201cSuch a brilliant decision, young brother Tu.\u201d Li Qiye nodded his head approvingly.Tu Buyu smilingly replied: \u201cWhen it comes to heavenly brilliance, I am not your equal.\u201dTu Buyu's words silenced Nan Huairen. He used to think that he was smooth and slick, good at reading other people's mind, but this old man was even faster at flattering than he was. It seemed that Nan Huairen had met his match.Li Qiye only smiled and certainly did not mind this. One could see that Tu Buyu was an interesting and wily person; a person living for one thousand years like him could call a thirteen-year-old boy \u201cbig brother\u201d in their first meeting. This type of person, if he wasn't an insidious mastermind, then he would be a person who could read the circumstances, knowing what to do in each situation.Of course, no matter what type of person he was, he could not escape from the eyes of Li Qiye. He had seen many people; when it comes to reading people's thoughts and characters, very few could hide their intentions and nature in front of him. Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to cultivate the invincible Min Ren.Li Qiye and Tu Buyu only just casually talked for a little bit, then they said their goodbyes. In fact, Li Qiye didn't really care for Tu Buyu's purpose in coming back to the sect, so he didn't bother asking; this wasn't a big deal to him. Li Qiye only had one goal; that was to make himself powerful, rebuild the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, and kill anyone who tried to block his steps, leaving no survivors!If the appearance of Tu Buyu yesterday was strange and funny for Li Qiye, then the news from Nan Huairen the next day was unexpected to him.The next day, Nan Huairen and his master, Protector Mo, went up to the peak. They reported to Li Qiye, giving important news: Tomorrow, Li Shuangyan, the princess of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, will be coming to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.As the person in charge of the marriage between the two factions, Protector Mo was the first to be informed regarding Li Shuangyan's arrival by the Nine Saint Demon Gate.\u201cComing is fine, it is best to come after thinking it through completely. But if not, it doesn't really matter.\u201d Li Qiye was quite surprised. He thought that the Nine Saint Demon Gate would wait for eight or ten years, he didn't expect that Li Shuangyan would be coming in less than a year.Of course, if the Nine Saint Demon Gate was to wait for ten years before making a move, then Li Qiye wouldn't open his door for them. By then, his wings would have become full-fledged so there was no need for the Nine Saint Demon Gate to come. What he needed right now was a timely ally, not someone who would \u201cembroider flowers on cotton cloths.\u201dProtector Mo was too hesitant to personally ask Li Qiye, so he winked at Nan Huairen. Nan Huairen understood his master, and had to bite the bullet to ask: \u201cSenior, if Princess Li actually wanted to stay at our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, would you really let her be a sword maid?\u201d[1] Basically giving help when it is no longer necessary, cotton was considered expensive/high-class in the era where this phrase originated from.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now that the word is out, why change it!\u201dProtector Mo and Nan Huairen winked at each other, and Nan Huairen finally stuttered: \u201cB-bu-but she is the descendant of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, and the princess of the Old Ox country.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d Li Qiye was like an ancient well without waves, and calmly said: \u201cLittle Nan Huairen still hasn't reached the apex, he still has a lot of training to do.\u201dNan Huairen and his master were silent, not knowing what to say. The words \u201cSo what?\u201d were very short and simple, but what kind of arrogant attitude and confidence was required to say these words?Li Shuangyan wasn't only the descendant of the Nine Saint Demon Gate and the princess of the Old Ox country, but she was also one of the geniuses possessing a King Physique, King Life Wheel, and Saint Fate Palace. She had incredibly great talents.Whether it was talent or appearance, Li Shuangyan was not below anyone in the Grand Middle Territory, or even the entirety of the Mortal Emperor World. There were enough men that wanted her love to make a line from the east to the south of the Old Ox country.Even then, Li Qiye was not satisfied; she was only worthy of being his sword maid. If this news were to be spread, who knew how many men would want to kill Li Qiye.Nan Huairen and Protector Mo had given up in front of Li Qiye's arrogance; this was not the first time they've seen this. They only gently sighed, and didn't dare to report this to the Six Elders, afraid that the Six Elders would be scared silly. \u201cDo the Elders know about this?\u201dProtector Mo shook his head: \u201cI have not reported this to the Elders. We have decided to wait until we spoke with you first before reporting to the Elders.\u201dEver since their return to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect from the Nine Saint Demon Gate, the two, master and disciple, had to choose between Li Qiye and the Six Elders \u2013 and they chose Li Qiye. To others, this was an odd decision, but Protector Mo had thought it through.\u201cThen report it to the Elders!\u201d Li Qiye nodded this head without much care.Even if people of this era valued the Nine Saint Demon Gate and Li Shuangyan, to Li Qiye, they were nothing. No matter how talented Li Shuangyan was, she still couldn't compare to Immortal Emperor Xiu Shu that year!After leaving Li Qiye's peak, Protector Mo immediately reported the message to the First Elder. First Elder Gu couldn't sit still when he heard this news.\u201cWhat, Princess Li is almost here?\u201d Compared to the nonchalant Li Qiye, the First Elder's reaction showed a lot more shock.After Protector Mo confirmed that the news was absolutely true, the First Elder walked back and forth in the room; his heart was extremely excited.Protector Mo secretly sighed, this was the gap; Li Qiye had no reaction to the news whilst the First Elder was extremely serious and ecstatic. No doubt, the First Elder greatly valued the marriage between the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the Nine Saint Demon Gate.Finally, the First Elder calmed down and calmly commanded: \u201cSend the command to Li Qiye, tell him to prepare well to welcome the arrival of Princess Li.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Protector Mo accepted; he wasn't foolish enough to tell the First Elder that he had already told Li Qiye first.\u201cAlso inform all of the Elders, Protectors, and the rest of the disciples within the sect. We have to use the most solemn ceremony to greet the arrival of Princess Li. During this time, no one can make any mistakes, understand?\u201d The First Elder gravely commanded.Protector Mo immediately accepted the order and didn't say anything else. If this was before, then Protector Mo, like everyone else, would heavily value this marriage; but because of Li Qiye's influence, his view on the grand scheme of things had changed. Like Li Qiye, he believed that becoming a subsidiary for the Nine Saint Demon Gate wasn't a permanent solution. Only strength itself was the fundamental path.Of course, Protector Mo was also clear that the current Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was lacking an upper echelon that could independently deal with all of the dangers \u2013 that had enough strength to reignite the sect.\u201cPrincess Li coming to our sect is one thing, but what about the issue of the marriage?\u201d After finishing his commands, the First Elder continued his questions. His heart was also clear, that the current Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was too weak, and with a new start, they would need the backing of the Nine Saint Demon Gate to survive.Which was why this marriage must be successful; it further guaranteed the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's chance of revival.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Protector Mo didn't know where to start. The truth was, he had heard from one of the Elders from the Nine Saint Demon Gate that if Li Qiye had chosen to stay at the Nine Saint Demon Gate that day, then his marriage with Princess Li would definitely already have been settled and assured.\u201cI'm afraid only the Princess and the Demon King would clearly know the answer.\u201d In the end, this was the only thing Protector Mo could say. Some things, he couldn't reveal too much about.The First Elder took a deep breath of relief and said: \u201cRelay my order to Li Qiye; tell him to take good care of Princess Li during her stay here. We absolutely cannot let her have a hint of displeasure; try to win the Princess's favor. When the time is ripe, tell him to propose to her. If he could marry the princess, then the sect will heavily reward him!\u201dThe First Elder made so many commands that Protector Mo was frozen without words. In fact, Li Qiye didn't even want to marry the Princess; even if Princess Li was willing to follow him, the best she could do was being a sword maid. Of course, Protector Mo couldn't tell the First Elder that, because he would certainly become crazy.\u201cYes!\u201d Protector Mo quickly affirmed. He would definitely relay the order to Li Qiye, but he also knew that Li Qiye would definitely just laugh it off.Overnight, the news regarding Li Shuangyan's visit to the sect spread throughout the entire faction; everyone was ecstatic.Especially the young male disciples, they were more excited than anyone else. Although they haven't seen her figures, they had heard about her reputation; Princess Li of the Old Ox country, the descendant of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, a beautiful and peerless talented woman.She was the goddess in everyone's dream, the object of affection for many of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's male students.A senior brother couldn't help but exclaim: \u201cGoddess Li, you can say that she is the real beauty of our Grand Middle Territory. Five years ago, I was on a mission to the Old Ox country, I only caught a glance but I guarantee that she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.\u201d\u201cPrincess Li's visit! Maybe there is a chance to get her favor!\u201d Another younger brother started daydreaming and said: \u201cWith regard to looks and talents, I am also famous in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. If I could get her attention, then I could soar up into the sky. In the future, I will be the Sect Master of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, it is no problem!\u201dAll of a sudden, the male disciples became more active; some started to dress up meticulously. Especially the disciples who were considered to be talented in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; they put on their True Armors and True Treasures in visible sight so that Princess Li would take a second glance at them.The next day, all of the disciples in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect gathered outside the Dao gateway, the Six Elders were present as well, along with the Protectors and sectional leaders; as long as they were still present in the sect, they had to participate in this feast today.All of the disciples were wearing their most extravagant clothing, even the female disciples were dressed up.Normally, only the upper echelons were allowed to stand on top of the Dao gateway, but there was an exception today. There were two other people qualified to stand here to greet Li Shuangyan.One of the two was today's hero, Li Qiye, and the second was Leng Shizhi, who was known as the genius of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.Leng Shizhi was only twenty years old with a handsome face, a fit and muscular body, and his confident smile which always gave him the aura of a genius.Leng Shizhi was a disciple of the second elder, Cao Xiong. This Leng was the most talented disciple, he was considered the top genius of all of the third generation disciples.Leng Shizhi had been in Elder Cao Xiong's ranks for almost twenty years; today, he is at the Warrior Canopy ranking. At such a young age with such a strong cultivation in a declining sect like the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, he was not just a genius in name.Back then, when Second Elder Cao Xiong had an aspiration of ambition to become the Sect Master, Su Yonghuang appeared out of nowhere and he lost the chance to become the head of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. This event had always haunted him.Today, Su Yonghuang didn't have a successor; Cao Xiong used all of his resources to groom Leng Shizhi so that this disciple could easily win the seat. He had wanted for Leng Shizhi to become the Prime Disciple, but Su Yonghuang had refused, and the First Elder didn't support him. This was the second hatred in his heart.Even though Li Qiye was now the Prime Disciple, Cao Xiong did not put Li Qiye \u2013 this waste of life \u2013 in his eyes. With Li Qiye's disposition, he was not qualified to fight with his disciple, Leng Shizhi, for the seat of the Sect Master.So, for this visit of Princess Li to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, Cao Xiong had especially commanded his disciple, Leng Shizhi, to seize this golden opportunity; if he could get Li Shuangyan's favor, then becoming the Sect Master, it would no longer be up for question. No one in the sect, then, whether they be the Elders or Su Yonghuang, wouldn't be able to stop his steps at becoming the Sect Master.So today, Leng Shizhi was particularly well dressed, wearing treasure clothing with radiating lights, with a pair of boots accompanied by white clouds, and on his waist was an Eight Treasures Jade Jewel with a faint sound of the Grand Dao; his whole body, with the treasures, exerted a formidable pressure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Their treasures were in plain sight on their bodies, afraid that people wouldn't know that they didn't have so many treasures.Li Qiye saw this scene and could only shake his head. He told Protector Mo who was standing near by: \"These people seemed to be attending the circus, not Li Shuangyan's greeting party!\"Nan Huairen didn't have the qualification to stand next to the upper echelons during the greeting party, only Protector Mo was next to Li Qiye. Hearing those words, Protector Mo could only show a hollow smile.\"Be more formal!\" At this time, Leng Shizhi who was standing in front turned back and coldly said: \"Princess Li is the descendant of the imperial family, the most distinguished guest of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. We must greet her in the most dignified manner, in order to avoid disgrace and shame to our sect!\"Finished speaking, he looked at Li Qiye with disdain.At this point, Li Qiye alone, was wearing a cotton garment, unadorned by any treasures and looked exactly like a mortal. At first, Leng Shizhi was assigned to be standing side by side with Li Qiye, but Leng Shizhi believed that he was above the piece of waste, so he took the initiative to stand in front.\"Her royal highness' presence is definitely an honor to all of us.\" Among the male disciples waiting, one excitedly exclaimed.Leng Shizhi was dismissive of these disciples, their talents were so average, how could they win Princess Li's favor. It was simply a toad wanting to eat a swan's meat! Hmmph, as for the idiotic Li Qiye, he wasn't even a toad; he was not even qualified to have such a thought.WIth this thought, Leng Shizhi had an even greater disdain for Li Qiye. Although the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the Nine Saint Demon Gate had an ancient marriage pact, only the Prime Disciple like Li Qiye would have the right to marry Li Shuangyan. However, Leng Shizhi didn't care for this ancient convention; Li Qiye was not qualified to marry Li Shuangyan in his eyes, and surely Li Shuangyan would hate a piece of trash like Li Qiye.In Leng Shizhi's opinion, as long as he had the opportunity to be close to Li Shuangyan, he could please her enough to win her favor. He was extremely confident in himself, he was the first genius of the sect after all!Li Shuangyan had yet to come. At the ancient gateway, some from the younger generation couldn't help but quietly whisper amongst each other. A disciple asked: \"This time the princess is coming to our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, what is her purpose?\"\"I heard that the Prime Disciple and the successor of the Nine Saint Demon Gate were determined to be married.\" An older disciple knew a little about it thoughtfully said.\"Marriage?\" After hearing this answer, one disciple glanced at Li Qiye and contemptuously said.One disciple said with disdain: \"Him? Hmmph, in my opinion, the princess came to dissolve this marriage. Her royal highness would be dismissive of an idiot with a Mortal Physique, Mortal Life Wheel, and Mortal Fate Palace.\"\"Whatever reason it might be for the princess' arrival, this is a good chance for us to be close to her royal highness.\" A disciple excitedly said.The only person without any interest in these little arguments was Li Qiye. It was fine to occasionally act in a play, but if this took any longer, he would lose his interest!At this time, an \u201cooomph\u201d resonated from the Dao gateway, it blindingly illuminated the eyes. The brilliant crystal door was opened, and the dimension between the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the Nine Saint Demon Gate was finally connected. A group of people stepped out from the gateway, and the first person was the successor, Li Shuangyan of the Nine Saint Demon Gate.In addition to her, there were a few familiar faces to Li Qiye, such as Grand Protector Yu He and a few exceptional disciples of the Nine Saint Demon Gate.Li Shuangyan, still dressed in white, her masterpiece of an alluring face was still cold as snow; arrogant like a goddess sitting on her throne, causing even the moon and sun to blush in her presence.As for the male disciples, especially the ones that were seeing Li Shuangyan for the first time, they were stunned by her beautiful face and figure and couldn't recover for a long time. Even the female disciples found that the appearance of Li Shuangyan totally eclipsed their own, and subconsciously felt ugly in comparison.The person who claimed to be the first genius of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, Leng Shizhi, couldn't keep himself from staring at Li Shuangyan's features; he lost his thoughts for a long time, unable to recover.The Six Elders were surprised because they thought it would just be Li Shuangyan, but Grand Protector Yu He came as well.One had to know that Yu He was a powerful figure even within the Royal Nobles of the Nine Saint Demon Gate. Even the Elders of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect didn't have the qualification to meet Yu He; but this time, he personally came along, and this made the sect feel quite proud.The Six Elders quickly recovered, and brought the Protectors forward to greet him.\"Princess Li and Protector Yu's arrival brings our sect great honor. If our small faction's hospitality has any mistakes, I hope for the princess and grand protector to forgive.\" The First Elder led the pack and greeted them.Seeing this, Li Qiye sighed. The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had really declined. The great Six Elders of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect of Immortal Emperor lineage had to act in such a servile manner, these people were helpless.Way back then, when Min Ren and him were still controlling the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, they never had to bow down to anyone. He sent the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect to sweep the whole Nine Worlds.Virtuous Paragon? Ancient God? Who dared to stop the rise of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, kill without mercy! Heavenly Devils, Blood Race, and even the Charming Spirits blessed by the heavens had to come worship the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Between the nine heavens and ten earths, in the middle of this world, who had the qualification to make the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect subservient?\"Elder Gu and everyone are too kind!\" Li Shuangyan lightly nodded her head and Grand Protector Yu He stepped forward to return the greeting.At this time, Li Shuangyan's bright eyes fell upon Li Qiye. Even though they showed no emotions and were as cold as ice, their attractiveness was still apparent. Li Qiye, however, was still casually standing, calm and comfortable as if there was nothing important enough to warrant his attention.Seeing Li Shuangyan walking away, Yu He and the other disciples from the Nine Saint Demon Gate quickly followed.Numerous disciples held their breaths, their minds were frozen from staring at the beautiful girl ahead. The First Elder was relieved to see this scene. No matter what, Li Qiye had successfully passed the trial of the Nine Saint Demon Gate. Li Shuangyan going towards his direction was a good start.Leng Shizhi was trying to regain his composure and he saw Li Shuangyan coming closer. He was ecstatic. Of course, Li Shuangyan had noticed him \u2013 the first genius of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. So he arched his back and exposed a confident smile to greet Li Shuangyan.Seeing this, many male disciples were jealous and envious, but they had to admit that Leng Shizhi as the first genius of the sect and was the one who was the most entitled to Li Shuangyan's blue eyes.However, Li Shuangyan didn't bother to look towards his direction. She went straight towards Li Qiye, making Leng Shizhi's expression freeze.\"Young Noble Li!\"Li Shuangyan greeted in front of Li Qiye. The two of them, one masterpiece of alluring beauty, and the other was just an ordinary boy; them standing together created a scene that was like the difference between the heavens and earth.Li Qiye just casually nodded, despite Li Shuangyan's peerless beauty. He was not moved by her honoring gesture, he leisurely smiled and said: \"It is best to figure it out completely!\"Of course, these abrupt words could only be understood by a few people here.\"It is my honor to see Young Noble again.\" Yu He also stepped forward and clapped his hands: \"Our majesty has a message for you. He hopes that when you have some leisure time that you would visit our sect as a guest, his majesty will personally greet you.\"\"If the Demon King said so, then I won't be so reserved.\" Li Qiye smiled and then continued: \"Coming to my Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect as a guest, you don't need to be so restrained; if there are any inconveniences, just let Protector Mo or Nan Huairen know.\"\"Young Noble's words, Yu He understand!\" Yu He nodded and greeted Protector Mo and Nan Huairen.This small action caused a shiver in the master and disciple pair because the words from Li Qiye before had changed a lot of things.Although they were on the side of Li Qiye, they have not been given any real benefits. However, with Li Qiye words just now, their status had been elevated greatly.Even the greeting party led by the Elders were using a subservient status to greet a Royal Noble like Yu He. However, with Li Qiye's words, it meant that he placed them in the same position as Yu He, and they could directly communicate with Grand Protector Yu He of the Nine Saint Demon Gate. Protector Mo and Nan Huairen felt like the decision of joining Li Qiye was their wisest choice; their destiny would be changed in a way that others couldn't ever imagine.[1] To get into someone's blue eyes is to get their respect or acceptance.[2] Gongzi is close to Mr. but mostly meant for younger men.

    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Emperor\u2019s DominationEmperor's Domination Chapter 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis scene caused everyone to be stunned, and this included the Six Elders. Although they were the Elders of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, with their cultivation, the best they could do was to be given the title of Named Hero from counties.Yu He was different; with the status of Grand Protector of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, he was an extremely powerful Royal Noble. He could even be granted the title of Enlightened Being.This was why practitioners with lower cultivation levels than Yu He, like the Elders of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, didn't have the qualification to stand side by side with him; because of this, their positions were already lowered by half.The Six Elders respectfully greeted Yu He while the Grand Protector was speaking to Li Qiye with reverence; no one understood the events that were unraveling before their eyes.What was even more incredible was that Yu He also brought a message from the Demon King Lun Ri: if Li Qiye, once again, became a guest at the Nine Saint Demon Gate, Lun Ri would personally greet him.Who was the Demon King Lun Ri? He was the mighty overlord of an entire region; he could walk unrestrained across the world. The Elders of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect could only stare from afar, and someone like Demon King Lun Ri wanted to personally greet Li Qiye? This was an unimaginable matter.As for the other disciples, they were unable to think. At once, the people on the scene were standing frozen in place. However, they were even more shocked at the scene where Li Qiye naturally curved his left arm; Li Shuangyan glared at him for a second, without saying anything. She then, gently, held Li Qiye's arm, and she left with Li Qiye in a submissive manner.\u201cProtector Yu, I don't have time to entertain you.\u201d Before leaving, Li Qiye only left behind one sentence while Yu He was bending his back to say goodbye.No one in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect understood; none of them had any explanations for the things that had just happened. These events were so outside of their own imagination. The disciples, Elders, and Protectors were all petrified, and they could not recover for a long time.While everyone was still flabbergasted, Li Qiye had brought Li Shuangyan back to his ancient peak. Once they stepped inside the small house, where there were only the two of them, Li Shuangyan withdrew her hand from Li Qiye.She angrily narrowed her eyes at Li Qiye, and her cold and arrogant voice rang in the air: \u201cThis time, are you satisfied?\u201dLi Qiye acted as if he didn't see Li Shuangyan's attitude. He comfortably sat in a chair, and he looked at her, slowly saying: \u201cIn front of everyone, do you think by grabbing my hand is akin to granting me a great honor? Satisfying my vanity? No, you are mistaken. This Li Qiye does not need such vain admirations.\u201d\u201cThe fact that I let you borrow my arm is my giving you three parts face\u2026\u201d Li Qiye paused for a second, and his eyes became cold; he then spoke in a serious manner: \u201cI have always hidden the shortcomings of the people by my side, and I have always protected them. Since you wanted to follow me, I gave you face by letting you hold my arm. This is so you could be proud! Strictly speaking, as my sword maid, you don't have the status to hold my hand and walk alongside my shoulder; you need to remember this!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Li Shuangyan was shaken with anger, and her face was deeply flushed with redness. She accepted the order to come to this place, to let go of her royal status; she patiently held the hand of this bastard, and she followed him in the presence of everyone. One could say that she gave him ten parts face. However, now, he dared to say these words. How could she not be angry?\u201cYou have your pride, I can understand.\u201d Li Qiye did not acknowledge her anger, and he continued speaking: \u201cYou were ordered by the Demon King to come here, but, in your heart, you did not want to. You consider yourself to be a talented woman, a beloved daughter of the heavens, and you look at me with great contempt; you believe me to not be worthy of your attention for even a second \u2013 this is normal. However, remember these words, today, I let you hold my arm. This is to give you a good beginning. If you feel victimized by having to follow me, then that is your concern. The decision is yours; however, when comes the day of my sweeping this entire heaven and earth, there will be no place for you by my side!\u201dA thirteen-year-old boy, saying these most confident and arrogant words, even a prince coming from an ancient country would not make such a statement. However, today a thirteen-year-old boy said such dominating words.If others said such a thing, then it would certainly be arrogance and ignorance. However, Li Shuangyan looked at Li Qiye's incomparably calm expression and his tone showed his confidence in saying the most arrogant words in the world. If it was another time, she would have thought of him as being presumptuous, ignorant, and the King of Ye Lang; however, now, she could not see this pattern in his appearance.Of course, Li Shuangyan didn't want to come here voluntarily. Outside of Demon King Lun Ri's command, even the honorable Elder Sword of the Nine Saint Demon Gate thought that following Li Qiye would grant her a promising future; they eventually persuaded her, so that she would come.This matter, for Li Shuangyan, could be considered an incomparable grievance. She was the Nine Saint Demon Gate's successor, and she was the princess of Old Ox country. Whether it be talents or appearance, she was an outstanding phoenix; she was a beloved daughter of the blue heaven.Her male suitors, even if only counting the talented geniuses, were numerous like the carps crossing the river, but she didn't care; however, today, she had to lower herself into becoming a sword maid for a mortal.Her master, Demon King Lun Ri, was an expert with an extremely powerful cultivation with great talents and intelligence; even in the era where the Heaven's Will was fractured, he was able to defy the heavens and become a tyrant in one direction. However, this generation's overlord and her master would value someone that only had a Mortal Physique, Mortal Life Wheel, and Mortal Fate Palace; this made her so perplexed \u2013 without an answer \u2013 after much thought!She wanted to release the anger in her heart, but she didn't know how; she wanted to call Li Qiye ignorant, but the situation did not seem to be this way.In the end, Li Shuangyan couldn't contain herself and angrily said: \u201cGood, you consider yourself to be unparalleled in the world, then prove it to me. If you truly have that sort of ability, then I'll consider those words to be legitimate. Otherwise, you are just daydreaming to satisfy your own ego.\u201dLooking at Li Shuangyan for a moment, Li Qiye slowly raised his voice: \u201cProof? I have nothing to prove!\u201dLi Shuangyan angrily shivered at Li Qiye's arrogant attitude. He was only thirteen years old, obviously younger than her, but his words were incomparably domineering; it was as if he was the supreme emperor for an entire generation. This thirteen-year-old boy had gone mad to say such words in such an indifferent and bored manner.\u201cI have a magical formation; if you can just say a few mysterious truths regarding it, not to mention you being able to solve this formation successfully or not, then you do have some ability!\u201d Finished speaking, Li Shuangyan took out an ancient beast fur \u2013 its origin was unknown. It was a myriad of curved symbols, Dao runes, stars, and formations of dots. This little beast fur, seemingly, contained all of the stars in the universe; it was as if it held all the profound mysteries of the heaven and earth.If one took a careful look, their spirit would be sucked out instantly with the feeling that they had suddenly entered a mysterious world. No matter how marvelous and supreme one's talent was, they wouldn't be able to control themselves. They would be captivated by the mysterious truths of the beast fur, and eventually, fall enamored to the magical formation, unable to escape from the inside.Li Qiye looked at this old fur; it was too familiar. In the blink of an eye, a corner of the magical formation clearly appeared in his head. This was one part of the memories regarding the complete magical formation hidden in the mind of Li Qiye, and that was the magical formation on the ancient beast fur.This little corner of the magical formation was simply too profound. Regarding the complete formation, Li Qiye was too lazy to remember the whole memory because no one else knew more than him.\u201cThis is only a corner of a broken formation. Listen carefully, now: Starting from Kui Xing constellation, go towards the Nine Entrances, avoid the Eight Full Moons, turn into Nine Stars, switch to the Milky Way, and then return to the Dao\u2026\u201d Li Qiye calmly spoke while pointing with his fingers: \u201cThis will be the center of the broken formation; it is carefully protected by six Beasts and four Immortals, together. From the past until now, the people who could successfully break through this formation could be counted on one's fingers.\"Li Qiye eloquently spoke without pause; it was as if he had them memorized. Each word, from his mouth, made it sound like it was not a masterpiece magic formation, but merely a trivial technique.However, Li Shuangyan was shocked completely. She knew the heaven-shattering secret of this broken magic formation. Even her patriarch, an ancestor of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, was only lucky enough to have this little ancient beast fur. This corner of the broken magic formation, alone, was enough for the many geniuses and Virtuous Paragons of the Nine Saint Demon Gate to research through several generations; in the end, they were able to completely understand the profound truths behind this broken formation.Despite understanding the theory, they could not actually recreate this magical formation for practical usage. Seeing Li Shuangyan's talent for magical formations, Demon King Lun Ri passed the formation to her, full of optimism, since she might be able to, one day, understand this formation even further; this, too, could be a boost to her training. Half of her current cultivation was also related to this magical formation.From a young age, Li Shuangyan had already started studying this formation, but it took ten years for her to understand it. This was under the guidance from the knowledge left behind by the Virtuous Paragons. Otherwise, someone else, without such good circumstances, would waste an unknown amount of time.Li Shuangyan's dream was that one day, she could create this formation; even though it was only a broken corner, it would still be able to kill Gods and Immortals; however, she knew, with her current cultivation and luck, this dream was impossible.This trip to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, Demon King Lun Ri also wanted her to bring along the ancient beast fur and wait for the right opportunity to ask Li Qiye to see if he knew anything about it or to hear his thoughts regarding it.Li Shuangyan would never, even in her wildest of dreams, think that Li Qiye would be able to, with a single glance, eloquently describe this broken formation that was considered peerless in the world.[1] King of Ye Lang is an expression of calling someone ignorant and arrogant. The original raw has another idiom for arrogance + ignorance so it sounds more poetic than this version.[2] Kui Xing = one of the twenty-eight mansions.

    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Emperor\u2019s DominationEmperor's Domination Chapter 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Shuangyan had a suspicion that Li Qiye had seen the ancient formation somewhere else previously; however, she quickly dismissed this idea because the Nine Saint Demon Gate had to pay a great price in order to obtain this single copy of the broken formation that the Formation Progenitor had left behind. It could be said that, besides the Formation Progenitor who had died in the ancient era, only their Nine Saint Demon Gate knew about the existence of this broken formation.But now, Li Qiye, with a single glance, had been able to recite information regarding the broken formation as if it was something insignificant, and was nothing more than a lesson on memorization.This made Li Shuangyan frightened into being speechless for a long time; she had spent ten years of research, along with the guidance of many generations of great sages from the Nine Saint Demon Gate, yet all of this was only equal to a few words that were hastily spoken by him? Such an event greatly damaged her confidence.Even the most heavenly talents weren't able to understand the formation with just one glance, but Li Qiye had done just that. Li Qiye's words alone could have defeated all of these geniuses. The worst part was, Li Qiye wasn't a genius!Li Shuangyan didn't know that Li Qiye had already seen the complete formation in its entirety during the ancient times, and that was why, upon seeing the ancient beast fur, his memories of the formation had resurfaced.\u201cCome here.\u201d At this point, Li Qiye leisurely beckoned for Li Shuangyan to come closer.Because Li Shuangyan still hadn't recovered from her shock, she subconsciously came closer to Li Qiye. She didn't even know why she did it.\u201cPow, pow, pow!\u201d Li Shuangyan was still in a daze, so Li Qiye grabbed her, placed her over his lap, laid her down, and without any mercy for beauties, swung his big hand onto her butt several times; he caused it to numbingly burned.\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d Li Shuangyan was like a cat that had its tail stepped on, as she jumped to her feet, and loudly yelled. Her face blushed red, and she angrily glared at Li Qiye.As for Li Qiye, he just patted his palms in a comfortable manner, like it was a trivial thing to do, before slowly saying: \u201cAs my maid, you need to be aware of your situation. I can forgive the people around me, and favor the people around me; this includes you, even if you're only a maid. However, you have to remember, never provoke me! Don't think that just because you're heaven's favorite daughter that you can flip over the earth!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Li Shuangyan seethed with anger. She was the favorite daughter of the heavens and the princess of the Old Ox Country. In the past, until now, she'd always been in a high position, and no one had dared to be disrespectful towards her. However, today, a small man had mercilessly spanked her on the bottom; this sort of shameful thing truly made her tremble.\u201cGo, find a place in which to live by yourself.\u201d Li Qiye motioned with his sleeve to imply the departure of the guest, ignoring Li Shuangyan's feelings.\u201cYou\u2026 Little man! You\u2026! You better remember this!\u201d In the end, without knowing how to vent her anger, she enunciated each word clearly. She had always been superior, looking down below from her high position, and countless talented young men wanted to win her favor. However, today, Li Qiye said a few hateful sentences, and he then told her to leave; he didn't even arrange her a place to stay. This really infuriated her!Li Shuangyan left with her arms waving angrily in the air; her royal highness, at the age of eighteen, was provoked by a thirteen-year-old boy to the point of wanting to vomit blood. Even she couldn't believe it.\u201cDo not try to practice the 'Immortal Emperor Slaughtering Formation' any longer.\u201d At this point, Li Qiye's calm voice echoed from behind: \u201cThe formation on your hand is simply a small corner of the Immortal Emperor Slaughtering Formation. If you force yourself to cultivate it, one day, you will be ruined by this formation. Even the ones that knew about it since the ancient era long ago didn't dare to cultivate it on a simple whim; let alone you. If you truly want to repair this array, once your cultivation has matured, I will think about teaching you a thing or two.\u201dBased on the cultivation and talent of Li Shuangyan, most people normally didn't get the chance to ask her for guidance, and now a little man like Li Qiye wanted to guide her?However, the four words \u201cImmortal Emperor Slaughtering Formation\u201d made her stop in her tracks. This formation was a legend left behind by many generations. Most people didn't believe in its existence, but Li Qiye was talking about it like he had it grasped in the palm of his hand.Even though she was curious, her anger had not subsided; nor her pride. Thus, she only scowled angrily, and she ignored Li Qiye. Then, she continued leaving.Li Qiye didn't care whether Li Shuangyan was in a good mood or not; he simply sat in his chair in silence. Immortal Emperor Slaughtering Formation! How many years had passed? His lost memories suddenly resurfaced once he saw the corner of this broken formation.In the warring era, against the Ancient Ming, how many people died in this formidable formation? How much of a price did he have to pay to build this formation?This eternally invincible ancient formation; a formation that, once completed, would be bathed in the blood of many masters. Many immortal sages and himself spent their blood and sweat to create this formation.In the devastating war against the Ancient Ming, for the Mortal World and all of the Human race, numerous masters had died in this formation. He controlled the grand formation, side by side with his brothers, generals, and comrades, to fight a heaven-shattering battle; blood painted the sky.He did not remember how many people had died on the battlefield, nor how many peerless masters that followed him had been sacrificed. He only remembered his pain, in silence, after the battle.Time could erase everything, and time could heal all wounds; however, some memories could not be forgotten even through the passing of time because they are imprinted in the deepest part of the soul, never to be forgotten.Li Qiye sighed, and he regained his composure. He did not allow himself to drown in emotions and indulge in the sentimental past. The past had passed, and the present was worth living. In this life, he would have the chance to traverse the Nine Worlds and personally repay some old scores; not only for himself, but for the people that had sacrificed themselves for him as well.Li Shuangyan's visit to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was an important event; not only did it make the young male disciples sleepless, but it also made the upper echelon excited.Only Li Qiye acted like nothing major had happened. He didn't care whether Li Shuangyan was going to leave or stay; if she was willing to pledge allegiance to him, then, in the future, he would reserve a spot for her next to him. If not, then so be it. He would not be missing capable assistants. Even without her, he could find a substitute; it was this simple!This night, Li Shuangyan was with a stomach filled with angry steam. She ground her teeth silently cursed Li Qiye. She didn't stay in Li Qiye's small mansion, and she also didn't leave this place; however, she chose to create a small treasure building down from the corner of Li Qiye's peak, and she entered inside. Although she did not live with Li Qiye, she also didn't leave his peak.With the arrival of Li Shuangyan and Yu He, the biggest harvest was gained by Protector Mo and Nan Huairen because they were in charge of the entire trip for Yu He and his people at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.This was no minor event because they could work alongside a Royal Noble like Yu He; they could ask him many questions about cultivation and his experience \u2013 this was a big benefit. The most essential thing was still Li Qiye's words that allowed for Protector Mo's and Nan Huairen's positions to elevate greatly within the sect.Yu He obeyed Li Qiye's order, and he left everything for Protector Mo and Nan Huairen to decide. They became the special envoys between the two sects.One has to remember that before disciples, and even the Six Elders of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect wouldn't necessarily be able to meet Grand Protector Yu He. However, now, simple organizers like Nan Huairen and Protector Mo could directly meet with Yu He to discuss events; this meant that the relationship between the two sects had become more intimate.The improved status of Nan Huairen and Protector Mo; this left many Protectors, Sectional Leaders, the third generation disciples, and even the second generation envious.Despite all of the commotion, Li Qiye did not care. The most important thing to him right now was to refine his Dao foundation, not allowing any room for mistakes, and carefully cultivate towards flawless perfection. Once there was a mistake, this small mistake would be a fatal danger on the road of cultivation; especially when he faces the time of Life Reduction and the Fate Calamity. As long as his base was solid, with a strong Dao foundation, then in the future, he could go farther; he could exceed the apex.Many geniuses wanted to rush their cultivation ranking and they neglected their refinement of the Dao foundation; rushing for success caused the Dao foundation to have defects. In the end, they died in regrets during the moments of Life Reduction and the Fate Calamity.This was why Li Qiye's expectation for himself was very high. Even though the peerless Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law could increase his cultivation speed, he still limited its effect for a solid foundation. If he stopped his own suppression, then he could easily break through into the Inner Longevity rank.Li Shuangyan had stayed at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect for seven days. Time had passed without any incidents, but this morning, Nan Huairen visited Li Qiye's peak along with a middle-aged man.\u201cSenior, this person is Sectional Leader Zhou, an instructor at Cleansing Jade Peak.\u201d Nan Huairen immediately introduced the man to Li Qiye.His senior only glanced at Sectional Leader Zhou once, and he nodded his head: \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201dLi Qiye's attitude was arrogant in the eyes of Sectional Leader Zhou, and his heart was uncomfortable. He coldly scowled, but he didn't say another sentence.Nan Huairen quickly replied: \u201cThe Elder has decided that senior will temporarily replace Sectional Leader Zhou as the instructor of Cleansing Jade Peak. Today, Sectional Leader Zhou brought along a list of disciples of the Cleansing Jade Peak, as well as detailed information regarding them. The Elders hoped that senior would accept this decision.\u201dSectional Leader Zhou was just silently listening. He, a Sectional Leader, was meeting Li Qiye, but Li Qiye didn't show him any respect. He left the roster behind, and he then turned away without leaving any words or reminders behind.[1] Life Reduction is when the Life Wheel weakens, Fate Calamity is a fated time of calamity.[2] Reminder: Palace Foundation, Palace Expansion, Physique Accumulation, Provision Palace, Inner Longevity, Heaven's Mandate, Warrior Canopy, Purified Rebirth, Heaven's Primal.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Tell me your opinions.\u201d Li Qiye lightly waved his hand. He didn't care for the smooth words of his junior. Nan Huairen's nature had been solidified; it couldn't be changed even if he wanted to.Nan Huairen quickly said: \u201cI heard one piece of news: The First Elder wanted you to teach the disciples how to cultivate at the Strange Gem Peak, but the second elder has been advocating for you to teach at the Cleansing Jade Peak\u2026\u201d\u201cKeep going with your conjectures so I can listen to them!\u201d Li Qiye casually smiled; he had already understood the essential factors behind this event.Nan Huairen was no longer flippant; he continued explaining his thoughts in a serious manner: \u201cThe second elder has great influence at the Cleansing Jade Peak because senior Leng Shizhi also studied there. Although Leng Shizhi was only a third generation disciple, with his cultivation, he had already been equal in status to the sectional leader uncles.\u201d Here, Nan Huairen looked up to see Li Qiye's expression because he knew; when it comes to strategy and tricks, this senior was the most frightening person.\u201cHow did the other Elders react?\u201d Li Qiye smiled.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Nan Huairen pondered for a moment. Even though he was gifted at reading people, but, as a third generation disciple, there were many things that he was not privy to.\u201cIt is very simple! We just need to see whether the First Elder still wants to compete for the Sect Master position, then, we can make an accurate conjecture.\u201d At this moment, Tu Buyu arrived; he spoke while he walked forward. Even though he was more than one thousand years old, his body was as vigorous as a young man; his face always had a kind smile.\u201cKeep going, I'm listening.\u201d Li Qiye did not mind the presence of Tu Buyu joining the conversation; thus, he commanded him to go on.Tu Buyu smilingly said: \u201cSenior, no one in our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect has more influence than the First Elder. He is a serious man, administrates fairly, and, on top of that, he was also the eldest disciple of the previous Sect Master. One could say that he has the biggest opportunity to become the Sect Master of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201d\u201cOur master isn't the eldest disciple of the previous Sect Master?\u201d Li Qiye was a little surprised to hear Tu Buyu's response. He had thought that, because Su Yonghuang was the eldest disciple from the last Sect Master, that was why she became the new Sect Master.Tu Buyu shook his head and smilingly answered: \u201cMaster's situation is a bit special unlike the First Elder. Within the first generation of disciples, the First Elder was the most likely successor; in fact, amongst the Six Elders, only the second elder had competed for the Sect Master's seat. The other four, in theory, had always supported the First Elder.\u201d\u201cThen what does the First Elder think about this situation?\u201d Li Qiye stroked his chin, and he asked.Tu Buyu quickly replied: \u201cEveryone knows about how Cao Xiong yearns for the Sect Master's seat, but no one knows what the First Elder is thinking. Even though the other four Elders support him, fervently, he still hadn't shown a decisive attitude. I'm afraid that, in recent years, the other four Elders stance have been shaken because of this.\u201dLi Qiye looked at Tu Buyu and teasingly said: \u201cMaster has been outside for many years, and younger brother seldom returns to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; however, it seems like you are still pretty well-informed on things.\u201dIt made one think about why Su Yonghuang still grasped the exact situation of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect even though she wasn't here. Li Qiye was a bit curious, but he didn't care for the First Elder's attitude, let alone Su Yonghuang's or even Cao Xiong's. Since he had made up his mind about reviving the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, no one could stop him; not even his master-in-name, Su Yonghuang.\u201cSenior, please stop joking. As a disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, this is our home, so of course we have to pay attention to our home's current situation.\u201d Tu Buyu graciously smiled; his words were humbling.Since Tu Buyu had started speaking, Nan Huairen had been silently listening. A monster living for more than one thousand years more than possessed the necessary qualifications to discuss the situation of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.He was definitely an old fox! Li Qiye silently cursed in his mind, and he then calmly smiled: \u201cSince younger brother is back, then you should know about master's attitude more than anyone, eh.\u201dIf this second disciple was a smart person, then Li Qiye wouldn't waste time talking in circles; he would directly ask about the main point.Tu Buyu's expression was still the same, and he smilingly said: \u201cSenior is the Prime Disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, and you represent our future glory; whatever senior does or says, master will not interfere.\u201dNot bad. Such mastery at pushing and pulling; as expected from a one thousand year old fox. Li Qiye was impressed with the sly conducts of Tu Buyu. If the disciple was like this, then what would the master, Su Yonghuang, be like?Li Qiye only smiled after he finished speaking. Right now, he didn't want to cause a commotion in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; once his cultivation reached an acceptable height, he would take action and deal with everything.Leaving Tu Buyu to the side, Li Qiye directly commanded Nan Huairen: \u201cHuairen, go bring all the information regarding the merit laws that are currently being practiced by the disciples at the Cleansing Jade Peak to my place; I want to see what they are playing with.\u201dNan Huairen quickly affirmed and turned around to take care of it without neglect.However, before Nan Huairen had returned, Li Qiye was invited to meet the First Elder via his disciple.The Cleaning Ancient Incense Sect used to have over one thousand primary peaks; however, right now, there were only seventy-three peaks, and even these seventy-three were withering; the natural world energy within them had slowly been depleted.As the First Elder, Elder Gu was qualified to own the tallest peak containing the highest amount of natural world energy in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.As a third generation disciple like Li Qiye, being invited to a private conversation with the First Elder would be considered a tremendous honor in the eyes of the other young disciples.Li Qiye comfortably sat in the hall, facing the First Elder, without any worries or nervousness.The two of them stared at each other for a long, yet, as they examined each other's attitude, no one was willing to make the first move.Eventually, the First Elder couldn't wait any longer; he sighed and opened his mouth: \u201cLi Qiye, this seat does not understand you. If others say that you are from the Nine Saint Demon Gate, then you are too irrationally arrogant.\u201dThe First Elder was quite blatant with his words; then, he too might as well open the sky for a truly clear and direct conversation. Li Qiye smiled indifferently and said: \u201cWhat is the First Elder's implication? That I am a spy from the Nine Saint Demon Gate?\u201d\u201cThis isn't something that can be confirmed or denied on my own.\u201d The First Elder wittily responded.Li Qiye smiled after hearing these words; this answer was not outside the realm of his expectation. He stared at the First Elder for a moment, he then inquired: \u201cHow others look at it doesn't matter. The most essential thing, here, is your opinion. What does the First Elder think about my teaching of the Dao at the Cleansing Jade Peak?\u201dThe First Elder stood up and went to a window. He silently stood there, without saying a word, akin to a statue. After a while, he turned around, stared at Li Qiye, and then said: \u201cI, alone, cannot administrate everything in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, especially during this time.\u201d\u201cIt seems like the four Elders attitudes has been shaken!\u201d Li Qiye smiled and thought about the words of Tu Buyu. He understood the thoughts of the First Elder. Although the four Elders had always supported Elder Gu, a long period of time could whither or shake their attitudes; Cao Xiong's ambition for the Sect Master's seat had been apparent for a long time. It would be strange if they didn't reconsider their attitudes.\u201cI was born and raised in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, and my master was my benefactor; his kindness, to me, was as heavy as a mountain.\u201d The First Elder's tone became heavy and continued: \u201cI do not want to see the day where the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect suffers a great calamity befallen from the heavens.\u201dLi Qiye was silently listening. A moment later, the voice of the First Elder rang again: \u201cOur enemy isn't the people in our sect; they are from external forces such as the Heavenly God Sect.\u201d\u201cElder, please guide me through this maze.\u201d Li Qiye nodded, accompanied by a rare serious attitude, and he inquired.The First Elder sat down, gently sighed, and then he said: \u201cThirty thousand years ago, our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect fought a battle with the Heavenly God Sect. We suffered a crushing defeat in our national capital, and we had to run back to the sect's territory, losing complete control of the kingdom. Thirty thousand years ago, till now, all of our great predecessors from the older generations had met their origins; our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's decline was inevitable and irrevocable. Although we had fallen, we still possess certain things that the Heavenly God Sect coveted. The Heavenly God Sect has not made any moves; it is because they still have some reservations. If one day, the Heavenly God Sect finds out that we do not have any hidden aces, that would be the day of our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's demise!\u201dThe war between the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the Heavenly God Sect \u2013 Nan Huairen had talked about this before. In reality, when Li Qiye was still the Dark Crow, he knew some information regarding the Heavenly God Sect; however, his disposition at the time was not ideal. Thus, he naturally did not bother with such trivial matters![1] The first raw sentence is using Tai Chi's ideologies to describe someone dodging a question completely.[2] Certain people in powerful positions refer to themselves as \u201cthis seat\u201d.[3] Li Qiye here used a respectful idiom to ask the Elder to elaborate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As long as you are able to marry Princess Li, regardless of what happens, I will support you!\u201d\u201cElder, are you are not afraid of bringing the wolf to chase the tiger? Then being eaten by the wolf in the end?\u201d Li Qiye smilingly said.The First Elder bitterly smiled, gently shook his head, and he replied: \u201cThere are some things, that aren't up to a little character like me to control.\u201dAt this point, he deeply stared at Li Qiye, and he said: \u201cThis is why I will bet on you! Hoping that it will be a miracle!\u201dHere, the First Elder's demeanor became strange; he looked at Li Qiye, and he said: \u201cUntil now, many people had wanted to take the Cleansing Incense Ancient Order from Old Devil, yet no one had succeeded! However, Old Devil is willing to give the Cleansing Incense Ancient Order to you!\u201dSpeaking of Old Devil and the matter of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Order, Li Qiye couldn't help but smirk. However, he did not say more about it; there were secrets behind this event that other people naturally couldn't see through it.Staring at the First Elder, Li Qiye smiled: \u201cElder is betting money on me, why not bet it on the Sect Master? I heard Sect Master was appointed by the previous Sect Master to be the successor.\u201dRegarding this problem, the First Elder closed his mouth and remained silent. The First Elder's attitude piqued Li Qiye's interest; Su Yonghuang, the current Sect Master of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, was what type of person in the end? What was the secret in this matter?\u201cThis time, I proposed for you to be a dao instructor; I am hoping that you could earn some merit points and eventually be able to join the upper echelon's meeting in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201dThe First Elder didn't speak about the matter of the Sect Master, Su Yonghuang. He instead switched to a different subject.Li Qiye smiled, and he said: \u201cElder hopes that I can have great contributions so that I could join the upper echelons. Eventually, I would become a Protector or an Elder, so that I would be more worthy to be with the Nine Saint Demon Gate's successor; the princess of the Old Ox Country.\u201dLi Qiye easily pointed out the intricacies, and this made the First Elder stunned for a moment. In reality, since the beginning, he was not optimistic about Li Qiye; however, Li Qiye mysteriously passed the Nine Saint Demon Gate's trials, and this caused the Six Elders to suspect that he was a spy from the Nine Saint Demon Gate.However, since Li Shuangyan's arrival and the attitude of Yu He, the First Elder couldn't help but contemplate this situation. If one was to say that Li Qiye was a spy from the Nine Saint Demon Gate, then his method would be too arrogant and too obvious! The most important thing, however, was that Yu He's attitude did not seem like it was an act!This made the First Elder rethink; if Li Qiye truly wanted the Emperor merit laws or Immortal Emperor True Treasures of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, with the Cleansing Incense Ancient Order, he simply didn't need to be a spy! This Order was given to him willingly by Old Devil; if Li Qiye had used this Order to demand an Emperor merit law or an Immortal Emperor True Treasure, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect wouldn't have an alternative unless they wanted to disobey the teachings of their ancestors!In reality, whether the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect still had Immortal Emperor True Treasures or not, as well as its Emperor merit laws, the First Elder knew best in his heart!\u201cWithin the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, I am considered the oldest person. Unfortunately, my talents are limited, and I had no way to stop our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's irreparable decline.\u201d The First Elder looked at Li Qiye, and he said: \u201cI don't believe in miracles; however, I hope that you are a miracle, or that the Patriarch was not willing for the high heavens to destroy my Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. I am not hoping for you to revive the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, but I hope that you could use your good relations with the Nine Saint Demon Gate to protect the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!\u201dLi Qiye couldn't help but laughed a little, and he said: \u201cThe First Elder values me so greatly, this truly makes me scared from receiving too much affection.\u201dOf course, the First Elder didn't believe Li Qiye; he simply didn't appear like he was scared from receiving too much affection, but this wasn't important.Li Qiye smiled, and he said: \u201cThe First Elder places all of his betting money on me and not the Sect Master; why is this the case? This truly leaves me curious.\u201dIt was obvious that Elder Ge being the First Elder was very reluctant to mention the Sect Master Su Yonghuang, but in the end, he looked at Li Qiye and deepened his voice: \u201cLi Qiye, if one was to say that your identity is not clear, then, the identity of the Sect Master is not one that I am willing to see!\u201dIt was but one short sentence from the First Elder, yet it contained many hidden implications! Su Yonghuang was the current Sect Master and was also his master's appointed successor; why was it that the First Elder was so unwelcoming of Su Yonghuang?\u201cCurrently, for our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, whomever sits on the Sect Master's seat is no longer important. We are about to be chased from our home, so why is there the need to dispute for the Sect Master's position?\u201d The First Elder clearly didn't want to elaborate much on Su Yonghuang, so he said in a serious manner: \u201cHowever, I do not wish for the second elder to be the Sect Master!\u201dThe First Elder suddenly told him this; thus, raising Li Qiye's interest. These words, if it wasn't a close confidant, would not easily be said; however, the First Elder told him this.\u201cSecond Elder isn't bad; I heard the Second Elder, when he was young, his aptitude wasn't bad. Within the Elders, his cultivation is only below yours.\u201d Li Qiye leisurely said.\u201cIf Cao Xiong\u2026If he was persistent with his own principles.\u201d The First Elder paused for a second, and he then finally spoke: \u201cHim being the Sect Master isn't a big deal! However, he reached out to Dong Shenglong! This is akin to pushing our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect down into an abyss of destruction; he, because of his thirst for power, had lost his reasoning!\u201d\u201cDong Shenglong?\u201d Li Qiye was slightly surprised, and he asked: \u201cThe guest advisor of our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect?\u201dRegarding this topic, Nan Huairen had mentioned it before; Li Qiye still had some impression.The First Elder stared at Li Qiye, and he then seriously said: \u201cAs the Prime Disciple, hopefully, you will take up the responsibility of shouldering the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. This matter, I can tell you. That year, when Dong Shenglong became our guest advisor, this was not my will! However, this came from the will of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom; I didn't have a choice!\u201d\u201cStrictly speaking, Dong Shenglong did not come from the Heavenly God Sect, but he is a Royal Noble bestowed by the Heavenly God Sect!\u201d The First Elder deepened his tone: \u201cFor the other matters, I don't need to say more.\u201dThe First Elder finished speaking here. Li Qiye was clear on the reason; he smiled, looked at the First Elder, and, in the end, he said: \u201cThe First Elder wants to borrow my hand to eliminate Dong Shenglong?\u201d\u201cI know that, with your cultivation, you can't eliminate Dong Shenglong.\u201d The First Elder was silent for a long time, then finally made his decision, looked at Li Qiye, and he said: \u201cHowever, Yu He can; you can borrow Yu He's hand to remove him!\u201d\u201cElder, this is a dangerous matter.\u201d Li Qiye laughed because he knew what the First Elder was thinking.The First Elder contemplated for a while; in the end, he sighed heavily, and he then said: \u201cBringing in the wolf to chase the lion, I know! However, in terms of the level of danger, the Heavenly God Sect is much higher than the Nine Saint Demon Gate. Thirty thousand years ago, our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect fought with the Heavenly God Sect once; we lost our Kingdom, and the Heavenly God Sect used our old territory to form the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom. Although the Heavenly God Sect didn't kill to the very last person, that was only because they had certain reservations. In this country, one of these days, the Heavenly God Sect will not tolerate our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect anymore. The Nine Saint Demon Gate rules the Old Ox country. If they want to destroy us, it is not an impossible thing; however, they definitely have to declare war on the Heavenly God Sect!\u201dComparing the two, no doubt, the First Elder made a choice, and he wanted to use the Nine Saint Demon Gate against the Heavenly God Sect!Li Qiye smiled, and he finally said in a leisurely way: \u201cElder's thoughts, I understand. These are not the important things to me right now. The more pressing matter is the Physique paste. You Elders had promised, before, to reward me a piece of King Physique paste; I'm wondering when the sect will be able to accomplish this?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d With Li Qiye suddenly bringing this matter up, the First Elder was stunned for a moment.Li Qiye continued: \u201cElder, my Physique paste; the leading beast marrow, I want it to be the beast marrow of a Hell Iron Bull. Do you have any objections to this?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 this will require some time.\u201d The First Elder was embarrassed, and he hollowly laughed.Li Qiye stared at the First Elder, and he seriously said: \u201cElder is regretting this, ah?\u201d\u201cLi Qiye, what the sect promised for you will not change!\u201d The First Elder immediately raised his voice: \u201cHowever, you want the beast marrow of a Hell Iron Bull. You should be aware, that, with our current power, taking the bones of a one hundred thousand year beast, not an easy matter! Our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, does indeed, have a King Physique paste; however, the beast marrow isn't from a Hell Iron Bull!\u201d\u201cI require the beast marrow of a Hell Iron Bull!\u201d Li Qiye coldly said.The First Elder took a deep breath, stared intently at Li Qiye, and then said: \u201cThe beast marrow of a Hell Iron Bull, I can give to you. I will convince the other Elders but, the condition is that you must marry Princess Li!\u201dLooking at the First Elder, Li Qiye couldn't help but exhale a long sigh. Finally, he stood up, and he calmly said: \u201cElder, my woman, I can control; a princess is fine, a Saintess is fine \u2013 this isn't an issue. As for the matter that you are worried about, I can give you one sentence: In my hands, whoever wants to destroy the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, I will slaughter them all! Also, I will add another sentence for the First Elder; whoever tries to stop my pace of reviving the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, whoever tries to stop my steps, kill without mercy! Gods and Devils are no exceptions!\u201dAfter he had finished speaking, he turned around and left.The First Elder was suddenly stunned on the exact spot; a thirteen-year-old boy just said those arrogant words, but, at this moment, he didn't think that Li Qiye was arrogantly ignorant. In this midst of everything, he completely couldn't see through Li Qiye, and he didn't know where his confidence was coming from; a thirteen-year-old boy\u2026 What means did he possess to say such big words?Eventually, the First Elder gently sighed. Since in all these years, he had carefully held the administration of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, he knew, that, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's decline was irreparable, but, he still wanted a miracle to happen!Maybe, Li Qiye's arrival was a miracle!Whether he believed it or not, currently, he still has to gamble on this! Because he was running out of time, the other four Elders, regarding his not wanting to be the Sect Master, had become dissatisfied. If this continued, without the support of the other four Elders, the overall situation of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect will worsen![1] The raw idiom is \u201cCleans ears carefully listening\u201d, another respectful idiom.[2] Another four words idiom: Receive Favor Becomes Frightened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Once the master and disciple had arrived, Li Qiye asked: \u201cWhat is the Sect Master's origin, in the end?\u201dThis matter interested Li Qiye. This First Elder truly wasn't one to be jealous of talents. On top of that, he also didn't have the ambition for the Sect Master's position. Why was it that he was so unwelcoming for Su Yonghuang?The master and disciple looked at each other. Nan Huairen knew even less; he shook his head, and he said: \u201cThis matter\u2026 This matter, I do not know. Before I had joined the sect, Sect Master was already the Sect Master. I can only count the times I've met the Sect Master with my ten fingers.\u201dLi Qiye turned to Protector Mo; Protector Mo, too, gently shook his head, and he said: \u201cThe origin of the Sect Master, I am not certain. In reality, within our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, very few people know the true origin of the Sect Master. One could say that the Sect Master suddenly appeared overnight.\u201d\u201cSuddenly appeared overnight? A person who suddenly appeared overnight became the Sect Master?\u201d Li Qiye, hearing this statement, couldn't help but become puzzled.Protector Mo pondered for a moment, wanting to think carefully, and he said: \u201cWhen the former Sect Master was still in this world, I heard the Supreme Elder still hadn't met his origin. I don't know the exact details, but, during that time, I heard that within the span of one night, the former Sect Master only called for Elder Ge. The Sect Master first appeared. Then, one could speculate that, in this moment, the previous Sect Master and the Supreme Elder, before meeting their origins, entrusted Elder Ge to help the Sect Master take charge of the Cleansing Ancient Incense Sect.\u201dAfter hearing the words of Protector Mo, Li Qiye felt that it was outside of his expectation. He had thought that his master, Su Yonghuang, was always a disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; it seemed, now, that this was not the case.\u201cAre you saying that this master of mine was a person that the previous Sect Master and the Supreme Elder secretly groomed?\" Li Qiye inquired.Protector Mo shook his head: \u201cWe do not know the specific circumstances. We only know that, after Elder Ge was summoned, a new Sect Master was announced. In reality, at that time, not only Cao Xiong, but even the other four Elders were strongly opposed to it; however, I heard that the First Elder did a lot to persuade the other four Elders. Afterward, the First Elder personally took action to suppress some disciples, certain high ranking Protectors, and sectional leaders in the opposition party\u2026\u201cAt that point, the previous Sect Master was still there. The Supreme Elder hadn't met his origin, Elder Ge had the support of the previous Sect Master and the Supreme Elder. Elder Ge's status, in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, had always been high. In reality, most people, then, would have assumed that Elder Ge would accept the Sect Master's position, but suddenly, a new Sect Master appeared; it was outside of everyone's expectations. However, even Elder Ge, himself, supported the new Sect Master and he didn't try to compete for it. In the end, the other four Elders also agreed with this decision.\u201dProtector Mo paused at this point and turned silent for a moment.\u201cThe new Sect Master was not well-received\u2026\u201d Li Qiye could imagine the scene, then; suddenly, a new Sect Master appeared, and even with the support of the previous Sect Master and the Supreme Elder \u2013 along with Elder Ge's suppression \u2013 still was afraid that the hearts of the people of Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect were not happy.Protector Mo gently nodded, and he said: \u201cSect Master was in her new position for a short time; she then took a small group of disciples, became the overseer of the Desolate Wasteland, and she rarely returned. Sect Master had never returned to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect with the exception of the time the previous Sect Master and the Supreme Elder met their origins.\u201dLi Qiye couldn't help but stroke his chin; the whole thing made him feel confused. What was the Sect Master's origin, in the end?Eventually, Protector Mo whispered: \u201cIn terms of truly understanding the Sect Master, I'm afraid that, outside of Tu Bu Yu, there is no one else.\u201dLi Qiye smiled, and he then shook his head. Tu Bu Yu speaking on this, that would truly be strange. Clearly, Tu Bu Yu was a trusted confidant of the Sect Master, Su Yonghuang. Otherwise, he wouldn't be sent back here.Regarding Sect Master Su Yonghuang's origin, Protector Mo couldn't explain why, so Li Qiye also stopped asking. He slowly cultivated, and he thought about how to instruct the Dao to the Cleansing Jade Peak's martial hall.If one was to discuss teaching conducts, then no one was more fitting to be an instructor than Li Qiye. He rose and he fell through innumerable moons, and he improved himself over millions of years. What type of person had he not seen? He had met many ambitious overlords, and he suppressed countless outstanding emperors.Not to mention that Immortal Emperor Min Ren was groomed by his own hands. Even the Black Dragon King and three generations of Immortal Emperors, as well as many peerless supremes \u2013 all rose from his teaching.Teaching a group of feather-haired youngsters, for Li Qiye, was a matter as easy as turning his palm. However, with this matter, Li Qiye was seriously contemplating.The reason was simple: every time a person was flung from his hands, not one of them were weak. He didn't want the life that he had finally obtained, with his body, with his own hands, to ruin his reputation.Regarding cultivation, Li Qiye had many profound insights. In Li Qiye's eyes, talents weren't important, Physiques weren't important, and even merit laws weren't important.The most important thing\u2026 was to have an unshakable Dao willpower; a willpower that thirsts for knowledge! A willpower that understands that the truth of all rivers flow into the same sea! A willpower that was diligent and assiduous! This was the most important thing!For insufficient talents, hard work would suffice as long as the mind was willing; for insufficient talents, others take one day to awaken, and you take one hundred days to awaken. There would always be a fruitful harvest. With a Dao willpower that could accept that all rivers lead into the sea, one could see the entirety of the eight directions and not be blinded by their own shortsightedness!Insufficient merit laws? Just be thirsty for knowledge! Even if it was a common merit law, as long as one was tirelessly diligent, one of these days, one could take this common merit law to the apex of its cultivation; they could traverse an entirely new heaven and earth with it!Since the ancient times, countless supremes, from their common merit laws, had created a new heaven and earth, became enlightened with their own Dao merit law that belonged to just them, and walked on the road of Dao that only belonged to them!Dao willpower, this was the foundation of cultivation! Countless eons, countless kingdoms, countless holy churches groomed many geniuses, but, in the end, only a few became Immortal Emperors; there weren't many.Li Qiye carefully read through the short introductions for the three hundred students at the Cleansing Jade Peak and their current cultivating circumstances. He had memorized them all, and, at the same time, he also carefully read the merit laws of the martial hall.In reality, the three hundred disciples at the martial hall did not cultivate that many different types of merit laws because the longest disciple had only been there for five years; they, technically, were not considered official disciples of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. They needed to pass the final assessment before they became official disciples of the sect.Martial hall, with its three hundred disciples, half male and half female, didn't practice that many merit laws. The merit laws of the martial hall only numbered in the dozens.Amongst these merit laws, some were created by the heavenly sages of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect to be used as entry merit laws, and some of the older entry merit laws were left behind by Immortal Emperor Min Ren. The oldest merit law was left behind by Li Qiye in his Dark Crow form.These were all entry-level merit laws, and they were not considered to be heaven shaking methods; however, these merit laws were all chosen because they were necessary for a solid foundation.Although, with the exception of a few common merit laws left behind by Li Qiye for the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, Li Qiye had never seen the other merit laws; however, after a million years, he had researched many merit laws. Even if all of his memories regarding merit laws were erased, from a certain perspective \u2013 regarding the understanding of merit laws \u2013 no one could compare to him! For any merit laws talked about, Li Qiye's explanations could be considered exact truths!On top of looking over the merit laws of the martial hall, Li Qiye also went to the first and second level of the Scripture Library. Li Qiye himself wouldn't practice these merit laws; he was only finding appropriate merit laws for the martial hall disciples.The First Elder was hoping that Li Qiye could contribute to the sect, so he specifically gave Li Qiye a license to read these merit laws.With regard to being an instructor, Li Qiye was truly responsible; he was not only using the three hundred disciples to earn contribution points, then be finished.As a senior instructing the Dao, he would surely uphold a high standard of responsibility, and he would absolutely not ruin his reputation with his own hands.For the instruction of Dao, Li Qiye had made full preparations. He had complete confidence in teaching these disciples, and he wanted to see the day of the final assessment. None of the disciples would fail the assessment and not become a disciple in the sect.The Cleansing Jade Peak's main branch; one could say that Cao Xiong, in this main branch, had the highest influence. For example, Sectional Leader Zhou was on Cao Xiong's side.However, this type of challenge, for Li Qiye, was far from what he would consider a challenge! Even if Cao Xiong's influence in this branch was greater, Li Qiye still had the utmost confidence that he could grasp this Cleansing Jade Peak in his hand. For him, this was not a problem!The Cleansing Jade Peak martial hall, built on top of the Cleansing Jade Peak; Cleansing Jade Peak was huge, and there were many buildings and staggered courtyards. The disciples that haven't been here for longer than five years numbered in the three hundreds. Counting the servants responsible for daily activities, the Cleansing Jade Peak had a total of four hundred people.Li Qiye, early in the morning, had entered the Cleansing Jade Peak. Naturally, Sectional Leader Zhou would not give him a hand; however, Nan Huairen was meticulous and attentive because this was the first day of Li Qiye's Dao instruction. After Li Qiye had arrived, he, in place of Li Qiye, gathered the three hundred disciples to the martial hall.Three hundred male and female disciples were all gathered at the martial hall practice ground, and, at this moment, all three hundred pair of eyes were on Li Qiye.Li Qiye looked around at the surrounding disciples. Within the three hundred disciples, almost evenly divided between male and female, the oldest was not eighteen and the youngest was around thirteen years old.Li Qiye only appeared to be thirteen to fourteen years old. He had to face the three hundred disciples and instruct the Dao; this caused Nan Huairen to worry that Li Qiye wouldn't be able to suppress these disciples.However, looking at Li Qiye sitting there with a calm-sky clear-wind expression high above, he, a thirteen year to fourteen year old, appeared like a great master; seeing Li Qiye's confidence, Nan Huairen breathed a sigh of relief.Sure enough, when the three hundred disciples had gathered, trouble did as well. Within these three hundred, immediately, there was a disciple who was not satisfied with Li Qiye, ignoring the fact that Li Qiye was currently adorning the status of the Prime Disciple.[1] Met the origin means death. Don't confuse this with the other use of origin, which means the beginning.[2] All rivers flow into the same sea = tolerance for the Dao and all existences.[3] Calm-sky clear-wind meaning = calm, nonchalant.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Won't this create a mistake in our cultivation? In less than a year, I want to pass the assessment; in the one out of ten thousand chance that I don't pass, then, I would have to wait for another five years!\u201d A discontented disciple said.There were many unhappy disciples. Another one couldn't help but to start complaining: \u201cThis is true. We have such bad luck! A person younger, compared to us, has been sent here to instruct us on the Dao; this matter is intolerable bullying towards us.\u201dOne disciple with good talents scowled, and he then said, with disdain: \u201cHmmph, a trash Mortal Physique and Mortal Fate Palace could still become our Prime Disciple; it is truly a disgrace to our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!\u201d\u201cShhh, older brother Luo. Careful or he will hear us.\u201d A disciple whispered while he pulled at his older brother.In fact, prior to this, Sectional Leader Zhou had implied to make things difficult for Li Qiye. This matter was not a big deal, and there would be no one to step up in place of him. This was why the martial hall disciples became bolder.\u201cSo what if he can hear us?\u201d The disciple called older brother Luo raised his voice higher instead, and he loudly said: \u201cHe is only a rubbish straw bag, and he is no different from anyone else! Even if he held the thighs of the Nine Saint Demon Gate; we can't allow him to delay our cultivation because of that! Why did we tortuously cultivate these past few years? It is so that we could pass the examination and become a disciple in the sect. If we are taught by a piece of trash like this, our efforts in these few years would be in vain.\u201d\u201cThis is true.\u201d In that moment, many students echoed: \u201cWe can't let a piece of trash waste our many years of effort in vain! We want to send him away! Change to a different instructor!\u201dSuddenly, around a dozen disciples chimed in. They surrounded him together, in a circle, and they started to heckle and rebel. Seeing this situation, Nan Huairen, frowning, wanted to step forward, but he was stopped by Li Qiye.\u201cGet rid of this waste; he is not qualified to instruct us on the Dao!\u201d The dozens of students loudly jeered: \u201cA person who had only recently joined the sect isn't even equal to me, and he still has the audacity to instruct us in the Dao!\u201dA disciple contemptuously said: \u201cWhat is a Prime Disciple worth? Pfft, he is not worth a single coin!\u201dOlder brother Luo yelled: \u201cCorrect! His cultivation isn't as strong as us, but he still wants to instruct us on the Dao. This is truly shameful! Wanting to instruct the Dao to us isn't a difficult thing; he just has to beat us first, and then we can talk.\u201d\u201cThat won't be good.\u201d A female disciple's big eyes, having some fear, said: \u201cProvoking the instructor; this is not a light charge.\u201d\u201cBah, provoking the instructor? He needs to have the qualifications to be our instructor; then we can talk.\u201d Older brother Luo loudly said.\u201cNot wrong, without the qualifications to be our instructor, he can't talk about Dao instruction. How is this called provoking the instructor?\u201d Many disciples agreed and without a double, this older brother Luo commanded high respect within his peers.\u201cSo, you all are completely not satisfied with this senior?\u201d Now that Li Qiye started to open his mouth, the disciples here quickly became silent. They looked at Li Qiye while Li Qiye looked back at them. No matter what, Li Qiye still was the Prime Disciple sent by the Elders.\u201cNot satisfied, eh? One could say that I am a very open-minded person.\u201d Li Qiye laughed so hard that his eyes were shut.Seeing Li Qiye's smile caused Nan Huairen, who was standing next to him, to shiver. The expression of Li Qiye's smile created an illusion in his mind; it was as if a Desolate Wasteland fierce beast had opened its jaw while licking its white-as-snow fangs and stared intensely at a group of lambs.At this moment, many students made a rattling sound from turning around to look at older brother Luo. Without a doubt, brother Luo was someone they trusted, and many people here were waiting to see his attitude.This brother Luo, that was confident enough, suddenly stood up. This brother Luo was sixteen or seventeen years old, and he looked at Li Qiye, who was even younger than him; he coldly smiled: \u201cYes! We are not convinced! You are just a new disciple! What gives you the qualification to instruct us on the Dao. Hmmph! Casually pulling a bag of straws to instruct the Dao to us! This is no different from destroying our futures!\u201d\u201cThis younger brother, what is your name?\u201d Li Qiye wasn't angry with this. No, he still had his eyes closed and a smile on his face as he said this.This brother Luo proudly look over Li Qiye, and he responded: \u201cI walk without changing my first name, and I sit without changing my surname; Luo Fenghua is who I am! You want revenge, coming to me is enough!\u201dAfter hearing this name, Li Qiye let off a brighter smile; he had seen the roster, and this Luo Fenghua he naturally knew of. Luo Fenghua had joined for almost four years now, and his talents and physiques were not bad. After four years, he had reached the Provision Palace rank.As an outer disciple, without the chance to practice superior merit laws, on top of the fact that three hundred disciples were instructed by only one sectional leader, and him using four years to reach the Provision Palace rank, even if his physiques and talents were not worthy of pride, he would still be considered a small genius.\u201cBesides this younger brother Luo, are there any others who are dissatisfied with me?\u201d Said Li Qiye, maintaining his eyes shut and wide smile.Luo Fenghua looked at the other disciples, and he then raised his voice: \u201cIf you are not satisfied then say you are not satisfied; this is not a big deal! We're not a bunch of cowards! We should unite and chase away this bag of straws; this is for our own good! If we let a bag of straws instruct us on the Dao, he will destroy all of our hard effort from the last few years. If there are any punishments, then they can come at me! I will shoulder them!\u201dThis Luo Fenghua, still speaking loudly, had some capability for leadership: \u201cThis is not wrong! We need to personally fight for our rights!\u201dUnder Luo Fenghua's lead, many disciples were tempted, and they all stood up.Suddenly, there were almost a hundred disciples standing up, and some loudly yelled: \u201cA person even younger than us joined the sect later than us. He is not qualified to instruct us on the Dao! You should immediately get out of the Cleansing Jade Peak!\u201d\u201cThat's right! Immediately get out! Get out!\u201d Different disciples were shouting.In this moment, the roaring was higher than a wave, and the disciples, who were silent before, under the surging mob, couldn't help but start to loudly echo their voices.\u201cIt seems like all of you are very dissatisfied with me.\u201d Facing these discontent disciples, Li Qiye still smilingly said: \u201cHowever, this was a decision made by the Elders, wasn't it? Since you guys are dissatisfied with me, I want to listen to your demands. You guys can talk; what type of person would have the qualifications to instruct you on the Dao?\u201dEven though the crowd was emotional and loud, Li Qiye, on the other hand, was not angry. With a consulting appearance, he made this group of young teenagers hesitate for a moment. No one had their own opinion, so they couldn't help but looked over at Luo Fenghua.Luo Fenghua met the group's expectation, and he coldly sneered: \u201cTo be our instructor is not difficult. At least be stronger than us! Then one will be eligible to be our instructor. If one can't compare to even us, they shouldn't talk about instructing the Dao!\u201d\u201cSo, you want to have a match with me?\u201d Li Qiye smiled at Luo Fenghua, as he said.Luo Fenghua, with a proud attitude, replied: \u201cCorrect; if you can beat me, you will have the qualification to instruct the Dao to us! Hmmph! However, if you can't beat me, don't blame me for being ruthless! Against my enemies, I never hold back. At that point, don't blame me for beating you and rolling on the floor. Once I make a move, I will cut your ribs from your body!\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 This is not good.\u201d Next to him, the female students, with big eyes, timidly said: \u201cEveryone having a match is good, but we should know the right time to stop.\u201dLi Qiye shook his head, and he smilingly said: \u201cI feel that this younger brother Luo makes a lot of sense; if we stop at the right time, then it is not a real fight. Isn't this right, everybody? If we want to fight, we have to use everything!\u201dLi Qiye stepped up and he loudly yelled: \u201cGood, winning or losing depends on the cultivation of the fighters!\u201d\u201cI will fight you!\u201d This Luo Fenghua, truly was courageous.Li Qiye smiled again, his eyes were still shut, and he said: \u201cYou want to fight? I will fight with you here.\u201dFinished speaking, he slowly took out his Serpent Punishing stick that was hung to his waist, and he said: \u201cI am the senior, I will not make the first move. You make your move.\u201d\u201cHmmph! You don't know your own strength. Older brother Luo is at the Provision Palace rank! You dare challenge older brother Luo with a wooden stick? This person doesn't know life and death!\u201d Someone saw Li Qiye taking out his Serpent Punishing stick, and he said with disdain.Nan Huairen shook his head; he knew that he had bad luck. Even an expert like Xu Hui was beaten by the Serpent Punishing stick until he rolled on the floor, let alone this Luo Fenghua ahead.\u201cYou don't know your own strength!\u201d Li Qiye taking out a wooden stick, to Luo Fenghua, was very humiliating. He opened his mouth, let out a loud roar, and he took out a sword; this was a True Treasure with a relatively low rank. The sword was out, and an \u201conggg\u201d sound rang in the air. In the blink of an eye, many surging sword shadows appeared; one \u201cHeavenly Vast River Sword\u201d attack flew towards Li Qiye.Luo Fenghua's sword, that just came out, was immediately knocked away by the Serpent Punishing stick.A bang occurred; the next stick strike caused Luo Fenghua's view to be covered with yellow stars. His face was hit violently once, and fresh blood painted his whole face; he, essentially, couldn't escape the Serpent Punishing stick.\u201cBang\u2026 Bang\u2026 Bang\u2026\u201d Li Qiye was without mercy, and Luo Fenghua was clubbed dozens of time. Suddenly, he brought Luo Fenghua down to the ground, and sure enough, Li Qiye continued to beat him. Luo Fenghua screamed out in pain; Li Qiye was especially brutal towards Luo Fenghua. He swung at him very hard; he did so until his eyes and nose were covered in nothing but blood.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d In the end, when Li Qiye finally held himself back, Luo Fenghua didn't even have the strength to scream; he could only quietly whimper.A person below Heaven's Primal rank, in front of the Serpent Punishing stick, could only accept the beating!Nan Huairen couldn't help but pitifully glare at Luo Fenghua. Even Xu Hui's teeth were hit till they scattered on the floor. This time, Li Qiye's beating could be considered mercifully restrained.At this point, all of the disciples were frozen. In just a blink of an eye, Luo Fenghua, the strongest person in their group, was beaten to a bloody pulp.\u201cAll of you step forward right now; all of you can come together.\u201d Li Qiye held the Serpent Punishing stick, and he pointed at the disciples that were chiming in with Luo Fenghua; he said this dismissively.\u201cBut\u2026 But\u2026 We.\u201d Seeing the end result of Luo Fenghua, these disciples couldn't help but take a step back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He is only one person, and we have so many people, like this! All go! Ah!\u201d A disciple, with big guts, loudly yelled. He then took out his weapon, and he jumped forward.\u201cAll together!\u201d With one person leading, the remaining dozen became emboldened. They loudly exclaimed, and they took out their weapons, moving forward.\u201cBang\u2026 Bang\u2026 Bang\u2026\u201d However, having more people was of no use. In front of the Serpent Punishing stick, cultivators under the Heaven's Primal rank, they only had one option; the only option was to be beaten. The dozens of students were like little snakes, encountering their nemesis. The moment they made a move, the Serpent Punishing stick immediately hit their face, and as each strike came along, blood covered their faces. They fell down to the ground on the spot.\u201cBang\u2026 Bang\u2026 Bang\u2026\u201d For the ones leading this rebellion, Li Qiye showed no mercy, ruthlessly whipping without stop. Even if they were on the floor, he would still strike.Li Qiye went all out with the whipping until these students wailed like ghosts and howled like wolves; struck until these students' bodies were covered in blood and lying on the ground. They wouldn't be able to stand up for an hour.Li Qiye was so fierce, it made the spectating students shiver in fear; they turned pale.\u201cAll of you, come over here for me!\u201d Li Qiye pointed at another group of disciples with his stick, and he coldly said.\u201cSe-senior, we, we, we didn't rebel.\u201d The female disciple with big eyes frightenedly said.\u201cI know.\u201d Li Qiye dismissively said: \u201cMy first class is very simple. It is to let you all know that anyone can challenge me; however, the result of challenging me, will be as you all can see with your own eyes.\u201d\u201cBang\u2026 Bang\u2026 Bang\u2026\u201d Li Qiye ignored whether the disciples made a move or not; he made a quick dash over to them, and sent a quick strike, beating them down!In reality, Li Qiye was already at the Physique Accumulation rank, and some of the disciples were weaker compared to him. Even without the Serpent Punishing stick, he could still take care of them; thus, Li Qiye dashed like a fierce lion into a pack of lambs, and, in the blink of an eye, he had beaten half of them down.\u201cRun ahhh\u2026\u201d They did not know who was scared with broken wits, but they turned around and fled.Unfortunately, the moment they tried to escape, they were thrown back by Nan Huairen. They essentially couldn't get away, and some of the ones who were thrown back started to defend themselves; however, a stick immediately flew toward them, and in a moment, they were lying on the ground in the same spot.\u201cBang\u2026 Bang\u2026 Bang\u2026\u201d Against the disciples who didn't rebel, Li Qiye went easy on them. He only brought them down to the ground. They were not like Luo Fenghua, struck to the a bloody pulp.Eventually, all three hundred disciples, without an exception, were struck to the ground. All of the disciples' faces were deadly pale. The Serpent Punishing stick was indeed their nemesis; one strike on their body, even if it didn't leave a wound, still hurt to the bones.The Serpent Punishing stick, this was the best treasure to discipline students who didn't listen \u2013 rare in this world. Otherwise, Li Qiye wouldn't use it to discipline Min Ren and his group of little boys! In this moment, the entire martial hall was a relay of constant and agonizing moanings; all of the disciples were beaten by the Serpent Punishing stick to the ground. The ones that stubbornly fought back, these were beaten even harder by Li Qiye. Especially the dozens in the group of Luo Fenghua. After he brought them to the ground, he even ruthlessly whipped them even more. He did so until their skins cracked and bones broke.After carefully discipline these disciples in front of him, Li Qiye slowly went back to his seat on top, stared at the disciples on the ground, and he casually spoke: \u201cProvoke me, I very much welcome it; however, the result\u2026 Ah, you all can decide for yourselves. Today is the first lesson. It was only an appetizer! Later, I will not show such mercy; until I break your bones, I will not stop!\u201dStill staring at these disciples lying down in the same place, Li Qiye continued: \u201cI am your instructor, I will take charge of everyone here! Hard bones without submission? That is fine! I will hit them until he or she submits! Otherwise, be obedient disciples for me! In front of me, everything you have learned before, whether you are a genius or not, throw it all away! In front of me, geniuses and dog shit are of little value! A dragon, coil yourself for me; a lion, lie down for me; otherwise, I will beat you until your arrogant egos are shattered!\u201dRight now, a bunch of students were lying down there, they couldn't even stand up, so no one dared to talk back.\u201cThe first lesson, today, will stop here.\u201d At this point, Li Qiye smiled; before he left, he said: \u201cOf course, if you guys are dissatisfied with me, you can go complain. However, you should remember well; if you complain about me, I will entertain you really well!\u201dSure enough, that afternoon, Sectional Leader Zhou came to his door; once they met face to face, Sectional Leader Zhou coldly said: \u201cTeaching disciples under you, you should put Dao teachings at the top. The Cleansing Jade Peak disciples, in the future, will be the pillars of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. If something happens to them\u2026\u201d\u201cIf Sectional Leader Zhou is unhappy with me, then go to the Elders and complain.\u201d Li Qiye interrupted Sectional Leader Zhou mid-sentence, and he then said: \u201cSince I am now responsible for the Dao instruction, how to teach \u2013 that is my business. I do not need someone else to wave their hands and dance their legs while telling me what to do. If Sectional Leader Zhou doesn't have any other business, see yourself out.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Met with Li Qiye's fighting words, especially how Li Qiye essentially didn't put him in his eyes, this made Sectional Leader Zhou shiver with rage.\u201cSectional Leader Zhou, please take your leave.\u201d Li Qiye didn't want to glance at him much. With his level of character, he didn't want to waste his time arguing needlessly.Sectional Leader Zhou was outraged to the point of vomiting blood; his anger soared to the sky, and he almost crushed his teeth from grinding them. In the end, he was so angry that he smiled, and he coldly said: \u201cGood, good, good! Until the day of the assessment, let us see how you teach these disciples to pass it!\u201dFinished speaking, he turned around and left.After Sectional Leader Zhou left, Li Shuangyan appeared out of nowhere. She coldly watched Li Qiye, and she indifferently said: \u201cYou make enemies in all four directions, are you not afraid of others cutting you?\u201d\u201cCultivation, isn't everything.\u201d Li Qiye, comfortably looked into her eyes, and he said: \u201cTo kill, is not a difficult task. It is more about how to kill; additionally, is it worth killing, is the question.\u201d\u201cSpeaking of killing!\u201d Li Qiye couldn't help but smile, and he then said: \u201cAt the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, so what if a magnificent army with thousands of men and horses appear? The numbers that come are the numbers that will be killed!\u201dLi Shuang Ya stared at Li Qiye, and she coldly said: \u201cSo, you are very confident.\u201dLi Qiye was too lazy to talk about such matters, so he reminded her: \"However, don't forget. You are my sword maid; protecting one's master is your responsibility.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Li Shuangyan's face was reddened because of Li Qiye's attitude; she had cultivated for so long, and her Dao willpower was very stable; however, since she met Li Qiye, many times, she was angered to the point of vomiting blood.In the end, Li Shuangyan was a favored daughter of the heavens; she took a deep breath, and she finally calmed her mind. She stared at Li Qiye, and she eventually said: \u201cMaking me submit, it is also not a difficult task. At the very least, you have to give me a reason on why I should submit.\u201d\u201cPure Crystal Physique; one of the twenty-four King Physiques is not a bad physique.\u201d Li Qiye stared at her, and he then casually said: \u201cStay by my side well. In the future, I will teach you a little bit. As long as you work hard, with my instruction, cultivating to the Void Imperfection Physique will not be a problem!\u201d\u201cSuch strong words, Void Imperfection Physique!\u201d Li Shuangyan couldn't help but to glare at Li Qiye; she coldly proclaimed: \u201cDo you even know the meaning behind Void Imperfection Physique? It is one of the twelve Immortal Physiques! From the ancient times till now, the people that could cultivate an Immortal Physique was just a very few! I currently am practicing a Saint Physique merit law; this is the apex of physique merit laws!\u201dLi Shuangyan was born with a King Physique, this was a matter that made one proud; Pure Crystal Physique was extremely rare, and it was one of the twenty-four King Physiques. The current physique merit law she was cultivating was one of the top physique merit laws in the world; however, even for her, to turn the Pure Crystal Physique into the Pure Jade Physique, this would require many moons!Pure Jade Physique, this was one of the eighteen Saint Physiques. Once a Saint Physique was completed, unlimited power; it could not be underestimated!\u201cOnngggg\u2026\u201d Without a word, Li Qiye's Life Wheel suddenly appeared. Behind his head was a heavenly rotating aura; blood energy like a hurricane, and, in a split second, like a Kun leaping from an ocean, his Fate Palace floated up and down. Within this moment, Li Qiye ferociously extended a kick towards Li Shuangyan.Li Shuangyan's expression changed; her white hands covered the air, holding a silver shield to block Li Qiye's kick.\u201cBang\u2026\u201d A loud noise rang the air; under one kick, heavy as ten thousand mountains, profoundly deep without words. This was such a kick. For Li Shuangyan to block was not so easy. A \u201cCrack crack\u201d sound occurred; under this kick, her silver shield immediately shattered into pieces. Even though she had successfully received the kick, she still had to take a step back. The stone bricks on the floor were trampled by her movement.Suddenly, Li Shuangyan's expression greatly changed; this one kick, from Li Qiye, was not the power of the Dao. It was not from a powerful force, but it was weight; the power of pure weight.It was as if one leg of Li Qiye was as heavy as ten thousand mountains. Under this one kick was enough force to crush mountains and rivers! This was something impossible. Li Qiye's cultivation was still shallow; there was no way his kick could be this powerful!\u201cHeaven's prideful daughter, these three words you do deserve without shame; to be able to bear the weight of this one kick, your cultivation is immeasurable.\u201d Li Qiye took a glance at her once, and he then said: \u201cYou practice the Pure Jade Sacred Heart method from the War God Temple. It is not a bad Physique method.\u201dHe left after these words.Li Shuangyan was silent for a long time; her mind was shocked like never before. Since she had met Li Qiye till now, Li Qiye had only given a mysterious feel. This caused others to not see through him; but today, with his heavy kick, he had completely stunned her!She believed that Li Qiye's cultivation definitely did not exceed the Physique Accumulation rank; however, that one heavy kick from Li Qiye had shaken her to her core. She felt that it wasn't only grand Dao energy or power; it was but, simply, the force of weight.It was absolutely impossible for a human leg to be this heavy; at least a Mortal Physique couldn't have reached this level! Why was it that Li Qiye's leg was heavy like this? Thinking about this, Li Shuangyan's heart couldn't calm down!Speaking of Physiques; with heavy constitutions, there were several different Physiques. For example, the Xiantian Physique \u2013 Mighty Mountain Physique. Another example would be the Devil Suppressing Physique within the King Physique trees, even the Hell Suppressing Physique was within the Saint Physiques.However, one could see that Li Qiye was not of Xiantian Physique, and he was also not of King Physique; definitely not Saint Physique! Natural born King Physique and Saint Physique definitely couldn't escape other's eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The weight of this kick left a matchless and profound impression when she thought of Li Qiye.Li Shuangyan's mind shook. She couldn't recover for a long time as she was thinking about many things.On the second day, Li Qiye once again appeared at the martial hall, sitting high above. In the practice field, the three hundred disciples were gathered, and at this moment, the entire martial hall was completely silent.Right now, one did not know how many disciples were frightened by Li Qiye; yesterday, all of them were thrown to the ground by Li Qiye, and they received a good beating. This kind of pain; when they thought of it, they couldn't help but shiver their whole body.However, the Serpent Punishing Stick was amazing; even if they were hit to the point of their skin bruising and flesh breaking, there would be no damage to the bones and muscles. Not to mention, yesterday, Li Qiye pulled his punches on many students; with a touch of golden healing paste, there would be no hindrance the next day.Yesterday, many were scared by Li Qiye; thus, today, when Li Qiye's gaze swept the field, many of the disciple's hearts were beating drums; they didn't dare to look at him in the eyes.\u201cVery good; there are brothers and sisters with courage that can complain about me.\u201d Li Qiye smiled, and he said: \u201cHowever, I don't know if these brothers and sisters who complained about me have the courage to stand up or not?\u201dAt this point, many disciples looked at each other in dismay; seeing Li Qiye's beaming smile, their hearts were all nervous.\u201cOne person commits the crime will be one person accepts the punishment; it was I who complained about you.\u201d Luo Fenghua stood up, and he loudly said. Even though Luo Fenghua could walk right now and his body had no serious wounds, his face was covered with medicinal pastes, undermining his angry handsome face.Li Qiye stepped down from his high position, and he beamingly smiled at Luo Fenghua. Nodding his head, he said: \u201cPeople that have courage, I have always admired; younger brother Luo is someone I can admire without a doubt. However, you dared to challenge my authority, so you will be enlightened about the consequence of challenging my authority. Today, young brother Luo wants to crawl back, or be carried back by other people?\u201dWhen he finished speaking, he slowly took out his Serpent Punishing stick.Seeing Li Qiye's smile, with the Serpent Punishing stick in his hand, all of the disciples \u2013 regardless of whether they were male or females \u2013 couldn't help but greatly sour their expressions.\u201cUsing\u2026 Using treasure\u2026 What kind of skill?\u201d Luo Fenghua turned pale, but he was still standing up straight. He loudly said: \u201cIf you are skillful, you should have a real match with me! With real techniques!\u201dBy now, even a fool could see that the ordinary wooden stick in Li Qiye's hand was a treasure.\u201cYou truly want to have a match with me?\u201d Li Qiye stared at Luo Fenghua in front of him, and he smiled.Currently, the thing Luo Fenghua was unwilling to see the most was Li Qiye's beaming smile. Looking at Li Qiye's demeanor, his heart became uncertain; however, he gritted his teeth, and he became determined. He loudly said: \u201cThats right, if you are skillful, use real techniques to have a discussion with me. If you are stronger than me, I will have no other words to say.\u201d\u201cSince younger brother Luo wants to discuss things a little bit, then, I will have to have a discussion with you.\u201d Li Qiye smilingly withdrew his Serpent Punishing stick, then, he stared at Luo Fenghua and said: \u201cI am the older brother, it wouldn't be fitting for me to make the first move. You go first.\u201dLuo Fenghua saw that Li Qiye had withdrew the Serpent Punishing stick; in his mind, he was ecstatic. He took out his sword, and he loudly said: \u201cGood, we shall discuss a little bit.\u201dThe words had just ended, Luo Fenghua crossed his sword horizontally, and he immediately put on a careful guard \u2013 his first move was a defensive form.Luo Fenghua was frightened by Li Qiye, so he was already on the defensive.\u201cA bit talented.\u201d Li Qiye examined his careful defensive form, and he smiled. In the blink of an eye, his Life Wheel appeared, blood energy rotated, and he sent one kick went out.A \u201cPop\u201d sound was heard; under one kick, Luo Fenghua's defensive formation was not of use. His whole body flew three meters, his sword was broken at once, and he laid on the floor, spraying a mouthful of blood.\u201cCrack, crack\u201d; before Luo Fenghua had fallen on the ground, the sound of a bone breaking was heard \u2013 a bone in his chest was broken. He lied on the ground, spewing out blood, and his eyes went blank as he fainted.Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique! Li Qiye's cultivation was the unbeatable and strongest Physique in the world! One kick, the weight of ten thousand mountains; one could only imagine how heavy this kick was.All of the disciples were shocked; within the three hundred disciples, Luo Fenghua's cultivation wasn't the highest; however, it could be counted with one's finger. He couldn't even block one kick from Li Qiye. How could this be possible?Li Qiye slowly put his foot back down and said: \u201cThat was one kick with one-tenth of my weight behind it, yet you still couldn't block it; still, you had the arrogance to challenge me.\u201dThis one kick, Li Qiye had shown mercy; otherwise, this one kick with its true power, Luo Fenghua would definitely be dead.On the side, Nan Huairen slightly shook his head. Half a year ago, his oldest brother had not yet cultivated; even Du Yuanguang and Xu Hui were dismembered by him at that time. Currently, he had cultivated; Luo Fenghua, here, was courting his death.Without Li Qiye's command, Nan Huairen woke up Luo Fenghua, helped him reconnect his broken bone, put on some silver medicinal paste, and he then carried him back to his place.\u201cIt seems like I still should use the Serpent Punishing stick to discipline you guys well, ah; it's basically not as dangerous.\u201d Li Qiye once again took out the Serpent Punishing stick, and he randomly pointed at another disciple; he said: \u201cYou, come out; if you have any skills, use all of them here.\u201d\u201cOld-older brother, I-I-I didn't complain about you, I, I swear to the heaven, I absolutely didn't complain.\u201dLi Qiye nodded seriously, and he said: \u201cI know you didn't complain, but, the content of the second lesson is still my beating you guys, again. Of course, you all could try to run; however, if you get caught by me, I will beat you ten times harder than I did yesterday. It is best that you guys believe my words, otherwise, the consequences will be serious.\u201dThe disciple had no other choice; he hesitantly stepped up, and he said while trembling: \u201cOlder brother, please show mercy.\u201d\u201cWanting me to show you mercy is not as good as putting in your own effort! One blow at full power, the initiative is in your hands.\u201d Li Qiye smiled with his eyes closed. Finished speaking, a strike immediately came.Without any other choice, the disciple had to fight.\u201cBang\u2026 Bang\u2026 Bang\u2026\u201d This disciple couldn't handle more than two techniques against Li Qiye's hands. Immediately taken to the ground by the Serpent Punishing stick, Li Qiye was free to beat him up until he was in unbearable pain, but at least it was better compared to yesterday, there was no visible blood.\u201cYou, you, you\u2026\u201d Li Qiye pointed a few times, and he said: \u201cAll of you come.\u201d\u201cBang\u2026 Bang\u2026 Bang\u2026\u201d Many techniques came out; the three hundred disciples were, once again, beaten to the ground by Li Qiye. Many painful howls rang; whether real or fake, at least, this type of pain was straight to the bone marrow. At least, today, Li Qiye didn't mercilessly beat them up; there was no blood, but, this type of pain was still torturous.\u201cLittle kids cannot be caught!\u201d Li Qiye shook his head and lamented quietly, then he turned around and left.The third day, Li Qiye appeared one more time. The three hundred disciples were summoned to the field. What was outside of Li Qiye's expectations was that Luo Fenghua, who had a broken chest bone from yesterday, also came.After being beaten twice, currently, to all three hundred disciples, meeting Li Qiye was like meeting a ghost; their hearts trembled, and the taste of the Serpent Punishing stick would be a nightmare for a long time to them.This was understandable for them. That year, when Immortal Emperor Min Ren was still young, the undefeated generals, who had followed Immortal Emperor Min Ren to fight in the nine heavens and ten earths, they, at a young age, also didn't forget the taste of the Serpent Punishing stick for a long time! Even after receiving the Heaven's Will and becoming an Immortal Emperor, when he thought back about this period, he was also filled with all kinds of emotions.\u201cThe third class' content is still to beat you!\u201dLi Qiye stepped down, once again, and he beamingly smiled.When Li Qiye's words came out, the disciples couldn't help but shiver. They had already been beaten twice; this frightened them to the point of their legs giving up.\u201cWho is first?\u201d Li Qiye smiled, and he gazed at the three hundred disciples here. As his eyes swept around, many students were shivering; they couldn't help but take a step back.\u201cMe.\u201d In the end, the first to step up was Luo Fenghua, again. Luo Fenghua stood up, and he loudly said: \u201cI will come!\u201dFinished speaking, he took out a large shield.Luo Fenghua, on the other hand, was smart. Today, he especially brought a large shield hoping that it could deflect the Serpent Punishing stick in the hand of Li Qiye.\u201cYou have some courage, and you are even a little clever.\u201d Li Qiye nodded his head, and he smiled.\u201cBang\u2026 Bang\u2026 Bang\u2026\u201d In the end, Luo Fenghua couldn't escape his fate of being beaten. If the Serpent Punishing stick could be stopped by a large shield, then it would not be worthy of being taken out of the Demon Forest by Li Qiye.At this moment, Li Qiye had beaten Luo Fenghua badly, and he stained him with fresh blood \u2013 he was beaten until he couldn't stand up from the ground, groaning in pain.Witnessing Li Qiye's merciless action, the rest of the disciple's expressions greatly changed; however, they didn't dare to say anything.\u201cClever indeed, but, you used it in the wrong place. One point of intelligence becomes wisdom. Next, you will want to use your brain even more. This meal, I fiercely beat you, so that you will use more of your brain.\u201d Li Qiye comfortably said.This day, all of the disciples were beaten by Li Qiye again. This time, Li Qiye was much more merciless than yesterday; many disciples saw blood, lying on the floor, and they were not being able to stand up.On the fourth day, Li Qiye casually said: \u201cThe fourth day, it is still as before: beating you. Who will be the first one?\"This time, all of the disciple's faces quickly changed. They quickly stepped back, one after another; no one wanted to be the first to come out. Even Luo Fenghua, who was courageous yesterday, didn't dare to come out.\u201cI-I, I will go.\u201d In the end, an eighteen-year-old teenager stood up; this young boy appeared to be honest, but his body was still very strong.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d Li Qiye glanced at this young boy, he had an impression of him. Each time he had beaten them, all of the other disciples wanted to escape and flee; however, this disciple was tenacious. Every time, he tried to face the beatings head on. Each time he fell to the ground, he desperately tried to stand up; his mentality wasn't bad. This left Li Qiye with a not-so-shallow impression.This disciple scratched his head, and he politely said: \u201cRespectful older brother, my name is Zhang Yu.\u201d\u201cWhy be the first one to come out?\u201d Li Qiye smiled, and he asked.\u201cWh-when older brother is happy, you beat us anyway; when you are unhappy, you will still beat us. Older brother just wants to beat us; since we can't run, wh-why not be the first?\u201d Zhang Yu stuttered while speaking.[1] The first sentence is an expression, using 'not known' as a way to say a great number/many.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhang Yu, within the three hundred disciples, his cultivation was near the bottom, but he joined the martial hall two years earlier compared to the majority of the other disciples.Even though Zhang Yu's cultivation was weak, he had the toughness of an old ox and a spirit that would not let go. The Serpent Punishing stick violently struck his body causing his whole body to ache; it was as if his bones and tendons were peeled, even standing up was difficult.However, Zhang Yu, again and again, tried to stand up, even knowing that this resistance was a waste of time; however, he kept trying to stand up, again, and again, and again and again, just to be beaten by Li Qiye again and again, down to the ground.This time, Li Qiye was deliberately trying to test him; again and again, he struck Zhang Yu. Even though there was no blood; however, he struck Zhang Yu until he felt an unbearable pain, his bones and tendons felt as if they were shattered.If this was a different person, they would be motionlessly lying on the floor; however, Zhang Yu, again and again, stood up, and again and again, resisted Li Qiye's strikes.\u201cBang\u2026 Bang\u2026 Bang\u2026\u201d The stick kept striking Zhang Yu's body. This striking sound caused the other disciples to lose their wits; they felt that Li Qiye had gone too far against Zhang Yu.The last three times, Li Qiye usually only brought a person to the ground, and then he would stop; however, this time, it was as if Li Qiye was purposely making it difficult for Zhang Yu. Again and again, he struck Zhang Yu, and Zhang Yu, again and again, stood up just to be struck by Li Qiye, to the ground.Until the end, Zhang Yu was no longer able to stand up from the strikes. Even though his body sustained no injuries and it didn't shed blood, his four limbs were tired; he was trembling from the pain. Cold sweat the size of a bean ran rampant, and he had a pale-white face \u2013 this showed how much pain he was in.Seeing the state of Zhang Yu, many disciples couldn't help but shiver repeatedly; with fear in their mind, the many female disciples felt bad, and they couldn't bear to watch.\u201cA spirit that is unwilling to give up, very good!\u201d Li Qiye glanced at Zhang Yu, who was tiredly lying on the ground, with a calm-sky clear-wind expression and said: \u201cIf I was unhappy, I wouldn't take it out on little characters like you all. Take ten thousand steps back; if I wanted to take it out on you all, I can think of \u2013 off the top of my head \u2013 three or five hundred brutal ways to torture you all!\u201dThese words of Li Qiye was for Zhang Yu's ears, and also the rest of the disciples.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d After beating Zhang Yu, the Serpent Punishing stick of Li Qiye readily pointed at another disciple: \u201cCome out.\u201dThe disciple pointed at by Li Qiye had his hair explode, his two legs trembled, and, under the tyrannical abuse of Li Qiye, he couldn't not go out.Li Qiye looked at this disciple, and he smilingly asked: \u201cDo you all know why I have to beat you guys?\u201dAt this time, in the eyes of the disciple, Li Qiye's smiling face was more terrifying than the devil's smiling face; his two legs shaking, his body exuded cold fear, and he couldn't speak clearly. He stuttered: \u201cYe-yes, it was because we offended older brother\u2026\u201d\u201cWrong!\u201d Li Qiye smiled: \u201cFight back.\u201dFinished speaking, the Serpent Punishing stick in his hand, once again, violently flew past.\u201cBang!\u201d This disciple was struck by Li Qiye once, and he cried and moaned.\u201cNext.\u201d Li Qiye, once again, picked a random disciple and beat him once; he struck him until he couldn't stand up from the ground.Suddenly, wailing sounds of pain went up and down in the field, and, under the Serpent Punishing stick, one after another, all of them suffered.\u201cSpeak, why am I beating you guys?\u201d Li Qiye beat a disciple with no place to hide; this disciple could only accept his fate, and he was beaten by Li Qiye till he had a swollen nose. In the end, he gave up on resisting, and he held his head with both hands, leaving Li Qiye to fiercely strike.\u201cN-no, I don't know\u2026\u201d This disciple could only consider himself unlucky; he said a dozen answers, but there wasn't one that made Li Qiye's hands stop.At this point, a frightened voice rang: \u201cOl-older brother's strikes were\u2026 were hitting our, our weak points\u2026 or, or it is because ol-older brother is, is testing us; our merit laws, inside our merit laws, are flaws.\u201dHearing these words, Li Qiye suddenly stopped and turned around, looking for the origin of the voice. The one who spoke was a female disciple, Li Qiye had a little impression of her; a big pair of eyes with a frightened expression.The face of the female disciple that was pretty and delicate. From her expression, one could tell that she was not bold. At this time, Li Qiye's \u201cvicious\u201d eyes turned around; the female disciple unconsciously took a step back. Her palm became sweaty, the older female disciple next to her was worried about her, and he gently pulled at her once.Li Qiye pointed at the big-eyed female disciple with the frightened demeanor, and he smilingly said: \u201cYou, come out.\u201dThis disciple was quite frightened and dawdled out.This scene was a bit funny; Li Qiye was only a thirteen to fourteen-year-old boy, and the girl in front was clearly older than Li Qiye.In front of Li Qiye, the female disciple waddled forward like she was a little lamb facing an old wolf.\u201cSpeak, why do I want to beat you all.\u201d Li Qiye beamingly smiled as he looked at the female disciple; her face was whitely pale, and she didn't dare to come closer.This female disciple was indeed very afraid of Li Qiye, and she took a step back. This scene, it was like Li Qiye was a young master who specialized in bullying kind-hearted young girls.The female disciple finally bit her teeth, and, with a voice like a silver bell, she quietly said: \u201cI, I feel that, older brother, e-each strike, all, were hitting me. Our techniques have openings, ol-older brother want-wanted to test our merit laws, our flaws.\u201dHaving said that, the big-eyed timid looking female disciple looked at Li Qiye without confidence, and she then immediately tucked her head down; she really was afraid of Li Qiye.At this point, she thought Li Qiye was going to act violently; however, Li Qiye slowly and casually asked her: \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\u201cXu, Xu Pei.\u201d This female disciple's scalp was tingling from being stared at by Li Qiye. She was older than Li Qiye, but the moment Li Qiye stared at her, she felt like she was being targeted by a Prehistoric Desolate fierce beast.\u201cXu Pei, younger sister Xu.\u201dLi Qiye cheerfully smiled: \u201cI will tell you a good piece of news; very lucky, you have guessed correctly.\u201dLi Qiye's words got out. Many disciples were stumped for words, and Xu Pei's heart couldn't help but became ecstatic; finally, she had escaped a calamity.\u201cFrom now on, you are the oldest sister; the three hundred disciples of the Cleansing Jade Peak will be led by you.\u201d Li Qiye slowly spoke: \u201cHowever, it is your turn to make a move right now.\u201dLi Qiye suddenly appointed this position, causing the other disciples to startled. Xu Pei was also startled; she was startled, not because of the appointment, but because of the sentence said afterward by Li Qiye. \u201cOld-older brother, I, I had guessed correctly to your, your question. I, I won't be exempted from the beating?\u201dLi Qiye beamingly and cheerfully smiled: \u201cIt is true that you have guessed correctly. However, I didn't say I was going to let you go. My way of living is very fair; I always treat others equally.\u201dRight now, facing Li Qiye's cheerful smile, Xu Pei felt that it was scarier compared to an old wolf.In the end, Xu Pei didn't have any other choice; she had to gather the courage to resist. At the point when she was about to make a move, she couldn't help but timidly say: \u201cO-olde-older brother, not, not the face, is that okay\u2026?\u201dWishing to appear beautiful was the nature of all women; even a cultivator was like this. Li Qiye's Serpent Punishing stick's strike, even though it didn't leave wounds, but being beaten till one's face and nose were swollen, this \u2013 to any young girl \u2013 was a torturous affair.\u201cI can think about it.\u201d Li Qiye happily smiled, but his Serpent Punishing stick had already aimed for her face.Xu Pei became frightened. She immediately moved her feet into a defensive gate, barely dodging the stick from hitting her face, but the Serpent Punishing stick was like maggots in the bones; she had just escaped but another strike was on the way.Xu Pei was alarmed. Once again, she used the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's stepping techniques to dodge, but Li Qiye was still chasing her \u2013 it was hard to escape.\u201cIf you keep on running away, do you trust that I will beat your face into a pig's head or not?\u201d The voice of Li Qiye, like an evil ghost, rang.These words astonishingly frightened Xu Pei. No longer dared to run, she immediately turned around to fight. She let out a roar with her long sword in her hand put into motion, and she crossed horizontally towards Li Qiye.\u201cBang!\u201d One sound, one stick from Li Qiye, without mercy, ruthlessly struck the sweet fragrant shoulder of Xu Pei; the pain caused her tears to flow; it was as if her sweet smelling shoulder was about to break into pieces.\u201cThis power of 'One Sword Sweep the Earth' is one part too weak. It can't even withstand a single blow. One Sword Sweeps the Earth; the move is just like its name, sweep through everything!\u201d Li Qiye violently struck Xu Pei's sweet shoulder until she cried; however, Li Qiye was still cheerfully smiling, and he said: \u201cAgain.\u201dLi Qiye ignored Xu Pei's pitiful state; his cheerful smile was extremely ruthless, and he said: \u201cA fight to the death, it is not just being scrupulous as the earth, but it is also as courageous as the heaven. When meeting your enemy face-to-face in a narrow path, the braver one will win! Your heart is bright like a mirror, able to see clearly the downy feathers in the autumns; however, you are lacking the will to fight a bloody battle to the end \u2013 lacking the courage and enlightenment to fight a battle to the death!\u201dLi Qiye was giving pointers to Xu Pei; not only in her lacking techniques, but also her mentality in battle!Xu Pei could only reluctantly withstand the pain and let out a lovable roar; her sword created a net like a sea, and she returned a blow towards Li Qiye.\u201cBang\u2026\u201d Li Qiye, once again, struck her waist and indifferently said: \u201cThis one 'Sword like the Grand Water' lacks a majestic boundlessness; this move is dependent on the word 'Grand! 'Grand Righteous Energy!\u201d [3. \u201cSword like the Grand Water\u201d is \u201cJian Hao Ru Hai\u201d, \u201cGrand Righteous Energy is \u201cHao Ran Zheng Qi\u201d. Li Qiye is stressing on the profound truth of the technique which is the word \u201cHao\u201d. Also \u201cHao Ran Zheng Qi\u201d is very common in xian xia, usually used by kings or good-natured people]\u201cBang\u2026\u201d Li Qiye, once again, obliterated Xu Pei's openings; with each move and each technique, he taught Xu Pei: \u201cThis 'Southern Swallow Returns to its Nest' was practiced very well, but you shouldn't be complacent; it is still lacking maturity. A weakness can momentarily be exposed.\u201dLi Qiye enjoyed reading merit laws and techniques that were practiced by the Cleansing Jade Peak's disciples. In reality, the three hundred disciple's practicing methods and techniques were limited, and the majority of these methods were left behind by Li Qiye for the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect that year. There were even some that Li Qiye had created just for Immortal Emperor Min Ren.[1] This repetition of \u201cagain and again\u201d was in the raws so we wanted to keep the meaning.[2] Double negatives, Author loves them, embraces them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then, she couldn't hold on any longer, fell to the ground, and she found it impossible to stand up. Li Qiye then let her off.Li Qiye pointed at another disciple, and he cheerfully said: \u201cNext.\u201d\u201cBang\u2026 Bang\u2026 Bang\u2026\u201d At this moment, all the other disciples also suffered the calamity; one after another, they were beaten by Li Qiye, and they laid motionlessly on the ground.After Xu Pei's words enlightened them, at the moment when Li Qiye was beating them, the other disciples were watching each strike from Li Qiye. Even though they were getting hit, each disciple still remembered Li Qiye's every strike.Now, everyone wanted to know the flaws in each of their moves and actions. Some wanted to cover their flaws, so that they wouldn't be beaten so badly by Li Qiye; some wanted to use this opportunity to see their own weaknesses and to raise their own cultivation\u2026Although Xu Pei's words had woken everyone up, not every disciple could see the flaws in their techniques and actions. Even if they could see the flaws within and know, personally, that their moves had flaws, they still wouldn't be able to fix the underlying problems.The other disciples weren't as lucky as Xu Pei; Li Qiye was only beating them, he didn't give them pointers.In the end, the disciples who were beaten by Li Qiye lied on the ground, wailing moans filled the air. Li Qiye indifferently looked at them, and he then smiled, saying: \u201cToday will end here. I'm giving you guys three days to rest. You should carefully think for a little bit, lest you make the same mistakes again.\u201dFinished speaking, he turned around and left.Three days rest was as quick as a blink of the eye. Li Qiye, once again, appeared in the martial practice hall of the Cleansing Jade Peak. Li Qiye looked at the surrounding three hundred disciples, and he slowly said: \u201cThe contents of today's lesson is still the same; it is still a beating.\u201dLi Qiye's words made many students change their expressions; many students were afraid of Li Qiye and the taste of the Serpent Punishing stick, it was definitely not easy to endure \u2013 this type of pain, absolutely torturous.Li Qiye stared at the three hundred disciples ahead, and he beamingly smiled: \u201cAre you all coming out personally, or do I have to kill all the way to the door?\u201d\u201cI will go first to fight against older brother.\u201d Li Qiye had just finished his sentence, and the first to step up was Luo Fenghua. This was not Luo Fenghua's first time to be the vanguard, but this Luo Fenghua coming out first was completely different from the past.Luo Fenghua's talents were not bad; within the three hundred disciples, his aptitude could be considered first or second. His cultivation was not shallow, and he could be said to be someone that was proud and arrogant.When Li Qiye first arrived, he essentially didn't obey. In reality, even after Li Qiye had beaten him with the Serpent Punishing stick, he was still not convinced in both his words and his mind all the way until he was blown away by Li Qiye's one kick, breaking the bones of his body \u2013 this was when he suddenly woke up.Even though Luo Fenghua was arrogant and proud, he wasn't ignorant. Li Qiye's one kick immediately trampled and shattered his bones; the power of this kick made Luo Fenghua realize the terribleness of Li Qiye!At that moment, Luo Fenghua realized that Li Qiye was not a bag of straws like the rumors.Especially after Xu Pei's words that woke the disciples, afterward, each disciple was carefully studying each blow from Li Qiye. One sentence woke the people up from their dreams. Being beaten by Li Qiye, even though the majority of the disciples suffered from agonizing pain, these last three days, caused them all of them to open their eyes. Many meticulous disciples theorized Li Qiye's strikes, and they had fruitful harvests regarding the flaws in their techniques.Especially when these flaws were found out by pain; this made the disciples remember them very well.Luo Fenghua's talents weren't bad, originally. On top of Xu Pei's words, the last three days he had been contemplating, and it gave him not small benefits; he immediately understood Li Qiye's good intentions, and inadvertently, his attitude towards Li Qiye had changed significantly.Li Qiye beamingly smiled at Luo Fenghua, and he slowly said: \u201cEven though you are one part arrogant and prideful, you are not ignorant to the point of stupidity.\u201dArrogant Luo Fenghua; this time, on the other hand, his cheeks were red, he bowed his head, and he said: \u201cPlease guide me from my mistakes, older brother!\u201dThis time, Luo Fenghua was sincere and serious.Li Qiye also didn't say many nonsensical words. He took out the Serpent Punishing stick, and he casually spoke: \u201cMake your move.\u201dLuo Fenghua briefly said: \u201cExcuse me\u2026\" After the words came out, going all out in effort, he let out a long roar; a brilliance \u2013 like a tsunami \u2013 rushed forward. Body like an eagle, stance like an aquatic dragon, commotions in the middle, and accompanied by a dragon tiger.\u201cBang!\u201d Luo Fenghua's technique had only begun, but the Serpent Punishing stick had already directly struck. At the impact point, where his eyes were filled with yellow stars, tears were coming out.Li Qiye, making a move, showed no mercy. One stick struck Luo Fenghua to the point where he couldn't tell North, South, West, and East from each other. One stick came down, and Li Qiye indifferently said: \u201cCombat on the battlefield is to avoid the lightning and fire; if you survive, this is akin to the enemy's death. Between each technique, the best is the one that kills in one blow. Combat on the battlefield, it is truly not a viewing contest \u2013 beautiful techniques are nothing more than the silver decorations at the tip of a spear!\u201d\u201cThe move 'Dragon Seizing the Hawk' in the 'Flying Dragon Fist', is simply to kill, it does not have excessive and unnecessary variations; a form to murder and kill without needless additions.\u201d Li Qiye, once again, struck the body of Luo Fenghua, and he said: \u201cYou considered yourself to be smart, and derived this move into a variation, and then another variation; seemingly profound; however, it is simply drawing legs on a snake, and impairs this killing move!\u201dLuo Fenghua's perception was great; after Li Qiye finished speaking, he immediately changed his technique. The move was filled with a heroic aura and was direct, seemingly rough, like a hatchet chopping wood!\u201cThis move's variation isn't bad; too hard an attack is easily broken. It has to be just right; between hard and soft.\u201d Li Qiye was talking, but his hand never stopped moving. Showing no mercy, one stick repeatedly struck the face of Luo Fenghua until his face and nose were swollen.\u201cBang\u2026 Bang\u2026 Bang\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Luo Fenghua had been struck a dozen times by Li Qiye. Without much effort, Luo Fenghua was knocked down to the ground, and the Serpent Punishing stick rendered him unable to stand up.Being violently struck by the Serpent Punishing stick, Luo Fenghua was groaning from pain; however, his heart was ecstatic. This beating was not wasted as it gave him a fruitful harvest.\u201cNext.\u201d Li Qiye mercilessly brought Luo Fenghua down to the ground, and he said this to the other disciples.\u201cBang!\u201d Finally, an older disciple next to Luo Fenghua went forward; however, after one move, he was struck by Li Qiye's stick on his legs. He immediately fell to his knees.\u201cYour move is too slow!\u201d Li Qiye didn't bat an eye; another club flew out, and the frightened disciple rolled to this side, then the other side, and then he successfully escaped the stick.\u201cBang\u2026 Bang\u2026 Bang\u2026\u201d After a while, the disciple was struck by Li Qiye, and he ended up with a swollen face. He, under the Serpent Punishing stick, had only lasted ten moves; however, these ten moves were not wasted since Li Qiye pointed out his incomplete moves one by one.Half a day later, Li Qiye had finished beating all three hundred disciples. This time, it took longer compared to the past; each time a disciple was beaten, he was pointing out the incomplete variations in the disciple's techniques.Towards any disciple, Li Qiye did not show mercy. All three hundred disciples were beaten until they couldn't stand up; at the moment, they kept on groaning with an unbearable pain. However, despite the tough pain, for many of the disciples, their harvests were great; their being beaten were not in vain!In the next few days, each day Li Qiye was always beating the three hundred disciples one by one. However, all the disciples didn't have any complaints; there were even some disciples that were happy to be beaten. Even though Li Qiye was not showing mercy with his Serpent Punishing stick, however, because of the big results, even worse pain would still have been worth it.The Dao instruction of Li Qiye had left a deep impression on the three hundred disciples. Being beaten by Li Qiye so ruthlessly, even if they didn't want to remember their flaws, it would be difficult. Using pain to trade for learning, it left a lasting impression.Even though the method of Li Qiye's Dao instruction was brutal, each disciple received great benefits. For the disciples, especially in the area of technique variations, these short few days were enough for them to learn truly profound technique variations. When their cultivations had flaws, previously, in the severe beatings, were re-molded.Within the short few days, many disciples showed clear progress. Especially the disciples with good talents such as Luo Fenghua; his progress was even more obvious. Under the molding of Li Qiye, Luo Fenghua grasped the true meaning of his methods, so, within a few short days, each of his techniques and each of his variations were as meticulous as an antelope and as high as the peak.Even though Li Qiye was brutal, his teachings were true knowledge; all of the disciples greatly benefited.Seeing Li Qiye taking great responsibility with his Dao instruction, the disciples, towards Li Qiye, were without grievances.Even though Sectional Leader Zhou rarely beat the disciples during his Dao instruction, Sectional Leader Zhou's Dao instruction was with everyone gathered in one place. The sessions that he instructed on were very short, and they were akin to force-feeding. He presented the cultivation methods and their variations once; whether the disciples could understand, that was up to the individual disciples.The three hundred disciples, each one had different talents and different perceptions. Even if they were to cultivate the same methods and the same techniques, their results would be different. This was why, during the moment of cultivation, there were natural biases. The strange thing was that some disciple's cultivations were completely wrong.Now, with Li Qiye's one-on-one instruction and beating out the flaws of individual disciples, this gave each disciple a clear direction for cultivation. Regarding the profound variations of techniques, their understanding became deeper.So, in just a few days, with regards to the variations of techniques, many disciples had seen the road; some had even taken steps on the road! This delighted many disciple's hearts. A few short days of Li Qiye's instruction were more fruitful than what they were studying for a year, even two or three years!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In fact, only the Six Elders were eligible to attend this meeting.The conference was personally arranged by the first elder. Sitting in his high seat, looking at the other five elders, he gravely said: \u201cWith all five brothers in the same room, let us talk about the King Physique paste matter.\u201dWhen the first elder spoke up, the other five elders couldn't help but glance at each other; they were contemplating. Within the Six Elders, in terms of qualifications and merits, the first elder was the highest.Furthermore, the first elder was the direct disciple of the previous sect master. The status of the first elder, one could say that no one could compare to it at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. However, there was a rumor within the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, that the current sect master, Su Yonghuang, was also a disciple of the previous sect master. The current sect master was thought to be a direct disciple secretly groomed by the previous head.However, regarding this matter, the six elders were aware that this was not the case.Within the Six Elders, with the exception of Cao Xiong, the other four didn't have the ambition to compete for the sect master's seat because they knew, with regards to cultivation or contribution or status, they didn't have the qualifications to compete for the seat.Truthfully, the four elders believed that regarding the matter of the sect master's position, besides the first elder, there was no one else.\u201cWe had previously agreed with Li Qiye that if he could successfully become in-laws with the Nine Saint Demon Gate, we would grant him a King Physique paste.\u201d The first elder looked at the five elders, and he deepened his voice.The four elders went silent, and only Cao Xiong was especially upset in his heart. Li Qiye having an in-law relationship with the Nine Saint Demon Gate; then in the future, this would have a great impact on his disciple, Leng Shizhi, to compete for the head's seat.Cao Xiong had his own plans; even if he had no chance to become the sect master in this lifetime, he still hoped that his disciple, Leng Shizhi, could become the next sect master. In reality, Leng Shizhi did not disappoint his expectations. What gave Cao Xiong deadly anguish was that, at the halfway point, an unfathomable Li Qiye suddenly appeared.If Li Qiye could actually marry Li Shuangyan, on top of his position as the prime disciple, then Cao Xiong was afraid that the matter of him becoming the next Sect Master was inevitable, and he couldn't be shaken by others; this included the current sect master, Su Yonghuang.WIthin the Six Elders, the fourth elder, Elder Sun, stroked his beard up and down, and he nodded his head; he said: \u201cThis matter we had agreed on; Li Qiye was successful on his part, granting the King Physique paste, is something we have to do.\u201dElder Sun was ranked fourth within the elders, and he didn't realize he had unconsciously supported Li Qiye. The reason why Elder Sun was supporting Li Qiye was very simple; it was because his disciple was Protector Mo.Elder Sun did not only have one disciple; in reality, Protector Mo, within his disciples, was not considered excellent. Protector Mo's cultivation was not the weakest within the disciples, but Protector Mo, and his disciple, Nan Huairen, their natures were the complete opposite; Protector Mo was taciturn and lacked social dealings on top of his average cultivation, which was why Elder Sun didn't think Protector Mo could inherit his legacy.Elder Sun thought about supporting another disciple in the future, to inherit his elder seat! However, recently, things have changed. With one sentence from Li Qiye, everything became different all at once! His words turned Protector Mo and Nan Huairen into the ambassadors between the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the Nine Saint Demon Gate. When the Nine Saint Demon Gate's Grand Protector Yu He had any concerns, they were conveyed through Protector Mo and Nan Huairen to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.One had to know that the status of Yu He, in the Old Ox country, was that of a Royal Noble. Even the Six Elders wouldn't necessarily be able to contact him, but, right now, any matters would be informed to Protector Mo and Nan Huairen. Suddenly, the status of Protector Mo and Nan Huairen, at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, had greatly improved.His disciple and grand disciple had gotten great benefits, so naturally, Elder Sun had to support Li Qiye.The first elder spoke: \u201cAs brothers all know, we still have a King Physique paste in our sect.\u201dThis matter only caused the other elders to think, but Cao Xiong's heart was in physical pain. This King Physique paste had been kept for a long time in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. It has been kept since the time of the previous sect master; however, this King Physique paste still had not been used.In fact, the first elder once had a great contribution, and this King Physique paste was meant to be awarded for his usage; however, the first elder was reluctant because he thought that he was already old and limited by his talents. For him to use a King Physique paste would have been a waste.When even the first elder was hesitant to use it, the other elders definitely would not have any intentions, or a reason, to use this King Physique paste.From their thoughts, back then, in the future, if there was an extremely gifted disciple in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, and if this disciple could uphold one direction by himself, then this one King Physique paste would be given to him to mold his body!Currently, this King Physique paste was promised to Li Qiye, and it was a matter that was agreed on by the first elder; the other four elders weren't in a position to say anything. Cao Xiong's heart was in pain, because he had previously thought that this King Physique paste would be given to his disciple, Leng Shizhi, in the future for his second body molding.\u201cHowever, Li Qiye requires the leading beast marrow of this King Physique paste to change to a Hell Iron Bull's beast marrow.\u201dThe first elder said with a deep tone.These words had just came out, but the expressions of the four elders couldn't help but become alarmed; Elder Qian startledly reasoned: \u201cOlder brother, the Hell Iron Bull, this is an extremely rare Heavenly Beast; everyone knows that the beast marrow of a Hell Iron Bull's price on the market is as high as the sky! The beast marrow meant for a King Physique paste, this rank of beast marrow, even at its lowest, would have to be one hundred thousand years old. I'm afraid that this price would frighten people!\u201dThe first elder gently nodded his head, and he said: \u201cI had contacted the auction house; they actually had a Hell Iron Bull's beast marrow, still young, a little more than nine thousand years; this could be considered ten thousand. They were willing to swap the bone marrows with us; however, we have to add one thousand pieces of Ancient Sacred Refined Jade.\u201d\u201cOne thousand pieces of Ancient Sacred Refined Jade?\u201d Having heard this, the fifth elder, named Zhou, his expression greatly soured, and he said: \u201cThis is the lion opening its mouth; with one thousand pieces of Ancient Sacred Refined Jade, we could buy the beast marrow! Two hundred thousand years!\u201d\u201cOlder brother, this Li Qiye, this is giving him an inch and he'll want a mile.\u201d Cao Xiong grasped this rare opportunity, and he seriously said: \u201cThe great matter of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, it is not his place to bargain. He is only a third generation disciple, yet he still dares to propose conditions with us. This whole thing is not showing us any respect! He is being too presumptuous.\u201dThe first elder's expression changed after hearing these words. Cao Xiong continued speaking to the four other elders: \u201cDear brothers, we are all aware that the King Physique paste is precious. This King Physique paste was meant for the third generation disciple, and this was already a great blessing from our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. That ungrateful thing still dared to haggle\u2026\u201cBesides, the origin of Li Qiye's identity is still in question; one could say that he might be a spy! We're giving a priceless King Physique paste to a traitor, is this not throwing meat buns to beat a dog? If we add one thousand pieces of Ancient Sacred Refined Jade, on top of that, then our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect would suffer a heavy loss; who was to say, in the future, that Li Qiye won't defect against us after receiving all of our benefits?\u201d [1]This was an opportunity that was rare for Cao Xiong; he strongly tried to convince the other four elders, and he naturally wouldn't want Li Qiye to obtain this King Physique paste.Elder Wu, ranked sixth within the elders, couldn't help but to try and convince the first elder: \u201cOlder brother, our granting him the King Physique paste is already a great benefaction from our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; Li Qiye, as a third generation disciple, he needs to be aware of this! Moreover, older brother is clear on this; in our sect, the remaining Ancient Sacred Refined Jade isn't much. If, this time, we spend another one thousand pieces, this is not different from emptying our storage; this isn't a trivial matter, ah, older brother.\u201dThe other elders couldn't help but to stare at the first elder; even though they didn't say anything, their perspectives were obvious. Seeing this scene, Cao Xiong was secretly ecstatic. He thought that this matter was half completed; in just a moment, he will fan the fire again. Maybe Li Qiye wouldn't even get the King Physique paste.\u201cOne thousand pieces of Ancient Sacred Refined Jade, this is not worth it.\u201d The third elder also voiced his opinion.It was undeniable that the four elders were truly respectful towards the first elder. The first elder, in their minds, had an extremely high status, and he couldn't be shaken by other people.However, in recent years the situation had changed. Until now, the elders had all hoped that the first elder would take over the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. In their hearts, they rejected the current sect master, Su Yonghuang! Their ideal sect master was the first elder.However, with regards to the sect master's seat, the first elder had never revealed his ambition. As time passed, the other elders couldn't help but become disappointed. Especially in recent years, the first elder appeared to be disheartened, and he no longer had the courageous aura of the early years; this greatly shook the other elder's hearts.On the contrary, Second Elder Cao Xiong had never given up on the sect master's seat. Cao Xiong was too close to Guest Adviser Dong Shenglong; in the elder's hearts, Cao Xiong was not an ideal Sect Master; however, in the future, if they really had to choose between Cao Xiong and Su Yonghuang, they couldn't help but hesitate.Especially in recent times, when Cao Xiong had repeatedly suggested his intention to become Sect Master, making the elder's hearts more or less jolted inside.Today, when First Elder brought this up, Cao Xiong pointed out the important intricacies within, making the four elders rethink their thoughts.Just when Cao Xiong was reaching his opportunity, the first elder suddenly flashed his soaring eyes. In a split second, the first elder's aura greatly pressured others; his whole body exerted and exuded rays of brilliance. At this moment, it was as if the first elder became a different person; his heavenly form flew upward to the sky. With Dao finger incantations in front of his chest, he was brimming with imposing power! Inside this power was a faint presence of a Royal Noble's pressure.The first elder, in the end, was a person that could be bestowed the Named Hero title. Within the Six Elders, he had been in the sect the longest, and he also had the deepest cultivation. He, suddenly exerting his pressure, caused the other elders to be shocked, and they felt the suppressing atmosphere.At this time, the first elder slowly opened his mouth, and he said: \u201cBrothers' oppositions make sense, but brothers must also know the grand circumstance ahead; the Nine Saint Demon Gate, to our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, is extremely vital! Li Qiye, to our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, is just as vital! Without him, there will be no Nine Saint Demon Gate! This is why, regarding this matter, I summoned brothers here hoping that brothers would approve this matter!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was no longer a question. When he spoke these words, there was no other road; the other elders had to agree.The aura of First Elder was aggressively frightening, and, in the blink of an eye, it shook the hearts of the other elders. Even Cao Xiong's expression couldn't help but greatly change!The support of the four elders, for the first elder, had been shaken in these last two or three years; however, today, when the first elder suddenly exerted his imposing aura, it made the other elder's hearts tremor and linger in the middle. It was as if their old brother from that year was now present again. That year, the first elder was the one who made all the big decisions for the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. and, that year, the first elder's imposing aura was just like this.Cao Xiong's expression soured; during these recent years, his ambition for the sect master's seat had not lessened. However, the first elder was downhearted and decadent, this made Cao Xiong not put him in his eyes. After all, he was not necessarily worse than the first elder! If they were to complete for the sect master's seat, again, the first elder was not his opponent.Now, the first elder suddenly, and abruptly, started a storm, and this made Cao Xiong once again realize that the first elder was still the pillar of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!\u201cIf older brother thinks that Li Qiye is worth grooming, then I support older brother's decision.\u201d In the end, Elder Sun, master of Protector Mo, was the first to express his opinion.The third elder was silent for a moment, and he then finally expressed his view as well: \u201cIf older brother truly wants to groom Li Qiye, the let it be so. Hopefully he won't betray your heart's blood.\"These words were, without a doubt, an agreement to the first elder.The fifth elder was contemplating as well, and he then said: \u201cThis time, I agree with older brother's decision.\u201dSuddenly, all four elders agreed to accept this decision. This decision was made, not because of Li Qiye's merits, but because of the first elder. The four elders faintly felt that the first elder's ambition had not decayed. They hoped that the first elder could, once again, shoulder the burdens of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.Earlier, Cao Xiong had many little calculations in his mind, thinking about how to not let Li Qiye obtain the King Physique paste; however, the sudden reversal rendered all of Cao Xiong's schemes unusable. It made Cao Xiong startled, and he stood in the same spot, unable to accept the reality.At the Cleansing Jade Peak, Li Qiye had beaten the three hundred disciples for more than ten days, and he then molded the disciples, regardless of their cultivations and flawed techniques.To this day, the three hundred disciples at the Cleansing Jade Peak were convinced by Li Qiye in both their words and their minds. Even the arrogant Luo Fenghua, towards Li Qiye, was convinced with both his words and his mind.Xu Pei became the oldest sister of the three hundred disciples. Xu Pei's age was higher than Li Qiye by not just a little; however, she was timid and lacked her own opinions. Under the devil-like training in these last ten days, Li Qiye was trying to polish Xu Pei; not only in her incompleted techniques, but also her Dao willpower in order to increase her confidence.In the blink of an eye, half a month had quickly passed. Today, Li Qiye climbed to his high stand. In reality, Li Qiye didn't come alone. Serving by Li Qiye was no longer Nan Huairen, but Li Shuangyan.The truth was, this was not Li Shuangyan's first time accompanying Li Qiye to the Cleansing Jade Peak. The first time she had visited, there was a large wave within the three hundred disciples. After all, to these disciples who were not officially in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, a heavenly goddess like Li Shuangyan was an existence in the legends.The descendant of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, princess of the Old Ox country, the heaven's prideful daughter, and a cultivation genius. Any of these titles was enough to startle these disciples. To some of the disciples, Li Shuangyan was unreachable.However, under Li Qiye's instruction, Li Shuangyan recently had been showing up with Li Qiye to the Cleansing Jade Peak more often, making the three hundred disciples slowly accept Li Shuangyan's existence.Li Shuangyan was perplexed regarding Li Qiye's ruthless Dao instructions; however, within a few days of witnessing Li Qiye pointing out their black hearts, revealing the incomplete and flawed techniques of the disciples, and this caused Li Shuangyan's heart to shake!She could tell that the Serpent Punishing stick was a magical treasure. However, with just the Serpent Punishing stick, it wasn't enough for Li Qiye to correctly point out the flaws of many techniques. Without a doubt, Li Qiye grasped the profound truths behind these methods and techniques.The Cleansing Jade Peak's disciples weren't practicing peerless merit laws, but, in order to grasp the profound truths of dozens of merit laws and understand the mysterious arts, was this such an easy thing?Moreover, many of these foundational merit laws came from the hands of Immortal Emperor Min Ren. The simpler the merit law, the more majestic the aura; to truly grasp the profound truths was not an easy thing.Without a doubt, currently, Li Qiye had never practiced these merit laws, but he had grasped the profound truths of these techniques! Such a phenomenon was shown by a thirteen year old boy with a Mortal Physique, Mortal Life Wheel, and Mortal Fate Palace; this was truly inconceivable!Li Qiye, on his high platform, looked at his fellow disciples, and he started to speak: \u201cToday's lesson is a lecture on the foundational mysteriousness of the Jade Spiral Merit Law. This is one of the most basic merit laws in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, and one third of all disciples practice this merit law. If a disciple does not practice this merit law, they could choose to not listen.\u201dCurrently, Xu Pei was the leader of the three hundred disciples. She suddenly heard Li Qiye's announcement, and she couldn't help but exclaim: \u201cOlder brother, we\u2026 Our lesson today isn't getting hit?\u201dLi Qiye beamingly smiled at Xu Pei, and he said: \u201cWhat, our younger sister is addicted to being beaten? One day without a beating, and your whole body wouldn't be comfortable?\u201d\u201cN-no, not at all\u2026\u201d Li Qiye's words immediately made Xu Pei blush; her face reddened, and she immediately shook her head to deny.In fact, when Li Qiye had started his lecture, the other disciples were expecting it as well. Li Qiye had beaten them for the last ten days, so they were almost numb to the painful sensation.With his lecture starting, all three hundred disciples didn't leave the field, and they stayed to listen in amazement. Currently, the three hundred disciples had absolute faith in Li Qiye. Li Qiye was already able to point out the flaws in their techniques; currently, when he was speaking about profound truths, it definitely would not be worse.Currently, the disciples had forgotten that Li Qiye's entrance to the sect was later than them. His talent was worse, and his age was also young. Before they knew it, Li Qiye had become the oldest brother in their hearts; the prime disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.At the moment Li Qiye finally started his lecture, the disciples immediately lost their thoughts, and they listened with great pleasure.Not mentioning the three hundred disciples, even Li Shuangyan, who was known as a genius and standing next to Li Qiye, was also carefully listening; she would not regain her flippant thoughts for a long time.The Jade Spiral Merit Law was the most basic merit law of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; it could refine the Life Wheel and Fate Palace, and it belonged to an all-purpose type of merit law. It was well received in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. In reality, this merit law in the sect was not considered confidential or anything. Any disciple could spread this method \u2013 even to the mortal world \u2013 because this method was too ordinary; it was definitely an all-purpose common merit law.This type of merit law, in the Grand Middle Territory, was as common as the hairs on an ox. This type of merit law, to the new disciples of many sects, was disdained as beneath contempt.However, this most rudimentary foundational merit law, today, in the words of Li Qiye, was like the deluge of heavenly flowers and the golden spring rushing forth from the earth. Li Qiye continuously spoke, using simplicity to solve complications and shallow light to enter the profound darkness. From his mouth, profound truths came out in the form of words; this caused listeners to become dazed like they were intoxicated.If there was a person who was still completely showing conscious towards anything but the lesson, they would wonder whether this was only a rudimentary foundational merit law. The Jade Spiral Merit Law, under the preaching of Li Qiye, had become a true guiding principle of cultivation.In fact, the Jade Spiral Merit Law was, indeed, a true guiding principle of merit laws. Even though it was coarse, it still contained the blood and thoughts of the human race in the long searched road of the grand Dao.The merit law was inherited since the Desolate Era. During that era, ten thousand races were trying to find the grand Dao. One could say that the Jade Spiral Merit Law was one of the beginning merit laws of the many immortal sages \u2013 from the human race \u2013 at the start of their cultivation. Even though it was superficial, but this was an excellent merit law for new beginners. This merit law was fair and honest as well as gentle and mild; it was suitable for laying down the first foundation.In that year, when Li Qiye and Immortal Emperor Min Ren had built the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, they had taught many disciples this merit law. However, later on, when the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect obtained Emperor merit laws, not many disciples were willing to learn this merit law any longer.Currently, only the disciples who had not officially entered the sect was willing to study this method! In reality, it was because they had no other choices.Once Li Qiye had finished his lecture, many disciples had still not regained their wits for a long time. Li Shuangyan was the first to regain her composure, and she couldn't help but quiver in astonishment!Li Shuangyan stared at Li Qiye with amazement. The Jade Spiral Merit Law, this ordinary merit law that couldn't be any more ordinary, she had read it multiple times. For a genius like her, this foundational merit law, she had only needed to read it once to understand the profound truths within.However, after having heard Li Qiye's lecture, she immediately thought that her understanding of this merit law, prior, was superficial and shallow. Under the teachings of Li Qiye, this coarse merit law became the general principle of the Dao.These profound truths, these understandings \u2013 this was impossible to imagine. Even her master, Demon King Lun Ri, wouldn't be able to preach such mysterious truths.Moreover, these truths of Li Qiye were not unbending and stiff; these truths, from this merit law, in the words of Li Qiye, seemed to say that he was already a grandmaster of this merit law.How could Li Shuangyan know that, after Li Qiye had read the Jade Spiral Merit law, his memories regarding the method came back? The profound truths of this merit law, it wasn't only just Li Qiye's enlightenment throughout the ages, but it was also the combination of the blood and thoughts of countless human race ancestors in the Desolate Era. Li Qiye was simply combining the profound truths of this merit law in one place.That year, this merit law was considered to be one of the most important foundational merit laws of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Immortal Emperor Min Ren's most powerful generals had all practiced this merit law.Only later, when Immortal Emperor Min Ren had obtained the Heaven's Will, and the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, having an Emperor merit law, was the moment the descendants looked down on practicing this method.[1] Downhearted and decadent raw texts were 2 idioms, four words each. Heart (became) Ash Mind Cold, Dejectedly Crippled Old Weak were the eight characters.[2] Heart's blood meaning expectation.[3] Another idiom, to be convinced by someone with both their words and their minds is to completely respect that person.[4] Black heart here meaning her hidden thoughts.[5] Five four-words proses just in this paragraph.[6] Unbending and stiff here meant that the content was more or less regurgitated, not natural.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Emperor\u2019s DominationEmperor's Domination Chapter 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Qiye's Dao lecture caused Li Shuangyan to be shocked; just the Jade Spiral Merit Law alone was enough for her to feel that it was impossible. Afterward, Li Qiye started to preach the other foundational merit laws of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. He spoke continuously like he had them memorized on the palm of his hand, from shallow to deep, and from simple to complex; indescribably wonderful, just like the deluge of heavenly flowers and the golden spring rushing forth from the earth.Li Qiye, in one breath, explained several foundational merit laws of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. He spoke about the profound truths, he taught the mysterious meanings, and he left behind an everlasting impression without comparison, giving others a fresh feeling.Since Li Shuangyan had read these foundational merit laws, before and after, she had meticulously understood them; it caused her to have an even greater surprise. Even though these merit laws were superficially simple; however, with her current cultivation and with her current Dao understanding, she wouldn't be able to preach such profound truths like Li Qiye.This discovery impacted her and shook her very foundation. Li Shuangyan was the heaven's prideful daughter; she had a King Physique and a Saint Fate Palace. It wasn't an undeserved reputation regarding her talents or Physique, or even her Dao understanding. Not eyeing just the whole Grand Middle Territory, even the whole Mortal Emperor world, she would still be a named genius.However, her explanation of the Dao truths and her understanding of the profound truths, even with her current cultivation, were left far behind by Li Qiye. This sort of thing, to appear in an ordinary person with a Mortal Physique, Mortal Life Wheel, and Mortal Fate Palace; it was never seen before. However, when things like this happened to Li Qiye, everything felt like it was a natural matter.At this moment, Li Shuangyan couldn't help but lament over the fact that, regarding the spotting of geniuses, she was far inferior to her master, Demon King Lun Ri. In the beginning, she had thought that her master had chosen Li Qiye because of the four Heavenly Guardian golems, but seeing what was before her eyes, this was far from the truth.Li Qiye went from rotten to magical, and this caused Li Shuangyan to feel an incomparable astonishment. She couldn't see through Li Qiye, a young boy who was younger than her. His unfathomable existence has to be a miracle!Li Qiye's Dao lesson was entering its closing stage; he originally wanted to correct the incomplete moves of these disciples, and that also served as a way to earn the respect of this arrogant and unruly group. After was the Dao instruction meant to create a complete foundation for their cultivation in order to avoid flaws within their merit laws; otherwise, it would have an adverse effect on the rest of their cultivation lives.In fact, since the ancient ages, many cultivators only needed to practice the most powerful merit laws. In the future, they could step into the apex ranks. Many cultivators, ancient immortal heritages, and even major figures teaching their disciples had thought that this was the case.However, after innumerable years of ups and downs, regarding the insights within Dao instructions, other people couldn't compare to Li Qiye. To Li Qiye \u2013 a cultivator, at the beginning of cultivation \u2013 the most important thing was not a world-shattering method, but a proper understanding of morality and an awareness of the grand Dao foundation. If, in the beginning, one's morality and foundational Dao understanding had diverged from the main road, then in the future, it would be difficult to change; this negatively affected the ideals of Dao cultivation.Lastly, Li Qiye wanted to show the direction to the three hundred disciples of the Cleansing Jade Peak. In reality, these disciples were limited in their foundational cultivations with the introductory merit laws, plus they were also in the early and superficial stages; it was difficult to spot flaws. However, Li Qiye did not take this matter lightly, and, without any carelessness, he examined all the individual disciples.Physique, Life Wheel, Fate Palace, and the Dao willpower affected and reinforced each other; Li Qiye had his own insights. Regarding this matter, Li Qiye was absolutely the unparalleled grandmaster!Thus, as he checked the base of each disciple, he could formulate the most exact explanations!During Li Qiye's examination, Luo Fenghua was the first leading horse; the first to stand out. He had greatly changed. Before, the most disrespectful towards Li Qiye was him; the one who opposed Li Qiye the most was also him; however, he was currently one of Li Qiye's biggest admirers.Sectional Leader Zhou taught the Dao to him for several years, but it was not equal to Li Qiye's Dao instruction of a few days. With such an obvious gap, a talented person like Luo Fenghua naturally understood who was a true mentor; he was not a fool.Under Li Qiye's command, Luo Fenghua was floating his Shou Life Wheel, Xuan Fate Palace, and Zhan Physique; he activated his Fate Palace and Life Wheel merit laws so that Li Qiye could thoroughly check them.\u201cYou practiced very thoroughly; the Dao foundation is without flaws. However, you were too anxious with ranking up; in the future, do not be hot-tempered and impatient. Step-by-step improvement is not a bad thing. Do not only see the cultivation rank ahead as you need to have a vision for the future.\u201d Li Qiye was impressed with Luo Fenghua since he indeed had some talents.After hearing Li Qiye's view, Luo Fenghua stepped back with joy.\u201cYou belong to the Night Owl Physique. On the basis of Dao foundation, with an emphasis on lightness. In the future, with your cultivation, emphasize flying bird types, and you should take the road of quick and violent.\u201cThere is an insufficient ferocious strength, but there is an abundance of yin; this seems to be the Early Form Fate Palace. You cannot single-mindedly pursue the ranks; it is as if you were just expanding your Fate Palace. You need to use your Fate Palace to revolve your Life Wheel in order to refine your Physique to its max potential. Slow down your cultivation speed, and you should use more time to rebuild your Physique.\u201cA girl doesn't necessarily have to practice a gentle yin method. Your blood qi is yang, and your Life Wheel is extremely fast. In the future, you should have a bias for firm and yang cultivational methods because your Life Wheel directly affects your Physique\u2026\u201dLi Qiye examined the Dao foundations for each disciple. After his examinations, he would give out exact advice.Li Shuangyan was still by Li Qiye's side, keeping him company, and she continued to be astonished by his suggestions. Li Qiye's current achievements, once again, pushed her to a different door. Before, when Li Qiye was preaching, she assumed that Li Qiye's Dao understandings were beyond comprehension.However, with Li Qiye's current explanations for Dao cultivation, this was outside the realm of understanding cultivational methods. This matter, it didn't matter how high one's talents and aptitudes were, as one couldn't simply be enlightened with these explanations.These explanations were accumulated through time, accumulated through the months and the years. These explanations, only someone who was very far along on the grand road of Dao would be able to accumulate.If someone said that her master, Demon King Lun Ri, would have this knowledge, she wouldn't be shocked because her master, as of today, had experienced countless grinding and polishing. With regards to cultivation, his understanding was truly deep.However, the thing that was impossible to understand was that Li Qiye was only thirteen or fourteen years old. Right now, Li Qiye and his insightful form made Li Shuangyan question whether this was the first time that he had cultivated.Taking ten thousand steps back, even if this was not Li Qiye's first time cultivating, as a thirteen or fourteen-year-old, how could his knowledge be so deep?The last person to step up for the examination was Zhang Yu. Zhang Yu stepped forward, and he couldn't help but rub his hands together; his voice was very soft, and he asked: \u201cBro\u2013brother, does my, my practice have any problems?\u201dThe time since Zhang Yu had joined the sect was longer than Luo Fenghua's group. One could even say that Zhang Yu was one of the longest-running disciples. His age was high; however, no one knew why, in these recent years, his cultivation was always near the bottom.This was not because Zhang Yu did not try. On the contrary, Zhang Yu was one of the hardest working and diligent disciples, but his cultivation, nevertheless, had always been in the back.Zhang Yu was the type without many words. As his cultivation grew difficult to increase, even by a half step, he became even more silent, saying fewer words than before. Many disciples in the Cleansing Jade Peak had thought that his talents were not great, and even Sectional Leader Zhou thought this way. This was why Sectional Leader Zhou ignored him during Dao instruction, didn't question his cultivation, and left him to live and die by himself.When Zhang Yu showed his Shou Life Wheel, Xuan Fate Palace, and Zhan Physique, and showed Li Qiye his Dao foundation; one could see that his Life Wheel was faint, his Fate Palace was unstable, only the Physique had an indistinct sound of a cow mooing.Li Qiye examined Zhang Yu's condition; he couldn't help but change his expression. He stared at Zhang Yu and said: \u201cWhy are you practicing the Beneficence Water Longevity Law? This type of Life Wheel merit law, was it chosen by you?\u201dZhang Yu scratched his head, and he said: \u201cI, I, I, Sectional Leader Zhou said, I am a Houtian Physique; a Water Ox Physique. So, he picked the Beneficence Water Longevity Law, and he said it would express the water affinity of the blood qi!\u201d\u201cTruly not knowing east from west!\u201d Li Qiye coldly scowled, and he said: \u201cHampering the student's progress! Houtian Physique is not wrong, but this is not the Water Ox Physique. You have the Primordial Chaos Ox Physique!\"A Houtian Physique was not like Xiantian Physique or Mortal Physique in that it could become an King Physique, Saint Physique, or Immortal Physique. Although it couldn't increase in rank, this didn't mean that a Houtian Physique would be weak.Houtian has its own evolution procedure. Normally, the Water Ox Physique, through the cultivation with a formidable Physique merit law, could evolve into the strongest Kui Ox Physique. When Kui Ox Physique was practiced to its strongest form, even someone with a Saint Physique would change their expression.\u201cPrimordial Chaos Ox Physique? There, there is a physique like this?\u201d Zhang Yu was in a daze, he had never heard of this physique before.\u201cOf course there is.\u201d Li Qiye indifferently said: \u201cYour physique is it.\u201dIn fact, the Primordial Chaos Physique was extremely rare, and there were many uses for this physique.Li Qiye glanced at him once, and he said: \u201cYou have practiced the wrong longevity law. If you continue, there will not be a half step of improvement.\u201d\u201cWell, well, what should I do then?\u201d Zhang Yu's face became pale with fear, and didn't know what to do in the moment.Li Qiye replied: \u201cTear down everything and rebuild once more; practice the Jade Spiral Merit Law! This merit law is gentle, and it is the most basic foundational merit law. It reinforces the Life Wheel, Fate Palace, and the Physique. This merit law is the most fitting for you!\u201dZhang Yu jumped up from being frightened, and he quickly said: \u201cHowever, the assessment is, is less than a year from now.\u201dLi Qiye looked at him once, and he calmly responded: \u201cIs the assessment important? Or is the road to your future important? If you don't pass the assessment, you could try to retake the test again. After another ten years, if you want to tear down your Dao foundation to rebuild it, I'm afraid you would have wasted your best years. It is best to carefully think about this.\u201dAt this point, many disciples sympathetically looked at Zhang Yu. He practiced hard for five years, and now, he has to tear away everything and rebuild it. This was a matter that was difficult to accept for anyone. Just like this, five years of blood and tears were completely wasted.For most people, they would not want to break and rebuild. If they missed this assessment, they would have to wait another five years; not everyone was willing to wait.[1] Moral is used different here, it is saying to be moral/true to oneself. It is not referring to societal moral completely, although a certain righteousness and justice are usually associated with the path of Dao.[2] The prefixes in front of the Life Wheel, Fate Palace, and Physique seemed to be their more official names \u2013 I didn't translate because their meanings were already very close to the three things.[3] Yin and Yang, yin = softness/feminine, yang = hard/masculine in this case.[4] Couple of idioms in this one. Type without many words is self-explanatory, leaving him to live and die by himself = leaving him to fend for himself.[5] Hampering the students progress is an idiom meant to criticize teachers for their incompetence.Hampering the students progress is an idiom meant to criticize teachers for their incompetence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 61": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Emperor\u2019s DominationEmperor's Domination Chapter 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhang Yu's face was sometimes white and sometimes green. There were important intricacies; he understood this. Five years of sweat and blood was suddenly ruined since he had wasted these five years of cultivation.\u201cIf you can't decide at the moment, you should go back and think it over. After you have figured it out, you can come find me.\u201d Li Qiye did not force him. One's road, in the end, had to be walked by the person personally; if he lacked this decisiveness, then wanting to polish a firm Dao willpower would just merely be empty words.\u201cI, I destroy! I, I will practice the Jade Spiral Merit Law!\u201d Li Qiye had only just finished his words before Zhang Yu had already gritted his teeth and firmly said what he had thought with strong determination.Li Qiye only nodded his head, and he didn't say anything else. He told Li Shuangyan, who was standing by his side: \u201cDestroy his cultivation; he will start all over again.\u201dWith regards to Li Qiye, the current Li Shuangyan was without the slightest hesitation, and she immediately took action.Eventually, Li Qiye had finished examining the cultivation of the disciples. One could say that the majority of the disciples didn't have any major flaws. The only big flaw was the grave situation of Zhang Yu.After the Dao examination of all of the disciples, everyone was on track. Li Qiye began to let go, allowing his disciples to self-cultivate, reaffirm their Dao foundation, clear their moral stance, and correct their merit laws. Then, the next step was for them to personally cultivate. Thinking up to this step, Li Qiye had already led the Cleansing Jade Peak on the road of cultivation. He would no longer support them one by one. He would let them go on their own cultivation path; however, once in awhile, he would take the time to pass on the Dao instructions for those disciples.For countless moons and ages, even Immortal Emperors were groomed by him. Li Qiye was more clear than anyone that no matter how fantastic a disciple's talents were, if he didn't let go and held their hand the whole way, then those disciples, in the end, would not be able to grow. He would have no way of holding up a direction by them self! Without experiencing the rain and wind, how could one meet the rainbow?After letting go, Li Qiye started to focus on his own cultivation. In reality, because of the Dao instructions for the Cleansing Jade Peak disciples, Li Qiye had really slowed down his own cultivation speed.Currently, Li Qiye was at the Physique Accumulation rank, at the Blood Strengthening stage. Moreover, his Blood Strengthening stage had already reached grand perfection as he stepped towards the Body Tempering stage. To Li Qiye, this was a good time to temper his body one more time.At this moment, Li Qiye took out an ancient box. If Li Shuangyan was here, maybe she would be able to recognize this ancient box. This was the ancient box taken from the Saint Cavern of the Nine Saint Demon Gate. In fact, the elders of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, as well as Demon King Lun Ri, did not know what was inside the ancient box. Perhaps even Demon King Lun Ri found it strange that Li Qiye did not select an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure, but chose this nameless ancient box instead. What could actually be inside?In principle, when a disciple reached the Physique Accumulation rank, at the Blood Strengthening stage, the sect would reward them with a Longevity Treasure! However, currently, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had been declining, and their treasure storage was limited. If they had to reward a Longevity Treasure for even the outer disciples, the treasure storage of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect would not be able to handle it!A Longevity Treasure's major role was to prolong life and nourish the blood. Longevity Treasures and Fate Devices were the two major treasures of a cultivator; the majority of cultivators all have a Longevity Treasure and a Fate Device!A Fate Device, whether it was a Life Treasure or True Treasure, its main effects would be to protect the Fate Palace and attack the enemy. Under the majority of situations, only on the battlefield would there be a need for a Fate Device.A Longevity Treasure was different, it was necessary at any moment. A Longevity Treasure could prolong the life of a cultivator, but it could also strengthen the flesh and strength of its possessor; it could even refine the longevity blood of a cultivator.A Longevity Treasure, in battle, could also have great effects. When the blood energy was depleted in a battle, one could activate the Longevity Treasure, and in a short time, it could replenish the missing blood energy. It could even provide a burst of strength for the cultivator, increasing his combat effectiveness!Li Qiye opened the ancient box, and inside the box were two objects, lying down like blood pearls; two drops of blood pearl, seemingly ordinary. They were formed by the condensation of two drops of fresh blood.However, with meticulous observation, one would find that the two blood pearls seemingly hid an endless amount of blood energy; it was as if they were two huge seas of blood. Plus, these two blood pearls were different, one blood pearl seemingly had a circular Golden Sun, slowly ascending, while the other blood pearl was akin to a circular Mysterious Moon, floating up and down without break!\u201cYin Yang Sea of Blood\u2026\u201d He grasped the two seemingly ordinary blood pearls in his palm. Li Qiye gently sighed, reminiscing; the bloody battle that year seemed like it was just yesterday.That year, Immortal Emperor Min Ren's grand Dao had been completed, shouldering the Heaven's Will, commanding countless heavenly generals, and sweeping through the nine heavens and ten earths; nothing could have blocked his path! Immortal Emperor Min Ren's first battlefield, he became an Immortal Emperor while shouldering the Heaven's Will, it was an ancient Forbidden Burial Ground with tremendous viciousness!As the Dark Crow during that moment, his form was becoming unstable; however, he still hoped to see Min Ren's first battle. To any Immortal Emperor, the first battle was very important; it was an opportunity to refine the Heaven's Will.Li Qiye chose an ancient Forbidden Burial Ground for Min Ren! Even though, at that moment, Li Qiye did not personally lead the army; however, he still watched this battle's murderous scene as the heaven fell and the earth was rended, killing to the point where the sun and moon no longer shined.That year during this battle, the heaven's dome was broken, and ten thousand fields were stamped out! In the end, Immortal Emperor Min Ren, with his horse leading the charge, penetrated into the deepest depths of the ancient Forbidden Burial Ground.That year in the deepest depths of the Forbidden Burial Ground, one of the spoils was this ancient box currently in front of him! That year, Li Qiye was approaching his deep slumber. From his personal perspective, he had hoped that Immortal Emperor Min Ren would use the Yin Yang Sea of Blood to craft an Immortal Emperor Longevity Treasure that belonged to just him.However, because Immortal Emperor Min Ren had accepted the Heaven's Will, he had complete confidence in himself. He personally had a Longevity Treasure that was already frightening through the eons, so he was not willing to waste this treasure. In the end, he rewarded the treasure to Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon who exerted the most effort in this battle, as a praise.Afterward, Li Qiye went into his deep slumber, and he didn't further inquire on this matter. He assumed that Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon had already used the Yin Yang Sea of Blood to create his own Longevity Treasure, until the moment that he opened the Saint Cavern. He now realized that Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon didn't use this treasure.The moment that he opened the door, he finally understood that, when Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon told him to take care of the Nine Saint Demon Gate in the future and that he had left an indescribable treasure within, he was referring to the Yin Yang Sea of Blood.\u201cDnggggg\u201d When Li Qiye dropped the two blood pearls into his Life Wheel, his whole body shook. Instantly, there were two seas of blood encompassing his whole Life Wheel. With the blink of an eye, his Life Wheel reddened with bright auras, and it flooded through his entire body.Within the sea of blood, the highest formidable vital energy came out; instantly, his Life Wheel was on the verge of fragmenting, and the Fate Palace became unstable. Even his physical body suffered from the impact. Countless amounts of vital energy pushed forward as if it wanted to break the body of Li Qiye!\u201cBang\u2026 Bang\u2026 Bang\u2026\u201d At this moment, the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law, with the most powerful gesture, pulled the two seas of blood, filled with vital energy, with its utmost potential to bring the vital energy from the seas of blood into the Life Wheel.If it was any other longevity merit law, it essentially wouldn't be able to pull this type of vital energy. A small horse can't pull a large cart as, naturally, the pulling would be unsuccessful. However, the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law was heavenly defying. The stronger the blood energy, the more energy was used to pull even harder. Instantly, the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law had brought a large amount of vital energy into the Life Wheel.However, the Yin Yang Sea of Blood origin could flood the whole sky. Even an Immortal Emperor would be interested. The Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law, at this current cultivation, couldn't use all of the vital energy; thus, it couldn't move all of it into the Life Wheel!Suddenly, monstrous waves of vital energy drowned out Li Qiye's body and Fate Palace. This extreme vital energy was on the verge of destroying his body and Fate Palace in the blink of an eye.In this very dangerous moment, Li Qiye's Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique finally bursted. The sound of \u201cBang, Bang, Bang\u201d rang aloud as if the heavenly chains of hell were dragged. Each heavenly chain was akin to one million soldiers in power, and each of them suppressed this vital energy that had covered the sky. Using an extremely oppressive presence to forcefully bring the energy into the physical body of Li Qiye, he pressured it into the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique!Meanwhile, inside the Fate Palace of Li Qiye, the Kun Peng's Six Variants turned into a gigantic Kun Peng. It opened its mouth and sucked a large portion of vital energy. This swallowing process was as if the Kun Peng could suck in an endless sea. The Dao foundation turned into a Kun Peng, countless vital energies were absorbed, and sent to the True Fate! Instantly, the True Fate inside the Fate Palace became blindingly bright, extremely spectacular!Under the suppression of the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law, Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique, and Kun Peng's Six Variants, in the end, the two seas of blood inside the Life Wheel of Li Qiye finally calmed down. The two seas of blood combined together into one, one yin one yang, and, like a Yin Yang fish, it swam without breaks inside the sea of blood.At this time, the Yin Yang Sea of Blood was feeding the Life Wheel of Li Qiye, strengthening him with vital energy. The Life Wheel, in turn, with vital blood, washed the muscles and bones of Li Qiye's entire body. Each strand of vital blood was spread throughout the bone marrow of Li Qiye; it gave him the feeling of a new body \u2013 he was reborn!Unknowingly, Li Qiye had achieved the stage of Body Tempering. Borrowing the Yin Yang Sea of Blood to refine his vital blood, he then used this to wash his Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique; this caused his Physique to have a minor improvement!The Yin Yang sea was like the Yin Yang fish, they were moving constantly inside his Life Wheel. At this time, the sea of blood was seemingly calm; however, Li Qiye knew that with his current cultivation, he couldn't even utilize one part out of the ten thousands of the Yin Yang Sea of Blood! If he could truly activate the heavenly power of the Yin Yang Sea of Blood, this would frighten the heaven and shake the earth, the blood would penetrate the nine firmaments, and the Gods and Demons would tremble!When Li Qiye withdrew his cultivation, without realizing it, Li Shuangyan was outside of his door. At this moment, Li Shuangyan's beautiful pair of eyes stared at Li Qiye intensely.\u201cWhat devil merit law are you cultivating?\u201d At this point, Li Shuangyan's countenance was incomparably emotional. She originally was inside her own pavilion sitting down, but suddenly, she felt an ancient and vast vital energy beginning to flow; however, all of a sudden, it disappeared.This change was only for a moment, but it didn't escape the heavenly sense of Li Shuangyan; she knew this fluctuation was from the body of Li Qiye.Because the vital energy and blood energy was too powerful, it raised Li Shuangyan's suspicion. She thought that he was practicing a devil merit law!Facing Li Shuangyan's question, Li Qiye was only smiling, and he then said calmly: \u201cDo I need to cultivate a devil merit law?\u201dLi Shuangyan, with a surprised look, glanced at Li Qiye for a split moment. In the end, she didn't inquire any further, and she then turned around and left.[1] Longevity Treasure and Fate Device are the sub-categories for Life Treasures/True Treasures.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Emperor\u2019s DominationEmperor's Domination Chapter 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Qiye's Dao instruction and his own cultivation were going well in an orderly manner. Another month had quickly passed. This whole time Nan Huairen had never appeared, and Protector Mo had not showed up either.During that time, Nan Huairen was an ambassador of another sect, so even with his lack of presence, Li Qiye was not surprised. However, as for Protector Mo, it was a bit outside of Li Qiye's expectations.\u201cOh, oh, oh, big brother! You stand tall and see far with penetrating insights, and you understand the grand Dao so well! You could teach any mysterious sacred technique!\u201d Seeing Li Qiye, Nan Huairen rubbed his palms together and cheerfully smiled.Li Qiye glared at him: \u201cSince you already stay by my side to handle matters, stop tapping the horse's butt. If you have gas, just hurry up and fart.\u201dNan Huairen's face became red, but his expression was still natural. He was indeed a person that believes long sleeves would help one dance beautifully.He smiled said: \u201cThis younger brother requests for older brother to give my cultivation some pointers.\u201dLi Qiye looked at Nan Huairen, then Protector Mo to the side, then calmly said: \u201cThis was Protector Mo's idea.\u201dBeing figured out by Li Qiye, Protector Mo's face became red. He couldn't help but to forcefully smile, he said: \u201cI'm just interested in hearing your wise opinion.\u201dIn reality, during the days of Li Qiye's Dao instruction, Nan Huairen was outside of the sect. Protector Mo, on the other hand, was still here and inadvertently heard Li Qiye's Dao instruction. He was startled because an elementary merit law like the Jade Spiral Merit Law, even his master wouldn't be able to preach with such resonance with the grand Dao. His accidental hearing of Li Qiye's preaching granted him great benefits.So, this intrigued Protector Mo; right now, from his perspective, Li Qiye had a peerless perception regarding Dao instruction. He was afraid that there was no one that could compare to him in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. He wanted to be examined like Li Qiye as well, just like he did with the disciples at the Cleansing Jade Peak. However, in the end, he was a protector. Because he personally was a person of few words, he did not know how to deal with people; thus, he didn't know how to ask Li Qiye.This was why, after Nan Huairen's return, he immediately asked Nan Huairen to come here for advice.Nan Huairen quickly smoothed things over for his master. He smiled \u201cheh heh\u201d and said: \u201cMaster said that big brother's cultivation is high, so your little brother will thick-facedly ask for your advice.\u201dLi Qiye didn't look at Nan Huairen. He glared at Protector Mo, and he coldly said: \u201cWe're on the same side; if there is a matter, just be frank about it.\u201dHere, he didn't have any other words. The rest was up for them to contemplate.Protector Mo could see his future from these words. The moment they had joined Li Qiye, with one sentence to Yu He, Li Qiye had propelled their status. Right now, Li Qiye was saying this; even if Protector Mo was foolish, he would still be able to understand the implications behind them.\u201cWhat you both are practicing is the minor Emperor merit law 'Violet Cloud' right?\u201d Li Qiye looked at the master and disciple as he said this.\u201cThis is correct.\u201d Protector Mo repeatedly nodded his head: \u201cI presently have climbed to the Heaven's Primal rank, but reaching the heaven's will Primal God seems to be a bit too strenuous.\u201dAs a protector of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, Protector Mo's aptitude, within the protectors, wasn't the highest; however, he unendingly cultivated without break, so his cultivation had ascended to the Heaven's Primal rank.\u201cA minor merit law, in the end, is still minor; in order to cultivate the heaven's will Primal God, it is completely true that this isn't such an easy matter.\u201dHeaven Primal rank was a boundary for cultivators. Once they have reached this rank, to take an extra step, it was harder than grabbing the sky. At this rank, it was not just dependent on one's aptitude and talents, but it also depended on one's merit law, Heavenly Magnificent Treasures, and other various aspects\u2026Li Qiye spoke: \u201cViolet Cloud is a minor merit law originating from the main Emperor merit law 'Violet Yang Ten Sun' of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Reaching the Heaven's Primal rank, if one also cultivates the Violet Yang Ten Sun, it would be akin to a dragon coming together with a tiger, water and fire combining strengths, and their cultivation will increase!\u201d\u201cIf the sect still has the Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law, would I be like this?\u201d Protector Mo dejectedly laughed before gently sighing.Nan Huairen busily said: \u201cBig Brother, there is something you aren't aware of; I heard from my great master that our Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law, in the sect, is flawed with incompletion and it is not completed to formidability. No one simply dared to just cultivate it. My great master switched to a different Virtuous Paragon merit law once he reached the Heaven's Primal rank that year, just to reach a higher level.\u201dHaving heard this, Li Qiye was in contemplation. The Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law was created by Immortal Min Ren, and it was extremely powerful. Right now, this Emperor merit law was even lost by the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.In reality, Li Qiye could, once again, find the memory of the Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law \u2013 this was not a difficult matter. He didn't even need to see the Violet Yang Ten Sun incompleted manual as just the minor Emperor merit law Violet Cloud was enough in order to regain his memory.However, in the current moment, Li Qiye had a different plan. He didn't have the capability right now to give the master and desciple the entire Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law.\u201cThe Violet Yang Ten Sun Law.\u201d Li Qiye smiled with a determined expression, and he said: \u201cI'm willing to bet, within just one year, that you both will be able to practice a completed Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law. As for you guys\u2026\u201dPausing here, Li Qiye looked at the disciple and master, and he smilingly said: \u201cAs for the Violet Cloud Merit Law, there is no complaints here. Before, I had already observed your vital situations. Protector Mo's Dao foundation is solid, and little brother Ren is a little shallow. Continue to practice this law; once the foundation becomes fortified, then you will practice the Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law. This would be like doing less, yet you reaping greater benefits.\u201dLi Qiye's words made the master and disciple indefinitely shocked. Those words were with extreme confidence; they couldn't understand the reason for his confidence in stating that, within one year, they could cultivate the completed Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law. One had to know that the current Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect essentially did not have a complete Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law!If this was a different person, they definitely would say that these words were crazy, and only meant to console them. However, having seen Li Qiye's frightening demonic demonstration, Protector Mo and Nan Huairen didn't doubt Li Qiye. The only thing that was surprising to them was how Li Qiye will obtain the complete Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law.Li Qiye, to the anxious master and disciple, said: \u201cEven though Protector Mo has reached a bottleneck, there is a method to break this bottleneck. When you are practicing the Violet Cloud Merit Law, in the morning, absorb the sun, in the late afternoon, extract the essence in the clouds. Extreme Yang Vital Flame from the sun and the afternoon vital essence combined together with the world natural energy, and then turn them into Longevity Blood. This is a different shortcut for the Violet Cloud Merit Law; both of you could do this practice.\u201dThe merit laws of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect were either left behind by him or created by Immortal Emperor Min Ren. There was no one who was more familiar with them than him. Even if he couldn't find his memories of the Violet Cloud Merit Law, he would still know the essentials of this merit law.\u201cWe will try a little bit.\u201d The master and disciple pair agreed to Li Qiye's suggestion.Sure enough, not even in a few days, even though Protector Mo didn't come, Nan Huairen excitedly jumped up and down; he happily told Li Qiye: \u201cBig brother, this matter was too mysterious! I followed your instruction on how to practice this merit law. It was truly doing less while reaping more benefits. One day of practice was more than my normal five or six days of cultivation. Big brother, how did you come up with this method? You don't practice the Violet Cloud Merit Law.\u201dSuch a result left Nan Huairen with disbelief. In reality, his master also felt that it was impossible. This result left them in amazement. Li Qiye only pointed out one or two sentences, but those words gave them a road that they had never heard of before.Li Qiye spoke in a carefree manner: \u201cI was only picking my finger to calculate.\u201dNan Huairen, of course, didn't believe the picking of fingers calculation. This matter was essentially impossible. Even his grandmaster, Elder Sun, didn't know this method; why was it that Li Qiye knew such specific details? However, if Li Qiye didn't want to reveal any more, then Nan Huairen wouldn't dare to inquire further. Being with Li Qiye for this long, he slowly began to understand Li Qiye's temperament.Li Qiye pointed out some advice for the master and disciple; he didn't think that not even a month had passed and Protector Mo had already recommended someone else to come to Li Qiye for Dao instruction. This person was the master of Protector Mo, and he was also known as Elder Sun, one of the Six Elders. His cultivation was enough to be bestowed the title of Named Hero!If one was to say that an elder of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, a big character with the qualification to be a Named Hero, was asking a third generation disciple for pointers, this matter was essentially inconceivable.In fact, recently, Elder Sun's cultivation had a problem. Protector Mo, as his disciple, naturally had to help his master, so the first thing that came up in his mind was Li Qiye.Of course, Elder Sun thought that his disciple's idea was too outrageous. If it was before, Elder Sun would have scolded Protector Mo right away; however, today, Protector Mo's status was different. Elder Sun, as the master, had been more protective and caring for his disciple.Protector Mo brought up the pointers from Li Qiye regarding the Violet Cloud Merit Law to Elder Sun. Elder Sun tried it once and he saw its effectiveness, surprising him. In the end, under the nagging of Protector Mo, Elder Sun eventually put away his pride, and went to the Lonely Peak to let Li Qiye look at him a little bit.Even with the arrival of an elder, Li Qiye was still nonchalant. Elder Sun wasn't happy about it, but he could still endure. Currently, even the descendant of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, princess of the Old Ox country, was very attentive of Li Qiye; he, as an elder, couldn't afford to put on too much air.Li Qiye examined the Life Wheel, Fate Palace, and Physique of Elder Sun, and he then said: \u201cElder's Dao foundation can be considered solid; however, that year, during the Purified Rebirth rank, you were too eager for success, and you left behind defects on your Dao foundation. When you were at the Heaven's Primal rank, you swapped from the Violet Cloud Merit Law to a different Virtuous Paragon merit law; this isn't a big problem. Even though the two merit laws combining is not extremely perfect, but, at the point of Life Reduction and Fate Calamity, it will not be fatal.\u201dLi Qiye's words, once they got out, shook Elder Sun. At first, he didn't think too highly of Li Qiye, but, right now, Li Qiye diagnosed him like a doctor treating a sick horse.[1] Tapping the horse's butt means flattering words. Gas and fart means to just spit it out.[2] Long sleeves help one dance beautifully, meaning he believes in material things/benefits, and will say/do most things for them.[3] Heaven's Primal has multiple levels in it as well, and Primal God is one of them. As for the heaven's will here, it is more of a general comment, not the proper Heaven's Will that could only be obtained by one Immortal Emperor.[4] Fortune tellers/wise masters in China have this action where they look at their fingers and do a variety of symbols and gestures to predict a matter.[5] Li Qiye's peak is named Lonely Peak.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he was at the Purified Rebirth rank, with a heart that rushed for success, defects were left behind. This was something he had never told a stranger, he didn't think that Li Qiye could find out by just examining his Dao foundation. This was such a precise pair of eyes.This type of vision, this type of knowledge; it was not something a thirteen or fourteen-year-old boy could have. Even as an elder, Elder Sun's eyes were not as clear and perceptive. At the same cultivation level as a Named Hero, he wouldn't be able to judge the Life Wheel and Fate Palace of his opponent and know their hidden depths!This type of vision and knowledge required an accumulation through time, and a high cultivation to gather! However, the boy in front of him was not this type of person.While Elder Sun was stunned. Li Qiye looked at him, and he said: \u201cYour cultivation is the Scarlet Refined Physique, also known as the Scarlet Refined Serpent Physique, and You want to turn your Scarlet Refined Physique into the Scarlet Dragon Physique.\u201dHaving heard Li Qiye's words, Elder Sun's face became red, and he embarrassingly coughed. Then he said: \u201cI do want to attempt it once or twice.\u201dElder Sun was a natural Houtian Physique, a natural Scarlet Refined Serpent Physique; however, he wants to change his physique to its highest form\u2026 the Scarlet Dragon Physique!\u201cThe issue is in your Heavenly Cauldron.\u201d Li Qiye revealed the problem as if he had already known.\u201cMy Heavenly Cauldron?\u201d After he heard Li Qiye's words in this situation, Elder Sun immediately shook his head, dening: \u201cThat is impossible, my Heavenly Cauldron has followed me for hundreds of years. I had this Heavenly Cauldron since I was at the Physique Accumulation rank, and I still am using it now. It has accompanied countless pill creations, and there had never been any problems.\u201d\u201cYour physique allows the fire affinity to flourish, and sometimes when you absorb Yin energy, your blood does not travel unhindered through your vessel, correct?\u201d Li Qiye nonchalantly said: \u201cIf you don't believe me, take out your Heavenly Cauldron so I can inspect it.\u201dLi Qiye's words shocked Elder Sun because he said he didn't have any problems. However, Li Qiye spewed out words contrary to his belief. How could he not be scared?While anxious and doubtful, Elder Sun finally took out his Heavenly Cauldron. His Heavenly Cauldron was as small as a fist and had three serpents intersect at the mouth of the cauldron.After he made contact with Elder Sun's Heavenly Cauldron, Li Qiye smilingly said: \u201cThree Serpents Fire Cauldron, I have seen quite a few of these Heavenly Cauldrons.\u201dA Heavenly Cauldron was essential to all alchemy masters. Even if one wasn't an alchemy master, the majority of cultivators would still try to find a personal Heavenly Cauldron.The Heavenly Cauldron, to put it simply, was a cauldron to refine pills. However, when mortals refined pills, they would use metal and stone to forge the cauldron. A cultivator's pills had their own spiritual nature, and could not be made by metal and stone cauldrons.Cultivators must use Heavenly Cauldrons to refine pills. In reality, these Heavenly Cauldrons were nature's cauldrons; these cauldrons had their own spirits, and even their own life. This was why only the cauldrons of cultivators could be called Heavenly Cauldrons.Regarding the true origin of Heavenly Cauldrons, there were many different beliefs. One belief dictated that during the long lost legendary past, Heavenly Cauldrons were used by Immortals for their alchemy.Of course, this belief couldn't be trusted. Many more people believed in a different legend: where the Heavenly Cauldron was a metal plant born from the heaven and earth. Because it was bathed in natural world energy, it gained its own spirit. After it suffered from Heavenly Tribulations, it finally gained the fire origin. Thus, it turned into a treasure cauldron, and it became the Heavenly Cauldron that was known by cultivators.Therefore, each Heavenly Cauldron was a treasure cauldron with the essence of the heaven and earth, as well as the Origin Flame. After refinement by cultivators or alchemy masters that used spirit medicines and treasure plants, the Heavenly Cauldron gained its medicinal property; the Origin Flame was used to create Physique pastes, Life medicines, and Fate pills!Li Qiye carefully observed the Three Serpents Fire Cauldron of Elder Sun once! In the end, both of his hands were placed on the top of the cauldron, and he shouted: \u201cOpen!\u201dThe word just came out, and the Three Serpents Fire Cauldron appeared.Once it fell to the floor, it wasn't just as big as a fist, but a huge cauldron appeared in the room. This was a cauldron as big as a desk; the top of the cauldron contained the natural world energy in the shape of revolving spirit serpents. Even though they weren't real serpents, they still felt very much alive.Three serpents opened their big mouths and placed them on top of the cauldron. At this time, the cauldron's mouth gushed out a burst of heat, and the three serpent's mouths also released a medicinal aroma.The Three Serpents Fire Cauldron, this was the Heavenly Cauldron of Elder Sun. One did not know how many countless Physique pastes, Life medicines, and Fate Pills were refined in this cauldron.The mouth of the cauldron continuously released waves of heat; this was the Origin Flame emitted from the body of the Heavenly Cauldron. This was an essential process of pill refining. The medicinal aroma was the Medicinal Treasure hidden within the cauldron's body, the quality of the pill refinement was heavily dependent on this Medicinal Treasure.Li Qiye looked around the cauldron, then said afterward: \u201cThis cauldron of Elder, its natural disposition is a Yan flame; this flame is a commonly seen Origin Flame.\u201dHere, Li Qiye's eyes moved and continued to observe.\u201cThis Heavenly Cauldron usually absorbed the Earth Flame, to strengthen its original flame. You also usually throw in miscellaneous spirit medicines to grow the Medicinal Treasure. From my observation, the most common medicine that you have fed it is the Yin Yan Hawk Plant, am I correct so far?\u201d\u201cHow did you know?\u201d After Li Qiye had finished speaking, Elder Sun's body couldn't help but tremble!\u201cIt was only the picking of my fingers to calculate it.\u201d Li Qiye coldly said. He continued to look inside the cauldron, and then he spoke: \u201cHowever, it is clear, Elder Sun recently didn't throw in the Yin Yan Hawk Plant. If my conjecture is not wrong, Elder Sun recently had fed the cauldron with exactly the Fire Dragon Plant, am I correct, Elder Sun?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 You, how could you know this?\u201d Elder Sun was stunned, and his words couldn't come out clearly. Because he recently wanted to improve his Physique with a big leap forward in order to cultivate the Scarlet Dragon Physique as the foundation, he had paid a great price to buy the Fire Dragon Plant; fed it to the cauldron in order to greatly strengthen the Medicinal Treasure!Many cultivators who weren't considered to be alchemy masters would personally carry a Heavenly Cauldron because, inside the Heavenly Cauldron, there was a natural Origin Flame. After little fire sparks were fed to it, the origin fire would continue to grow. At the same time, the Heavenly Cauldron would require a great number of spirit plants in order to refine the hidden Medicinal Treasure inside.A suitable Heavenly Cauldron was very useful to a cultivator. For example, some natural Heavenly Cauldrons had the Extreme Tai Yang Origin Flame. Then, if the cultivator had a natural born Young Yang Physique \u2013 one of the twenty-four Emperor Physiques, they could borrow the Extreme Tai Yang Origin Flame of the Heavenly Cauldron to refine their Physique.At the same time, the Medicinal Treasure inside the body of the Heavenly Cauldron could also grow the Physique, replenish the blood energy and even restore wounds and cure illnesses.Because there were so many uses for a Heavenly Cauldron, even if one was not an alchemy master, they would still bring a Heavenly Cauldron along.As for Elder Sun, one did not need to say more. He was not only an alchemy master, but he was also one of the two grand alchemy masters of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; he was even more likely to have a Heavenly Cauldron with him.For an alchemy master, the spirit medicines they usually fed their Heavenly Cauldron normally would not be easily revealed to others.However, currently, Li Qiye only needed one glance to know what his Heavenly Cauldron had eaten; how could Elder Sun not be alarmed? This was such knowledge of medicinal properties, this was such knowledge of Heavenly Cauldron refinement!Li Qiye didn't answer Elder Sun, he only said: \u201cThe issue lies in this matter. Correct \u2013 if you want to cultivate the Scarlet Dragon Physique, a Fire Dragon Plant truly has an appropriate advantage. However, Elder Sun, your Heavenly Cauldron had always eaten Yin Yan Hawk Plants for hundreds of years. The Medicinal Treasure of your Heavenly Cauldron had accumulated a large amount of Yin Yan medicinal properties, and the essence inside the Medicinal Treasure is the Yan Flame energy, but the Fire Dragon Plant belongs to the powerful Yang energy\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 Like this, you suddenly fed it with the Fire Dragon Plant. The powerful Yang energy of the Fire Dragon Plant directly impacted your Heavenly Cauldron's Medicinal Treasure. If the situation was serious, then it would damage your Heavenly Cauldron, and later it would greatly impact the quality of pill refinement! Even more importantly, your Physique had always been refined by using this treasure cauldron, and it was used to the Yan Flame energy. However, now, the cauldron suddenly exuded powerful Yang energy to refine your Physique, this immediately suppressed your Yan Fire Physique, stopping your blood flow!Li Qiye spoke without breaks like he had it memorized like the palm of his hand, it was as if he was a grandmaster on this subject. This not only made Protector Mo become wide-mouthed with a foolish face, but even Elder Sun was the same.Eventually, Li Qiye casually determined: \u201cElder Sun, you are considered one of the two grand alchemy masters of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. You must be aware, an alchemy master shouldn't only focus on the power of your medicines, but, to one's Heavenly Cauldron, one should be very protective. Natural, a Heavenly Cauldron with its Origin Flame and flame sparks, you need to feed it, this is a deep area of Dao study. At the same time, once the Medicinal Treasure is formed; whatever spirit plants you feed it afterward, this and the medicinal properties of the Medicinal Treasure are directly related\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 The quality of the Fate Pills and Physique pastes aren't determined by only the skills of the alchemy master, but it is also whether the Heavenly Cauldron is good or bad. The other important thing is the affinity of the Origin Flame, the essence of the Medicinal Treasure, and the future medicinal materials; whether they conflict with each other or not is essential.\u201d\u201cMedicinal materials and a Heavenly Cauldron's planning, this is a profound area of study; this requires time to accumulate. As long as you consider the Heavenly Cauldron as a second life, then you would be a qualified alchemy master.\u201dLi Qiye, all at once, preached about the Heavenly Cauldron, up to the point where Elder Sun's mouth was twisted and eyes turned crazy. At this moment, this disciple in front of him didn't look like a thirteen to fourteen-year-old disciple that had just joined the sect, but, instead, a grand alchemy master. His preaching regarding the Heavenly Cauldron, it was definitely not crazy and nonsensical words.\u201cWell, then\u2026 what should I do to correct it?\u201d It was unknown when Elder Sun was convinced by Li Qiye. Inadvertently, he was an elder, but he still couldn't help but to respectfully ask for Li Qiye's advice.Li Qiye smiled, and he said: \u201cElder Sun's problem is not serious, and it is easy to fix. Elder Sun has to stop feeding it the Fire Dragon Plant. If Elder Sun truly wants to obtain the Scarlet Dragon Physique, I recommend Elder Sun to use the Amiable River Fire Plant. The medicinal property of the Amiable River Fire Plant is very similar to the Yin Yan Hawk Plant. Plus, it is also one rank higher; however, the most important thing is that the Amiable River Fire Plant is very familiar with the Scarlet Dragon Physique!\u201d[1] The Yan here is not a typo of Yang. Yan here is a description of the Flame, meaning \u201cinflammation\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At this moment, he had forgotten his status as an elder, and he was like a little boy. The extremely happy elder exclaimed: \u201cDone, it's truly done! Currently, the blood energy is flowing, and the medicinal property of the Heavenly Cauldron is stronger as well.\u201dRegarding this result, Li Qiye only had a smile. Medicinal properties, Heavenly Cauldrons, the Dao of alchemy\u2026 This area, if he claimed to be number two, then since the beginning of time, no one would dare claim to be number one!Li Qiye's nonchalant expression caused Elder Sun to change his demeanor. If it was any other disciple that was praised like this by an elder, they would surely be extremely pleased. However, to Li Qiye, this form of appreciation was only the daily norm.\u201cWhen you first joined the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, you had already learned the Dao of alchemy?\u201d Elder Sun couldn't help but change his expression, and his heart became appreciative of his talents. At this point, he was reminded of the first elder. In recent times, the disheartened first elder had suddenly regained his fiery ambition and supported Li Qiye. It seemed as if Li Qiye was truly worth grooming. Before, they underestimated Li Qiye, or, towards this disciple with a Mortal Physique, Mortal Life Wheel, and Mortal Face Palace; they thought he was essentially worthless!Li Qiye only smiled once, and he said: \u201cI only accidentally read some manuals; it was not enough for the Dao.\u201d\u201cThis still isn't enough for the Dao?\u201d Elder Sun immediately became silent. Li Qiye, regarding medicinal properties, had a complete understanding. Regarding his Heavenly Cauldron, his explanation could be considered to be uniquely exhaustive! Even Elder Sun would be ashamed of being compared to Li Qiye!Elder Sun couldn't help but say: \u201cIf you meet any difficulties with cultivation, you could think about practicing the Dao of alchemy a little bit. With your insight of medicinal properties, I truly think highly of you. Who knows, you could even be the second Alchemy God!\u201dElder Sun was extremely optimistic of Li Qiye's outcome. From his perspective, Li Qiye might be a cultivation piece of trash; however, if he was willing to step into the Dao of alchemy, he could be a genius medicinist!\u201cAlchemy God?\u201d Another familiar name was mentioned by others, and Li Qiye couldn't help but smirk.Elder Sun was afraid that Li Qiye didn't know who the \u201cAlchemy God\u201d was, so he hastily added: \u201cThe Alchemy God could be called the Primogenitor of all alchemists; one could say, the majority of dan refinement processes were created by him. Some even said, the name 'Heavenly Cauldron' was coined by him. During the Desolate Era, it all began with him creating a completed dan refining process; his contribution to the Dao of alchemy is incomparable by anyone else. It would not be an exaggeration to say that, since the ancient past to now, he has one of the highest achievements regarding the Dao of alchemy!\u201dAs Elder Sun talked about the Alchemy God, Li Qiye couldn't help but reveal a small smile. Alchemy God eh? He couldn't be more familiar as this was a very good part of his memory.That old little boy was indeed a genius at the Dao of alchemy; this point, no matter how much time had passed, even when Li Qiye was the Dark Crow, he would still have to admit.Li Qiye with a smiling face; Elder Sun bringing up the Alchemy God caused him to reminisce some of the past during the Desolate Era. It was a time of many moons that were worthy of remembrance. During this era, he brought this old little boy to invade the Nine Worlds, going across the Forbidden Ground and Immortal Land. During those many moons, they used to eat so many pills for the sake of pill creations; they had created countless methods of dan refinement, and they had brought to light countless pill formulas. They had grown so many spirit plants that other people wouldn't even dare to think about\u2026There were many moons brimming with excitement and danger. During those years, there were many creations, there many dangerous pill testing, there were even more explorations! During those many moons, when he was the Dark Crow, he had planned countless of times against the Heaven and Earth, countless of times ambushed powerful giants, and countless of times bathed the nine heavens and ten earths in blood! However, there were not many moons that could make him as sentimental as those years he spent with the Alchemy God.During those many years, there was a lot more love for learning; the time of killing and the scent of blood was a lot less.Since the ancient ages till now, whether it was alchemists or cultivators, they both thought that the Alchemy God was the pinnacle of the Dao of alchemy. This wasn't only because he was peerless regarding pill creation, but more importantly, he created a complete system of the Alchemy Dao! For the Alchemy Dao, he created an immortal foundation!In reality, no one knew; the foundation of the Alchemy Dao wasn't just formulated by the Alchemy God alone. In this matter, there was also a Dark Crow that no one knew about, innovating new paths in the Alchemy Dao, and creating rules for the Alchemy Dao; the Dark Crow no one knew about had a huge contribution!One could say that, without this Dark Crow, there would be no Alchemy God. Of course, this secret, no descendants knew about.Thinking about those years, Li Qiye's heart couldn't help but let out a long sigh. If he had any regrets, his biggest regret would be that he had lost his memories regarding the world's most precious alchemy manual. Once these memories were erased, there was no way to get it back. The reason was simple, he couldn't find this alchemy manual later on. Even if it was only an incomplete part, he still couldn't find it.Regarding this matter, Li Qiye discretely shook his head. The old little boy, that year, was a madman. After becoming the Alchemy God, Li Qiye had reminded him to find a disciple in order to pass down his heritage. However, this old little boy went crazy; even though he left behind many valuable dan manuals for his descendants, but the most valuable one that was coveted by people was missing!Li Qiye knew this crazy old man did it intentionally. He, in the end, did not want to pass down this alchemy manual!As Li Qiye was reminiscing, his stunned expression made Elder Sun mistake that Li Qiye was thinking about being an Alchemy God; that he had been successfully convinced by Elder Sun.\u201cHow about switching to the Alchemy Dao? If you really want to switch to the Alchemy Dao, I will teach you my entire life's knowledge! In the future, you will become the strongest alchemy master in our sect. Later on, you could climb to the elder's seat, or even the sect master's seat; this matter would be as easy as turning your palm!\u201d Elder Sun couldn't help but to urge Li Qiye even more because he saw the potential of Li Qiye!If this was a different disciple, having just heard the elder wanting to take them in as a disciple, they would naturally be extremely excited; they would wish that they could immediately kowtow on the spot to formally become a disciple to the elder, but Li Qiye was acting unimpressed.Li Qiye smiled, and he said: \u201cThank you, elder, for your support, but the Dao of alchemy is only a hobby of mine.\u201dLi Qiye's words silenced Elder Sun. Black lines appeared on his forehead. If this was someone else, they would definitely think Li Qiye was being arrogant; however, at this moment, Elder Sun didn't have this thought. In his heart, Elder Sun was crazy because Li Qiye was wasting his aptitude!Elder Sun was truly enraged; he actually wanted to go on a rampage, but he still calmed himself down. In the end, he said in a very lovingly manner: \u201cYou can think about this carefully again; if one day you change your mind, you can find me at any time.\u201dRegarding the good intentions of Elder Sun, Li Qiye could only smile back. Seeing Li Qiye's attitude, Elder Sun could only sigh as he left.In reality, Elder Sun's hope didn't die. Not a few days had passed, Protector Mo also appeared at the Lonely Peak. After his arrival and seeing Li Qiye, he opened his mouth and only stutterings came out. He wanted to speak but couldn't. After half a day, he couldn't say anything.Facing Protector's Mo hesitated speech, Li Qiye was aware; he smiled as he said: \u201cElder Sun wants you to convince me to practice the Dao of alchemy, right?\u201dProtector Mo was a little embarrassed; he awkwardly smiled and had to say: \u201cMy master indeed has this thought. Although, whether to practice or to not practice, in the end, it is still up to you. No one dares to force the matter.\u201dIn fact, Protector Mo's heart was clear that Li Qiye was a headstrong person, with his own path. He just didn't have a choice to reject his master's request.Li Qiye smiled and said: \u201cThe Dao of alchemy is only a hobby to me; if I have time, I will think about it a little bit.\u201dRegarding this result, Protector Mo was mentally prepared; thus, he didn't try to convince Li Qiye, and he went to report to his master.With the blink of an eye, another three months had passed. The three hundred disciples in the Cleansing Jade Peak didn't require a lot of Li Qiye's attention. Li Qiye had also reached the grand completion of the Physique Accumulation rank, he was now at the Body Strengthening stage. He was ready to breakthrough to the third level of Physique Accumulation, Body Baptism!This baptism, to cultivators, was extremely important. This was especially true for the geniuses with Xiantian Physiques and King Physiques; this level was even more crucial.This level was an opportunity for all cultivators to mold their bodies for the first time! Body Baptism was not only based on cultivation; in order to mold one's physique, the more crucial matter was the Physique paste!Of course, for cultivators in terms of principle, the higher the Physique paste ranking was, the better it was for the body molding. However, within the process of cultivation, there were various restrictions.As an example, one Xiantian Physique, for its first body molding, a Xiantian Physique paste would be the best. First, it would be easy to absorb the essence of the paste; second, because it was the first body molding, having the same rank of Physique paste as your own Physique was the most suitable.In reality, within the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, at this rank, the majority of disciples during their first body molding did not have a choice; they could only choose a Houtian Physique paste.The reason was simple, it was because no one had a different option. The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was declining; regarding the matter of materials, it was highly limited. The disciples that could use a Xiantian Physique paste were the direct disciples of the elders!Li Qiye pondered for a moment. The time he wanted the Physique paste was soon approaching, so he went to find the first elder.In fact, he could have used the Physique paste earlier; however, because he wanted to stabilize the Yin Yang blood energy inside his Life Wheel, he pushed the matter of the Physique paste back.Hearing Li Qiye's intention, the first elder couldn't help but be surprised. He looked at Li Qiye, and he asked: \u201cYou have reached the Body Baptism level of the Physique Accumulation rank?\u201dHe calculated the time with his fingers. Li Qiye joining the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and his start of cultivation have not reached a year, but he had already reached the Physique Accumulation rank, at the level of Body Baptism.With this kind of achievement, in any sect, he would be considered a genius. One has to know, Li Qiye had a Mortal Physique, Mortal Life Wheel, and Mortal Fate Palace. This was an impossible matter.This, when First Elder responded, he looked at Li Qiye again; he asked: \u201cYou practiced the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law?\u201d[1] Black lines appearing on forehead means angry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Emperor\u2019s DominationEmperor's Domination Chapter 58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWith Li Qiye's constitution, to reach this stage within a year; the only explanation was that Li Qiye practiced the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law.This was not a secret within the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, and Li Qiye also didn't have anything to hide; thus, he calmly acknowledged: \u201cThat's right.\u201dHaving heard this, the first elder went silent for a moment. If this was another disciple, he certainly would ask him to not practice this merit law; however, did Li Qiye still have another choice? Mortal Physique, Mortal Life Wheel, Mortal Fate Palace. With this constitution, no matter which merit law was chosen, the end result would not be any different.Eventually, the first elder said: \u201cThis King Physique paste, the sect has finished preparing. However, you need to be mentally prepared. The medicinal parts of this physique paste, outside of the leading beast marrow, were spirit medicines of around one hundred thousand years old, and the better ones are one hundred and ten thousand or one hundred and twenty thousand years old. The leading beast marrow was only lacking a little since it is slightly off from one hundred thousand years. Therefore, when you use this physique paste, you need to be mentally prepared.\u201dIn reality, regarding this physique paste matter, the first elder had tried his best and exerted his whole hard-earned savings. Just so that Li Qiye could marry Li Shuangyan, it could be said that he was willing to give up everything!\u201cIn this matter, elder can rest assured.\u201d Li Qiye maintained his grin.In reality, Li Qiye was already prepared. Today, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had declined. To be able to gather the medicinal materials for a King Physique paste, this was already very difficult.First Elder paused for a moment, and then he continued: \u201cThere is another thing that is considerably hard to deal with; this is the alchemy matter. In our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, regarding alchemy skills, there are two people at the top: Elder Cao and Elder Sun, respectively.\u201dHere, the first elder stared at Li Qiye, and he said: \u201cRegarding the alchemy creation skill, Elder Cao is better than Elder Sun by one part. For Elder Sun to refine the physique paste, six times wouldn't be a problem; seven refinements, I'm afraid that is out of his reach. Elder Cao refining seven times, this is no problem.\u201d\u201cElder Cao isn't necessarily willing to refine the physique paste for me.\u201d Li Qiye was confident.First Elder wasn't willing to speak further on this matter, so he only said: \u201cRegarding the matter of the physique paste, Elder Sun is very willing to refine it for you; however, the only thing is, he is not too certain of the medicinal strength.\u201d\u201cThis physique paste matter, First Elder doesn't need to worry about it. How about this? First Elder can prepare the medicinal materials; this physique paste matter, I will take care of it.\u201dLi Qiye already knew that Cao Xiong wouldn't be willing to refine the physique paste for him; this was a matter well within his expectations. However, he wouldn't need to go beg Cao Xiong either.\u201cThis should be fine.\u201d After First Elder saw Li Qiye's complete confidence, he could only affirm by nodding his head. A moment later, he said: \u201cI will let a disciple guard the medicinal materials for you. When you want to refine them, just say one word; I'll send a disciple to bring the materials to you.\u201dLi Qiye thanked the elder, then left for Lonely Peak.Li Qiye didn't yet make it back to Lonely Peak when he saw that Nan Huairen's expression wasn't good. Nan Huairen quickly went up to him and urgently said: \u201cOlder brother, this is not good! Not good!\u201dFollowing Nan Huairen were the people from the Cleansing Jade Peak such as Xu Pei; their expressions did not look good.Li Qiye stared at Nan Huairen, and he asked: \u201cDid the sky fall down?\u201dNan Huairen hastily replied: \u201cOlder brother, the sky didn't fall down; however, your courtyard is being destroyed by others.\u201d\u201cDestroying my courtyard?\u201d Having heard this, Li Qiye's eyes couldn't help but squint, and then he beamingly smiled: \u201cWho has the sudden interest in coming to destroy my courtyard like this?\u201dSeeing Li Qiye's squinted eyes made Nan Huairen and even the Xu Pei crowd's hearts to panic; this smiling demeanor of Li Qiye, in their eyes, when compared to the visage of a demon, made their hearts even colder.Xu Pei quietly whispered to Li Qiye: \u201cIt was, was older brother Leng Shizhi.\u201dA bold disciple spoke: \u201cFirst brother, I heard that older brother Leng was court-courting goddess Li.\u201dEven though the disciples of the Cleansing Jade Peak were all from the Cleansing Jade Mountain, currently, all three hundred disciples were on the side of Li Qiye; they were in the same faction.\u201cI had also heard that older brother Leng had given goddess Li treasures\u2026\u201dA disciple, not without worries, said: \u201cFirst brother, older brother Leng is a genius of our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. He, he is a powerful love rival of yours.\u201dAt this moment, even though these disciples were all saying different things, all of them had the same feelings of anger against a common enemy of Li Qiye. However, they were not without worries, for Li Qiye, because in the end, Leng Shizhi was the genius of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect \u2013 a direct disciple of Elder Cao.It could be said that regarding the appearance, Leng Shizhi had it; regarding talents, he had it as well; regarding a backing, he was not without; regarding his origin, he has the origin. Personally, they wanted Li Qiye to marry Li Shuangyan. After all, Li Shuangyan and Li Qiye had been together in the recent days, and they would be glad to see it happen.However, with a powerful love rival like Leng Shizhi, the disciples, like Xu Pei, were not without worries for Li Qiye.\u201cA powerful love rival?\u201d Having heard this sentence, Li Qiye found it really ridiculous, and the corner of his lips couldn't help but become angled. His smiling expression rippled uncontrollably.Nan Huairen reminded him: \u201cFirst brother, this thing, Leng Shizhi had been granted tacit permission from Cao Xiong; maybe even strong support from him. It is easier to hide from a bright spear than it is to guard from a hidden arrow. First brother might as well be careful; just in case.\u201dNan Huairen, too, knew about Li Qiye's situation \u2013 a powerful love rival? Nan Huairen, of course, wouldn't consider Leng Shizhi being qualified as a love rival of Li Qiye; Leng Shizhi was worth how much? Even at the Nine Saint Demon Gate, Li Qiye was still roaring; let alone Leng Shizhi?Why did Li Shuangyan come to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect? Simply put; it was because of Li Qiye. No matter how excellent Leng Shizhi was, he wouldn't be comparable to Li Qiye. These two essentially weren't at the same level? What qualifications did Leng Shizhi have to become a rival in love of Li Qiye?\u201cCome, we will go to see how my strongest love rival is destroying my courtyard.\u201d Li Qiye leisurely said these words as if the courtyard being destroyed wasn't his.When Li Qiye, along with Nan Huairen, climbed to the top of Lonely Peak, many rumbling sounds occurred. \u201cBoom Boom.\u201d At this moment, Leng Shizhi was commanding some disciples to destroy the courtyard of Li Qiye; seven or eight parts were destroyed.However, standing in front of her pavilion adjacent to the courtyard, Li Shuangyan was only coldly observing, without saying a word.\u201cLi Qiye, you came back at the perfect time.\u201d Seeing Li Qiye along with the Nan Huairen's group returning, Leng Shizhi arrogantly raised his chin, and he said: \u201cStarting from today, you will move to Small Spring Peak to live!\u201dLeng Shizhi used a commanding tone towards Li Qiye; it was as if he believed Li Qiye would definitely listen to him.\u201cWhy should I move to Small Spring Peak?\u201d Li Qiye looked at the destroyed courtyard, still smiling wholeheartedly; it was as if there was not even a hint of anger within him.Leng Shizhi became a bit impatient, and he coldly said: \u201cIf I tell you to go, then go; why is there so much chatter?! Starting from today, I will live at Lonely Peak! The little courtyard here was in the way, so, after it is destroyed, I will build a spirit pavilion here!\u201dHere, Leng Shizhi started to ignore Li Qiye; he put on the expression that he considered the most handsome and charming, and he smiled at Li Shuangyan in the far distance: \u201cLonely Peak overlooks the entirety of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, and the view is very good. Goddess Li choosing to stay at this place, it could be considered as having an incomparable insight. I, fortunately, have the honor to be next to Goddess Li, discussing the Dao, investigating the profound mysteries \u2013 this would be a beautiful story!\u201dAfter Li Shuangyan's arrival at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, this was not Leng Shizhi's first time courting her. However, each time, he was met with a locked door; Li Shuangyan essentially was too lazy to care for him at all.Pursuing without an entrance, Leng Shizhi decisively chose to move to Lonely Peak; he wanted to be closer to Li Shuangyan and use this opportunity to earn her favor. As the proverb dictates; the pavilion closest to the water enjoys the moonlight first!Leng Shizhi publicly revealed this particular attitude, and this caused the hearts of Nan Huairen's crowd to be annoyed. Goddess Li and first brother were engaged \u2013 this was a matter the entire Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was aware of. Currently, Leng Shizhi, in front of Li Qiye, was courting Li Shuangyan; this was basically not placing Li Qiye in his eyes.As for Li Shuangyan, she only stared at Leng Shizhi. This was the type of person that, after death, wouldn't know how they had died. With only abilities like his, yet he still dared to stroke the tiger's whiskers and provoke Li Qiye? This was simply being tired of living! Back when Li Qiye was at the Nine Saint Demon Gate, even her master, Demon King Lun Ri, was three parts restrained; an insignificant person like Leng Shizhi would be worth what?Leng Shizhi, in front of Li Qiye's presence, selling flirtatious behavior, rendered Li Qiye unable to withhold his laughter. The matter of Leng Shizhi courting Li Shuangyan was, of course, something he knew about! With the women around him, Li Qiye had absolute confidence! This sort of insignificant trifling matter; he didn't want to bother to intervene with.Now, Leng Shizhi actually went to offend him. Li Qiye couldn't help but smile and pitifully glance at Leng Shizhi, and, afterward, he said to Li Shuangyan: \u201cYou stood here and watched the small courtyard being demolished?\u201d\u201cIsn't this an internal affair of your Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect?\u201d Li Shuangyan let off a slight smile; this smiling expression was capable of causing the downfall of a nation.Li Shuangyan slight smile was enough to cause Leng Shizhi's spirit and soul to be flipped upside down. Once his mind came around, his heart was encompassed with jealousy. He intended to be closer to Li Shuangyan many times, but Li Shuangyan, until now, still didn't sell him any colors, much less a laugh; this matter suddenly made him hate Li Qiye even more.At this point, Leng Shizhi's expression became cold as he loudly reprimanded: \u201cWhy are you still foolishly dawdling here, quickly take your leave! Is Lonely Peak is an area that you can be foolish around? In the future, Lonely Peak will be the place where I cultivate the heart and nurture the character; if you dare to rush in and cause a commotion here, we will use the sect's rules to deal with you.\u201dWith Leng Shizhi acting like this, Li Qiye still wasn't angry, but the group of Nan Huairen was indignant, especially Nan Huairen. Lonely Peak was assigned to Li Qiye by the elders; however, now, Leng Shizhi was seizing Li Qiye's peak, and he even destroyed his place. Even worse, he even used the sect's rules to threaten him. This was too arrogant! This was not giving anyone face![1] Out of his reach original idiom = The heart was willing but the capability wasn't.[2] Beautiful story here has the connotation that it is a legendary event that captures the imagination and will be spread far and wide.[3] This idiom also means to benefit from being close/intimate with an influential person.[4] Flirtatious behavior also have the meaning of using excellent/charming literary words \u2013 This is funny because the Shi in Leng Shizhi's name has the meaning of literary excellence.[5] Spirit and soul upside down \u2013 meaning felt clear enough so I kept this idiom in \u2013 to be in a daze. Not selling any colors \u2013 to ignore completely without emotions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don't spend your days sticking together with this bag of straws; this is akin to destroying your own future! If you follow a piece of trash like him, you, at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, will not achieve even a half step forward!\u201dThese words of Leng Shizhi; they weren't just to simply sneer at Nan Huairen, but they were also there to threaten him!Nan Huairen was one who understood that long sleeves helped one dance beautifully; he was smooth and slick at establishing social relations, so how could he not understand the overtone? Following who, Nan Huairen's heart already had its own ideas. Regarding Leng Shizhi's words, Nan Huairen said in a grave manner without hesitation: \u201cSenior doesn't need to worry about this. First Brother is the outstanding talent of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. I will be like the heavenly thunder; where he commands, I will strike there!\u201d\u201cWilling to fall from grace?!\u201d Nan Huairen, in front of him, denied his request, so Leng Shizhi coldly scowled.Li Qiye did not care for these political dealings; he only stared at Leng Shizhi, and he said: \u201cFor the sect's comradery, I will give you one chance. Do a good job at fixing the little courtyard; otherwise, tomorrow, you wouldn't be able to stand up even if you wanted to!\u201dLi Qiye saying this caused Leng Shizhi's eyes to exert coldness, his killing intent became higher. He coldly smiled once, and then he said: \u201cYou don't know the immensity of the heaven and earth! Do you truly think you are the first brother of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect? I dare you to say this to my face! Hmph, with just you and these bunch of scrap metal in front, yet you still dare to say arrogant things! A group of clowns has the qualifications to be my enemies?\u201dLeng Shizhi's words immediately made the hearts of Xu Pei's group angry. These words of Leng Shizhi had not only dishonored Li Qiye, but it also dishonored them as well.Facing a Leng Shizhi that did not know the correct boundaries, Li Qiye was too lazy to pay attention to him. He turned around and left.\u201cSo? Weren't you spouting arrogant words earlier? Saying that I wouldn't be able to stand up tomorrow? Currently, why are you trying to flee now? Being a coward even before the battle begins, yet a bag of straws like you still dared to jump around in front of me\u2026\u201d Seeing Li Qiye's turning around, Leng Shizhi coldly laughed as he said this.Li Qiye essentially didn't want to waste too many words with Leng Shizhi. He only went to the front of Li Shuangyan's pavilion, and he commanded her: \u201cBeat him down from the peak; beat him until his father and mother can't recognize him anymore. If he doesn't want to repair my courtyard, cut off his third leg as well for me!\u201d\u201cHa ha, ha ha\u2026\u201d Li Qiye's sudden command to Li Shuang Ya made Leng Shizhi act as if he had heard the funniest story in the world. He laughed until his body was arched; he pointed at Li Qiye with tears in his eyes, and he said: \u201cWho do you think you are? Do you think you are the Demon King? Or a Mortal King? You are only a bag of straws, yet you still dare to be arrogant and bossy towards goddess Li? Goddess Li, this idiot, I will discipline him for yo\u2014\u201dHowever, before Leng Shizhi could finish his sentence, Li Shuangyan had stood up, looked at him as if she was looking at an idiot, and she coldly said: \u201cI will give you one opportunity to make a move.\u201dSuddenly, Leng Shizhi's smile was frozen in the same place. His expression was even more exaggerated than when one would eat shit. His whole body was frozen, and he couldn't have any other expression.\u201cBang!\u201d During the moment when Leng Shizhi was still in a daze, Li Shuangyan, with one kick, made him fly outside of Lonely Peak. Afterward, an agonizing scream from below Lonely Peak echoed; without a doubt, Li Shuangyan used an appropriate force.At this point, the disciples that had destroyed the courtyard were standing still. Li Shuangyan taught Leng Shizhi a lesson; in the blink of an eye, she had already beaten him till he screamed! This scene shattered the other disciples' courage.Even Xu Pei's group \u2014 the disciples from the Cleansing Jade Peak, couldn't help but look at each other. Even though in the recent days, Li Shuangyan had always been by Li Qiye's side; however, they rarely talked to each other. From the group's understandings, Li Shuangyan staying was because the two sects had a marital pact, so she had to stay with the first brother.However, they didn't expect that the heaven's proud daughter, goddess Li, princess of the Old Ox country reigning over tens of thousands of people, would listen to their first brother. If this matter was to be spread, others would find it hard to believe.What was the Nine Saint Demon Gate, what was the current Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect? Right now, Li Shuangyan's status was high beyond imagination. Even the elders of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect didn't have the qualification to compare to her; such a grand unreachable character, yet she still listened to their first brother \u2013 this matter was too impossible to think about.After Li Shuangyan taught Leng Shizhi a lesson, like the most loyal hound of Li Qiye, Nan Huairen coldly smiled, stared at the disciples who destroyed the courtyard and said: \u201cYou still haven't rolled out? Maybe you are waiting for us to take care of you all as well? Hmph, we're all disciples of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; you shouldn't cross the boundaries. Don't think that you hugging the legs of Elder Cao means that you could ignore the laws\u201d\u201c\u2026 First Brother's heavenly aura is something that you guys could provoke? Hmph, such narrow-mindedness, even for the Demon King, First Brother would still be an esteemed guest! Don't think that you could challenge big brother just because you all have found some backing! Big brother is merciful, and he wouldn't bother with you all; otherwise, there would only be death, no matter the backing you have!\u201d Nan Huairen was wily and meticulous. He knew exactly what words to say and what actions to take. This time, it looked like he was using Li Qiye to act arrogant, but these words were not only for the courtyard-destroying disciples. These words were also for the Xu Pei's group to hear, they were words meant to wake them up!These disciples regained their wits, and their bodies shivered. With those words, they threw away the equipment in their hands, and they turned around to flee. Right now, their boss had already been beaten to the point of screaming like a butchered pig. Even if they were ten times more courageous, they still wouldn't dare to challenge Li Qiye.When the group of Xu Pei was still surprised, Li Shuangyan had flew down in front of the pavilion. To teach Leng Shizhi a rough lesson, to someone with her cultivation, it was like the lifting of one's hand.Even if Leng Shizhi was the genius of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, versus someone like Li Shuangyan, the heaven's proud daughter, it was not enough to reach the apex!Once Li Shuangyan had returned, Li Qiye glanced at her once before saying: \u201cNot taking the sect's order into consideration, you should remember your own responsibility! To anyone who blocks my road, no matter who it is, kill them without mercy!\u201dLi Qiye's words made Xu Pei and her group confused, but Nan Huairen's heart was moved! The group of Xu Pei didn't know the intricacies inside, but Nan Huairen did.Li Qiye had previously said that Li Shuangyan would just be a maid! Currently, Li Qiye had commanded Li Shuangyan like this; in this matter, Nan Huairen had suddenly understood; in this matter, how could it not shock Nan Huairen?Li Shuangyan is the princess of Old Ox country, and the descendant of the Nine Saint Demon Gate; however, today, she was only a maid for First Brother!During the moment, when the crowd was still dazed, Li Qiye turned around, and he went inside the pavilion of Li Shuangyan. His words resonated from the inside; he was always as nonchalant and carefree like this: \u201cThis time, you had failed in your duty. I will temporarily stay in your bedroom; you stay in the next room to protect my Dao for me.\u201dAs Li Qiye said this, Li Shuangyan was both angry and dejected. In the end, she could only stomp her foot, and she went inside afterward, without saying anything.Such a scene turned Xu Pei and others into stone statues; this scene was too dominating, right? This scene was the most aggressive and domineering event they had ever seen.Li Shuangyan, in their minds, was an unreachable character, a generational Heavenly Goddess, a descendant of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, and the princess of Old Ox country; her master was Demon King Lun Ri, and she also had a natural born King Physique and Saint Fate Palace. Only one of these matters was enough to shock others. A heaven's proud daughter like Li Shuangyan, no matter the place, would be the moon that all the stars revolved themselves around.However, today, this heaven's proud daughter, Li Shuangyan, could only be in the room to serve their First Brother. This thing, this scene, it was too dominating; this type of domination, even a Mortal Emperor could just be like this, no more!Inside the treasure pavilion of Li Shuangyan, inside her lady's chamber, Li Qiye lied down on her elegant bed, and he glimpsed at Li Shuangyan's annoyed expression. Both of his hands padded the back of his head comfortably, and he casually said: \u201cI know you are upset. However, you truly failed your duty. Being my maid, you should know what to do. If you feel that I am not worthy of your service, then you could leave at any time. This type of matter, I don't want to force you; picking a stubborn melon will make it not sweet.\u201dLi Shuangyan was only staring at Li Qiye in silence, and she didn't say anything no matter what.\u201cI will take your silence as you are willing to stay here.\u201d Li Qiye nonchalantly he dropped this matter. He then added: \u201cSend these words to Demon King Lun Ri in place of me, and tell him that I require an alchemy master. The higher the skill, the better.\u201d\u201cI will send the message to master, but, as for the person sent by my master, it is not for me to decide.\u201d After a while, Li Shuangyan's anger subsided. In the end, she was used to being the heaven's proud daughter; with this sudden change in status, she was not yet used to it. After her mind had calmed down, she truly faced herself once more.\u201cRegarding this matter, I'm sure if Demon King Lun Ri will have his own opinion.\u201dLi Qiye smiled. After everything was decided, he stopped caring. He then went into a deep sleep.With such a scene, Li Shuangyan didn't know whether to be annoyed or silent. This thirteen to fourteen-year-old boy; he was more domineering than any other man she had previously met. Today, he took her bed and even felt that it was such a natural thing. He was complacently lying there and snoring! This arrogant man was something she had seen for the first time; however, what made her even quieter was that this man was sleeping on her bed even though he was just a little boy much younger than her \u2014 a thirteen to fourteen-year-old little boy!Sure enough, the next day, the courtyard was rebuilt by others; this new courtyard was not lesser than the old one.Leng Shizhi was unable to stand up from Li Shuangyan's beating, and this caused Cao Xiong, his master, to have no place to vent his anger at the moment!His idea was to hope that his disciple could climb up Li Shuangyan. He did not think that his genius disciple, who he was most proud about, not only didn't receive Li Shuangyan's favor, but he also had been beaten to the point of not being able to move on his bed!This matter made Cao Xiong angry to the point of vomiting blood. His disciple was beaten by the descendant of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, princess of Old Ox country; what was he gonna do? Kill to the door and find Li Shuangyan to even the score?[1] Tens of thousands people is an idiom. I'm sure Old Ox country has billions of mortals considering the scale of this world.[2] Protect Dao is a rather common term in this novel and even others. I originally had it as fate protector, but Dao protector is also nearly identical.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not just him; even the entire Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect wouldn't dare to offend Li Shuangyan. To offend her, was akin to offending the entire Nine Saint Demon Gate. To offend a giant monster like the Nine Saint Demon Gate, this was the same as seeking for death!\u201cTo hell with it!\u201d Cao Xiong couldn't help but scream out this sentence. His genius disciple did not get into Li Shuangyan's eyes, but a bag of straws like Li Qiye was winning Li Shuangyan's favor; this was like meeting a ghost.This event, the only explanation was that Li Qiye was a spy from the Nine Saint Demon Gate. However, this type of explanation was even more like meeting a ghost and even less plausible than Li Shuangyan favoring Li Qiye.If the Nine Saint Demon Gate sent a disciple with a Mortal Physique, Mortal Life Wheel, and Mortal Fate Palace to infiltrate the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, then that would truly be like meeting a ghost. What was even worse was that Li Qiye would be the most unqualified spy; had anyone ever seen such an arrogant spy?To say that Li Qiye was a spy of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, even Cao Xiong himself didn't believe it. This was merely only a scheme to attack Li Qiye.If Li Qiye wasn't a spy from the Nine Saint Demon Gate, then what was the reason for Li Shuangyan's favor towards him? Could it be because the two sects have a marital pact? Or maybe it was because Li Shuangyan really liked him?Regarding this matter, Cao Xiong had almost broken his head from continuous thinking. Cao Xiong's expression was extremely hard to see; in the end, he went to visit a certain place in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.On top of a main peak in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was a peak with the densest natural world energy in the sect; however, today, inside the main hall of this peak, was not an elder nor a protector of the sect, but Guest Adviser Dong Shenglong!Guest adviser \u2014 this seat was present in many sects and even in many countries. To be a guest adviser was to benefit from the resources of the sect or nation, and they did not need to worry about the sect's matters; only when the sects or nations met a disaster would the guest adviser need to take action!Dong Shenglong was a guest adviser of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, plus, he was the only guest adviser of the sect!Inside the ancient hall, the breath of a Royal Noble \u2013 like mercury \u2013 discharged into the air; without a single opening. This caused others to not dare to come closer! An old man wearing a blue robe with a suppressing pressure; his whole body absorbed and exerted the frightening energy of a Royal Noble. Without a doubt, he was a powerful Royal Noble; a Royal Noble that was highly experienced.Dong Shenglong, a guest adviser of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, was a powerful Royal Noble that could change other people's expression. His cultivation, compared to the Six Elders of the sect, was even stronger.At this moment, Dong Shenglong and Cao Xiong were sharing a table. Even though they were sitting together, Cao Xiong was still showing a respectful and cautious manner.\u201cBrother Cao's mood recently has not been good, ah.\u201d Dong Shenglong poured wine into Cao Xiong's bowl. As a Royal Noble, he appeared to be very approachable; however, his fathomless eyes carried coldness that could swallow others!Cao Xiong drank the wine in silence, and he didn't say anything in the moment. Naturally, he came here with many expectations, but he was not willing to open his mouth first. He was waiting for Dong Shenglong to name the price.\u201cBrother Cao is worried because of the sect master's seat?\u201d Dong Shenglong was still pouring wine for Cao Xiong; his face still wore the same hidden smile, but the cold intentions in his eyes were extremely frightening.Dong Shenglong was a guest adviser for the sect, but in reality, his origin was formidable. His Royal Noble title was not self-proclaimed, it was bestowed upon him by the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom.Dong Shenglong's background was from the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom's nobility. This noble family had complex ties with the Heavenly God Sect, and it could even be considered a sub-sect of the Heavenly God Sect.Also, even Dong Shenglong's family was not weak, it was many times stronger than the current Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!Dong Shenglong being a guest adviser at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, naturally, was not from an invitation by the sect. Don't jest, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the Heavenly God Sect were considered enemies.Thirty thousand years ago, when the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had declined, the Heavenly God Sect went on the offensive against them. The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect did not only lose their kingdom that they had ruled for many generations, but they had also lost all of their Grand Elders, more or less, in this war!After this war, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had never recovered. The Heavenly God Sect erected the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom on the remains of the collapsed kingdom of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!Dong Shenglong was a noble at the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, and he was bestowed Royal Noble by this kingdom; why would the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect invite him to be a guest adviser? He was assigned here as an adviser by the Mortal King of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom.Regarding this particular guest adviser, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect could not decline. Today, the sect was no longer able to compete with the Heavenly God Sect or the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom. With this guest adviser sent by the kingdom, the sect could only accept him inside.Dong Shenglong, as a guest adviser at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, had his own mission. He kept a very low profile during his time here. Besides cultivating, he rarely went outside, and he, even less, interfered with the matters of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; thus, Dong Shenglong had not made that many protectors and elders to outright reject him.Cao Xiong was an elder of the sect. In the past, he, similar to the other protectors and elders, had great animosity towards Dong Shenglong. However, Cao Xiong, in his heart, also had many things that he wanted to change since he always had an ambition towards the sect master's seat.During that year, regarding the passing down of the sect master's seat and taking into consideration of order according to status, the sect master's seat should have gone to the first elder or to him!However, inexplicably, Su Yonghuang appeared, and this made him painfully lose the sect master's seat! In these recent passing years, Cao Xiong had lost the idea of becoming Sect Master himself; he instead placed all of his aspirations into his disciple, Leng Shizhi.This was also the reason why Cao Xiong had so often tried to turn his disciple, Leng Shizhi, into the prime disciple, but this progress was not so smooth.With this result, Cao Xiong became disconsolate, and his magnificent aspiration was difficult to achieve. Under these conditions, with Dong Shenglong intentionally acting friendly towards him, Cao Xiong inadvertently became closer to Dong Shenglong; his previous hostility towards Dong Shenglong had dissipated by a lot.Later, Dong Shenglong had implied many times that he and his backing would be able to assist Cao Xiong in climbing to the sect master's position of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!With such a tempting offer from Dong Shenglong, it would be strange if Cao Xiong was not interested! Cao Xiong knew the people that were behind Dong Shenglong were powerful, but he also knew what Dong Shenglong wanted.If he truly joined Dong Shenglong, Cao Xiong knew that him becoming the sect master was not a difficult matter. The problem was, once he joined Dong Shenglong, he had to put in great effort afterward. The backing of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom was not easily bestowed upon, and this deal would symbolize his betrayal of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the ancestors.Even though Cao Xiong truly coveted the sect master's seat and was tempted by Dong Shenglong's offer, but as an elder of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and a disciple that grew up here, he ultimately couldn't cross this bottom line in his heart. In the end, for him, to betray the sect and the ancestors would be something that will torture his conscience!Of course, Dong Shenglong was not in a rush either. The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had declined, and the items of this sect, one day, would fall into his hands; he had enough patience. Naturally, if Cao Xiong would join him, then it would be even better.Facing Dong Shenglong, Cao Xiong was just drinking without replying while Dong Shenglong maintained his smile. It was a smile on the outside, but inside, it wasn't.Finally, Cao Xiong placed down the bowl in his hand and said: \u201cThe sect master is not present, so I do not need to worry.\u201dDong Shenglong, with his pretentious smile: \u201cBrother Cao is an elder of the sect, and you have truly contributed to it with your blood and courage. Brother Cao should be more aware of the current situation of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201dCao Xiong was waiting for Dong Shenglong to say these words. He looked at Dong Shenglong: \u201cMy mind is dark; please give me a few pointers.\u201dDong Shenglong, still maintaining a smile, replied: \u201cBrother Cao, even though the Nine Saint Demon Gate is here because of the marital matter; however, have you thought about this? I'm afraid that they are only here because of a certain thing in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Cao Xiong did not answer directly. In reality, he knew clearly what he meant in his heart.Dong Shenglong did not care for Cao Xiong's attitude. He was afraid of the fish not biting the bait. As long as he took the bait, everything would be easy. He wouldn't be afraid of Cao Xiong's hesitation anymore.Dong Shenglong sincerely asked: \u201cHas Brother Cao thought more about this? The truth is, in the end, the only thing that can protect the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect is still the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom. The Nine Saint Demon Gate is far out in the other corner of the world; they only want the things that belong to them. As for whether the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's living or dying, I'm afraid they do not care at all.\u201d\u201cThe marriage between the two sects, I don't see it as a bad thing entirely.\u201d Cao Xiong still replied in a patient manner.Dong Shenglong let out a laugh and then spoke words with hidden meanings: \u201cOf course, from your point of view, the marriage pact between the two sects is a happy thing, worthy of celebration. However, the marriage of the two sects; from my perspective, if your disciple Leng Shizhi could marry princess Li, then it would be ten parts perfect.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, my disciple is not the prime disciple!\u201d\u201cThis marital pact; it doesn't necessarily have to be the prime disciple, right?\u201dThe fish had taken the bait, so Dong Shenglong smiled. Cao Xiong, in the end, couldn't escape his palm, and his confidence rose; he then, with a beaming smile, said: \u201cThe two sects have the pact. However, what if something unexpectedly happens to the prime disciple, or what if your prime disciple commits a grave sin?\u201dCao Xiong's eyes narrowed as he asked: \u201cWhat is the meaning behind brother Dong's words?\u201dDong Shenglong answered while smiling: \u201cBrother Cao, there are some people that have achieved a few accomplishments, and they couldn't help but become arrogant and disrespectful toward their seniors. They then committed wrongful acts against the sect's rules? Tell me I am right? For example, if your prime disciple, Li Qiye, commits a crime, then the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect would have to deal with it fairly. This type of horse that causes trouble to its herd; if not dealt with, it would cause detrimental harm to the sect.\u201dCao Xiong's eyes were focused, but he did not say anything for a long time.Finally, Dong Shenglong, still staring at Cao Xiong, slowly opened his mouth: \u201cBrother Cao, since you came to confide in this little brother, this little brother will naturally help a friend; even if it would risk my life. If brother Cao has any ideas, just go and do it. Even if the sky falls down, isn't this little brother still here to console brother Cao?\u201d\u201cBrother Dong is so affectionate and helpful; this Cao is very appreciative.\u201d In the end, Cao Xiong stood up and clasped his hands together before taking his leave.After Cao Xiong's departure, Dong Shenglong smiled, and he slowly said: \u201cAs long as you have stepped on this boat, I'm not afraid that you won't betray the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Cao Xiong, ah Cao Xiong; if you want to fight with that old Gu, you definitely will request my help!\u201d[1] There are ghosts and demons in this world, but this phrase still has the meaning of surprise in the narrative.[2] Gu is the first elder's name.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 68": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Emperor\u2019s DominationEmperor's Domination Chapter 61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter teaching Leng Shizhi a lesson, Li Qiye originally thought that there would be peace for some time. However, not many days had passed and trouble had come to his door again.\u201cFirst brother, first brother, not good, not good.\u201d As Li Qiye was cultivating in the courtyard, Luo Fenghua and several panicked disciples rushed in.The appearances of Luo Fenghua, along with his fellow disciples, was extremely scruffy; especially when there were purple bruises all over their bodies. From just a glance, it was clear that they had been taught a lesson.Seeing their current shapes, Li Qiye furrowed his brows, and he asked: \u201cWhat actually happened?\u201d\u201cSectional Leader Zhou went to the Cleansing Jade Peak. He, he found reasons\u2026 to teach us a lesson.\u201d A disciple explained the current situation with two or three sentences.So it was earlier this morning, Sectional Leader Zhou who was no longer teaching the Dao at the Cleansing Jade Peak suddenly returned. He gathered all three hundred disciples and decided to check their cultivations.Before Li Qiye become an instructor, Sectional Leader Zhou was the one who instructed the Dao for the three hundred disciples; the opinion of the disciples regarding him wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible either. Normally, Sectional Leader Zhou just routinely taught the Dao, and after the lesson was over, he quickly left. Outside of these lectures, the disciples normally had a difficult time finding him.On top of this, his lecture was nothing out of the ordinary and didn't give special attention to any disciples; to him, Dao instruction was merely a mission from the sect.This was precisely why the three hundred disciples, regarding Sectional Leader Zhou, didn't have a good affinity towards him. However, it also was not bad, it could only be considered the affinity between a senior and a disciple.Today, Sectional Leader Zhou suddenly came to check on their cultivation. From the beginning, the disciples didn't think anything of it; after all, before, it was only Sectional Leader Zhou whom taught them the Dao. His wanting to examine the disciples of the Cleansing Jade Peak would be viewed as a normal occurrence.However, the moment the examination took place, his attitude completely changed. After a period of time, he said that this disciple was practicing a qi deviation merit law, then another was practicing a completely wrong style, then he scolded a different disciple for acting on his own initiative at picking a merit law\u2026The one that was scolded the worst by Sectional Leader Zhou was Zhang Yu. Zhang Yu had previously destroyed his cultivation to re-practice the Jade Spiral Merit Law; this matter caused Sectional Leader Zhou to personally gave him a good beating.Not only Zhang Yu, but other disciples, such as Luo Fenghua who brought up a few objections, also received a beating.Li Qiye's Dao instruction, compared to the Sectional Leader Zhou's, was much more mysterious and profound. This was something that the three hundred disciples had unanimously agreed upon. After experiencing Li Qiye's lessons, many disciples' cultivations increased by not a small amount; some had even experienced exceptional leaps. There were even disciples whose cultivation had frozen, but after Li Qiye's lesson, their Dao was like the water flowing into the river.One could say, regarding Li Qiye's Dao instruction, all of the disciples at the Cleansing Jade Peak were completely convinced; especially the ones with great talents like Luo Fenghua, they were clear regarding excellence and mediocrity.So, at the moment when Sectional Leader Zhou said that Li Qiye Dao's instruction was not worth a coin. Luo Fenghua and his fellow disciples couldn't hold back and immediately objected, so they were ruthlessly beaten by Sectional Leader Zhou.With this result, the intelligent group of Luo Fenghua suddenly realized that something was amiss. In the past, Sectional Leader Zhou had never disciplined them, but now he suddenly raged a storm, without knowing right from wrong. They now knew that Zhou was here not for the sake of examination, but to cause trouble. On top of that, the targets weren't them, but their first brother Li Qiye, they were merely cannon fodders.This was why Luo Fenghua and his group decided to take advantage of Sectional Leader Zhou's inattentiveness while raging a storm; they sneaked to Li Qiye's place to report. Maybe, Sectional Leader Zhou had intentionally let them go.Hearing the narrative from Luo Fenghua's group, Li Qiye's gaze gave off a feeling of concentration; the corner of his mouth tilted deviously and revealed a cold smile.He had no grievances with Sectional Leader Zhou. In theory, Sectional Leader Zhou did not need to find faults with him like this, not to mention, examining the cultivations of the Cleansing Jade Peak disciples was no longer Zhou's responsibility! Most importantly, currently, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the Nine Saint Demon Gate have an in law's relationship, and Li Qiye was a crucial piece. At the sect, even the protectors wouldn't want to look for trouble with him, let alone an ordinary sectional leader.Presently, Sectional Leader Zhou suddenly jumped out to find faults with him. If there wasn't someone behind the scene planning, or if he didn't have a powerful backing, even if he was ten times more courageous, he wouldn't dare to do this.\u201cCome, we will go see. Let's take a look at this extraordinary Sectional Leader Zhou's ability to put forth stormy winds and waves.\u201d Li Qiye stretched his body and cheerfully smiled.Luo Fenghua and the others didn't dare to neglect the words, so they busily followed behind Li Qiye to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, with Li Shuangyan to the side!Although Li Qiye was happily smiling the whole time on the way, Luo Fenghua's group was a bit nerve-racked. These few were not stupid, they have faintly smelled the struggle within the upper echelon of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.The group of Li Qiye had arrived at the Cleansing Jade Peak, and sure enough, they were met with Sectional Leader Zhou causing a storm. The disciples didn't dare to make noises; many of them were more or less wounded. At the moment of Li Qiye's arrival, Zhou was still yelling at another disciple.Seeing Li Qiye, the other disciples couldn't help but move their gazes towards Li Qiye, asking him for help.\u201cLi Qiye, these things you have taught!\u201d Li Qiye had just arrived, but he didn't even have the chance to speak. Sectional Leader Zhou had already pointed at his face and loudly yelled: \u201cAs the Dao's instructing senior, not only have you brought in heretical notions to teach to the ignorant disciples, but you also lead them into the devil's path; what is your motive behind this? To poison the fellow disciples like this, this crime cannot be pardoned!\u201dLi Qiye hadn't opened his mouth, but Sectional Leader Zhou already had an accusation ready for him.\u201cSectional Leader Zhou, who the hell do you think you are?\u201d To Sectional Leader Zhou's accusation and yelling, Li Qiye didn't want to look at him any further, and he slowly said: \u201cIf you are sensible, then get the hell out of here. In my jurisdiction, it is not up to you to wave your hands and dance with your legs; what do you think you are worth?\u201dLi Qiye opened his mouth and immediately, the most arrogant and rudest words came out. Sectional Leader Zhou, who had mentally prepared, was still shocked for a little bit. He thought that Li Qiye would retort him, and he had many words in his mind ready. No matter what, today he would indict Li Qiye the crime of teaching the devil Dao's path. However, he didn't expect for Li Qiye's first words to be so unbridled and aggressive.\u201cImpudence!\u201d Sectional Leader Zhou returned to normal, and he angrily yelled: \u201cAs a disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, you are unfilial and rebellious, disrespectful to a senior, would cheat on your master and kill your ancestors, and rebel against the sect\u2026\u201d\u201cYou talk too much\u2026\u201d Not waiting for Sectional Leader Zhou to finish his yelling, Li Qiye took out the Serpent Punishing stick and fiercely struck forward.\u201cThis thing doesn't know whether he wants to live or die!\u201d Sectional Leader Zhou saw that Li Qiye had made a move towards him. He became angry, screamed angrily once, and his big hand aimed towards Li Qiye. To him, for Li Qiye to make the first move, nothing could be better.At the same time, Zhou did not put Li Qiye into his eyes. This was only a bag of straws disciple, once he actually made a move, it would be as easy as turning one's own hand.\u201cBang\u2026 Bang\u2026 Bang\u2026\u201d However, the result was far from Sectional Leader Zhou's expectations. Within the blink of an eye, Zhou had been beaten by Li Qiye to the ground. The Serpent Punishing stick aimed for his face and unleashed a myriad of rains and winds until he was covered in blood.Sectional Leader Zhou, within the sect's thirty-six leaders, could only be considered ordinary, with an average cultivation. He was no more than a Warrior Canopy cultivator.Under the Heaven's Primal rank, any cultivator in front of the Serpent Punishing stick would only have one fate, to be beaten.\u201cAhhh\u2026\u201d Sectional Leader Zhou was a big character, but after a hard beating from the Serpent Punishing stick, he was unable to bear this agonizing pain, and couldn't help but to let out a miserable shriek. At this moment, Zhou's appearance was completely tattered, lying down on the ground. Tiredness encompassed his whole body along with blood. Especially his face, which was beaten to a mushy pulp by Li Qiye.Seeing this domineering sight caused the disciples of the Cleansing Jade Peak to be in awe. Sectional Leader Zhou was one of the thirty-six leaders, as well as a second generation disciple, a senior of the third generation disciples.Plus, Sectional Leader Zhou was already a Warrior Canopy expert, but in the end, he was still beaten and rolled on the ground because of Li Qiye. He was not able to defend himself against the fury of the Serpent Punishing stick.This time, the disciples couldn't help but shiver once. They were all beaten badly by the stick as well, but from seeing this, maybe it wasn't something to be ashamed about; even an expert like Zhou was still thrashed like he was a dead snake!\u201cProtector Hu, save me\u2026\u201d In the end, Sectional Leader Zhou let out a pathetic bellow, calling for help.\u201cImpudence! What are you doing!\u201d After the scream for help, in the blink of an eye, a deafening roar echoed in the air, and a large group of men, that carried a menacing aura, entered the Cleansing Jade Peak!This group that suddenly rushed in the peak was not small in size. Outside of the ordinary disciples, there were also three sectional leaders and one protector. Besides these men, Leng Shizhi was also part of this group.A patrolling law enforcement team of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect suddenly appeared at the Cleansing Jade Peak, this was \u201ctoo coincidental\u201d!Moreover, this patrol team for the sect\u2026 was too luxurious. Outside of the normal law enforcement disciples, there were also three sectional leaders led by a protector. Even the number one man of the younger generation, Leng Shizhi, was also in this group.This type of team, if a disciple was found to do anything \u201cillegal\u201d and was caught by three sectional leaders, one protector, and a genius like Leng Shizhi, it would be evidence made out of steel. No matter what the \u201ccrime\u201d would be, this would be irrefutable evidence and irrefutable proof; one couldn't wash this suspicion clean!At this moment, Sectional Leader Zhou was pathetically lying on the ground and pitifully exclaimed: \u201cProtector, Li-Li Qiye was disrespectful to the elders, and planned to kill a senior. He conspired against me, h-he, he wants to rebel against the sect, and cheat the master as well as kill the ancestors\u2026\u201dSeeing this scene, even though Luo Fenghua and his peers were young, but they weren't dumb, especially the smart ones like Luo Fenghua. Everything suddenly became clear.Luo Fenghua and his peers felt their blood running cold, cold sweat overflew their whole bodies. Currently, Sectional Leader Zhou was lying bloody on the ground, and Li Qiye was caught at the scene by Protector Hu and his enforcement group\u2026[1] Zhou threw out four idioms in one sentence here to attack Li Qiye's character, quite beautiful.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The three sectional leaders were also from the camp of Elder Cao!Luo Fenghua's group immediately knew that this was a terrible trap when they thought back to a few days ago where Li Qiye taught a lesson to Leng Shizhi. They broke out in cold sweat from worrying for Li Qiye. This time, even if Li Qiye jumped into the Yellow river, it still wouldn't be enough to cleanse this matter!In the blink of an eye, the law enforcement group had surrounded Li Qiye, with the leader being Leng Shizhi.\u201cDisrespectful! Master cheating ancestor killer! Sect betrayer! Kill him without mercy!\u201dLeng Shizhi stared intensely at Li Qiye; his eyes quivered with frightening killing intent!Li Qiye smirked; he hadn't yet made a move; however, Li Shuangyan coldly scowled as she took a step forward. Once she was in front, her blood energy pierced the heavens; it was as if a Heavenly King had woken up. Her body exuded a cold pressure that could freeze ten thousand miles in a flash.Once Li Shuangyan walked forward, Leng Shizhi couldn't help but to tremble, and he inadvertently took two steps back. He was the genius of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; however, when he was compared to Li Shuangyan, the difference was too drastic.It wasn't just Leng Shizhi; even the three sectional leaders and Protector Hu were shaking as well. In the end, this was the descendant and princess of the Old Ox country. This wasn't someone with an undeserved reputation. She was a proud daughter of the heavens; even considering all of Grand Middle Territory, her reputation would still definitely be just as renowned.\u201cPrincess Li, this is an internal matter of our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. We are dealing with a traitor; please reconsider and do not interfere with our sect's affair.\u201d Protector Hu's courage rose as he said this with a grave tone. He licked his lips as he thought about the backing behind him.Li Shuangyan's elegant yet cold countenance suddenly flashed a sharp brilliance. She naturally didn't care about opposing the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.Right then, Li Qiye let loose a smile, narrowed his eyes, and then he said: \u201cIt seems there are some that want me to step forward; fine, I will step out in front to say a few words. My two hands aren't stained with blood, so others actually think that I am a nice person. Shuangyan, step back.\u201dLi Shuangyan glanced at Li Qiye, then repositioned herself behind his back without saying a word.Seeing Li Shuangyan listen to all of Li Qiye's orders, Leng Shizhi's jealousy could pierce the heaven. He was maddened with jealousy. In his heart, Li Shuangyan was a goddess; a heavenly immortal in his mind. Even though she was so obedient towards a useless bag of straws, she instead had never looked at him.Li Qiye stepped forward, brightly smiled at Leng Shizhi, and then he said: \u201cNo matter what kind of plots and devious plans you all are scheming, or the backings behind all of you, since it has deteriorated to the situation today, if I don't kill a certain few, people will truly think that I am a pushover.\u201dLeng Shizhi coldly commanded: \u201cYou sect betraying, master cheating, ancestor killer! You are truly one deserving to be killed by all! Go, kill this traitor!\u201d This signaled the law enforcement disciples that surrounded Li Qiye.The surrounding disciples simultaneously yelled: \u201cTraitor, lay down and accept your fate!\u201d In the blink of an eye, they summoned their Life Treasures that flew straight at Li Qiye.Each of the law enforcement disciple's moves were fierce; their first move was to use their Life Treasures to slay Li Qiye. They essentially meant that they didn't want Li Qiye to survive; they wanted to kill him on the spot.\u201cScram\u2026\u201d The smiling eyes of Li Qiye suddenly became cold. In the blink of an eye, he flew upward like a giant Peng, and propped himself up; the heavens allowed for this Peng to fly. His body was in the air, and he used unpredictable steps in order to escape the Life Treasures that came from the law enforcement disciples.A loud \u201cBang\u201d sounded, and, just as Li Qiye had escaped the Life Treasures' fire and thunder rays, his whole body ferociously struck down. This power was no longer in the realm of speed; in the middle of the fire and thunder rays, Li Qiye was akin to a massive Kun. One swing of its tail was enough to splash an entire ocean across ten thousand miles!The appearance of the Kun, with its heavenly aura, caused a deafening noise to ring in the skies. The law enforcement disciples essentially couldn't block the huge waves of the Kun. Under the assault of the powerful pressure, these disciples spewed out fresh blood, and they were all knocked away by giant waves.\u201cKun Peng Minor Sixth Form; the last profound truth of the six moves\u2026\u201d Li Qiye had finished his move, and the eyes of the three sectional leaders and the protector couldn't help but squint their eyes. Although the Kun Peng Minor Sixth Form was an incomplete Emperor merit law, to understand the last profound truth, even the most gifted disciple would still require decades in order to understand it!Li Qiye jumped towards the middle with the heavenly Peng and gigantic Kun in a state of constant transformation; this matter was too frightening.Li Qiye, with one move, had knocked away the law enforcement disciples, and then he landed on the ground. He staringly smiled at Leng Shizhi as he said: \u201cDo you want to come alone, or do you want to come with the sectional leaders and Protector Hu?\u201d\u201cDon't be so arrogant; even if you understand the last profound truth, it is still only an insignificant technique.\u201d Leng Shizhi's eyes became cold, and he yelled: \u201cToday, I will enlighten you on these things; you will find out what is truly a grand technique!\u201dFinished speaking, he opened his mouth wide to let out a Thirty Six Celestial Deities Sword. It immediately became a murderous forest-like sword formation that trapped Li Qiye in the middle.\u201cThirty-Six Celestial Deities Sword formation\u2026\u201dSeeing this sword formation, the Luo Fenghua crowd that had heard of this technique expressions couldn't help but darken.Thirty-Six Celestial Deities Sword formation was a technique created by an elder with the ranking of Ancient Saint. It was not just a merit law of Ancient Saint ranking, but it was also an extremely powerful Ancient Saint formation.The Cleansing Jade Peak disciples didn't think that Leng Shizhi, who was only a third generation disciple, would have the qualification to cultivate this merit law!Li Shuangyan's eyes also showed signs of concentration. She was staring intensely at Leng Shizhi's sword formation. She could be called an expert regarding this realm, and after an analysis, she knew that Leng Shizhi had not understood one-tenth of this sword formation; the power was still considerable, however. Regardless, this was still an Ancient Saint sword formation.Li Qiye suddenly was trapped in the sword formation. He smiled, and in the blink of an eye, he was as swift as a flying dragon and quick like a tiger's steps. With this speed, he successfully escaped the sharp winds of the more-than-thirty swords with the two Invisible Dual Blades in his hands that were flying out and creating \u201cWhoosh, Whoosh\u201d sounds, while he was colliding and slashing at the thirty-six Celestial Deities Swords.The sectional leaders and Protector Hu couldn't believe their eyes. These Invisible Dual Blades, which were crafted from ordinary steel and collided with a Life Treasure, weren't being damaged in the slightest. This was an unthinkable matter!Seeing this scene, Leng Shizhi became angry, and he let out a deafening roar. He then activated a lethal technique in the sword formation: \u201cCelestial Deities Imprisonment!\u201d\u201cClank, clank, clank!\u201dIn a flash, the boundless sea of swords poured down in torrents that were accompanied by screams. At the moment the sword struck down diagonally, it was unstoppable. Once anything came into contact with the sword's tip, it would immediately be pierced into millions of holes. This sword's tip, that had an unstoppable momentum, pierced straight towards Li Qiye.The pressure of this sword, without even mentioning Li Qiye's body, was something that even someone with a Golden Body wouldn't be able to resist.At this moment, Li Qiye's body moved at an inconceivable speed. The sword edge that was going to behead him was dodged by his sudden jump into the air; it was like his body was a Kun Peng when he jumped out of the Thirty Six Celestial Deities Sword formation!In just a flash, Li Qiye had jumped out from the formation. Protector Hu knew his stuff; he spoke with a horrified expression: \u201cHeavenly transformation! Kun Peng's Six Variants\u2026\u201dIn the fire and thunder lights, Li Qiye had already jumped in front of Leng Shizhi. The Invisible Dual Blades' cold reflection shimmered, and his left and right hands struck together straight for the head of Leng Shizhi!Leng Shizhi was undoubtedly a genius of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. His expression darkened, and the sound of \u201cWhoosh, whoosh\u201d filled the air. In the face of life and death, his body was covered with a godly armor.\u201cPluff.\u201d The godly armor which Leng Shizhi wore had a great origin, but, against the Invisible Dual Blades, it was still penetrated. The neck of Leng Shizhi became cold; strand by strand, his blood dripped downward. Just a little bit deeper, and his skull would have been separated from his neck!If he wasn't wearing the godly armor, with just these blades, he would have definitely met his end. This time, Leng Shizhi was extremely frightened.\u201cImpudence\u2026\u201d Seeing the deteriorating situation, the three sectional leaders yelled in a deafening manner, and they moved at the same time. They took out their Life Treasures and directly went for Li Qiye.These three sectional leaders weren't just lazily sitting around. They were all at the Warrior Canopy and Purified Rebirth ranks.\u201cScram\u2026\u201d In a flash, Li Qiye's hostility soared with a crimson killing intent. He let out a loud roar, and his Life Wheel appeared along with blood energy that seemed like a sea; with an all-destroying momentum, his blood energy burst forth. This type of domineering and overbearing power even made Li Shuangyan's expression change.In the blink of an eye, Li Qiye lifted his legs and then stomped heavily to jump outside. The most simple technique and the most simple transformation was also the most oppressive move! One kick flew out, and the world was encompassed. The heavens and earth were suppressed, and Gods and Demons were screaming! Just this single heavy kick had the weight of millions of Jun behind it!\u201cBang\u2026 Bang\u2026Bang\u2026\u201d Under this one kick, the three Life Treasures shattered. Life Treasures were just pieces of paper under this one kick of Li Qiye.This was Li Shuangyan's second time seeing such a kick. Her expression greatly changed, and, at this moment, she was certain that Li Qiye was practicing a peerless Immortal Physique!The three sectional leaders were frightened until their faces were deathly pale. They immediately shifted their positions, and they were able to escape this horrible kick from Li Qiye.The Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique of Li Qiye had the freedom to send and return whenever it wanted, and, even though the three sectional leaders could escape this kick, they still couldn't escape the Kun Peng's Six Variants of Li Qiye. While he was pulling back his feet, Li Qiye, like a Kun Peng, flew to the sky; in a flash, he appeared before the three sectional leaders.\u201cHeavenly transformation\u2026\u201d This extreme speed caused the three sectional leaders to be frighteningly amazed. They suddenly recognized the technique, however, it was too late.Li Qiye's kick was like the immortal poison of a scorpion's stinger. Under the Kun Peng's Six Variants, this kick was terribly fast. Under the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique, this kick was akin to ten thousand thunders that simultaneously roared together. The three sectional leaders fundamentally couldn't dodge this kick; it was simply too swift.[1] Jumping into the Yellow river \u2013 a phrase originating from the belief that people who were indicted wrongfully would commit suicide using this river to prove their innocence.[2] I actually like master cheating ancestor killing more than the longer line in the last chapter, even though it looks weird in English.[3] Peng = a giant eagle-like bird, Kun = a giant fish/whale, Kun Peng would be a transformation of both. In CN novels, this beast is usually top two in speed and top ten in power.[4] Golden Body here to my knowledge, has nothing to do with the Physiques in this book. It is a description in Chinese literature/Daoism of an impervious body, so it is more of an expression.[5] Jun is a measurement in China, is equal to 30 catties, and 1 catty is equal to 1.33 pound.[6] The first sentence might be a bit confusing because it was an idiom, but basically Li Qiye's kick is literally a normal kick, there is no energy or preparation involved is the meaning of that first sentence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sound of bones breaking into pieces was incomparably hard for these people to hear. Everyone couldn't help but feel their blood run cold. Without a doubt, the bones in the three sectional leader's entire bodies were broken under this one kick.Everyone shivered after they heard the sound of bones being fragmented. Warrior Canopy experts couldn't even stop one kick from Li Qiye; just how frightening was this kick?\u201cHell Suppressing Immortal Physique!\u201d Li Shuangyan muttered to herself with a shocked expression. At this point, she had become clear on Li Qiye's peerless Immortal Physique. It was one of the twelve, the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique.The Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique's heaviness could suffocate Gods and Devils. Once the physique appeared, it could suppress all magical laws. One had to know, to cultivate a peerless Immortal Physique was simply impossible for a mortal body, unless he was in possession of a peerless Immortal Physique Merit Law.Since the eternal past till now, many Immortal Emperors have created peerless Immortal Physique Merit Laws; however, if it was a mortal body, the chance of success at cultivating an Immortal Physique was still minuscule.Without a doubt, Li Qiye's Immortal Physique was surely the original form. Reaching grand completion was only a matter of time! The meaning behind this was that Li Qiye's physique merit law was even above an Immortal Emperor physique merit law. To be above an Immortal Emperor merit law; just what kind of physique merit law was this?As Li Shuangyan thought up to this point, her expression greatly changed. She knew the implication behind this. The weakness of the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique was that its speed was too slow. However, the Kun Peng was an existence that possessed the fastest speed in this world. Li Qiye used the Kun Peng's Six Variants as his Fate merit law, and this made up for the shortcoming of his Immortal Physique!The Kun Peng's Six Variants synergized with the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique; what kind of frightening existence was this? Li Qiye's body was truly the most domineering and violent weapon in this world!\u201cCelestial Deities Imprisonment!\u201d The moment Li Qiye had performed a mortal blow on the three sectional leaders, Leng Shizhi, who had escaped previously, sneaked an attack on Li Qiye. The Thirty-Six Celestial Deities Swords formation slashed towards Li Qiye with torrential sword auras that destroyed everything in its path; however, Li Qiye's body was just like a Kun Peng, and he escaped the formation in the blink of an eye.\u201cKun Peng's Six Variants, be careful\u2026\u201d Protector Hu became alarmed, he had seen this merit law before. Out of everyone in the entire Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, there was only the first elder that had practiced this law; this was the strongest Emperor merit law in the sect.Li Qiye's speed was too swift while Leng Shizhi was too slow to avoid, two cold auras flashed, a \u201cPhoosh\u201d sound rang, and the two Invisible Dual Blades pinned his body into the ground!He was still wearing the godly armor on his body. One had to know, the godly armor on his body was crafted from Godly Gold metal; however, under the Invisible Dual Blades, his godly armor was like a thin piece of paper that was suddenly nailed to the ground!\u201cAh\u2026\u201d With his body nailed to the ground, Leng Shizhi miserably bellowed.\u201cYou couldn't even understand one-tenth of the sword formation's profound truth, yet you still wanted to trap me?\u201d Li Qiye smiled insipidly with a severe gaze that showed he wanted to cut Leng Shizhi.\u201cPhoosh\u2026\u201d In the blink of an eye, a gust of wind rushed forward with blood energy blazing chaotically like a storm. Suddenly, Protector Hu made a move and snuck an attack behind Li Qiye. He wanted to pierce through Li Qiye's chest with one move.However, this one move was stopped by a single palm. Protector Hu had to take a few steps back.The person who stopped this blow for Li Qiye was not Li Shuangyan, but it was Tu Buyu, who was always wearing an amicable smile. Unknownst to all, second brother Tu Buyu had already stood to the side.\u201cProtector Hu, as a protector, sneaking an attack on a disciple can't be considered part of the rules.\u201d No matter the occasion, Tu Buyu's smile was always present.Protector Hu let out a deafening roar: \u201cDie!\u201d He didn't want to waste any words and he let out a long roar. He opened his mouth and spat out a pagoda. The appearance of this pagoda exuded an unending and boundless killing aura. The sound of the ghosts that continuously wailed tortured the ears as if one was in hell.The pagoda's appearance caused each magical law to descend. A loud \u201cbang\u201d sound occurred; this caused endless magical laws to transform into a humongous whirlpool. Within this whirlpool, completed runes were absorbed and spat out as the incomplete runes interweaved with each other into a composition. Once this composition appeared, it felt like it could annihilate all existences and swallow their souls.In the end, Protector Hu was a Heaven's Primal expert. This was the defining boundary for cultivators. Once a Heaven's Primal expert made a move, a strong and unyielding aura immediately would come to be.\u201cProtector Hu's Suppressing Evil Technique isn't bad.\u201d Tu Buyu wore his smile again and suddenly emanated sword vibrations. In a flash, his entire body brought in and sent out the Sword's Spirit with his whole body that became a Sword Domain. Tu Buyu flew inside the Sword's Spirit \u2013 into the sky like a proud God of War.\u201cClank\u2026\u201d One sword slew the whole nine worlds! One sword struck down! The universe's light came to an end! Under one sword, the entirety of heaven and earth were completely swept away! Tu Buyu's hand was not carrying a sword, but his Sword Spirit encompassed the whole of the Heavens and the Earth.\u201cFormula of the God of War!\u201d Seeing Tu Buyu's move, Li Qiye beamingly smiled. His expression became serious, and his eyes stared straight at Tu Buyu.In reality, the moment when Tu Buyu's God of War Formula came out, Li Shuangyan was also shocked. She had suddenly remembered a legend regarding the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.Protector Hu cultivated the Suppressing Evil Technique. One could say that this was a powerful Heavenly King method! Even though the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had fallen, and their Emperor laws were gone; as an Immortal Emperor Sect that had ruled over an ancient kingdom for millions of years, they still possessed many Ancient Saint, Heavenly Monarch, and Virtuous Paragon methods! These were also the powerful heritages of the sect, and, even though they had the methods, the sect lacked the inheritors!The scenario of the God of War Formula that faced the Suppressing Evil Technique was not in the least suspenseful. In reality, Tu Buyu's cultivation was not shallow either.One \u201cBang\u201d sounded. Tu Buyu didn't have a physical sword, but once the God of War Formula was activated, the pagoda of Protector Hu couldn't stop it. The suppressed pagoda was struck away by the spiritual sword, and Protector Hu wasn't able to stabilize it. He was knocked away by the powerful sword's spirit while he also violently sprayed a mouthful of fresh blood.In a flash, Li Qiye disappeared. As his body turned into a Kun Peng, the heavenly transformation's shocking absolute speed came into full-display! The moment Protector Hu fell down from the sky, Li Qiye instantly appeared in front of him.In this quick moment, Li Qiye's single kick ruthlessly struck downward like a whip. Protector Hu was already gravely wounded and was falling down from the sky; with Li Qiye suddenly making a move, he had no chance to escape, nor could he activate his Life Treasure. Li Qiye was too quick.At this moment, Protector Hu raised his two hands like a heavenly king erecting a pagoda; he only wanted to stop the one kick of Li Qiye from thrashing down.\u201cSnap!\u201d The sound of bones being broken rang out. Without any doubt, the technique essentially couldn't stop this single kick from Li Qiye. A pitiful \u201cAhh\u201d sound was soon heard. Li Qiye's kick ruthlessly struck Protector Hu's body, and the crackling sound of bones breaking sounded endlessly in the air.\u201cBang\u201d The moment they fell to the ground, the earth trembled. Protector Hu's body was hammered by Li Qiye on top of the earth; at this moment, there was no saving Protector Hu. His whole body was deformed and had nearly become a fleshy paste.The Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique: the supreme physique! Once the grand completion stage was reached, it was enough to make the Gods and Devils tremble in fear. The physical body alone was enough to crush the galaxy and suppress the heavenly skies!Even though Li Qiye's body had not reached grand completion, the weight of his body could be calculated in the millions of Jun.Protector Hu was extremely unlucky; he was a Heaven's Primal expert, yet still died in the hands of a Physique Accumulation disciple. No one could ever have the same misfortune as him.Even if Li Qiye had the supreme physique, it wouldn't have been this easy for him to kill Protector Hu. It was a shame that Protector Hu had also met the mysterious Tu Buyu. Tu Buyu's move caused him to be mortally wounded, and, facing Li Qiye in addition, he didn't have the strength for another fight. It would even be considered strange if he survived.\u201cWhy the need to go this far.\u201d Tu Buyu shook his head smilingly after seeing Li Qiye kill Protector Hu. Still, he didn't try to stop Li Qiye.At this point, no matter if it was Luo Fenghua or a different disciple from the Cleansing Jade Peak, their hearts shivered. Even though Li Qiye normally disciplined them to the point of bloodiness, they had never seen Li Qiye radiate such terrible killing intent before.However, Li Qiye's first move was killing all three sectional leaders and a protector. This vicious method was completely incongruous with a supposed thirteen-year-old boy.Killing Protector Hu had no impact on Li Qiye. Li Qiye walked in front of Leng Shizhi, who was nailed down to the ground with fresh blood all over the place.Even now, Leng Shizhi was still confused. He was a Warrior Canopy expert, so why did he lose to a new disciple that had only joined for less than one year? Li Qiye's cultivation was obviously far below him, but he was, on the contrary, no match for Li Qiye!In many cases, with a lower cultivation rank, merit laws alone weren't enough to fill the gap. Even if he was practicing an Emperor merit law, there was no chance to be at the Physique Accumulation rank; yet, to still be able to defeat someone at the Warrior Canopy rank\u2026Even then, Li Qiye was Li Qiye; other cultivators couldn't be compared to him. He understood the ultimate Dao truths of the Kun Peng's Six Variants!Li Qiye looked at Leng Shizhi and cheerfully said: \u201cThe sword formation was not bad; if you could have understood three parts, then maybe you could have actually trapped me. Unfortunately, you couldn't even understand one part, yet you dared to be arrogant in front of me. I can only say, you were courting death!\u201d\u201cYou, don't be rash. I, I, my master is an elder, yo-you, you\u2026\u201d At this moment, Leng Shizhi's courage was completely broken. He didn't think of such a result as this. Shouldn't it have been as easy as turning one's hand for three sectional leaders and his older brother to kill a disciple like Li Qiye?\u201cI know\u2026\u201d Leng Shizhi hadn't finished his words when a \u201csnap\u201d rang out. Li Qiye twisted his skull; Leng Shizhi didn't even have the chance to scream.\u201cEven if your master was a Mortal Emperor, I would still kill him without mercy.\u201d Li Qiye threw Leng Shizhi's head to one side, then rubbed both of his palms together in a carefree and calm manner like nothing had happened.At this point, the Cleansing Jade Peak disciple's legs became weak. In their eyes, Li Qiye was a death god that killed three sectional leaders and a protector as well as slaying Leng Shizhi in one breath; and, while doing so, his expression didn't change even once. One had to know, killing a sectional leader or a protector called for the death penalty in violation of the sectorial laws! To Li Qiye though, this matter was seemingly meaningless!\u201cDo you want me to personally take you out of the Cleansing Jade Peak or not?\u201d Li Qiye brilliantly smiled at the group of law enforcement disciples; his expression was both amicable and adorable.Seeing the amicable and cute countenance of Li Qiye, the legs of these disciples greatly trembled. How was he merely a thirteen or fourteen-year-old boy? Li Qiye was clearly an evil butcher! Li Qiye didn't need to say a second sentence before these disciples immediately rushed out of the Cleansing Jade Peak.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Killing sectional leaders and a protector \u2013 this matter, regardless of what sect it happened at, would be a huge crime that was punishable by death!\u201cEscape, why do I have to escape?\u201d Li Qiye nonchalantly said. His current appearance didn't look like he had just killed people, it was exactly as if he just did some tiny trivial things.\u201cBut, yo-you just killed Protector Hu and his group.\u201d Luo Fenghua and his group felt fear and trepidation in the face of a disaster. At this moment, they finally realized what a vicious person was like. Luo Fenghua's heart was pounding; fortunately for him, that day when he had challenged his first brother, his first brother didn't care. Otherwise, the consequences would have been inconceivable! His first brother killed protectors and sectional leaders like they were nothing; for him to kill just a disciple, it was not a big deal.Li Qiye smilingly said: \u201cThis is called self-defense, not murder.\u201dThe Cleansing Jade Peak disciples suddenly became silent. A calamity was about to come, and the punishment was an inescapable death; yet, this first brother was still acting as if nothing had happened.At this point, Li Qiye looked at Tu Buyu, and he said: \u201cYour God's Fist was excellent.\u201dAn unforgettable memory for Li Qiye; regarding the God of War Formula, it appeared in his mind. Unexpectedly, Tu Buyu was practicing the God of War Formula! This was outside of Li Qiye's expectations.Tu Buyu maintained his kind and cheerful smile while replying: \u201cOf course not, of course not. Compared to the immortal techniques of First Brother, my ability is like an insignificant worm's.\u201dLi Shuangyan's face became serious. Today, the God of War Formula might have been forgotten by the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, or maybe they have never heard of it; however, she had heard of a legend. In his youth, Immortal Emperor Min Ren practiced the God of War Formula. He used this technique throughout his life. Moreover, this formula was rumored to be a renowned ancient method from the past; it was extremely heaven defying.For unknown reasons, after Immortal Emperor Min Ren had shouldered the Heaven's Will and became an Immortal Emperor, he didn't pass down this formula. Out of all of Min Ren's disciples, none have practiced this technique.Immortal Emperor Min Ren had even passed down his Heaven's Will secret techniques to his disciples and left them in the sect, but he never chose to pass down the God of War Formula; this matter left everyone perplexed.Regarding Tu Buyu's ambiguous attitude; Li Qiye only smiled, and he said: \u201cThe God of War Formula is fine, and the God Slaughtering Formula is also fine; however, your cultivation is not important. What is important is\u2026 that you don't stand in my way! Otherwise, death without mercy!\u201d\u201cFirst Brother said too much.\u201d Tu Buyu hurriedly said: \u201cFirst Brother is wise and powerful like a god; your talents exceed the sky. This little brother has always wanted to be your heavenly thunder, and I will strike whenever you command. One word from older brother and I will rush into the fire and smoke without any hesitation.\u201dTu Buyu's words rendered the Cleansing Jade Peak's disciples speechless. Tu Buyu was clearly much, much older than Li Qiye, he could even be the grandfather of Li Qiye, but his ass kissing ability was without equal.\u201cI originally thought that Nan Huairen's ability to ass kiss was matchless, but, today, it seems like Nan Huairen has met his match.\u201d Li Qiye looked at Tu Buyu. In reality, to him, whether Tu Buyu's words were true or not was not of importance.Hearing Li Qiye's words, Tu Buyu didn't become angry, and he maintained his amiable smile; this caused others to be unable to predict his mysterious intentions.\u201cTraitor, accept your death!\u201d At this time, an angry roar exploded throughout the entire Cleansing Jade Peak. A gigantic hand traversed the heavens and came crashing down. It seemed capable of crushing the entire Cleansing Jade Peak into dust.Cao Xiong had rushed to the scene after hearing about his disciple's deaths. His fiery rage soared, and he hurried to the Cleansing Jade Peak in order to behead Li Qiye. Cao Xiong was like a furious lion with imposing momentum, and his every strand of energy made others incapable to even breathe.Cao Xiong's huge palm swatted downwards, carrying the power of tens of millions of Jun. This one palm could smash the entirety of the Cleansing Jade Peak! A Named Hero was still a Named Hero after all, and, at this level, one stomp would cause the grand earth to shake three times! This was a lord of an entire region!When Cao Xiong's gigantic hand covered the whole sky, the Cleansing Jade Peak disciples lost their color; their faces became pale, and they were without any signs of blood. An angry Named Hero could cause blood to flow for one thousand miles. One palm from a Named Hero was enough to destroy mountains and rivers.\u201cOpen\u2026\u201d Hearing the roar, Li Shuangyan, who was standing beside Li Qiye, immediately made her move. In a flash, Li Shuangyan was unyieldingly solitary; her whole body was like a flourishing lotus flower, with each of its petals being blindingly translucent. The worse part was that the petals were gigantic and were enough to uphold the heavens. The moment the lotus flower was in full bloom, it could support the nine heavens and ten earths.\u201cBang!\u201d Li Shuangyan didn't make any visible movements, but she was able to easily deflect the gigantic palm from Cao Xiong; the palm could no longer reach the ground.Li Shuangyan, with a natural born Pure Crystal Physique, one of the twenty-four Emperor Physiques, had already reached grand completion after cultivation. She currently practiced one of the eighteen Saint Physiques that was the Pure Jade Physique with a little bit of success!The Pure Crystal Physique, when reaching grand completion, could rank up into the Pure Jade Physique. Once this physique appeared it would be like a lotus in full bloom, it utilized an incredibly powerful stance to obstruct Cao Xiong's one palm.\u201cPrincess Li, this is our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect punishing a traitor, do not intervene!\u201d His disciples were killed, how could Cao Xiong remain without rage?Even though Cao Xiong didn't dare to completely turn against Li Shuangyan, his speech was still full of confidence.Li Shuangyan still hadn't said a word. Her blooming lotus physique blocked Cao Xiong; he had reddened his complexion to the point of shivering anger. As a Named Hero, he was still no match for Li Shuangyan.One couldn't blame Cao Xiong for being weak, it was just that Li Shuangyan was too strong. Within the younger generation, she was renowned; even throughout the entire Mortal Emperor World, she would still be considered strong.\u201cThe Nine Saint Demon Gate's reputation is naturally well deserved.\u201d At this moment, a cold voice spoke up. He took one step forward, and the constellations immediately changed directions. His blood energy immediately enveloped the entire Cleansing Jade Peak. His Royal Noble pressure was like a sharp sword that caused pain and soreness to the bystanders.The Cleansing Jade Peak disciples were frightened as one disciple involuntarily cried out: \u201cGuest adviser\u2026!\u201dGuest Adviser Dong Shenglong: the number one character of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. As an experienced Royal Noble, the moment he stood forward, countless amounts of people drew cold breaths. At the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, a Royal Noble was truly unbeatable. That was not even mentioning that Dong Shenglong was an experienced Royal Noble, and even his title was bestowed upon him by the Mortal Emperor! It was exceedingly difficult to see through him.Dong Shenglong walked step by step, with the grand Dao crying out harmoniously. Under his feet was an interwoven grand Dao formation, it carried the momentum of mountains and rivers as well as the boundless world's spirit energy from under the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. This combination of powers pressed down upon Li Shuangyan; this vast energy was like the rolling vast ocean and an earthen bull that capsized its gigantic body and caused the entire Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect to be caught up in its shocking momentum.Li Shuangyan's elegant countenance sent out bleak coldness with her slender arms gently motioning. Under one dragon slaying technique, she had successfully blocked the advancing formation of Dong Shenglong.\u201cBang.\u201d Under this technique, the force went straight downwards into the Cleansing Jade Peak; this caused a chasm to form in the ground.Dong Shenglong's eyes couldn't help but become cold. After one move, he realized that he had met a worthy foe. What was frightening him inside was that Li Shuangyan was so young, yet she was an aspiring Royal Noble; this aptitude was too terrifying. One had to be aware that the difficult Dao era had just come to an end not too long ago, yet Li Shuangyan was already aspiring to be a Royal Noble; this talent could cause others to tremble.\u201cBrother Dong, what matter is worth troubling you!\u201d At this moment, a profound sound loudly rang out. Immediately afterward, five people came down from the sky. This was the first elder along with the other four elders!The first elder had arrived, and Dong Shenglong recovered his step and slowly said: \u201cBrother Gu, your traitor is fierce; I was only interested in helping your sect.\u201dCao Xiong could come here, so the first elder would have also received the news from a disciple. He knew an important matter had happened, so he brought the other elders along as well.At this point, Li Shuangyan withdrew her physique's stance, and the lotus flower disappeared. Cao Xiong severely shouted: \u201cTraitor, accept your death!\u201dHis yelling finished, and he sent one strike that was aimed to behead Li Qiye.Regarding Cao Xiong's attack, Li Qiye didn't even twitch his brows once.The first elder immediately stopped Cao Xiong, and he gravely said: \u201cLittle Brother Cao, don't be hasty. Let us hear what Li Qiye has to say.\u201dCao Xiong angrily yelled: \u201cOlder Brother, he is a subordinate that offended his superiors, killed sectional leaders, and he murdered a protector. These are sins of cheating one's own master and destroying his ancestors; what else is there to say? This animal must be decapitated in order to cleanse the sect.\u201dFirst Elder maintained his deep tone, and he said: \u201cBrother Cao, right or wrong, the sect will have an answer. If he had committed a great sin, then why do you feel the need to rush and take his life? Wait until a verdict is available; executing him then wouldn't be too late.\u201d\u201cBrother Gu, this person is vicious. Not only is he ruthless and cold-blooded, but he killed his own sect members. Moreover, he conspired with outsiders, betrayed the sect, and he planned to cause chaos. If this person is allowed to live for one more day, then it would bring greater risk to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201d Dong Shenglong, who was standing to the side, assisted Cao Xiong.\u201cThis matter is of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. This is not the time for an outsider to point their finger!\u201d The moment when a storm was looming; Li Qiye, as the main character, was acting leisurely without any care. He continued: \u201cThe business of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect is not up to an outsider to run their big mouth!\u201dLi Qiye gazed directly at Dong Shenglong; he was clearly provoking him.Li Qiye's words frightened Luo Fenghua's group. First, he killed the sectional leaders and a protector, and now he was provoking a Royal Noble adviser; this was courting death! Luo Fenghua's group was shocked and thought: didn't first brother think the matter was grave enough already? He was even going against Dong Shenglong.\u201cIf I am an outsider, then what about princess Li standing beside you?\u201d At this moment, Dong Shenglong's gaze exuded a chilling aura that pressured others, and he coldly said: \u201cJunior, you conspire with an outsider, plotting to cause chaos, and you still have the nerves to talk big?\u201d\u201cWhere did this old turtle came from to grumble in front of my presence?\u201d Li Qiye was utterly tired of Dong Shenglong's appearance, and he said: \u201cThe Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the Nine Saint Demon Gate are in-laws, this is no secret. Princess Li is still considered part of our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect! What now? Our in-law relationship is causing the Heavenly God Sect to feel pressured, so they sent a damned old man like you to break up the relationship between our two sects? Therefore it is clear that you, this old turtle, dispatched the traitors in our sect and wanted to murder me, destroying our marital pact.\u201d[1] The part about the ocean and bull might be weird, but they rhyme with each other in the raw, actually this whole paragraph was nearly all four words poetic phrases.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He faced the first elder and the other four elders before saying: \u201cElders, my words are the truth. If our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the Nine Saint Demon Gate becomes in-laws, who would be the most unwilling to see this? If one wants to break the marital pact, the most direct and effective method would be to slay me on false charges. What is cheating one's master and killing one's ancestor? What is disrespectful to seniors? These are all false accusations. The true goal is to destroy our two sect's marriage.\u201dThese small schemes to Li Qiye, who had lived for countless years, were simply insufficient to reach the apex. If Dong Shenglong didn't come, then he would need to waste his breath to justify everything. However, once Dong Shenglong had actually arrived, this was the same as giving him a living target.Li Qiye leisurely and comfortably said: \u201cElders, protectors; I'm afraid the one wanting to betray the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect is not me. It is an entirely different person. There is a person here that conspires with the Heavenly God Sect\u2026 That person conspires both internally and externally in order to hurt and massacre disciples.\u201dAt this point, since it was such a big matter, the other protectors were all rushing over. Now, the entire upper echelon of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect were gathered at the Cleansing Jade Peak.Cao Xiong reddened with anger and loudly yelled: \u201cTraitor! Spewing blood on others is an unforgivable crime; one that can't be redeemed even with ten thousand deaths!\u201dHe wanted to cross over towards Li Qiye, but he was stopped by Elder Gu.Cao Xiong furiously yelled: \u201cOlder brother, could it be that you really want to protect a traitor that killed his own sect members?!\u201dAt this moment, First Elder Gu Tieshou's expression became cold, and he unemotionally said: \u201cLittle Brother, the sect's elders and protectors are all here. Regarding this matter, right or wrong, black or white, everyone will discuss towards a conclusion! Why is there a need for little brother to be so hasty at this moment?!\u201dFirst Elder was not a fool. This matter was strange, and it was seemingly unordinary. Dong Shenglong wouldn't bring this matter upon himself! At this moment, First Elder's complexion greatly soured.Yet, at this time, Li Qiye interrupted and unhurriedly said: \u201cElder Cao is in such a rush to kill me for the sake of silencing. Elder Cao and this old fellow Dong conspired together to do evil things. They planned to murder me, and destroy the marriage between the two sects. Respect to all of our elders and protectors, right or wrong, black or white, I trust that everyone's eyes are as bright as the snow; who is loyal and who is traitorous? It is easy to distinguish after one look.\u201d\u201cAnimal, since you are spewing blood on others, you cannot be left alive!\u201dDong Shenglong deafeningly roared, and, in the blink of an eye, his blood energy soared to the sky; his Royal Noble pressure ran rampant, aiming for Li Qiye.\u201cBrother Dong, please have some self-control!\u201dAt this moment, First Elder Gu Tieshou's eyes shone fiercely with killing intent. At this moment, the normally peaceful First Elder had become a different person!Dong Shenglong's Royal Noble pressure hadn't decreased, but rather it increased; a \u201cBang Bang\u201d sound reverberated in the air. The frightening true energy floated above his head like the unyielding roar of a dragon. His Royal Noble pressure caused all of the protectors and elders to lose their colors.First Elder Gu Tieshou scowled coldly; his blood energy immediately surged, and the sound of his longevity blood crashed against the shore, like a gigantic ancient thunderous Ming. The moment when his blood energy soared, there was the sound of a Kun Peng screaming. In the Fate Palace of the first elder, a Kun Peng jumped outside. The Kun Peng covered the sky, and it antagonized mother earth itself. At this moment, the body of First Elder had a continuous and powerful Royal Noble's pressure!Royal Noble; that's right, First Elder Gu Tieshou was indeed a Royal Noble. This matter not only shocked the disciples, but it even shocked Elder Sun's group. Cao Xiong especially squinted his eyes!Right now, Gu Tieshou was meeting Dong Shenglong; each step was creating a new world. The Kun Peng floating on the peak of his head seemingly wanted to crack the earth and smash the sky. In the presence of a Kun Peng's heavenly pressure, all existences were its devout worshippers!Everyone didn't expect First Elder Gu to be a hidden expert. Everyone had thought that he was just a Named Hero; a peak Named Hero at best. They didn't believe that his true strength was that of a Royal Noble!Right then Dong Shenglong, as an experienced Royal Noble, immediately changed his expression. As both of them were Royal Nobles, he felt a certain sense of threat because Elder Gu practiced an Emperor merit law. On top of this, it was the strongest Emperor merit law left behind by Immortal Emperor Min Ren: the Kun Peng's Six Variants! This was the core Emperor merit law of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, and it was a great threat to Dong Shenglong.\u201cGood, good, good! Brother Gu is very secretive about his power. It causes others to misunderstand! Today, it seems like I have meddled in others business, and my kindness is being treated as being two-faced! If this is the case, then this Dong will first take my leave!\u201dDong Shenglong's eyes sunk. After speaking, he turned around and left.Dong Shenglong was a clever man. He knew that the current situation was disadvantageous to him. If he remained here any longer, he would be trapped inside. It was better to take a step back!Cao Xiong's expression was hard to look at to the extreme. First Elder's hidden strength was able to repel Dong Shenglong. This situation suddenly became much worse for him.At this moment, Li Qiye casually said: \u201cIt seems like there is someone who felt guilty and ran away first.\u201dThis sudden reversal left Luo Fenghua's group to be dumbfounded. What was called blocking the fierce waves? What was called repelling the powerful enemies with words? They finally experienced it today! Their first brother had already expected this, and he naturally was not afraid of the powerful opponents.Cao Xiong fiercely yelled: \u201cTraitor! You cheat your master and kill your ancestors, yet you still dare to say nonsensical words and spew blood on others?! Today, I will obtain justice for my dead disciples!\u201dLi Qiye watched Cao Xiong, and he slowly spoke: \u201cElder Cao, master cheating and ancestors killing? I have never done such a thing. If you want to frame someone, there are plenty of ways! Maybe Elder Cao is afraid that your schemes will be revealed, so you are hastily trying to silence me?\u201d\u201cAnimal, with these words of yours, this great seat can immediately kill you!\u201d Elder Cao let out a deafening roar, and he headed towards Li Qiye to make a move.\u201cLittle Brother, calm your mind; don't be angry!\u201d First Elder Gu Tieshou let out a roar. At this moment, Gu Tieshou had finally let loose a storm, and his Royal Noble pressure directly suppressed Cao Xiong.Under this pressure, Cao Xiong squinted his eyes and aggressively said: \u201cFirst Brother, do you truly want to protect this animal? He is killing his own sect members; if this type of disciple isn't punished, this will render the hearts of other disciples cold. We will be shunned by others. From now on, our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's rules will no longer be enforced!\u201dLi Qiye let out a laugh then said: \u201cElder Cao had vowed that I had killed sect members. Please tell me then: how did I kill our own sect members? If you can't, then using your position as an elder to conspire against a disciple, what is your plan and ambition!?\u201dLi Qiye instead returned a blow. The elders and protectors glanced at each other. In reality, everyone felt that this matter was not so simple. Dong Shenglong's appearance was a hint that this was the case.\u201cGood, good, good\u2026 You are good for an animal with a razor-sharp tongue!\u201d Cao Xiong coldly smiled, and he said: \u201cEven if you could speak lotus-like and flowery words, it doesn't erase the fact that you killed three sectional leaders, massacred Protector Hu, and murdered Zhi'er. The evidence is as visible as the mountains; how is this not killing one's own sect members?\u201dLi Qiye spoke without any signs of panic or haste: \u201cIt could only be said that the three sectional leaders, Protector Hu, and Leng Shizhi had it coming; I was only acting in self-defense.\u201d\u201cGood, good, good! As you can see Brother Gu, he still dares to defensively quibble! The evidence is like the mountains in front of our eyes!\u201dFirst Elder Gu Tieshou looked at Li Qiye, and he gravely said: \u201cWhat happened? For what reasons did you kill the three sectional leaders, Protector Hu, and Leng Shizhi for?\u201dLi Qiye innocently said: \u201cDear elder, I was only acting in self-defense. Protector Hu brought along the law enforcement team, and they suddenly appeared at the Cleansing Jade Peak. They suddenly wanted to make a move on me; they wanted to kill, so I could only fight back. Their reasonings and Elder Cao's were the same. What is cheating one's master and killing one's ancestors? What is disrespectful? This must be a conspiracy!\u201d\u201cYou fart!\u201d His face turning red, Cao Xiong yelled: \u201cFrom the report of the law enforcement disciples, Sectional Leader Zhou asked for help, so Protector Hu and the law enforcement team went to the Cleansing Jade Peak! You\u2026 This animal with the heart of a vile serpent only wants to cause chaos. After you had been seen through, you wanted to kill and silence everyone!\u201dAt this moment, Sectional Leader Zhou, who was hiding behind Cao Xiong, came out and said: \u201cDear elders and protectors, the truth was really just like this. Li Qiye wanted to conspire against me. So I, I, I asked for help. Protector Hu and the law enforcement team ran here to help, but I didn't think that this person's heart was vile just like a serpent\u2026 He massacred Protector Hu's group.\u201dGu Tieshou stared at Li Qiye, and he gravely asked: \u201cThere was an event such as this?\u201dAt this moment, the elders and protectors couldn't help but glance at each other. Li Qiye, an ordinary disciple, wanted to murder Sectional Leader Zhou? This matter was just a little bit unreasonable.Li Qiye smiled, and he slowly explained: \u201cElder, I don't know what this conspiracy is about. Even if it is a conspiracy, then how could Sectional Leader Zhou survive until now? I was able to kill Protector Hu; if I truly wanted to murder him, I could kill him easily like it was nothing. I spared his one life; the disciples of the Cleansing Jade Peak all saw with their own eyes. I was only teaching Sectional Leader Zhou a little lesson. I didn't think that Sectional Leader Zhou was such a bag of straws to the point that even a Physique Accumulation disciple like me was stronger than him. Sectional Leader Zhou's skill was not refined; you can't blame this matter on me.\u201dCao Xiong gravely said: \u201cNonsense, you are clearly a spy sent by another sect with hidden cultivation! You wanted to conspire and cause chaos. You were found out by Sectional Leader Zhou, so you wanted to kill and suppress his voice!\u201dLi Qiye smilingly said: \u201cElder Cao, you are the one spewing blood on others. Ask the Cleansing Jade Peak disciples: what was the reason behind my teaching Sectional Leader Zhou a lesson? From my perspective, I'm afraid that Sectional Leader Zhou was instructed by others, and conspired against me. I have the responsibilities of Dao instruction for the Cleansing Jade Peak. It could be said that I was nervous with trepidation. For Dao instruction, I exhausted much blood and sweat, but Sectional Leader Zhou was definite in his accusation that I was teaching the devil arts! He said that I brought a devil Dao to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect! Since he insulted my sweat and blood's effort, as long as I have a single drop of courageous blood in me, how could I endure this?\u201d\u201cYou clearly brought the devil arts into the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect! I was afraid that the disciples would succumb to the devil Dao. In order to save them from your poisoning, I had to stop them.\u201d Sectional Leader Zhou contended with absolute confidence.Li Qiye loudly laughed, and he said: \u201cWhether it is the devil Dao or not, everyone's hearts know the truth. One person can lie, but the Cleansing Jade Peak's three hundred disciples cannot all lie. Whether I was teaching the devil Dao or not, dear elders and protectors, don't be hesitant to ask the disciples a little bit!\u201dHearing Li Qiye's words, Gu Tieshou examined the disciples currently present. He randomly called for one disciple and inquired: \u201cWhat method did your first brother teach you all?\u201d[1] More direct translation: One speaking recklessly, one speaking foolishly, holding blood in mouth to spew on someone else \u2013 three four words phrases.[2] Two-faced here original words were the lung and river of a donkey, meaning he had hidden bad/animal intentions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

First brother was simply only deducing the defects in my Jade Spiral Merit Law and Flying Moth Swordplay that were present during my inception to the sect.\u201d\u201cRepeat what your first brother had said regarding the methods, so I can hear a little of what he said.\u201dThis disciple didn't dare to be disrespectful; he hastily recited the merit laws Li Qiye had revised, as well as the individual corrections in the techniques to First Elder.Having heard the words of this disciple, First Elder Gu Tieshou couldn't help but change his expression. In reality, the first elder wasn't the only one that was astonished, but the other elders and protectors were as well.The first elder didn't dare to believe what the disciples had spoke: \u201cThis is truly the method your first brother had said?\u201dThe disciple sincerely replied: \u201cMy respect to the elder; this disciple doesn't dare to lie, my words are thousands of genuine and innumerable truths.\"Gu Tieshou couldn't believe it. After he recovered from his astonishment, he picked a few random disciples from the three hundred. These disciples recited their merit laws and flawed techniques. This caused Gu Tieshou and the elders, as well as the protectors, to be shocked.Elder Qian, one of the six elders, inconceivably said: \u201cHow is this a foundational merit law? Ah! This is an entirely complete grand Dao guiding principle!\u201dElder Wu, who was shocked, also said: \u201cI have cultivated for more than one thousand years and have read the Jade Spirit Merit Law no less than one hundred times, but I have never thought that it was possible to understand this merit law like this. This interpretation, I'm afraid this is the ultimate profound truths of the Jade Spirit Merit Law, and this is the true essence of this method.\u201dAlso supporting Li Qiye, Elder Sun said: \u201cIf this was an evil sect's devil Dao, then our practices must be the real evil sect's devil Dao. I'm afraid there is no one in this world that could create a foundational merit law and make it so mysterious with such an imposing grand Dao!\u201dThis was not the first time Elder Sun had experienced the magic of Li Qiye; however, when he had heard these interpretations, he was still shaken. Elder Sun supported Li Qiye the most out of any other elders.Even more elders and protectors were at a loss for words. Li Qiye's interpretations of the foundational merit laws were mysteriously refined ten thousand times in a manner that lacked any defects. Li Qiye's pointers on the flawed techniques could be said to hit the mark every time. They cultivated for hundreds and even thousands of years, but they still couldn't interpret merit laws to this level. Today, they had finally found out that even the most basic foundational merit laws could be derived to this stage. Before, they thought they knew the essentials of the merit laws, but in reality, what they knew was only the skin and fur of the foundational merit laws.A protector emotionally said: \u201cIf I could have understood the Jade Spirit Merit Law to this level that year, then it would have been enough for my entire life!\u201dIt took a while for Gu Tieshou to regain his thoughts. Everyone knew that Li Qiye had a Mortal Physique, a Mortal Life Wheel, and a Mortal Fate Palace, yet he was able to deduced such fine interpretations. No one would ever believe this! Even a genius with talents as high as the sky still wouldn't be able to have deductions at this level! It was unreachable!Gu Tieshou emotionally stared at Li Qiye, and doubtfully asked: \u201cThese are really your meditation experiences?\u201dLi Qiye smiled, and he said: \u201cDear elder: this is merely one tiny part of my understandings; this is just a little experience, and it can't be considered profound.\u201dLi Qiye having said this caused First Elder Gue Tieshou to suddenly choke on his words. If this was only a \u201ctiny part of understanding and a little experience\u201d, then the word genius was not enough to describe him. He could only be called \u201cdemon's spawn\u201d!\u201cOlder brother, it seems like we had missed a genius. Li Qiye's perception is extremely frightening. Some time ago, I had a little problem with my cultivation, and it was Li Qiye who gave me valuable advice.\u201d At this point, Elder Sun also revealed his matter in order to support Li Qiye.The elders and protectors couldn't help but become amazed after they heard Elder Sun's story. This truly was unfathomable.Elder Qian said with a changed expression: \u201cThere was a rumor that a person's Physique, Life Wheel, and Fate Palace were not the only criterion to measure talent. I didn't believe it and considered it to be a load of crap. It seems like today, the ancient wise men didn't fool me.\u201dElder Wu of the six elders looked at Sectional Leader Zhou, and, at this moment, he said: \u201cSectional Leader Zhou, if this was an evil sect's devil Dao then there is no correct path in this world. If you were confused, don't be confused to this extreme.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d The sudden reversal of the situation caused Sectional Leader Zhou to be unable to react.Li Qiye, at this point, said with indistinction: \u201cI'm afraid this wasn't confusion, but a scheme to get rid of me. To Sectional Leader Zhou, what I instructed was not important. The important thing was to eliminate me.\u201dGu Tieshou's eyes became fierce; his pressure immediately suppressed Sectional Leader Zhou, and he gravely said: \u201cSectional Leader Zhou, what is going on?\u201dLi Qiye's understanding of the foundational merit laws alone was an extremely valuable treasure to the declining Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, and, at this time, Gu Tieshou absolutely wanted to protect Li Qiye no matter the circumstances. He knew that Li Qiye was important not only because of the marital pact, but also because of his profound knowledge.\u201cI, I, I\u2026\u201d Sectional Leader Zhou, at the moment, couldn't speak half a word, and he couldn't help but to stare at Cao Xiong.Cao Xiong knew the situation was not good, so he immediately said: \u201cSectional Leader Zhou was so foolish, and he couldn't even see through the profound merit laws! This is worthy of punishment, but the traitor remains to be rebellious against the Dao. He killed the three sectional leaders, Protector Hu, and Zhi'er! This is absolutely unforgivable!\u201dTo Cao Xiong, today was the day where he lost his money and only became ill. Not only could he not kill Li Qiye, but both of his disciples were killed. Especially Leng Shizhi, who was the disciple meant to inherit his legacy. With such a highly valued disciple being killed, it made his heart bleed.Li Qiye leisurely retorted: \u201cIf I truly conspired to betray, then this was a crime worthy of ten thousand deaths. Unfortunately, I am a victim. Originally, it was Sectional Leader Zhou who couldn't tell black from white, and he accused me of bringing evil sect devil Daos into the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. After this, it was Protector Hu who suddenly brought a big group of law enforcement disciples that wanted to join the fray and kill me. They didn't give me a chance to defend myself; this was definitely an evil plan\u2026\u201d\u201cThere were too many coincidences in this matter. Isn't this just trying to push me towards my demise? Why were Elder Cao and old man Dong together? The two of you were even faster than the other elders. Just like before, you two didn't differentiate black from white, and you also wanted to kill me. Isn't this just wanting to kill me before I could talk? Elder Cao, are you not conspiring with the Heavenly God Sect, ah? Elder Cao, you betrayed the sect and conspired with outsiders. This is a capital crime, infamous throughout eternity!\u201d Li Qiye carefully conveyed the scheme, causing the disciples of the Cleansing Jade Peak to be frozen. Their first brother easily reversed the situation. Such a meticulous and articulate plan was just too dreadful. Their first brother's intelligence was as vast as the sea.Li Shuangyan, as an outsider observing the situation, was even more moved. Li Qiye killed the three leaders and Protector Hu without any restraint like it was just some minor inconvenience. Currently, his frank and confident explanation easily reversed the situation. This was simply one palm covering the clouds in the sky and one fist calming the torrential rains. Moreover, from the beginning to end, he was carefree. This matter to him was akin to eating breakfast, leaving Li Shuangyan horrified.Li Shuangyan realized that Li Qiye was not simply mysterious. Today, she witnessed his calculating means when dealing with others; he was killing without seeing blood.Even Tu Buyu, who was standing to the side, had his eyes flash. Li Qiye's actions today, even after living for a thousand years, astonished him.In reality, this trivial planning was essentially nothing to Li Qiye. Back when he schemed against the whole world; that was a truly grand plan.\u201cAnimal, your death draws near, and you are still running your mouth\u2026\u201d Cao Xiong was shivering from anger. This plan was formulated by his own hand, but right now, Li Qiye had put his king in checkmate. How could he not have his hands tied?First Elder Gu Tieshou coldly said: \u201cLittle brother Cao, there are many doubts and unknowns. To say that Li Qiye is a traitor at this moment is just too simplistic.\u201dThe thing he didn't want to see the most was Cao Xiong and Dong Shenglong being together, but that was obvious at this point.Aside from Gu Tieshou, the other elders and protectors were all also biased for Li Qiye, but they didn't have any condemning evidence; they couldn't say much.\u201cOld brother wouldn't really trust this animal, right?\u201d Cao Xiong was vomiting blood from anger. All of his planning came to nothing, and his two disciples died in vain!Gu Tieshou coldly said: \u201cAt the very least, there are some dubious suspicions in this matter.\u201dWithout evidence, he couldn't punish Cao Xiong for conspiring with Dong Shenglong, but this matter left him extremely unsatisfied.Cao Xiong retorted severely: \u201cGood, good, Protector Hu and the others died for no reason then!\u201dAt this point, he unleashed another hidden card, and he gravely spoke: \u201cEven if Sectional Leader Zhou was confused, this animal having hidden intentions is the hard truth. This animal secretly stole the Kun Peng's Six Variants!\u201d\u201cStole the Kun Peng's Six Variants!\u201d The protectors and elders that were currently present were shocked.First Elder Gu Tieshou's face became tightly constricted, and he glared intensely at Li Qiye. The Kun Peng's Six Variants was the core Emperor merit law of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, and it was also the only Emperor merit law left behind that wasn't incomplete! This matter was of grave importance, and this couldn't be neglected.Gu Tieshou stared at Li Qiye, and he asked with a serious tone: \u201cIs this the truth?\u201dRegarding the Kun Peng's Six Variants, Gu Tieshou couldn't afford to not be careful.Li Qiye asked in a very innocent manner: \u201cWhat is the Kun Peng's Six Variants?\u201d\u201cElder, don't be fooled by him.\u201d Sectional Leader Zhou found a chance to tie the board, so he loudly exclaimed: \u201cI saw with my own eyes his usage of the Heavenly Transformation to escape from the Thirty Six Celestial Deities Sword formation of nephew Leng. These are thousands of genuine innumerable truths!\u201d\u201cElders, are you talking about this?\u201d At this point, inside the Fate Palace of Li Qiye, a Kun Peng leaped out. The Kun Peng was as large as a fist and was extremely vibrant. The moment it jumped up, floating unstable magical runes gently followed the Kun Peng's swaying back and forth. The galaxy rotated and brought the spectators to another universe. Each transformation of the Kun Peng was profoundly abstruse, with even the elders not being able to understand them![1] Idiom meaning absolutely true from many points of view.[2] Demon's Spawn has two possible meanings. It is either used to describe an incredible genius or an extremely evil/terrible person \u2013 I took the liberty to use spawn here because it makes more sense than \u201cDemon's son\u201d.[3] A load of crap here was actually \u201csilent dog's fart\u201d \u2013 interesting phrase\u2026[4] Lost money and only got illness \u2013 basically betting money but you lose both your money and something on top. Basically scheme going really wrong.[5] Killing without seeing blood: a praise for a calculating strategist; not having to take physical action.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he was practicing it, it was the previous sect master that personally granted permission with the agreement of the other Grand Elders.Besides First Elder Gu Tieshou's complete version, Elder Zhou also practiced the first three transformations of the Kun Peng's Six Variants.That year, Elder Zhou risked his life and achieved a great contribution for the sect, and, with the unanimous agreement from the elders and protectors, he was allowed to practice the first three transformations.To the current sect, the Kun Peng's Six Variants was an integral secret; even the elders couldn't approach the method without the agreement of the upper echelon of the sect.It was stored in the most safeguarded and secretive location in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. The location was unknown to all with the exception of the six elders.After seeing this merit law in action, First Elder Gu Tieshou's countenance was shaken. He practiced a complete version, so he had a higher understanding regarding it than anyone else. Seeing the Kun Peng floating up and down above Li Qiye's head, his heart was incomparably stirred; Li Qiye's Kun Peng was even more profound than his. This meant that regarding this method, Li Qiye had traveled farther than he had; this matter was inconceivable.The Kun Peng's Six Variants was one of the strongest Emperor merit laws in the sect; it was extremely profound. He immersed himself for hundreds of years in this method before learning the six transformations. He wouldn't dare to say that he truly grasped the real mysteries of this method! However, this novice disciple was well-versed in its mysteries.\u201cHow did you cultivate the Kun Peng's Six Variants?\u201d Gu Tieshou kept staring at Li Qiye. At this moment, his eyes were extremely frightening with even a hint of killing intent being revealed.Before, Gu Tieshou's intention was to protect Li Qiye no matter what. Currently, if Li Qiye's Kun Peng's Six Variants was stolen from the sect, then he would have engaged in a taboo of the sect. Without any decisions from the other elders and protectors, he would still eliminate Li Qiye!To Gu Tieshou, if he secretly practiced any other methods, there was room for discussion. However, the Kun Peng's Six Variants was too crucial to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201cStealing the core Emperor merit law, kill him without mercy\u2026\u201d Cao Xiong was secretly ecstatic from seeing the change of the tides, and he said to Elder Gu: \u201cOlder Brother, this person cannot be left alone. Even one second longer, and he'll bring more danger to our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!\u201dGu Tieshou ignored Cao Xiong, and directly asked Li Qiye: \u201cQiye, how did you practice this method?\u201dLi Qiye opened with a smile, and he carefully spoke: \u201cElder is calling this method the Kun Peng's Six Variants?\u201dCao Xiong continued to add wind to the fire by saying: \u201cStill playing the fool. Older Brother, we should first capture him and then torture him after!\u201dGu Tieshou suddenly snapped towards Cao Xiong and said: \u201cShut your mouth!\u201dAt this moment, Gu Tieshou's entire body was akin to a fierce lion with frightening pressure; his heavenly aura burned. As the first brother, there was a line of respect that couldn't be overstepped.Gu Tieshou's sudden outburst caused Cao Xiong, the other elders, and the protectors to feel that his presence could not be provoked!At this moment, Gu Tieshou thunderously roared: \u201cQiye, speak, how did you cultivate the Kun Peng's Six Variants?\u201d This was the first time Gu Tieshou had become angry. He was frighteningly serious.Li Qiye slowly spoke: \u201cThis matter began with the Kun Peng's Minor Six Forms.\u201dRegarding the heavenly aura of Gu Tieshou, he was not afraid. He paused for a moment, and then he continued: \u201cThat day when elder agreed to let me practice the Kun Peng's Minor Six Forms after my selection of the manuals, I immediately researched this method. During my meditation, I inadvertently fell asleep\u2026 At that moment, I experienced a strange dream. I dreamt of an old grandpa; this old grandpa told me our destinies were fated together, so he taught me a merit law close to the Kun Peng's Minor Six Forms. I didn't know the name of this merit law. Just now, since the elder had told me, I have finally learned its name\u2026\u201dLi Qiye continuously spoke as if it was the truth; he made the elders and protectors, that were currently present, feel as if his story was too outrageous.Cao Xiong yelled: \u201cNonsense, there is no such ridiculous thing in this world! This story of Dao instruction in your dream could only fool a three-year-old child!\u201dGu Tieshou didn't pay attention to Cao Xiong; he was still staring at Li Qiye. He then gravely said: \u201cWhat did this old grandpa look like?\u201d\u201cWell, it was in my dream; I can't remember it very well.\u201d Li Qiye tilted his head, pretended to ponder for a while, and then he finally described the image of Immortal Emperor Min Ren.In this world, no one was more clear than him on what Immortal Emperor Min Ren looked like in his old age. He said a few lines, and this was enough to have Min Ren sketched out.Li Qiye's description shocked the group of elders . There was a statue of Min Ren at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, but this was made from the hands of others; it did not contain his godly presence.However, the sect had secretly hidden a portrait of Immortal Emperor Min Ren. This portrait was personally painted by Min Ren. It was not just a simple painting as it carried the emperor's power and the immortal spirit of Immortal Emperor Min Ren. It was the bulwark treasure of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; when this portrait was respectfully summoned, it could expel powerful enemies.This portrait could not be used carelessly. If activated often, then its power would greatly decrease; the emperor's power and immortal spirit would gradually disappear. Thus, unless it was a sect-destroying calamity, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect would not easily utilize it.The six elders had all seen this portrait. The emperor aura of the Patriarch had left them an unerasable impression. Currently, with Li Qiye's few lines, they immediately realized that he described the heavenly aura of the Patriarch. Unless one had seen this portrait, they couldn't possibly describe the heavenly aura of the Patriarch like this.Hearing Li Qiye's vivid details of the heavenly aura of Immortal Min Ren like this caused Gu Tieshou's group to be shaken; could it really be that the patriarch had appeared in his dream?In the end, the first elder issued this command: \u201cAll the other disciples take leave; protectors and elders stay behind. Without my command, no disciple can come closer.\u201dAfter the departure of the disciples, only the protectors and elders remained on the scene. The atmosphere of the yard intensified.At this moment, First Elder Gu Tieshou had quarantined this location; no one was allowed to come close.Finally, the first elder said with a deep tone: \u201cBring out your Kun Peng's Six Variants in your dream so that Elder Zhou and I can see it for a bit.\u201dAt this time, Cao Xiong was extremely discontented, so he said: \u201cFirst Brother, you wouldn't really believe this irrational matter, right?\u201dGu Tieshou stared at Cao Xiong as Cao Xiong gravely said: \u201cThis matter is definitely this animal secretly stealing the Kun Peng's Six Variants!\u201dGu Tieshou didn't back down: \u201cThe hidden location \u2014 aside from the six of us, who else knows it? If one wants to open that place, Brother Cao should know the entire process. Without our permission, how could others open it? It would take a Virtuous Paragon to personally come and use brute force to open it. Otherwise, who could take out the manual? Whether the manual is still there or not, we know the truth in our hearts!\u201dElder Sun also seriously spoke: \u201cThat is right; if that place was breached by others, our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect would already be in danger. Currently, we are fine without any losses; Brother Cao, do you really think that Li Qiye has the ability to steal the Kun Peng's Six Variants from that location? Unless you are implying that First Brother secretly taught Li Qiye this method!\u201dCao Xiong bitterly said: \u201cThis little brother doesn't dare to say that!\u201dEven if he wanted to make this implication, it was still an impossibility. The other elders and protectors wouldn't believe in such an allusion.Eventually, Li Qiye silently wrote down the incantations of the Kun Peng's Six Variants. He also added his own profound knowledge.This copy of the merit law, only First Elder and Elder Zhou were allowed to read it; with Zhou only being able to see the first three transformations. During their examinations, Gu Tieshou and Elder Zhou were both surprised to see that this was not only a complete merit law, but it was also encompassed by mysterious truths that were more profound than their previous understandings!To be able to understand to this level, not to mention just them, but even the Grand Elders from the past wouldn't be able to! To be able to understand to this level and have this accumulation of experience would be enough to reach the Virtuous Paragon rank!At this moment, both the first elder and Elder Zhou were frightened. Maybe it was true that the patriarch had reached out to Li Qiye in his dream? Otherwise, how would one explain this matter?The first elder and Elder Zhou didn't say a word, and so the elders and protectors could not infer the current situation.They glanced at each other; maybe this type of Dao instruction in one's dream was a real thing. However, this was so irrational and difficult to believe.Finally, Gu Tieshou asked Li Qiye: \u201cDid the old grandpa from the dream say anything else?\u201dLi Qiye seriously thought about it, and then he said: \u201cHah, that's right; old grandpa also said that I carry a great responsibility. In the future, the rise of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect will fall on my shoulders. Old grandpa also said that later on, if I wanted to learn even more profound merit laws, then I should use a similar merit law and call out for him. Then he might appear in my dream again\u2026\u201dCao Xiong loudly retorted: \u201cRidiculous and shameless! To say that you alone could revitalize the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect\u2026\u201dGu Tieshou interrupted Cao Xiong, and he told Li Qiye with a deep voice: \u201cContinue\u2026\u201dLi Qiye scratched his head a couple of times, and then seriously said: \u201cWhat those similar merit laws are, I do not know. Recently, I am upset that I am not able to seek out old grandpa.\u201dAt this moment, Elder Sun busily said: \u201cYou have to call them minor Emperor merit laws! You practiced the Kun Peng's Minor Six Forms, so old grandpa taught you the Kun Peng's Six Variants. If you practice the other minor Emperor merit laws, then maybe he will teach you other core Emperor merit laws.\u201dCao Xiong coldly yelled in response: \u201cThis matter is too ridiculous! Little Brother Sun, you trust such ridiculous statements? These statements could only fool a three-year-old boy! Hmph, this argument cannot be proven, so he can say whatever he wants.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If he could write a different core Emperor merit law down, then this is enough proof that his dreams contains Dao instruction.\u201dElder Qian also agreed and said: \u201cThis method is feasible.\u201d\u201cIf this works, then I'm afraid that what Li Qiye said was the truth.\u201d This narrative was simply absurd, the elders and protectors couldn't believe it! However, within this crazy narrative, there was a shining ray of hope for the elders and protectors of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect to grasp on to!Currently, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was declining, and all of the other big sects were watching closely. It was like they were a flock of fat sheep that were surrounded by a pack of wolves. To the elders and protectors, what they needed right now was a miracle; a miracle capable of reinvigorating the sect. If Patriarch Min Ren was watching from the heavens above, then maybe he would really appear in a disciple's dreams.So, Cao Xiong paused for a moment, and then he ultimately said with a deep tone: \u201cIf he is willing to prove it, then I would have no objections!\u201d\u201cAre you willing?\u201d Gu Tieshou stared at Li Qiye, and he asked in a serious manner. In reality, as the chief elder, he had experienced many winds and waves, he naturally knew that this matter was too irrational and too ridiculous; however, since he carried the burden of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, his heart yearned for such a miracle\u2026 A miracle where the Patriarch appeared in someone's dreams!\u201cElders, I stand upright without the fear of having a crooked shadow. No matter what the elder's test will be, I am fearless.\u201dLi Qiye's brave and confident rhetoric garnered favorable impressions from the rest of the elders and protectors.Afterward was the selection of the merit laws. The elders glanced at each other, and, in the end, Elder Qian said: \u201cI believe we should pick the Violet Cloud Merit Law; regarding this matter, only Brother Wu has the most insight.\u201dIt could be said that in the sect, Emperor merit laws were pathetically few in number. The only complete core Emperor merit law was the Kun Peng's Six Variants, and it was also the strongest law in the sect. Outside of this, there were two other extremely formidable core Emperor merit laws. However, they were incomplete. One of these two incomplete Emperor merit laws was the Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law.Even though this was the case, the elders did not dare to carelessly cultivate the two incomplete Emperor merit laws, because with one mistake, they would suffer Qi deviation \u2013 this was akin to throwing one's entire cultivation away. So, the elders chose a Virtuous Paragon merit law instead.Elder Wu's first cultivation method was the Violet Cloud Merit Law \u2013 this method was too crucial to him. In the past, he wanted to cultivate the incomplete Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law, so he heavily researched the minor Emperor merit law. However, in the end, he realized that the incomplete Emperor merit law was too powerful, and he wouldn't be able to cultivate it. He had no choice but to give up and cultivate a Virtuous Paragon method instead.In order to test Li Qiye, they had to pick one of the two incomplete Emperor merit laws because Elder Wu had such a deep understanding of the Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law. After the elder's deliberation, they unanimously decided to let Li Qiye cultivate the Violet Cloud Merit Law.After the decision, Li Qiye went back to his Lonely Peak. At this moment, the six elders themselves were protecting Lonely Peak in order to watch over Li Qiye. The elders and protectors took this matter very seriously!Cao Xiong was hell-bent on killing Li Qiye in order to avenge his two dead disciples. He wouldn't be able to sleep without obtaining this vengeance. However, he had no say in the current situation. More importantly, Cao Xiong also had a different plan, so this matter of vengeance had to take a back seat.The six elders agreed for Li Qiye to practice the Violet Cloud Merit Law, so during this process, Li Qiye was not allowed to leave Lonely Peak; he had to only focus on cultivation.The Violet Cloud Merit Law was only a corner of the Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law. This was also an Emperor merit law created by Min Ren, and even if its power was not as formidable compared to the Kun Peng's Six Variants, within the Emperor merit laws, it was still incomparably powerful.Li Qiye understood the original form of the Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law more than anyone else. That year, the moment they first created this merit law, Li Qiye \u2013 as the Dark Crow \u2013 brought along Min Ren to the most dangerous of forbidden grounds, and they saw \u2013 with their own eyes \u2013 ten suns floating up and down, reenacting a grand Dao. After this scene, Min Ren was able to create this merit law.During this entire process, Dark Crow Li Qiye gave Min Ren advice, and he helped him perfect this merit law several times over.During his deep slumber, the memories of this merit law were erased; however, from the meticulous research of the Violet Cloud Merit Law, his previously erased memories and the profound truths of this method once again appeared in Li Qiye's mind.Li Qiye instantly retrieved the memories of the Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law, but he was not in a rush to tell the elders. Days had passed, leaving the elders to become very anxious.Day after day, month after month. At this moment, needless to mention other people, even the elders' hearts were wavering.The elders craved for a miracle in their minds even though the matter was ridiculous; however, they truly hoped that such a matter would happen, that the sect would be watched over by the Patriarch.\u201cFrom my perspective, this animal was fooling all of us!\u201d Cao Xiong coldly spoke, adding wind to the fire.Regarding Cao Xiong's instigation, Elder Wu fought back: \u201cBrother Cao, you appear to be too eager. This is not the last step, so how could you arbitrarily decide? It seems like Brother Cao needs to bring Li Qiye to his death just to be at ease.\u201dCao Xiong, with a grim countenance, gravely spoke: \u201cLittle Brother Wu, what do you mean by that? I am only committed to the protection of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect\u2026\u201dFirst Elder Gu Tieshou interjected: \u201cOkay, stop quarrelling. It doesn't hurt to wait!\u201dFinally, after three months had passed, Li Qiye came out from his small courtyard, excitedly saying: \u201cGot it, got it, got it\u2026\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d After hearing these words, all of the elders at this time had forgotten about their statuses, and they immediately rushed in! Even Cao Xiong couldn't suppress this urge.Li Qiye wrote the method down really well, and he handed it to First Elder. He then said: \u201cElder, this is the method the old grandpa in my dream was teaching me. Is this the Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law that you were talking about?\u201dFirst Elder excitedly accepted the method. In reality, the other elders were ecstatic as well, including Cao Xiong. However, he was excited for a different reason.Eventually, the six elders personally took the method written by Li Qiye, and they carefully matched it with the incomplete merit law in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201cTruth! He spoke the truth! This is a completed copy of the Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law!\u201d After the verification, Elder Wu was too astonished. He had dreamt about cultivating this method, but it was without success. He couldn't believe that during his lifetime, there would be a chance to see the complete Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law!Finally, Elder Wu with a matchless emotional excitement said: \u201cThis is not only the complete merit law, but it also contains mysterious interpretations. I think, outside of the Patriarch's Dao instruction in his dream, I'm afraid that an ordinary disciple would have no chance of understanding this merit law to this level! Even a heavenly genius, given a complete merit law, wouldn't be able to find profound truths like these!\u201dAll of the elders were shocked; some were excited, and some were moved. This matter to them was just like a dream; this was so ridiculous and impossible!An elder couldn't help but exclaim: \u201cThe blue heavens have eyes, and they pitied our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect! Our Patriarch is watching over us from the heavens, and he didn't wish to see the destruction of our sect! He had shown up in spirit to save us!!\u201dAt this juncture, there was nothing in the world more reliable than the Dao instructions in Li Qiye's dreams!Cao Xiong's eyes were restlessly flashing. Within the elders, he was the one to distrust this ridiculous Dao instruction in one's dreams the most; however, what if there was a one in ten thousand chance that this was the truth? This caused Cao Xiong to ponder without break.Finally, the elders once again summoned Li Qiye. Seeing his calm expression as he sat in the seat, the elders had an unspeakable feeling in their hearts. Could it be that the Patriarch had truly chosen this disciple with a Mortal Physique, Mortal Life Wheel, and Mortal Fate Palace in front of their eyes? Otherwise, there would be no other explanation.The elders couldn't help but recall the Jade Spiral Merit Law; maybe Li Qiye didn't come up with it, but it was passed down to him by the Patriarch.Whether this was the truth or not, it was no longer important to the elders. This was because they had seen a miracle. Li Qiye would be the key to the revitalization of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!In the end, First Elder Gu Tieshou deeply said: \u201cAfter the elder's examination, we believe that you receiving Dao instruction in your dreams is the truth, so the Kun Peng's Six Variants can't be considered to be stolen by you. Also, the elders have decided that you will be allowed to practice the Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law.\u201dAfter living for one thousand years, this matter still felt like a dream to Gu Tieshou. However, when it had reached this stage, he couldn't not believe it. He hoped that this was the truth.Li Qiye playfully smiled, and he said: \u201cI heard from the elders that the current Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law from the sect was extremely incomplete. Today, I have brought forth a complete version. I wonder, could this be considered a grand contribution or not?\u201dLi Qiye suddenly wanting credits caught the elders unprepared, and they had to glance at each other.\u201cYou could say that it is a grand contribution.\u201d In the end, First Elder Gu Tieshou couldn't deny this. For the sect, to find a core Emperor merit law, it was indeed a heavenly frightening contribution.Li Qiye smilingly said: \u201cIf you say so, then I want to make a request.\u201dThe elders looked at each other, and the first elder nodded his head: \u201cWe will allow for you to make a request; as long as the sect is capable, we will satisfy your desire.\u201d\u201cMy request is very simple. I heard that Nan Huairen and Protector Mo cultivate the Violet Cloud Merit Law. Since I have a grand contribution to use up, my request is for the sect to agree for them to cultivate the Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law!\u201d[1] First line \u2013 a morally upright man with nothing to hide won't have a crooked/slanted shadow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, Cao Xiong immediately yelled: \u201cPresumptuous and abusive for personal gains! This matter, the sect will never allow!\u201dEmperor merit laws; these were exclusive for the elders. Even a protector wouldn't be able to practice a core Emperor merit law. Currently, a third generation disciple wanted to cultivate a core Emperor merit law\u2026 Cao Xiong was naturally discontent.Li Qiye glanced at him, and he slowly said: \u201cElder Cao, if you personally find and bring back a core Emperor merit law, not mentioning your disciples, even if your grand disciple wanted to practice this core Emperor merit law, I would still agree. Ah, I forgot, Elder Cao currently had lost your disciples, let alone a grand disciple.\u201dThese words of Li Qiye seemingly pierced Cao Xiong; his face immediately became dark and twisted. He stood up, and he screamed: \u201cLittle animal, do you want to die?!\u201dFirst Elder Gu Tieshou thunderously roared: \u201cLittle Brother Cao.\u201d\u201cQiye is only a little child; there is no need to stoop down to his level!\u201d In the past, Cao Xiong didn't think highly of Gu Tieshou in his mind. However, now he knew that the first elder was not only a Royal Noble, but he was an experienced one at that. Moreover, he was also cultivating the Kun Peng's Six Variants which Cao Xiong dreaded facing. He definitely was not a match for Gu Tieshou.Cao Xiong bitterly said: \u201cOlder Brother Gu, you are way too condoning of this animal! He sooner or later will be the calamity of our sect!\u201d\u201cChildren don't think before they speak; Brother Cao, you don't need to mind his words.\u201d At this moment, Gu Tieshou was clearly partial towards Li Qiye. Even the other four elders were on his side; this caused Cao Xiong's heart to be hateful.Regarding Li Qiye's request, after some deliberations by the elders, they agreed; thus, they told Li Qiye: \u201cSince you want to use your contribution to back this matter, after our debate, we have decided to grant your request. Protector Mo has been loyal and with us for so long, and his loyalty is without question; he will be allowed to cultivate the Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law. As for Nan Huairen, ah, he can also cultivate it, but not now. After a few years of trials; if there aren't any problems, he will be allowed to cultivate this method.\u201dNo one could surpass Elder Sun's current cheerful mood; Protector Mo was his disciple and Nan Huairen was his grand-disciple. Now that they have the qualification to practice the Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law, as their master, how could he not be happy?Cao Xiong's heart was full of hatred to the point of rage. Currently, he almost became an isolated loner. His disciples Protector Hu and Leng Shizhi both died at the hands of Li Qiye, and he regretted not being able to cut Li Qiye into pieces. However, at this important moment, Li Qiye had contributed greatly, and he became an important person, one to be heavily nurtured; he was protected by the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, so it would be difficult for him to get revenge for his disciples.After hearing the message, Protector Mo and Nan Huairen were left without words. At this moment, they recalled that Li Qiye had said that within a year, they would be able to cultivate the Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law. They didn't think this matter would come so early, it felt like a dream.Currently, they felt that the day they chose to follow Li Qiye, it was the wisest decision they have made in their entire lives. At that moment, if other people knew about it, they would have laughed and called them crazy. A protector following a third generation disciple, a mortal one on top of that.Currently, through their efforts, they were reaping the results. Li Qiye had always been generous to his loyal followers!After Nan Huairen had received the order, he and his master went to meet Li Qiye with their excitement at its peak: \u201cOlder Brother, how did you do it?\u201dLi Qiye opened with a smile and said: \u201cIt was only a small matter; it was not difficult.\u201dNan Huairen was completely ecstatic. An Emperor merit law! Ah!! And a core Emperor merit law at that!!! This would cause others to be reddened with greed. He asked: \u201cOlder Brother, you, how did you find an Emperor merit law? Was it really the Patriarch in your dreams?\u201dThe Dao instruction within a dream was sealed off by the upper echelon of the sect. Nan Huairen only knew because his grand master, Elder Sun, told him about it.Li Qiye smilingly asked: \u201cDoes lying to you do me any good?\u201d\u201cI can't repay all the favors you have done for me. As long as you command it, I will do anything you want without batting an eyelid.\u201dLi Qiye glared at him and replied: \u201cSucking up once again?! Humph! If you weren't loyal to me, would I be rewarding you with an Emperor merit law?\u201dBeing yelled at by Li Qiye, Nan Huairen didn't mind, and he only laughed. As for Protector Mo, he was the type of person that was without many words, and he was not good in social politeness. He only turned towards Li Qiye and deeply bowed without saying another word.Li Shuangyan, who was considered a maid of Li Qiye, simply maintained the cool eye of a bystander. Even till today, outside of silence, she was still silent. No matter what had happened recently, she was just watching as a spectator.Li Qiye didn't show amazing talents or an amazing aptitude for cultivation, but instead heaven rebelling tricks and schemes.He suddenly became the most important resource of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect while being calm in any situation in order to reverse it. He killed five people, and he even got out of that unscathed; he also easily crushed Cao Xiong's plot and dispelled all dangers. He made it seem like it was as easy as turning one's hand, but in reality, it required an amazing foresight.These experienced and resolute actions, as well as the smooth flow of procedures; this was only a thirteen-year-old boy? Everything this little boy did was impossible to imagine. Every step was without childish temperament; they were all like the flowing of the rivers and the drifting of the clouds. He was like a meticulous antelope, defending itself at night; he essentially did not resemble a little boy, but a wise master that was knowing of all things.What shocked Li Shuangyan's heart was that before coming to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, she thought her master, Demon King Lun Ri, valued Li Qiye because of his knowledge regarding a few secrets; however, now it seemed like this was definitely not the case.Li Shuangyan thought of the proverb: on the road of cultivation, the most important things were not necessarily Physiques, Life Wheels, or Fate Palaces. This proverb was validated by Li Qiye.Li Shuangyan remained taciturn \u2013 without words. The longer she was by Li Qiye's side, the more she felt how unfathomable Li Qiye was.She was a genius and the heaven's proud daughter. She was prideful of her talents and aptitude. However, seeing Li Qiye's Mortal Physique, Mortal Life Wheel, and Mortal Fate Palace, she couldn't help but remain silent! Even she wouldn't be able to have such means to control everything while maintaining a clear view of the circumstances. A chess piece moves forward and a chess piece moves back, bringing someone to their death; this was not perception or talents, it was a grand wisdom, accumulated throughout the years.On top of that, such accumulation of the many moons of the past appeared in a young boy, leaving the conceited Li Shuangyan feeling helpless.If Li Qiye was a natural born like her, with an Emperor Physique and a Saint Fate Palace, then where would he be now? She's afraid that he would have swept through the nine heavens and the ten earths already!Li Qiye's killing of the three sectional leaders, one protector, and the genius disciple, Leng Shizhi; this matter, no matter what sect, would still be as grand as the sky.In order to bring an end to this matter, the six elders of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect specially called for a meeting, and Li Qiye was specially allowed to attend.Without a doubt, in the minds of the elders, Li Qiye was of the utmost importance. Outside of Cao Xiong, the other elders all considered that Li Qiye would be the key for the revitalization of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!\u201cThis matter is only a big misunderstanding.\u201d In the end, First Elder Gu Tieshou came to this conclusion. In reality, when this conclusion was achieved, the other elders had discussed secretly without the presence of Cao Xiong.Before, the other four elders had doubts because of the first elder's depression; they were disappointed, and their confidence wavered. However, after this experience, the other four elder once again became a group that completely supported the first elder. Not only this, but this matter had caused the four elders to greatly suspect Cao Xiong. In this matter, Cao Xiong and Dong Shenglong were too close to each other; this caused discomfort in the other elder's hearts.The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the Heavenly God Sect were mortal enemies. The two sects hadn't battled each other since the last war; however, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect still considered the Heavenly God Sect to be its biggest enemy!Cao Xiong and Dong Shenglong together brought on the dislikes of the other elders.It was just a misunderstanding; however, if we end it there, I'm afraid the other disciples would not be convinced. Three sectional leaders, one protector, and one genius in the sect died tragically; this was a heavy loss to our sect!At this moment, Cao Xiong's heart was bleeding blood, but he couldn't do anything else. He had lost everything from this matter, and he had burnt himself down. He also knew the other four elders had defected!Gu Tieshou discontentedly asked: \u201cWhat else does Brother Cao still want?\u201dIn reality, this entire situation, all of the elders and even the protectors suspected it was all part of Cao Xiong's plan, but unfortunately, the dead cannot testify; they had no way to accuse Cao Xiong, and they could only say that it was just a misunderstanding.Cao Xiong gravely said: \u201cSect members killing each other, this is an unpleasant event for the sect. If Li Qiye doesn't suffer a little bit of punishment, I'm afraid the disciples will be upset and think that we deal with matters carelessly; that we view human life as grass! If this is a misunderstanding, then we won't harshly punish Li Qiye, but a lenient punishment cannot be avoided. Otherwise, we can't convince the juniors.\u201dCao Xiong's words caused the other five elders to glance at each other. Even though they suspected Cao Xiong, they do admit that his words have some sense. They also had similar thoughts; using a misunderstanding as an excuse to kill three sectional leaders, a protector, and a genius disciple felt like a prevarication.Gu Tieshou's group all thought about giving Li Qiye a little punishment of no significance in order to have something to show the junior sect members.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We should sentence him to the Ghost Pavilion to meditate, facing a wall for half a year for being reckless and handling affairs impulsively!\u201dHearing Cao Xiong's words, Elder Sun grimaced, and he said: \u201cGhost Pavilion?\u201dCao Xiong went on: \u201cEven though the Ghost Pavilion appears to be sinister, but it is without danger. First Brother had experienced it himself, so I don't need to say more. If we make him wall meditate in a different location, I'm afraid the other disciples will laugh at us for being too easy on him! Personally, I feel that the Ghost Pavilion is the most appropriate.\u201dAt this point, Cao Xiong looked at Li Qiye, and he said: \u201cPlus, Li Qiye is protected by the Patriarch. Him going to the Ghost Pavilion is extremely fitting. The Ghost Pavilion was the area where the Patriarch suppressed evil ghosts and foreign Dao; this is just in time to borrow the Patriarch's heavenly aura again to suppress the Ghost Pavilion!\u201dWithin the elders, Elder Sun was the most supportive of Li Qiye. He said while he frowned: \u201cThis\u2026 This matter is not fine.\u201dDuring the moment when Gu Tieshou was still hesitating, Li Qiye glanced at Cao Xiong, smiled, and he calmly said: \u201cSince I have the Patriarch's blessing, then what is there to be afraid of? Ghost Pavilion? So be it; this disciple is willing to accept this punishment!\u201dStaring at Li Qiye for a moment, Gu Tieshou nodded his head in the end, and he said: \u201cFine, since you are willing, then it will be the Ghost Pavilion. We'll sentence you to wall meditation in the Ghost Pavilion for half a year; Protector Mo will be the overseer!\u201dGu Tieshou's arrangement was simply excellent. Instead of saying that Protector Mo would be supervising Li Qiye, it is more accurate to say that Protector Mo would be protecting him.After the verdict, Gu Tieshou said in a serious manner: \u201cLi Qiye's actions are reckless and completely deserving of punishment. Sectional Leader Zhou instigating the whole event, also needs to be punished. Without the ignorance and foolishness of Zhou, the group of Protector Hu wouldn't have died in vain! So, take away his position, and he will no longer be assigned to any duties in the sect.\u201dHearing this decision, Cao Xiong's heart was bleeding blood. He had lost two disciples and three loyal sectional leaders. Currently at his side were a few loyal hounds that were willing to do his bidding. The removal of Zhou's sectional leader seat was a big loss to him. However, at this moment, he had no choice but to acquiesce; if one couldn't bear the small matters, then it would ruin the grand scheme.\u201cSectional Leader Zhou is ignorant and foolish, I also agree with big brother's decision.\u201d Cao Xiong gritted his teeth, and he accepted Gu Tieshou's decision.Even Cao Xiong had already accepted, so the other elders didn't need to say anything. The decision became unanimously agreed upon.The decision of the elders was quickly announced to all. In a flash, each and all of the disciples of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had heard news of this. Many couldn't help but be without words because this matter was incredible.At the moment when Li Qiye had joined the sect, there were countless disciples that laughed at him with disdain. Now, Li Qiye had killed three sectional leaders, one protector, and even Leng Shizhi, who was considered the number one genius disciple of the sect. This was an unspeakable matter.What was even more frightening was that even though Li Qiye committed such a huge crime, the punishment was very light. This changed the expressions of many disciples and sectional leaders. At this moment, they were able to feel a different atmosphere.As for the elite disciples of the sect, they were warned by their masters and protectors to not openly discuss this matter. Regarding the Dao instruction in Li Qiye's dreams, this was a secret with a gag order from the elders. Outside of the elders and protectors, others didn't have the right to ask or know about this matter!Regarding this matter, in reality, the five elders had secretly discussed this. This was a decision made after the matter of Li Qiye's punishment; Cao Xiong was excluded.This was not a formal meeting, but it was privately discussed. Before the meeting, all five of the elders secretly sneaked out.At that moment, Elder Sun made a suggestion: \u201cWe should let Li Qiye practice the Daylight Sky Merit Law!\u201dElder Qian also nodded his head in agreement: \u201cThis we can do. The Patriarch protects Li Qiye, and he teaches him the Dao in his dreams. If we let him practices the Daylight Sky Merit Law, maybe we could obtain our Heaven's Will Secret Law again!\u201dWhen Immortal Emperor Min Ren carried the Heaven's Will, he was able to create a Heaven's Will Secret Law; it was one of a kind. A Heaven's Will Secret Law was the highest achievement in the life of an Immortal Emperor, and its power greatly exceeded the other Emperor merit laws. Heaven's Will Secret law, one could say that it carries the Heaven's Will godly aura!Immortal Emperor Min Ren had left behind his secret law to the sect; unfortunately, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect lost this invincible secret law later on.Currently, Li Qiye could be taught by the Patriarch in his dream, so all of the elders were hoping that they could find the Heaven's Will Secret Law through Li Qiye. If they could regain this secret law, to the declining sect, it would be \u2013 without a doubt \u2013 a heart-saving medicine!Elder Sun couldn't help but exclaim: \u201cI feel, that Li Qiye is currently the treasure of all treasures within our sect. We should let him learn anything that has to do with Emperor merit laws. With the Dao instruction in his dreams, we could regain all the Emperor merit laws that we have lost!\u201d\u201cIt is entirely true that we should let Li Qiye practice the Daylight Sky Merit Law; maybe it is the truth, that we could regain our secret law.\u201dFirst Elder Gu Tieshou nodded his head, and he carefully said: \u201cHowever, we cannot be too impatient and emotional. The proverbs say: we shouldn't bite off more than we can chew. If we ask for Li Qiye to practice the Daylight Sky Merit Law, there is a chance that he wouldn't be able to understand it. Without this understanding, he wouldn't be able to call for the Patriarch, so we should first let Li Qiye finish practicing the Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law. When he stabilizes this merit law, then we can let him practice the Daylight Sky Merit Law.\u201dIn reality, Gu Tieshou didn't know that Li Qiye didn't practice the Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law. He had already practiced the Kun Peng's Six Variants along with the Revolving Crescent Sun Merit Law, so he didn't need to practice the Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law.Elder Sun felt that statement was logical, so he replied: \u201cFirst Brother makes a lot of sense. Li Qiye is the ultimate treasure of our sect; we have to slowly dig it out. If we are too hasty, then what if he suffers from Qi deviation? Isn't this the same as destroying our future?\u201dAfter the secret deliberation, there was finally a decision. They prepared for Li Qiye to practice any methods that had something to do with Emperor merit laws of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.In a main peak of the sect, Cao Xiong was secretly meeting with Dong Shenglong. In the grand hall, there were only the two of them. The only difference was, Cao Xiong was no longer as calm as he was last time.Cao Xiong impatiently said in a cold manner: \u201cBrother Dong, the plan has been implemented. At this moment, mistakes definitely cannot appear.\u201dHis last plan suffered great losses. He lost two disciples and three sectional leaders, so he wished to cut Li Qiye into countless pieces.\u201cBrother Cao, you can rest assured about this matter. From now on, you and I are in the same boat. From now on, there will definitely be zero errors. Within three days, Lie Zhan Hou will be here. I had turned towards His Royal Highness for commands. At that moment, the situation will be very favorable for Brother Cao.\u201d Dong Shenglong smilingly said with his expression saying that victory was already at hand.Having heard this, Cao Xiong couldn't help but become shaken. Lie Zhan Hou \u2013 this was a great general of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, and he was bestowed this title by the Mortal King of the Kingdom himself!Dong Shenglong cheerfully smiled: \u201cBrother Cao, if the emperor sends down a command, this is a good opportunity for you to climb to the sect master's position of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; you must grab on to this chance.\u201dCao Xiong inevitably fell silent. Becoming the sect master was always his ambition; however, before this incident, he didn't want to use these types of schemes to become the sect master. Now, he had no other choice. His hope that was placed in Leng Shizhi was destroyed by the hands of Li Qiye! To him, this was a grave blow, and it also broke his aspirations.Cao Xiong asked with a deep tone that was filled with worry: \u201cBrother Dong, can you confirm that after the successful matter, Lie Zhan Hou will leave and the Mortal King won't offend my Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect?\u201dDong Shenglong smiled and replied: \u201cRegarding this matter, Brother Cao can rest assured. Brother Cao, think about it for a little bit. With the power of the Heavenly God Sect and the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom today, wanting to destroy your Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect is an easy matter, don't you think? However, His Majesty is kind, and he never wanted to take action; what does this imply? What His Majesty wants is only the Heaven's Will Secret Law; as long as you could obtain this secret law, the other matters are not a problem.\u201dCao Xiong gravely replied: \u201cBrother Dong, don't worry; obtaining the Heaven's Will Secret Law, I will take care of it.\u201dHe didn't want to sell the Heaven's Will Secret Law of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. He had thought about this many times. Once he gained control of the situation, even if Lie Zhan Hou wouldn't withdraw his troops, he wouldn't be afraid because he has the portrait of the Patriarch in his hand!As for Li Qiye\u2026 Hmph! A frightening killing intent flashed from Cao Xiong's eyes.Dong Shenglong naturally couldn't read Cao Xiong's thoughts, and he also didn't know the matter of the Patriarch's portrait. However, since he had the backing of the Heavenly God Sect and the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, he was not afraid. Even if Cao Xiong could somehow flip over the torrential ocean waves, in front of a gigantic monster like the Heavenly God Sect, it wouldn't be enough to reach the apex.On the other side, Nan Huairen had heard the news, and he was shocked.Nan Huairen, with an ugly expression, loudly asked Li Qiye: \u201cBrother, you really have to go to the Ghost Pavilion to meditate for half a year?\u201d\u201cCould this be fake?\u201d Li Qiye cheerfully smiled, and he said: \u201cThe elders had all decided, what else can I do?\u201dSeeing Li Qiye's relaxed appearance, Nan Huairen couldn't help but say: \u201cBrother, do you know what type of place the Ghost Pavilion is?\u201dLi Qiye replied in a relaxed manner: \u201cDidn't you talk about it before? It was previously the Zither Pavilion.\u201dNan Huairen couldn't bear it anymore, jumped up, and then he said: \u201cThat was a long long time ago. In the past, it was called the Zither Pavilion, but a few ten thousand years ago, its name was changed; people called it the Ghost Pavilion! A coward would be scared shitless entering this place. Currently, not to mention this Ghost Pavilion, even the peak over there, no one dared to venture near it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Without ghosts, how could it be called the Ghost Pavilion?\u201d Li Qiye laughed.Seeing Li Qiye without any anxiety, Nan Huairen jumped anxiously and busily said: \u201cBrother, I'm not joking with you. There are really ghosts at that place! There are really ghosts there! If you don't believe me, you can go ask my master!\u201dProtector Mo was also present. Hearing Nan Huairen, he pondered for a moment, and then he said: \u201cThe Ghost Pavilion is indeed ominous. It is better to be careful even though I've never heard of anyone dying in the Ghost Pavilion. I did hear that the first elder was unbearably hurt, suffering many losses in there. Whether there are ghosts or not, a conclusion cannot be drawn, but there are definitely some ominous things at that place.\u201d\u201cGhosts, eh.\u201d Li Qiye gazed towards the far direction, farther than far, and he finally smiled cheerfully. He said: \u201cIf there are actual ghosts, I would like it even more; why is there the need to be afraid of ghosts?\u201dAt this moment, he couldn't help but smirk and burst out laughing.Nan Huairen, regarding his first brother's \u201cheavy taste\u201d, became silent. Regarding these ominous ghosts, others just wanted to escape; however, his first brother said that he liked them.Nan Huairen was really concerned about Li Qiye, and he still wanted to persuade him; however, his master, Protector Mo, gently shook his head, so he became silent instead.Protector Mo didn't try to convince Li Qiye. From his perspective, Li Qiye already had his own ideas. He trusted that Li Qiye's actions didn't warrant their worries.In the end, Li Qiye smiled and said to Nan Huairen: \u201cLet us go! It's time to see the Ghost Pavilion!\u201dNan Huairen had no other options, and he had to resign to his fate. He followed Li Qiye to see the Ghost Pavilion, but along the way, he was muttering: \u201cBrother, if you meet a ghost, do not say I didn't warn you; there are real ghosts there.\u201dWith Nan Huairen's continuous verbose speech like a married housewife, Li Qiye could only smile.In reality, the matter of Li Qiye heading to meditate at the Ghost Pavilion, the disciples at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had all heard. The moment the Ghost Pavilion was brought up, the disciples all shivered in fear.A deadly pale disciple said: \u201cStaying half a year at the Ghost Pavilion? I wouldn't do it, not even for a day. I would rather stay in a punishing frozen cave than the Ghost Pavilion!\u201dAnother disciple shook his head and said: \u201cDon't even mention the frozen cave, I would rather go to the Dark Dried Valley than the Ghost Pavilion.\u201dOther disciples started to speak: \u201cRegarding the Ghost Pavilion, even Uncle Da Dan was afraid of it.\u201dThe disciple continued: \u201cUncle Da Dan could be considered the most courageous person in our sect. Five years ago, he didn't believe in the evil occult, so he made a bet with us to go into the Ghost Pavilion. The second day, the sun had not risen, and he escaped and even pissed his pants in terror.\u201d\u201cLittle bastard, revealing my shortcomings; do you want to be beaten?\u201d A middle-aged man, who was standing to the side, glared at him and yelled. This middle-aged man was incomparably rough looking; it was clear that this person was the uncouth fellow, Da Dan.Even though this disciple was glared at, there were other disciples that curiously asked: \u201cUncle, what happened at that time? What happened that night?\u201dThis uncle, questioned by the disciples, gave in; he contemplated for a moment, shook his head, and then he said: \u201cThe Ghost Pavilion has ghosts, frightening ghosts; maybe not just one, but many many ghosts.\u201dA disciple curiously asked: \u201cLi Qiye going to meditate in the Ghost Pavilion; how long do you guys think he can last?Someone was feeling like gambling: \u201cI'm willing to bet that he won't make it through one night.\u201dAnother disciple coldly scowled and said: \u201cA whole night, hmph! From my perspective, I'm afraid that once night falls, he would have peed in his pants. The Ghost Pavilion is not only notorious in name; there are definitely ghosts at that place!\u201dAt the moment, many disciples of the sect were gossipping. All of them said that there were ghosts there, but what type of ghosts, no one knew.In fact, regarding the Ghost Pavilion, even the protectors were afraid of it. First Elder went to the Ghost Pavilion once, and he tried to use his Emperor merit law to suppress the ominous aura of the Ghost Pavilion. No one could believe that on the second day, the tired first elder came out of the pavilion. He couldn't suppress the evil aura in the Ghost Pavilion.Since then, no protectors or disciples dared to not know their own strengths and venture into the Ghost Pavilion. Originally, the world's spirit energy of this peak was quite good, but because of the Ghost Pavilion rumors, no one was willing to come to this peak to cultivate.Currently, this peak was the scene of declination. The surrounding ten miles were declining as well. Even the flowers and trees were sickly looking; it was as if they were affected by the ominous aura of the pavilion.It was said that a few ten thousand years ago, the disciples of this peak formed their own branch. This peak used to be prosperous for generations. However, later on, it became haunted; this place started to decline until no disciples were willing to step into the place again.When Li Qiye was standing on top of the peak, basking in the view of the mountains and rivers in this area, he couldn't help but become solemn. This fading scenery was not only because no disciples were willing to go there, but one could faintly feel uneasy; it was like there was something below, exerting evil energy.In the last ten thousand years, all of the past disciples of the sect considered this place to be ominous; it seemed like this was not without reasons.Also standing next to Li Qiye, Nan Huairen felt a cold chill behind his back, as if a ghost was staring at him. It gave him sudden goosebumps; if Li Qiye wasn't with him, he would never be willing to go to this evil place.Regaining his wits, Li Qiye observed the big pavilion on the peak; the building named 'Ghost Pavilion' had begun to rot. Looking at the pavilion in front of his eyes, he couldn't help but to gently sigh.The Ghost Pavilion, in reality, was meticulously crafted with many interesting charms. It was built on top of a peak; it was as if it was part of nature, causing others to feel that it and the peak were integrated into one.From the decoration of the pavilion, it could be understood that the sect greatly valued it in the past. Unfortunately, because of the ominous aura, the sect had to forsake it.The Ghost Pavilion was not large in size, but it was very detailed; it could be praised as it was beautifully refined. However, the current pavilion was covered in dust and spider webs, as well as wild grass and weeds. Even the wild squirrels and birds considered this place their home.Entering the pavilion, stepping onto the floor made out of ten thousand year old Jade Pine caused a creaking sound. In the midst of the atmosphere inside, a coward would be scared shitless; especially since there were sounds of bats scurrying rampantly, increasing the evil atmosphere.Protector Mo nostalgically said: \u201cThis place used to be an important ground of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, but unfortunately, it is completely deserted and ruined now.\u201dIt was not just Protector Mo reminiscing, even Li Qiye's heart was sighing softly. That year, on the long winding road of the Dao, before Immortal Emperor Min Ren carried the Heaven's Will and his sweeping of the nine heavens and ten earths, inside this pavilion, Li Qiye used to teach the zither Dao to little Min Ren!Regarding this story, when he was still the Dark Crow, he used to tease Min Ren for his worthlessness at playing the zither. If he had to become a zither performer for his livelihood, Li Qiye was afraid that he would starve to death.Back in those days, Min Ren regarding Li Qiye's ridicule, he also couldn't do anything besides bursting into loud laughter.Without Li Qiye's command, Protector Mo and Nan Huairen busily cleaned the inside and outside of the Ghost Pavilion. After they were finished, the pavilion seemed a lot brighter, the dark atmosphere was partly swept away; however, even then, the pavilion still felt quite sinister.After preparing all the daily essentials for Li Qiye, they reported back to Li Qiye.After seeing the preparations from the two, Li Qiye gently nodded his head; he finally said: \u201cThis is fine, however, I will sleep in the grand hall; there is no need to prepare a room especially for me. Also, Huairen, go bring me a zither.\u201d\u201cZither? What do you need a zither here for?\u201d Hearing Li Qiye's words, Nan Huairen was surprised. Normally, very few cultivators would elegantly play the harp and watch the moon.Li Qiye smilingly said: \u201cOver here used to be the Zither Pavilion with extremely beautiful sceneries. At night, to be able to enjoy the moon and play the zither, how wonderful is this matter?\u201d\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d Nan Huairen couldn't endure and gently whispered: \u201cBig Brother, this place is the Ghost Pavilion. At night, there will be ghostly matters\u2026 Yo-you, you are still in the mood to play the zither?\u201d\u201cSmelly brat, don't ruin my mood; hurry up and go!\u201d Li Qiye, a thirteen-year-old boy, called Nan Huairen a brat as if he was an old grandpa, but Nan Huairen cheerfully smiled and ran away.At the moment when the two, master and disciple, were arranging matters, Li Shuangyan also followed and especially observed this Ghost Pavilion. She carefully analyzed it, without letting go of a single detail.Li Shuangyan currently watched the four large pillars inside the grand hall, and she was in a daze. The four large pillars were made from ten thousand year old Jade Pine. After countless years of baptism, they were without any sign of deterioration. On top of that, each of these pillars was densely packed with veined patterns. Actually, not only the four pillars were covered with these patterns, the entire Zither Pavilion was covered in these patterns, but the pattern's colors were very faint. If one did not focus, it was essentially difficult to see.Li Shuangyan, a genius with a Saint Fate Palace and Emperor Physique \u2013 no matter where she went, she would be the heaven's proud daughter. As she watched these patterns, she immediately felt that they were extraordinary. A genius like her was meticulously analyzing, wanting to see through the mysterious truths inside. However, during her observation, she found that these patterns were not Dao runewords or magical incantations. She couldn't shake off the feeling that there was a mystery indescribable by words inside.\u201cDo you see anything special?\u201d Li Qiye went next to her. He revealed a comfortable smile to Li Shuangyan who was observing the patterns.[1] Da Dan means big courage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With his calm demeanor and casual expression, she understood that this little boy had already knew what this was.Li Shuangyan couldn't help but to ask: \u201cWhat is it?\u201dThe genius heaven's proud daughter, Li Shuangyan, had never underestimated herself; however, after such a long observation, she was not able to clearly understand the mysteries of the patterns. Li Qiye already knew; this caused Li Shuangyan to feel a little helpless. Did this little boy in front of her really have a Mortal Physique, Mortal Life Wheel, and Mortal Face Palace?Li Qiye stared at the numerous densely packed patterns. At this moment, his eyes became particularly abstruse, and gently whispered: \u201cZither melodies.\u201dAt this moment, Li Shuangyan felt that the little boy in front of her had become an entirely different person; it was as if he was the victim of countless vicissitudes as if he was basked in countless moons.\u201cThe most regrettable thing in this world is lacking an intimate friend.\u201dIn the end, the little boy in front of her spoke out such a subtle and ineffable line.Li Shuangyan couldn't help but inquire: \u201cHow do you know these are zither melodies? What are the mysteries inside these lines?\u201dThe genius heaven's proud daughter was acting as if she was an eager student.\u201cAh, the mysteries inside are of an ancient story.\u201d Li Qiye smilingly said: \u201cAs for how I know, I calculated with my fingers.\u201dLi Shuangyan felt helpless once again. She couldn't see through this little boy. These zither melodies in front of her, she knew that her understanding would not be lesser than any other genius; however, this little boy, with just a glance, immediately knew what it was. This was too devilish! She couldn't help but wonder if the little boy in front of her was still human?Finally, Li Qiye told Protector Mo: \u201cAll of you should return, I want to be by myself to quietly contemplate.\u201dNan Huairen didn't have an opinion, and as the observer of Li Qiye for his wall facing meditation as well as his protector, Protector Mo had the responsibilities to look after him. He hesitated, and then he said: \u201cBut, you are not safe in this place.\u201d\u201cIf this place isn't safe, then other places are even more dangerous.\u201d Li Qiye bloomed a smile, and he arranged for Protector Mo: \u201cYour mission isn't to protect me; it is to watch over Cao Xiong carefully, understand?\u201dProtector Mo glanced at Li Qiye, and then finally nodded his head in agreement. Even though he was a man of few words, he was aware of the situation. At this moment, he immediately knew what to do with Li Qiye's command.\u201cYou also go back; here, I alone am enough.\u201d In the end, he also told Li Shuangyan to go back. In this place, he didn't need Li Shuangyan's protection. The truth was, with Li Shuangyan's presence, it wouldn't be convenient for him to catch the big fish.Everyone had left, and only Li Qiye remained. He didn't do anything except meditate in the grand hall with his eyes closed.Soon, the sun had set, and the moon had risen. The night curtain beckoned, and the entire peak was encompassed by a gloomy shadow. At this moment, the four directions were all silent. Outside of the peak, one could faintly hear the howls of the wolves.Under the night sky, the mountains and trees, along with the vines, seemingly became ferocious. There was a transformation in this place. It was as if an evil aura was coming from the ground, as if something ominous wanted to rise from the earth.\u201cWhoooooshh\u2026\u201d At this moment, inside the Ghost Pavilion was a howling fierce wind. In but a moment, a black fog appeared inside; it was as if this place was wanting to become hell.\u201cHahahahaa\u2026\u201d Suddenly, waves of sinister laughter came from inside the pavilion as if an evil ghost was hiding in the shadows, staring at Li Qiye.Li Qiye, who was sitting in the meditation pose, suddenly opened his eyes. He calmly smiled, and he gracefully said: \u201cI don't want to personally take action. I only want to ask one thing, where is that zither?\u201dAt this moment, Li Qiye was carrying the zither given to him by Nan Huairen, and his five fingers were hovering over the strings.\u201cHahahaha\u2026.\u201d The reply to Li Qiye's question was even more sinister laughters. Afterward, the sounds of ghostly bones creaking filled the air.At this time, Li Qiye focused his eyes and observed. The Ghost Pavilion was no longer here, and he was in an empty unknown wilderness. Looking as far as the eyes can see, it was an endless wasteland.The more frightening matter was that below the ground, there were waves of skeletons crawling up. These skeletons had been here for who knows how many years; they slowly stood up, carried broken swords, and they motioned towards Li Qiye. In the midst of things, Li Qiye was surrounded by the endless sea of skeletons.\u201cThis type of illusion, to me, is as simple as eating breakfast; it is without meaning.\u201d\u201cPhoosh\u2026\u201d At this time, a skeleton struck at Li Qiye with his blade. Li Qiye remained motionless, this blade pierced his body, and blood immediately sputtered; however, Li Qiye was still motionless, and he was still smiling.\u201cCreaking, creaking\u2026\u201d Wave after wave, the friction of the bones caused creepy sounds that would frighten others and cause their scalps to tingle; anyone else would immediately turn and run.At this moment, many skeletons had crawled up to Li Qiye. Some grabbed his hands and others his feet, they then lifted him up. They turned to the four directions, and they started to pull; seemingly, they wanted to dismember Li Qiye.Being dismembered by so many skeletons, wave after wave of extreme pain came; it was followed by the spurting of blood.\u201cPhoosh\u201d Next, the arms and legs were removed by the skeletons. His body became two halves, blood came flying out from his body, along with his innards. His head rolled really far away.For anyone else, they would have defended themselves earlier as well as destroy these skeletons, but Li Qiye was still calmly smiling as his head was rolling far away.As his skull was rolling on the ground, Li Qiye, who was still smiling, said: \u201cI only ask one question, where is that zither located? For the sake of an old friend, I won't make any moves. Once I take action, the consequences would be unimaginable.\u201dSuddenly, the scenery changed. There were no longer skeletons, and his body was without harm. Li Qiye was still sitting in the Ghost Pavilion like before.\u201cBoom\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Li Qiye's entire body felt like a floating immortal, with wings extruding from his back. At this moment, in the sky, a heavenly gate was opened. Li Qiye, without another option, walked inside the heavenly gate.Entering the heavenly gate, Li Qiye was immersed in the immortal sceneries. Within the immortal palace, he only saw immortal zithers flying, godly mountains floating up and down, brilliantly bright immortal palaces, heavenly weapons, godly treasures, countless materials\u2026 and godly stones that would cause countless cultivators to drool.One would lose their senses in this paradise. Wave after wave, heavenly sounds filled the air. Two groups of heavenly fairies, slim and graceful, started to dance gracefully. The two groups surrounded Li Qiye, and they began to dance.Each and all fairies were heavenly frightening beauties. Li Shuangyan could be considered a grand beauty, but to compare to this group of fairies, she would still lose her colors.What was even more stirring to the will of people was that the fairies were only wearing a thin silk veil, draped over their incomparable and beautiful naked bodies; sometimes hidden and sometimes showing. The two group of fairies started to alluringly dance faster; their dances were erotic and extraordinary, and they would cause others' blood to boil\u2026Under this dance, not mentioning the men, even women couldn't help but waver in their minds!\u201cWonderful Dancing Style\u2026\u201d Li Qiye remained unmoved just as before, and he said: \u201cSeems to be an old friend!\u201dThe dance became increasingly faster and increasingly tantalizing. Even immortals would be attracted by this erotic dance, but Li Qiye was just silently sitting back and admiring the scenery.Naturally, this illusion was useless against Li Qiye. Suddenly, the scenery changed again. Li Qiye was traveling in the desert, with the sun hovering over his head\u2026The illusions, one by one, kept on transforming. Each illusion was meant to attack the seven emotions and six desires of humans. Any cultivator, even if they could successfully pass one illusion, wouldn't be able to go through the second, the third, the fourth\u2026 As long as one was still human, they would naturally have seven emotions and six desires.Unfortunately, these illusions were facing Li Qiye. Li Qiye's willpower was unwavering; he floated throughout countless moons with endless ups and downs. What sufferings and transformations had he not experienced?After the illusions transformed into different illusions, Li Qiye lost his patience; he finally he opened his mouth: \u201cIt seems like you want me to make a move!\u201d\u201cZheng\u2026 Zheng\u2026 Zheng\u2026\u201d From the five fingers of Li Qiye, the sound of the zither started to play; the entire illusion suddenly collapsed into destruction.\u201cZheng\u2026 Zheng\u2026 Zheng\u2026\u201d Waves of zither melodies rang in the air. At this moment, the dense melody patterns inside the Ghost Pavilion started to ripple with Li Qiye's tune.Once the illusion disappeared, a huge monster head appeared inside the pavilion. This head was gigantic; one could only see that it had a bull's horn, bloody eyes, the body of a snake, and the wings of an eagle; it was dragging along a thick and long bloody tongue.Li Qiye stared at this monster and asked in a relaxed manner: \u201cWhere is your real body?\u201d\u201cRoar!\u201d The monster roared. Facing this roar, the five fingers of Li Qiye stroked down, and the sound of the zither immediately rang. The melody patterns inside the Ghost Pavilion became louder and stronger.\u201cBang\u201d An explosion occurred. Suddenly, there was a crack in the ground of the main hall; an ancient zither, along with melody patterns, suddenly rushed up.This ancient zither was extremely old with moving brilliance. It jumped up, and it suddenly fell into the hands of Li Qiye.\u201cRoar!\u201d Seeing the ancient zither falling into the hand of Li Qiye, the monster ferociously roared and rushed towards Li Qiye.Li Qiye's eyes concentrated, and he gravely said: \u201cBack\u2026\u201dHis five fingers started to pull at the strings of the ancient zither. Zhang\u2026 The zither melody was like a sword. In a flash, the melodic patterns in the entire Ghost Pavilion flashed brightly, becoming terrible sword energies.\u201cPhoosh\u201d, the sword energy struck down towards the gigantic monster. After being struck, it flew away to the far distance. The two bloody eyes of the monster stared at Li Qiye, seemingly afraid.[1] Intimate friend is made out of two words: \u201cComprehend\u201d and \u201cSound\u201d. The words have two meanings \u2013 one is someone who can understand your music, the other is your best friend.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sound was hard to hear and deafening to the ears, causing others to shiver: \u201cYou will never be able to kill me! No one can kill me!\u201d\u201cIs that so? Wait until I dig up the Yearning Lunar Peak beneath the bones of the dead; can you say no one could kill you then?!\u201d\u201cBang\u2026 Bang\u2026 Bang\u2026\u201d After hearing Li Qiye's words, the monster was frightened and retreated to the back.\u201cShow me your true body now; don't pretend to be Gods and Devils in front of me.\u201d Li Qiye sat in a meditative posture on the floor, staring at the monster. He gently wiped the dust off his ancient zither.\u201cZheng\u2026 Zheng\u2026 Zheng\u2026\u201d The zither started to play again. It was as smooth as the flow of water, it flowed inside the Ghost Pavilion. From the flow of the zither came the harmony of the melodic patterns, soft and smooth.Inside the zither tunes, it was as if others could see that inside the blue mountain over yonder was a small bridge to cross the river. Through that, there would be a courtyard filled with the chickens' crows in the morning; a small and tranquil village was appearing in front of their eyes.This unfathomable monster, hearing this tune, noisily backed away. At this point, the layers of fogs dissipated from its body. In the end, the gigantic monster ultimately disappeared, and a shadowy figure appeared. It was only a slim and graceful figure; it was only a shadow of her back, but it was enough to topple the spirit of all living things. Just the shadow of her back was enough to cause all living things to unconditionally turned their heads for another look. This was a beauty capable of causing the downfall of nations; this was a beauty with incomparable and absolute peerlessness.Who would have thought that a monster causing other people to be frightened would have such a peerless beauty as its true body?\u201cFlowing Water Mortal Home!\u201d The blurred shadow unfathomably stared at Li Qiye, and she murmured: \u201cYo-you\u2026 How did you know this melody?!\u201d\u201cXiao He, it really is you.\u201d Li Qiye stopped playing, and comfortably laughed while he stared at this peerless beauty's shadow.The peerless beauty, having heard Li Qiye's words, immediately became frightened, and she continuously stepped backward. She frighteningly asked: \u201cWh-who, who are you!?\u201dLi Qiye opened with a smile, and he said: \u201cThat year, under the wutong tree, digging out the bones for you; besides little brat Min Ren, you tell me who else was there?\u201d\u201cYo-you, you are Your Excellency Divine Crow?!\u201d The peerless shadow, astonished, asked with her eyes wide opened.\u201cWith the exception of that little brat Min Ren and I, who else would know what was under the wutong tree and Yearning Lunar Peak? Who else would know about the Flowing Water Mortal Home? This melody, 'Flowing Water Mortal Home', I was the one who taught it to that little brat Min Ren.\u201d\u201cIt truly is you! Your Excellency Divine Crow!\u201d This peerless shadow was extremely ecstatic; she quickly stepped forward, and she surprisingly said: \u201cYour Excellency Divine Crow, you are truly still alive.\u201dLi Qiye smiled and emotionally reminisced: \u201cI am eternal since the ancient past, this is nothing strange.\u201dThe peerless figure drew closer; her shadow was transparent and unclear, but from the shape, one could tell that she was a peerless beauty.Li Qiye finally looked at her, shook his head, and he said: \u201cYou have not dissipated. What sins did you commit to suffer like this? Turning yourself into something that isn't human nor ghost. You have to remember, that year I told you that you are not Su Yu He; you are not a ghost, but you are also not human. You are only a strand of yearning sentiments, not wanting to dissipate.\u201dThe peerless figure heard Li Qiye words, and she bowed her head in silence.\u201cI know.\u201d Li Qiye shook his head, and he continued: \u201cYou liked that little brat Min Ren, but you could not forget. Even that year, that little brat Min Ren couldn't recreate you. You are a dead person in the end; plus, your souls and spirits have dissipated along with any hateful sentiments. You are not a ghost, you are not a hateful sentiment, and you are especially not Su Yu He's soul, wandering in this world. In reality, you and Su Yu He no longer have any relations! You are just a yearning sentiment; a strand of yearning sentiment towards Min Ren, not willing to depart.\u201dThe peerless shadow's head remained in a bow; she didn't say another word.Li Qiye gravely said: \u201cLittle brat Min Ren's biggest flaw was being too gentle. That year, I had told him to use a melody to transcend your soul for it to find peace, but he couldn't do it!\u201dThe peerless shadow quietly whispered: \u201cYour Excellency, don't blame Immortal Emperor Min Ren. This was because I, I was not willing to transcend. I, I only wanted to leave behind, behind a strand of yearning sentiment!\u201dLi Qiye shook his head, and he said: \u201cLittle brat Min Ren is no longer here, do you feel like there is any meaning in leaving behind a strand of yearning sentiment? When little brat Min Ren was still in this world, he was too gentle and merciful; often, he came to play a melody for you! However, you know as well, this was not because of you. Little brat Min Ren passed away, so why do you still remain in this place?\u201dHearing Li Qiye's words, the shadow called Xiao He became sad, bowed her head really low, and finally she gently said: \u201cAfter he left, I hoped that one day I could be buried along with him under the peach tree, but it was impossible. I had no choice but to remain within this zither. Later, the zither sank into the ground by itself, and I fell into a deep slumber.\u201dSeeing this poor woman in front of him, Li Qiye gently sighed; in the end, he had to say: \u201cFine, after I accomplish everything, I will go to Yearning Lunar Peak and dig out your remains. I will bury you together under the peach tree, to fulfill your last wish.\u201dXiao He bowed to pay her respect, and she gratefully said: \u201cThank you, Your Excellency.\u201dSeeing her, Li Qiye could only sigh. There were no words to describe the feelings in his heart. He could only say, this was mother nature mocking humans.That year, he brought Immortal Emperor Min Ren onto the road of cultivation. He let Min Ren choose this place to establish the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect for a reason. During the Desolate Era, this place was a mysterious grand ground; many unexplainable things had happened here. In that era, countless races had examined this place.Straight to the Beginning Era, there was a different race with heavenly piercing talents that rose up in this place; they created an empire without equals. This race, at this place, had a tyrant, and the tyrant was ferocious, just like the rest of his kind. This caused the entire human race, in the Mortal World, to be massacred by him.Afterward, a Virtuous Paragon of the human race rose up and rebelled against this tyrant. This Virtuous Paragon was an unequaled creation, and he towered over the eight desolates; he was the opponent of the other tyrant.However, the tyrant used to explore the mysteries of this land. Each time, he and the Virtuous Paragon fought to the death; whenever he was in danger, he would borrow this mysterious land to defeat the Virtuous Paragon.The Virtuous Paragon was not discouraged; again and again, he raged war against this mysterious land. However, defeat after defeat, from being a young courageous man filled with energy to be a Mortal Emperor with white hair, in the end, this Virtuous Paragon became despaired. Unless he could carry the Heaven's Will, there was no way he could defeat this tyrant that was borrowing the strength of this mysterious land.However, he didn't have this chance; he had given up his opportunity to carry the Heaven's Will! Before the last war, he came up with a new method!This Virtuous Paragon had a daughter. His daughter, whether it was her talents or beauty, she was peerless beyond comparison; she was considered the number one beauty of that time! The Virtuous Paragon, wanting to figure out the mysterious land, had let his daughter marry this tyrant in the end.The tyrant also knew the intentions of his mortal enemy. He lusted for the number one beauty, so he brought her inside his empire.From then on, the number one beauty, that was admired by all, became the sole possession of the tyrant, and she became his toy. Fallen into his hands, the number one beauty accepted countless degradations and suffered from countless shameless acts, but in the end, she was able to obtain the secret of this land.The Virtuous Paragon, using the secret found by his daughter, was able to defeat the tyrant in one last battle, and he destroyed his brutal empire.However, the story didn't end there. Afterward, the Virtuous Paragon was not able to inherit the secret of this land. He forced his way up to the heavens, wanting to borrow the secret of this land to connect to the Heaven's Will, to carry the Heaven's Will, and to become the invincible number one in the Nine Worlds!However, after the number one beauty suffered humiliations in order to accomplish her task, she died in the dark night curtain from sadness. Her hateful sentiment didn't disappear; it lingered on top of this land.The moment when the Virtuous Paragon was trying to attack the Heaven's Will, the hateful sentiment was suddenly triggered; it went on a crazy rampage. Regarding his daughter, the Virtuous Paragon had always felt guilty. Due to his daughter dying from sadness, the Virtuous Paragon experienced an even greater blow, causing his Dao willpower to give birth to a will devil.During the crucial moment, the hateful sentiment of his daughter suddenly pierced the high heaven, and it went straight into the Heaven's Wrath, causing the devil will of the Virtuous Paragon to suddenly go crazy. In the end, he couldn't overcome the will devil's devouring, and he died under the power of the Heaven's Wrath.In the end, the human race kingdom, established by this Virtuous Paragon, in this place, turned into ruins!The daughter of this Virtuous Paragon, the number one beauty of that era, was Su Yu He!Countless years had passed; Li Qiye, as the Dark Crow, led Immortal Emperor Min Ren to this place to establish the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. At that time, this place was still in ruins. However, the hateful sentiments of Su Yu He still existed, and it often caused chaos due to her hatred; the hateful sentiments pierced the heaven, and they turned this place into a Ghost Domain.Later on, Immortal Emperor Min Ren, under the instruction of Li Qiye, had found the resting place of Su Yu He. He restored her corpse, and he buried her in a beautiful scenic area.Immortal Emperor Min Ren played matchless tunes for her hateful sentiment in order for it to transcend. After many times, in the end, her hateful sentiment finally dissipated, and she closed her eyes within the burial.However, after the hateful sentiments dissipated, the moment before closing her eyes and her traveling souls were still in this world, Su Yu He gave birth to a yearning sentiment towards Immortal Emperor Min Ren. Finally, she closed her eyes, and she rested in peace in an unknown location.However, this yearning sentiment followed the ancient zither back to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Afterward, when Li Qiye, as the Dark Crow, found out, she had already been staying in the sect.For such a matter, Li Qiye did not agree. Su Yu He had died with no chance of revival. Plus, this strand of yearning sentiment was not Su Yu He. This was not a person, not a ghost, and especially not an existence; this was merely a strand of yearning sentiment.A strand of yearning sentiment remaining in this world, this was only a torture to her. She didn't have a chance of becoming a living existence, so she didn't have a way of following Immortal Emperor Min Ren; she was but a yearning sentiment in a mist of nothingness.[1] Xiao means little, it is an affectionate way of calling someone.[2] Will devil = a flaw in one's Dao, might cause him to go berserk or lose emotions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, unfortunately, this strand of yearning sentiment was unwilling to go, and Immortal Emperor Min Ren was too merciful to forcefully send her away. This was why she had always remained in this place, alongside the ancient zither, without a way of departure!Recalling the past, even Li Qiye, who had experienced countless years, still couldn't help but to sentimentally sigh.Thinking up to here, Li Qiye looked at the peerless shadow and said: \u201cYou said that after the ancient zither sunk into the ground, you also went into a deep slumber; why are you now causing havoc? From my view, this is not a simple ghost matter. The world's spirit energy here has been contaminated. You are merely a yearning sentiment, so you don't have the power to have such a big influence; there must be a different reason.\u201dSu Yu He's yearning sentiment responded: \u201cAfter the ancient zither went into the ground, I also went into a deep slumber with it. I do not know how long I was asleep for. There was a commotion afterward; an evil energy pollution disturbed me, so I woke up. I was staying here, and I didn't want to be bothered; so I scared the disciples away from this place.\u201dLi Qiye's eyes became serious, and he asked: \u201cEvil energy invaded?\u201dThe peerless shadow couldn't help but say: \u201cYour Excellency, from my point of view, there is a chance that the mysterious ground under the earth is the cause.\u201dHearing these words, Li Qiye's expression greatly changed from his always calm demeanor and into a stern one. His eyes suddenly jumped, and he gravely stated: \u201cThere is zero chance! That year, I brought along the little brat Min Ren with the Old Chicken Head's group to kill until the heaven falls and the earth rends in order to forcefully seal it. With little brat Min Ren carrying the Heaven's Will under my order; he came inside one more time in order to use a matchless sealing technique in that place. The mysterious land definitely cannot escape the sealing of little brat Min Ren; this I have the utmost confidence in.\u201dThe peerless shadow frightenedly replied: \u201cI'm afraid that this is absolutely true; this evil energy is too familiar to me. This feeling, I know it all too well. After I had awoken, no matter the place, I always had this uneasy feeling; it was as if a small amount of evil energy was escaping from the ground.\u201dThe words of the peerless shadow caused Li Qiye's heart to plummet. Even though she was only a yearning sentiment of Su Yu He, this matter, to her, had too much influence. If she said so, then it definitely would not be wrong.He had confidence in Immortal Emperor Min Ren, plus this matter was related to the eternal inheritance of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; Min Ren must have been extremely cautious. With the unbeatable methods of Min Ren as an Immortal Emperor, Li Qiye had no reason to doubt him. As long as he suppressed and sealed this place, the evil energy had no chance of escaping the confinement of Min Ren.However, now there was a strange occurrence; what actually happened below the earth? Li Qiye's eyes focused, and after a while, he turned towards the peerless shadow, saying: \u201cIt seems like there are some things that I need to change my plans around. When it is time, I will open your grave. If it is really necessary, I will bury you under the peach tree first.\u201d\u201cThank you, Your Excellency.\u201d The peerless shadow gently bowed. She was only a strand of yearning sentiment, and she existed only to be a pair to the ancient zither. She still had some mysterious power, but she had no way of burying herself.Li Qiye gently stroked the ancient zither in his hands. This ancient zither, he was too familiar with it. The time when Min Ren had only started to practice the zither, he gave this ancient zither to Min Ren. Even though this zither was not an epic treasure, after experiencing Min Ren's touch throughout the years, especially after he had become an Immortal Emperor, its essence greatly changed.Li Qiye properly put the ancient zither away, and then carefully observed the densely packed melodic patterns inside the Ghost Pavilion.Seeing Li Qiye in a daze and looking at the patterns, she couldn't help but ask: \u201cYour Excellency, do want to borrow the melodic patterns?\u201dLi Qiye lightly shook his head, and he said: \u201cThe descendants of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect are all bags of straws. This mountain of treasure is in front of them, yet they are unable to recognize it. The melodic patterns in this Ghost Pavilion have absorbed a large amount of emperor's power and immortal intent; this heavenly aura is enough for the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect to survive through many difficult moons, yet these people are putting all of their gazes on Immortal Emperor Life Treasures and Emperor merit laws!\"The Zither Pavilion, even though this was not the resting place of Min Ren, but it was the place Min Ren had come to countless times to play the zither, especially after he became an Immortal Emperor.As an Immortal Emperor carrying the Heaven's Will, shouldering the universe, and exerting endless immortal pressure, any object that was touched by his heavenly aura would obtain amazing benefits. It can be imagined that after Min Ren had received the Heaven's Will, each of his heavenly melodies, with its godly aura, contained numerous profound truths.This Zither Pavilion was basked in the sound of Immortal Emperor Min Ren's melodies again and again. The melodic patterns not only contained the aura of Min Ren, but it also contained the hidden profound truths of the grand Dao.One could say, the densely packed melodic patterns in this pavilion contained a matchless Dao of zither melody. If one used these zither patterns to embark on the Dao, they could definitely achieve an incredible grand Dao cultivation.However, Li Qiye was not interested in the Dao of the zither. He only wanted to borrow the emperor's power and immortal intent hidden within these patterns. The ancient zither in his hand and the melodies played by Min Ren, he knew them like the back of his hand because he was the one that taught Min Ren. He could unleash a frightening power from this ancient zither using Min Ren's emperor's power and immortal intent.The moment when Li Qiye was being punished at the Ghost Pavilion, there was also a heavenly frightening event happening at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.This day, outside of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, there was a huge ancient ship flying towards them. This ship was extremely big, it was the length of ten miles. When it flew in the sky, it cast a frightening shadow on the ground.The ancient ship resembled a mobile fortress. It absorbed and spat out ancient brilliant lights. The body of the ship was engraved with magical runes and formations that were moving continuously, emancipating the power of the grand Dao. Without a doubt, this ship could not only fly in the sky, but it could also defend itself against cultivators' attacks.On this ancient ship, a crimson blood energy, along with an ancient Royal Noble aura, poured down freely without any intention of suppressing itself. The rolling power of the Royal Noble aura was felt by the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect disciples, even from afar.This type of arrival, it was not a friendly visit; it was a clear provocation against the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!The moment the ancient ship arrived at the outskirts of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, eight hundred soldiers from the ship simultaneously roared, it was as powerful as a rolling tsunami that encompassed the entire Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. It deafeningly shook the ears of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect disciples, and caused their blood energies to run amok!In a flash, the sound of bells ringing echoed throughout the entire sect, warning the disciples that enemies were approaching!However, even though the ancient ship arrived at the sect, it didn't start its attack. The giant ancient ship simply stopped beyond the boundary of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.In the midst of everything, both the top and bottom of the sect were alarmed. It was not only the sectional leaders and protectors; even the six elders were unable to sit still in their chairs.The moment First Elder left the main peak, he saw a flag on the ancient ship that was embroidered with the word \u201cWar\u201d, and he couldn't help but darken his expression! At the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, Royal Nobles that could have the word \u201cWar\u201d on their ship like this could be counted on one's fingers. Currently, he didn't have to look; he already knew who the person was.\u201cLie Zhan Hou!\u201dA Royal Noble whose title was bestowed upon by the Mortal King of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, as well as one of the strongest Royal Nobles within the kingdom. Even though he did not originate from the Heavenly God Sect but from another big sect, he pledged his loyalty to the Mortal King. He had accomplished many remarkable military achievements. At the frontier of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, there were countless smaller sects that were stamped out by his hands!Lie Zhan Hou was not only a brave general of the kingdom, but he was also a renowned ruthless character.Lie Zhan Hou brought along eight hundred soldiers to the outskirts of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. This matter did not simply just alarm the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, but it also alarmed the other sects within the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom; especially the closest ones to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. They became frightened with the appearance of the ancient ship.\u201cThe warship of Lie Zhan Hou, could it be that the marquis is personally going into battle?\u201d Seeing this ancient ship, countless cultivators were surprised.A nearby sect master's expression darkened, and he said: \u201cAfter his title bestowment, the marquis rarely left the kingdom capital. Why did he suddenly appear here without any indications!\u201dThe appearance of the ancient ship caused many cultivators to secretly follow. Seeing it stop right outside of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect made these cultivators glance at each other, filled with astonishment.A sect master's face changed colors as he quietly mumbled: \u201cCould it be that Lie Zhan Hou is personally attacking the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect?\u201d At the moment, many powerful characters thought about many different outcomes.The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the Heavenly God Sect were mortal enemies. Today, the Heavenly God Sect created the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom and it was erected on the remains of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's old kingdom; the kingdom was an even bigger territory.The war that occurred thirty thousand years ago, the ancestor of the Heavenly God Sect personally took action, and the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was utterly defeated. With their miserable defeat, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect couldn't do anything outside of returning to the ancestral land.After the grand defeat, the Heavenly God Sect didn't use this opportunity to give chase; its ancestor also didn't personally slaughter the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. During the decline of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, both of the sects still had minor skirmishes; however, the Heavenly God Sect still did not destroy the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.Regarding this matter, within the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom and even the Grand Middle Territory, there were many different versions of rumors circulating. Some said that the Heavenly God Sect did not destroy the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect because it still had a living monstrous ancestor who was extremely powerful; even the ancestor of the Heavenly God Sect wasn't sure that he could destroy the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect in one breath.There was another rumor that the Heavenly God Sect ancestor wasn't sure that he could destroy the emperor foundation of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Even though the sect had declined, in the end, it was still a sect created by an Immortal Emperor. On top of this holy ground, the foundation built by an Immortal Emperor could not be shaken. The Heavenly God Sect was not confident in attacking this emperor foundation.A different rumor had it that because the Immortal Emperor True Treasure of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect still existed, the Heavenly God Sect couldn't destroy it. As long as the Immortal Emperor True Treasure remained in their hands, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect would not be destroyed!No matter what, to sum it up, after the Heavenly God Sect's victory over the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the founding of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, the Heavenly God Sect had never directly attacked the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.A few ten thousand years quickly passed, and suddenly, the warship of Lie Zhan Hou appeared outside of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; how could others not be surprised?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lie Zhan Hou's title was bestowed by the Mortal King himself, so, to a certain extent, he represented the will of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom and the Heavenly God Sect.Since Lie Zhan Hou was personally leading the troops, could it mean that the Heavenly God Sect had finally decided to make a move against the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect?An elder from a different sect said: \u201cIt could be that the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect has fallen completely with no hope for revival, so the Heavenly God Sect finally turned the butcher knife against them.\u201dThere was an old monster that had some knowledge regarding the war that year and said: \u201cIt seems like Liu San Jian is truly dead; the Heavenly God Sect finally wants to make a move.\u201dLiu San Jian, that year, was of illustrious prestige. In the legends, Liu San Jian was not an ordinary genius. Some people said that he was the disciple of Mu Shaodi, but some also said that he was the grand disciple of Mu Shaodi. Rumors had it that in the last war thirty thousand years ago, Liu San Jian personally commanded and fought against the Heavenly God Sect ancestor. Even though the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect lost disastrously, the Heavenly God Sect was still in fear of Liu San Jian, and they did not want to attack the lair of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!Lie Zhan Hou personally leading troops against the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect made other heritages and sects think about many things. The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was of Immortal Emperor heritage and contained Immortal Emperor Min Ren's merit laws and Emperor Treasures. Only one Emperor merit law or an Emperor Treasure stranded in the human world was enough for people's eyes to become reddened with greed.Even though there were early rumors that many of the Emperor merit laws of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect were lost, it still had some Emperor merit laws and Virtuous Paragon merit laws; this was still enough for countless sects to be overwhelmed with avarice.At this moment, many sects were privately discussing that the personal expedition of Lie Zhan Hou was for the Emperor merit laws, or even the Heaven's Will Secret Law of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.The warship stopping right outside of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect caused both the upper and lower ranks of the sect to be extremely alarmed. At this moment, the sect's atmosphere was extremely tense, and the disciples mentally prepared themselves for war!At this time, in the warship, a person stood up. This was a middle-aged man with a tall and majestic figure. He was adorned with battle armor like a general on an expedition.This man wore a leopard and tiger ornamented headband, and his eyes beamed with ominous ferocity, full of threatening momentum. Once he stood up, he was like a golden mountain and jade pillar. He was filled with uncontrolled blood energy, like a gigantic tsunami soaring through the entire sky. Frightening blood energy floated around his body. Standing there, he was like a leopard covered in blood, wanting to devour humans; this caused others to smell the bloodthirst from afar.Lie Zhan Hou, general of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, vicious underling of the Mortal Emperor. He was not only a powerful Royal Noble, but he was also a bloodthirsty warrior.\u201cHaha, Brother Gu, I heard that your sect was of an Immortal Emperor heritage. This general has always looked up to Emperor merit laws; hearing that your great sect has a peerless Emperor merit law, my curiosity couldn't help but become tingly. So, today I came to learn, wanting to see the invincible style of Immortal Emperor Min Ren's merit laws!\u201dLie Zhan Hou stood on top of the warship, and he laughed with an arrogant and overbearing attitude.Lie Zhan Hou cut straight to the point and bluntly called it \u201cwanting to learn\u201d, causing the entire Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's expressions to become ugly. This presumptuous attitude was as if the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect didn't have anyone of worth.As for the majority of the cultivators from the other sects watching from outside, they glanced at each other. It was as they thought; Lie Zhan Hou indeed came for the Emperor merit laws of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.Against the provocation of Lie Zhan Hou, First Elder Gu Tieshou had not yet accepted, but Second Elder Cao Xiong had jumped forward and fiercely shouted: \u201cLittle Boy Lie, don't be arrogant, our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect isn't a place that will tolerate your impudence. Today, this seat will teach you a lesson!\u201dFinished speaking, Cao Xiong's Fate Palace floated in the air along with true energy on top of his head, and he stepped on top of the warship.Cao Xiong was the first one to accept the challenge, causing the elders of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect to glance at each other's eyes.Against Cao Xiong's challenge, Lie Zhan Hou coldly glared at him once, and then presumptuously said: \u201cOnly Cao Xiong, yet you still dare to talk big in front of this seat; roll away!\u201dAfter the words came out, a banner of blood on top of Lie Zhan Hou's head cut straight down.Once the blood banner appeared, it immediately cut across ten thousand miles. The blood banner up in the sky was like a curtain of oceanic blood hiding the sun. Within the blood banner, countless skulls floated up and down while their anguished wailings reaching a thousand miles away. It was unknown how many lives were taken and devoured by this blood banner.\u201cBlood banner; the true energy of Lie Zhan Hou!\u201d Seeing the blood banner cutting straight down, many people's expressions greatly changed, and they lost their voice.\u201cOpen\u2026\u201d Cao Xiong loudly screamed, and his true energy pierced the heaven and met the blood banner. A \u201cBoom\u201d loudly rang. Even when Cao Xiong was borrowing the world's pure energy, he still couldn't block one attack from Lie Zhan Hou.Cao Xiong was knocked away by the blood banner, and he sprayed out a mouthful of blood; he immediately retreated. Even though Cao Xiong's cultivation was not shallow and could be considered the second strongest in the sect, but compared to a Royal Noble, the difference was too great.Lie Zhan Hou coldly glanced around, and he said with disdain: \u201cLittle Named Hero, your talent is not enough to reach the apex; you are but an insect running his big mouth, wanting to die\u2026\u201dCao Xiong reddened from anger, and he shouted: \u201cLittle Boy Lie, I will fight against you to the death\u2026\u201dHowever, at this moment, First Elder Gu Tieshou stopped Cao Xiong, and he told the other elders: \u201cEscort Brother Cao back and heal his wounds. Brother Cao, you are not his match; let Older Brother go.\u201dCao Xiong still wanted to fight, but the other elders consoled and stopped him, so he had to unwillingly go back to heal.At this moment, First Elder Gu Tieshou coldly stared at Lie Zhan Hou with fierce eyes. A loud \u201cboom\u201d occurred, and the first elder's blood energy was like the ocean, continuous without pauses. Each of his Dao incantations traveled around his body. The more frightening part was that on top of his head was a hovering Kun Peng. The moment the Kun Peng let out a loud roar, it flew to the sky's dome, and the gigantic Kun Peng immediately crushed the dome.At this moment, the Kun Peng looked down on the eight directions, encompassing all living beings, and the peerless frightening pressure crushed all its enemies. The Kun Peng was considered the strongest existence in this world; each strand of its energies was capable of suffocating the heavens and earths!Against such a strong enemy, First Elder did not hold back anything, and he directly revealed his Royal Noble power.\u201cKun Peng's Six Variants\u2026\u201d Seeing the Kun Peng collapsing the sky, many powerful cultivators' hearts were shaken. Emperor merit laws were indeed worthy of their name, peerless in all generations. No matter how powerful a Virtuous Paragon merit law was, it could not compare to an Emperor merit law!At this moment, the Kun Peng bullied the heavens, causing others to be unable to breathe. A complete Emperor merit law in the hands of a Royal Noble's power was monstrous. At the same rank of Royal Noble, if the opponent did not also practice an Emperor merit law, he would want to avoid them and retreat!\u201cIf you want to fight, this old man will fight you!\u201d At this moment, First Elder Gu Tieshou was dominating the heavens. As a descendant of an Immortal Emperor heritage, even though his talents were not good, he definitely was not a coward.Finished speaking, he took one step forward, and he invaded the space in front of Lie Zhan Hou. Lie Zhan Hou changed his expression, and he roared. The blood banner came crashing down \u2013 one banner to strike down and tear apart the fabric of space. The boundless sea of blood wanted to submerge Gu Tieshou and dissolve him.The Kun Peng jumped in the sky and flipped its tail, like a giant fish wanting to jump freely out of the vast sea. A loud \u201cThump\u201d occurred. This giant tail easily shattered the sea of blood of Lie Zhan Hou. On top of the blood banner, Lie Zhan Hou immediately took a few steps back!\u201cDie\u2026\u201d Lie Zhan Hou's expression became ugly. He crazily yelled and activated his blood banner. Suddenly, eighteen blood images came out from the blood banner. Each towered at ten thousand zhang; their loud and ferocious roars shook the heavens and earths.\u201cBloody Giants Diagram!\u201d Once the Bloody Giants came out, they trampled the world. The expressions of everyone greatly changed; this was the true energy of Lie Zhan Hou! Absolutely powerful, who knew how many Royal Nobles had been killed by this technique.\u201cOpen\u2026\u201d Each of the giants trampled the heavens and rushed forward. Gu Tieshou was not deterred, and continue to activate the Kun Peng's Six Variants. The Kun Peng let out a long roar and dived downward. The tail of the Kun Peng could not be mitigated, and each Blood Giant immediately collapsed. The moment of the impact, the giants were just like pieces of paper.\u201cBang\u2026\u201d The Kun Peng easily destroyed the true energy diagram of Lie Zhan Hou. When the tail of the Kun Peng struck down, Lie Zhan Hou couldn't stop it and was knocked one thousand miles away while spraying out a mouthful of blood.Seeing this scene, everyone couldn't help but to breath in cold air. The entire Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was ecstatic, and they started cheering.\u201cEmperor merit laws are so dreadful. Gu Tieshou didn't even let out his true energy; he only used the Emperor merit law to defeat the true energy of Lie Zhan Hou. This matter, this matter is simply frightful!\u201d The cultivators observing the fight, no matter if it was a tyrant of one domain or the head of one sect, their faces couldn't help but greatly change.\u201cThe Kun Peng's Six Variants! According to the legends, it is the strongest core Emperor merit law of Immortal Emperor Min Ren; this ability is unbelievable!\u201d Many people lost their colors seeing this scene.Today, they finally had the chance to witness the power of an Emperor merit law. Their hearts started beating faster. Emperor merit law, eh? This was too heaven-defying!\u201cYou are not enough!\u201d At this moment, Gu Tieshou's domination pierced the heavens. In a flash, he was able to catch up to Lie Zhan Hou, and the Kun Peng manifesting into reality stomped down on him.\u201cReturn\u2026\u201d Lie Zhan Hou loudly roared and summoned a Godly Diagram. Once this godly diagram appeared, it instantly became endless mountains and rivers and sucked Gu Tieshou inside.The godly diagram manifested into mountains and rivers; others could only see the faint shadows. Next were rumbling noises. One could barely see Gue Tieshou jumping into the sky inside the endless mountains and rivers formation. His Kun Peng moved unhindered in the heaven and earth, and his mysterious true energy swept the eight directions. He wanted to escape from this diagram several times, but the formation kept on suppressing him.\u201cInside my Yang Shou Mountains and Rivers Diagram, let see if you can cause any waves!\u201d Lie Zhan Hou coldly scowled, and in a flash, he also went inside the diagram; he took control of the formation, and the fight with Gu Tieshou continued on inside the Godly Diagram.\u201cYang Shou Mountains and Rivers Diagram\u2026\u201d Seeing this formation trapping Gu Tieshou, many people were secretly shocked. A sect master who was watching the fight exclaimed: \u201cI heard that the Lie family has an unfathomable Ancient Saint who was well versed in formation techniques and was researching ancient formations. He created a Godly Diagram named the Yang Shou Mountains and Rivers Diagram. I heard that if this formation was at full strength, not mentioning Ancient Saints, it could even defeat Heavenly Monarchs.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if Lie Zhan Hou couldn't activate ten parts of this formation, he would still be enough to slay him.\u201d Seeing this scene, everyone shook their heads in pity.The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was struck with horror seeing Gue Tieshou trapped in the formation. The four elders lost their color; the situation was very disadvantageous for the sect.However, everyone underestimated the strength of Gu Tieshou. This battle lasted for three days and three nights. Even though he was trapped, he used the power of the Kun Peng's Six Variants and maneuvered freely. Even though he couldn't kill a way out of the Yang Shou Mountains and Rivers Diagram, if Lie Zhan Hou wanted to kill Gu Tieshou inside the formation; this was also not an easy task.At this moment, Gu Tieshou and Lie Zhan Hou were persevering inside the formation, and they both were not able to suppress the other.\u201cGu Tieshou was indeed secretive! I thought he was just a Named Hero. It is unthinkable that he is actually an experienced Royal Noble!\u201dThe entire Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's hearts were hanging high in a cage up above. At the moment, only Gu Tieshou in the sect had the power to personally uphold one direction. The other four elders were only Named Heroes, and they were unable to help. Even if the four were to fight together, they would still be unable to compete against Lie Zhan Hou.All of the disciples knew a calamity had befallen on the sect including Li Qiye, who was punished inside the Ghost Pavilion. While the pressure of a Royal Noble flooded the entire Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, Li Qiye simply only glanced into the far distance once.Outside of the sect, the grand battle had been going on for five days and five nights, and the stalemate continued with Gu Tieshou being unable to escape and Lie Zhan Hou unable to kill him. Gu Tieshou could not surrender, and Lie Zhan Hou definitely could not withdraw his troops, so both of them could only continue this act.On the seemingly tranquil fifth night, the Ghost Pavilion became even more ghastly. Li Qiye was meditating with his eyes closed in the main hall; it was as if the battle outside of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had nothing to do with him.The quiet Ghost Pavilion did appear to be haunted during this silent night. An unknown amount of time had passed, and then suddenly, a gust of wind blew Li Qiye's eyes open; in front of him stood a person.Li Qiye examined the person standing in front of him, and he smilingly asked: \u201cElder Cao, the night is already so late; why did you come here?\u201dAt this moment, standing in front of Li Qiye was Elder Cao, who was recovering from his wounds inside the sect!Cao Xiong stared at Li Qiye with a chilling gaze, but his countenance was cheerful; he happily said: \u201cMy good talented nephew, I was asked by the other elders to come teach you the Daylight Sky Merit Law.\u201d\u201cDaylight Sky Merit Law?\u201d Hearing this, Li Qiye couldn't help but smile, and he said: \u201cElder Cao, I heard that the Daylight Sky Merit Law was a minor Heaven's Will Secret Law of our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Even though it is only a minor law, its importance is even higher than Virtuous Paragon merit laws. All of the elders must agree before passing down this technique.\u201d\u201cMy coming here to give you the Daylight Sky Merit Law was unanimously decided by the elders.\u201d Cao Xiong busily continued: \u201cCurrently, a calamity has struck our sect, and First Brother is trapped inside a formation. The elders need a miracle, and we need a Heaven's Will Secret Law to come to the rescue. Hopefully, good nephew could dream and see the Patriarch, so he could grant you the Heaven's Will Secret Law.\u201dHearing Cao Xiong's words, Li Qiye hesitated for a moment, and then he replied: \u201cElder Cao, I'm afraid this won't work. Even with the dream instruction, it would still need several months, ah!\u201dCao Xiong hurriedly said: \u201cTry it once for now to see if you can see the Patriarch or not in your dream. If not, we'll think of something else.\u201dLi Qiye also hastily said: \u201cOk, I will try for a little bit. Did Elder Cao bring along the Daylight Sky Merit Law?\u201dCao Xiong took out a manual and said: \u201cThis matter was too urgent; the original Daylight Sky copy wasn't brought along. I brought you a hand written copy of it.\u201dLi Qiye accepted the manual, and he was going to open it; however, he then hesitated again, put down the manual, looked at Cao Xiong and said: \u201cElder Cao, even though I am only a third generation disciple, regarding this grave matter, I still know that a Heaven's Will Secret Law has the utmost importance in the foundation of our sect. I want to meet the other elders once. It is not that I suspect Elder Cao, but because this matter is so important, I need to see them to really know that it was a unanimous agreement.\u201d\u201cMy good nephew, this is our existential crisis in front of our eyes! The other elders are outside to hold back the powerful enemies, and they can't come back at this moment; they could only entrust it to me.\u201d Cao Xiong hastily spoke with a worried expression. Afterward, he rolled his eyes and added: \u201cIf good nephew really wants to meet the other elders, so be it. I will just lead you to them.\u201d\u201cThis could not be better.\u201d Having heard this, Li Qiye nodded his head, but he then shook his head, saying: \u201cElder Cao, I'm afraid this will not do since I am still serving my punishment at the moment. I have to stay at the Ghost Pavilion for another half a year; I cannot leave.\u201dCao Xiong impatiently said: \u201cIt is a life or death moment for us, and the elders had decided to abolish your punishment, good nephew. We don't have much time, hurry and follow me.\u201dLi Qiye hesitated for a moment, and then shook his head again, saying: \u201cElder, this still will not do. Protector Mo is responsible for watching me. If I want to leave this place, we have to inform him first. How about this, Elder Cao quickly go bring Protector Mo here, and we will leave together.\u201d\u201cStop your long windedness!\u201d At this moment, Cao Xiong lost his patience and shouted: \u201cI let you go, so you go with me!\u201dLi Qiye said while staring at Cao Xiong: \u201cElder Cao, what is the meaning of this? I am only following the normal protocol. As an elder of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, you should know the exact procedures!\u201d\u201cLess nonsensical rubbish! Follow me right now!\u201d Cao Xiong's gaze became fierce. His violent intent was flashing in his eyes as he gravely spoke: \u201cAre you going to walk by yourself, or will I have to drag you?!\u201dAt this point, Li Qiye suddenly appeared to understand. He took a step back while hugging his zither and shockingly said: \u201cElder Cao, you didn't come here because of the other elders' request.\u201d\u201cHaha, heh, you can't be considered stupid yet!\u201d Seeing Li Qiye's suspicion, Cao Xiong decided to stop his pretension. He gravely said: \u201cIf you want to live then follow me right now; otherwise, this seat will personally take action, and I will make your face pretty!\u201dIt seemed Li Qiye at this time had finally calmed down. He glanced at Cao Xiong, and he said: \u201cSo it seems Elder Cao wants to seize the Heaven's Will Secret Law then? However, even if the Patriarch Dao instructs me in my dreams, I still wouldn't give it to you.\u201dCao Xiong exclaimed with a devious laugh: \u201cHaha, this you don't need to worry about. Wait until this seat brings you to an isolated location and imprison you. At that moment, this seat won't be afraid of your defiance!\u201dLi Qiye shook his head and said: \u201cIf I go missing, I'm afraid Protector Mo will quickly find out.\u201dCao Xiong shadily laughed, then said: \u201cSo what if he finds out? Hehe, at this moment, a disaster has befallen the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; it is a mess, and there are no precautions at the Ghost Pavilion. Who is to say that you didn't take this chaotic opportunity to escape. Hehe, if there were a page or two of a copy of the Daylight Sky Merit Law, then I'm afraid everyone will suspect you to be a spy who snuck into the sect just for the Daylight Sky Merit Law and the Heaven's Will Secret Law. Heh, at that moment, Protector Mo and the others will be your accomplices!\u201dLi Qiye shook his head: \u201cElder Cao, you are too confident in your calculations. You aren't afraid that the other elders will see through it?\u201d\u201cHa ha, the other elders will see through it? Huk, maybe after this disaster, there might be a new sect master for the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Huk, if Gu Tieshou was trapped to death in the formation, the sect would need a capable elder to lead it against the powerful opponents. Also, the current sect master is weak and useless. A calamity has arrived, yet she cowardly hid outside; thus, the entire Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, I'm afraid it will need to make a wise decision.\u201d Cao Xiong thought about his calculations, and he couldn't help but to deviously laugh.Li Qiye smiled and said: \u201cSo, Elder Cao would be the new sect master then. Elder Cao will be the new sect master; why the need for this hastiness to size the Heaven's Will Secret Law?\u201dCao Xiong's eyes became severe, and he began to be impatient: \u201cLess talking!\u201dLi Qiye stared at Cao Xiong, couldn't help but laugh, then he said: \u201cI understand, so you bargained with others. Was it Dong Shenglong, or Lie Zhan Hou? It seems like the person who you conspired with will not release the hawk without seeing the rabbit; if you don't give them the Heaven's Will Secret Law, they will not withdraw the troops; or they won't drag you to the sect master's seat?\u201d\u201cRubbish, come with me!\u201d Cao Xiong was now restless. He let out a deafening roar and he reached for Li Qiye with his hand.\u201cCao Xiong, I didn't think the sect traitor would turn out to be you!\u201d At this moment, a loud roar came forward. From the outside, five people rushed in. This included the four elders along with Protector Mo!Elder Sun's group suddenly came in causing Cao Xiong's expression to greatly sour, and he took a step back. In a flash, he captured Li Qiye, and he retreated to a corner.At this time, Elder Sun, Elder Qian, Elder Zhou, and Elder Wu quickly surrounded Cao Xiong.Elder Qian yelled: \u201cCao Xiong, you betrayed the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and sold off the sect's Emperor law! How will you face the ancestors?\u201dCao Xiong's face was sometimes red and sometimes white. He was in disbelief, and he frightenedly said: \u201cYou, why all are all of you here? Why are you not outside the sect?\u201dProtector Mo gravely said: \u201cElder Cao, I have been watching all of your moves! You and Lie Zhan Hou's act was too real; even the elders were fooled, but you didn't fool me.\u201dCao Xiong's expression became extremely ugly. He was using this opportunity to capture Li Qiye without anyone knowing, so he didn't think that Protector Mo was trailing him.Elder Wu shouted: \u201cCao Xiong, it is not too late to surrender!\u201dCao Xiong thunderously exclaimed: \u201cIf successful, I would be a king; if failed, then I am a villain. I have nothing else to say. Know better and make way for me, otherwise, I will crush your treasured disciple. Without him, you all will never find the Heaven's Will Secret Law!\u201dSeeing Cao Xiong's five fingers gripping Li Qiye's head, the expressions of Elder Sun's group greatly soured, and they glanced at each other.\u201cSo he is the key to the Heaven's Will Secret Law!\u201d At this moment, a calm voice filled the hall.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The moment he walked in, he let off his Royal Noble pressure causing the elders to greatly change their expressions.Seeing this person, Elder Sun blurted: \u201cDong Shenglong\u2026\u201d\u201cCao Xiong, you didn't tell me that this little brat was the key to the Heaven's Will Secret Law!\u201d Dong Shenglong's gaze fell upon Li Qiye. His eyes narrowed before he burst out in laughter: \u201cIn other words, obtaining this little brat is the same as obtaining the Emperor merit laws of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!\u201d\u201cBrother Dong, this isn't the time for us to blame each other!\u201d Cao Xiong spoke with a serious tone: \u201cAt this moment, we have to work together. Let us leave this place first, then speak!\u201dDong Shenglong glared at Cao Xiong and coldly sneered: \u201cCao Xiong, you still want to command me with your little strategy? Hmph, if I hadn't been watching over you closely, you would be a dead man right now!\u201d\u201cCao Xiong, conspiring with an outsider and betraying the sect, you have committed irredeemable crimes!\u201d At this moment, Elder Zhou couldn't help but roar; the four elders were enraged by this betrayal!Cao Xiong's face turned white, then green. Finally, he chillingly scowled, and he didn't bother arguing. Dong Shenglong's arrival had sealed the conclusion of this matter.Dong Shenglong stared at the four elders and smiled: \u201cOld Man Zhou, your words are true, but after today, it will not be. Heh, Li Qiye conspired with the Nine Saint Demon Gate to steal the Emperor merit laws of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, and he was discovered by the four elders. Then, a great battle broke out between you all and the traitor and Li Shuangyan! In the end, both sides died valiantly in battle!\u201cAs for Gu Tieshou, ah. Cao Xiong and I will join forces with him and enter the formation, and we will defeat Lie Zhan Hou and expel the enemies, but Gu Tieshou will die from his heavy wounds inside. The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's Su Yonghuang was cowardly and weak, and she hid away in the outskirt, not daring to fight. The sect will definitely remove her sect master position. Elder Cao has contributed greatly along with the support of the entire disciple body, so he becomes the new sect master of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201d Dong Shenglong spoke slowly.The four elders' faces were extremely difficult to look at. One Cao Xiong, they were not afraid of, but with the appearance of Dong Shenglong, the outcome has been determined. The four of them would not be able to compete with Dong Shenglong!\u201cThis story, it isn't that bad, right? It could even be a legend praised by the future Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201d Dong Shenglong was quite satisfied with his ploy, so he grinned: \u201cCao Xiong will be at ease with his sect master position, and, as for me ah! As the guest adviser for the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect for so long, I have fulfilled my obligations.\u201d\u201cThe moment you step down, you will also bring the Emperor merit laws of the sect away, right?\u201d At this moment, a pleasant and ringing laughter came forward from Li Qiye, who was in Cao Xiong's grasp.Li Qiye was still hugging his ancient zither. Even under Cao Xiong's control, he still maintained his cool.At this moment, he smilingly stared at Dong Shenglong, and he clearly spoke: \u201cNot a bad plan. Unfortunately, in my eyes, it is simply superfluous. Also, before killing you all, remember this one phrase, anyone who opposes my path will be killed without mercy!\u201d\u201cZhang\u2026\u201d Finished speaking, the five fingers of Li Qiye suddenly pulled on the zither strings. In a flash, the zither in his hands spewed out an endless brilliance with continuous Dao pressure, and he broke Cao Xiong's grasp on him.\u201cZhang\u2026\u201d The harmonious sound of the zither caused the melodic patterns inside the Ghost Pavilion to come alive. At this moment, these densely packed patterns suddenly lit up, and endless magical runes came forward along with a clear sword note; two sword auras immediately came pouring out!\u201cAhh\u2026\u201d A sword blade cleaved down, Cao Xiong was too late to scream as his head was sent flying upward. He then noticed the blood spewing from his neck. Even after death, he didn't realize what just happened.\u201cAhh\u2026\u201d Dong Shenglong pitifully bellowed. The sword aura swiftly pierced into his body, and the sword edge, in a flash, destroyed his Dao foundation. Under one sword, his fragile Dao foundation couldn't handle one blow; it was as if it was dry and rotten wood. He violently spurted out a mouthful of blood, and he fell straight down on the ground!\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Dong Shenglong bellowed while rolling on the ground. His skin lost all color from fear, and he crazily screamed: \u201cNo, NO, this is impossible!\u201dAt this point, the four elders and Protector Mo were frightened frozen. Cao Xiong was acceptable, but Dong Shenglong was a Royal Noble, yet he still couldn't block one blow. Even till now, the four elders still didn't know exactly what just happened.\u201cM-my, my three thousand years of cultivation\u2026\u201d In the end, Dong Shenglong let out a loud roar, and he shiveringly crawled up. In a short moment, he was a few hundred years older. His back bent down, and his flesh dried up.\u201cLittle animal, I will fight you till death\u2026\u201d After standing up, Dong Shenglong became crazy, and he rushed forward at Li Qiye. However, at this moment, he was like a hundred-year-old man that couldn't walk without shaking.At this time, Li Qiye raised his eyebrows and ordered: \u201cGrab him!\u201dThe four elders and Protector Mo regained their spirits. Elder Qian easily captured Dong Shenglong. He was stunned when he noticed that Dong Shenglong's cultivation was completely destroyed.\u201cLittle animal, kill me if you are courageous! Kill me, ah!\u201d Deng Shenglong, with disheveled hair, crazily struggled to escape Elder Qian's grasp. He even tried to pounce on Li Qiye with his nails.He cultivated for three thousand years just to lose it all in one night. To a cultivator, this was a fate worse than death. One couldn't blame Dong Shenglong for being so outraged.Li Qiye slowly glanced at him, and he said: \u201cWe will definitely kill you, however, just not right now. You a thousand times, ten thousand times shouldn't have offended me; this was you courting death.\u201dDong Shenglong deafeningly screeched, and he tried to pounce on Li Qiye again, but Elder Qian easily held him back.Such a change rocked the four elders' hearts. Earlier, Dong Shenglong was a Royal Noble, causing them to fear ten thousand times over. Even if the four of them fought together, they wouldn't necessarily be a match for Dong Shenglong. However, just a moment later, he became an old man that couldn't catch a chicken properly! This matter was too frightening.The four elders hesitatingly stared at the ancient zither in Li Qiye's chest. Seeing its ancient style, they couldn't help but shiver.Finally, Dong Shenglong was taken away to be imprisoned.\u201cThis, this matter\u2026 What actually happened in the end?\u201dCao Xiong betrayed the sect; this matter did not need to be discussed. However, Li Qiye easily killing Cao Xiong and destroying Dong Shenglong caused the elders to still be stunned.Hugging his zither, Li Qiye calmly explained: \u201cIt was only an Immortal Emperor's emperor's power and immortal intent; when they turn into swords, they are enough to slay the four directions.\u201dAt this moment, the four elders and Protector Mo couldn't help but to analyze this Ghost Pavilion. Earlier when Li Qiye played the zither, they all felt the change in the Dao; however, everything was so fast and they couldn't see clearly. Right now, they still couldn't see through the mysteries here.Elder Sun drew in a cold breath of air and asked: \u201cWhere did this ancient zither come from?\u201dLi Qiye smiled: \u201cI was meditating at this wall. When night came, the Patriarch appeared in my dreams and told me that downstairs had an ancient zither that was buried. That year, the Patriarch used to play it and later on, it sunk to the ground.\u201cI followed the Patriarch's instructions, and I dug out this ancient zither. In my dreams, the Patriarch also informed me about the true mysteries regarding this Zither Pavilion. Originally, this pavilion was the place where the Patriarch used to reminisce. During his period of upholding the world's immortal power, he used to play the zither here. Unwittingly, Dao truths were imprinted within the zither laws. After a long period of time, the entire Zither Pavilion contained these zither laws, and eventually, these zither laws were able to contain the vast emperor's power and immortal intent of the Patriarch. Not only that, these zither laws also hid a peerless Dao of the zither.\u201dLi Qiye spoke continuously as if everything was a matter of fact.Li Qiye smilingly continued: \u201cThe Patriarch in my dream taught me how to play and activate the zither laws in order to borrow the emperor's power and immortal intent.\u201dHearing Li Qiye's words, the four elders couldn't help but greatly change their expressions. Even in their wildest dreams, they wouldn't believe that a place they considered the Ghost Pavilion would contain such emperor's power and immortal intent like this!Elder Wu emotionally said: \u201cLi Qiye is the person our ancestor has personally chosen to lead our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. The Patriarch had chosen him, and this means that in the future, he will lead us to revival. He will bring back the glory of our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!\u201dIt was originally Dao instructions in a dream, but now it was treasure seeking in a dream. To the four elders, there was no doubt that the Patriarch had chosen Li Qiye to be the new leader of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.In the midst of everything, Li Qiye's status, in the minds of the four elders, became completely different. Li Qiye was the one chosen by Immortal Emperor Min Ren, and he would be his representative!The four elders struggled to regain their spirits, and Elder Qian muttered: \u201cThe matter of the Zither Pavilion, I had read about. I heard that this really was the place where the Patriarch used to play his instrument. Who would have thought that this place inherited his emperor's power and immortal intent!\u201dElder Zhou couldn't help but quietly murmur: \u201cThis pavilion inherited the emperor's power and immortal intent; does that mean it was even more powerful than our patriarch's portrait?\u201dElder Sun exclaimed: \u201cThis is all thanks to Qiye; otherwise, we would have missed this emperor treasure.\u201dElder Wu excitedly said: \u201cThe Patriarch protects our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect! He is not willing to see our decline, so he chose Qi Ye to be the one that restores our sect!\u201dSuddenly, the four elders were too ecstatic; Li Qiye's miracle allowed for them to see a ray of hope.\u201cNot good\u2026\u201d At this moment, Elder Qian suddenly gathered his thoughts, and he shockingly said: \u201cFirst Brother is still trapped within the formation! We need to make haste in order to save him. Perhaps the Heavenly God Sect would even use another evil plot to harm First Brother!\u201dLi Qiye smiled, and he said: \u201cWithin the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, this is not a difficult matter. Let me play a tune and destroy the formation of Lie Zhan Hou.\u201dFinished speaking, he sat down in a meditative pose on the ground, and he began to play the ancient zither.The ancient zither lit up at once, and the Zither Pavilion also lit up as well\u2026[1] Superfluous raw expression was \u2013 drawing a cake on a piece of paper. One can draw a cake on a piece of paper, but they can't eat it, so it is meaningless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In a flash, the emperor's power and immortal intent broke out, suffocating the heavens. Even four elders' legs were shivering, unable to stand straight. Under the pressure of the immortal emperor's remnants, they were entirely suppressed, falling flat to the ground.\u201cThe soul of the Patriarch\u2026\u201d Feeling the ancient and majestic immortal emperor's presence, the four elders were extremely emotional to the point where tears dripped down their faces; they finally got to see the immortal emperor's aura of the Patriarch after countless years had passed.Outside of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, there were still many experts watching the fight between Gu Tieshou and Lie Zhan Hou. Even though Gu Tieshou hadn't been able to escape the formation, even under the suppression of both the formation and Lie Zhan Hou, he still stood strong; he valiantly moved the other cultivators.Their hearts were moved by his unyielding will to not surrender until death; he was like a weak insect, yet still struggled to survive with all he had. The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, in the end, was still an Immortal Emperor lineage. Even though they had declined for thirty thousand years, they still had some hidden strength!As for the eight hundred soldiers that came along with Lie Zhan Hou, they coldly smirked in their minds. Even if Gu Tieshou tried his best, he still wouldn't make it past tomorrow. There would be a change of dynasty in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, yet Gu Tieshou was simply struggling on his last foot.\u201cBoom!\u201d At the moment when cultivators were thinking about how this fight would end, suddenly, inside the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, a light shot forward. This light tore through the sky in a flash and traveled through space with enough power to cut down all the celestials.In the blink of an eye, within the boundary of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, everyone felt an unbeatable ancient emperor pressure. Within this moment, countless existences trembled.\u201cWhat's happening?!\u201d All the cultivators outside were shivering with fear from the depth of their souls! Under this ancient breath, they all felt like they were insects and ants; they were not enough to reach the apex.Feeling this type of pressure, a sect master strugglingly spoke: \u201cEmperor's power and immortal intent! Could it be that the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect wants to go all out and activate its Immortal Emperor Life Treasure?!\u201d\u201cNot good\u2026\u201d Feeling this ancient immortal pressure, the eight hundred soldiers on top of the warship were aghast, but everything was too late.The light in the sky suddenly turned into a sword edge, and it swept horizontally across the heavens and earth. This sword edge shouldered an ancient immortal pressure, and with just this one blow, it could be seen that nothing could stop it.\u201cPhooosh\u2026\u201d Waves upon waves of blood spewed out. As the sword edge swept across, eight hundred heads flew up to the sky. All of their eyes were wide with astonishment. The moment their heads flew up, they could even see the blood spurting from their own cut necks.The sword carried along with it an unstoppable aura. It kept going until it hit the inside of the endless mountains and rivers. A \u201cBang\u201d sound rang, and the formation immediately became dust. The Ancient Saint's formation crafted with blood and sweat, under this sword, couldn't withstand one blow. The formation was split into halves, and it dropped to the floor; Gu Tieshou also fell down from the inside.\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Lie Zhan Hou, inside the formation, bellowed; the sword's edge immediately pierced through his chest, and it crucified him into the ground.At this moment, the sword aura disappeared, and only blood flowed quietly on the ground. Lie Zhan Hou, pierced to the ground, could still move his arms and legs. He was still alive simply because Li Qiye wanted to spare him.This sudden change, not mentioning the cultivators who were observing the battle, the disciples of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, and Gu Tieshou, left everyone in a daze; this sudden reversal was too frightening!The minds of everyone went blank from seeing this sight. Eight hundred soldiers, Lie Zhan Hou, and the formation \u2013 under this one sword, all came to naught. A Royal Noble and an Ancient Saint's formation, both were not enough to reach the apex. Under this one sword, everything was swept away like dust.This sword had passed through; within the castle of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, the Mortal King suddenly opened his unfathomable eyes. Like the flow of the sun and moon and the pattern of the celestials, it was truly frightening. At this moment, he quietly murmured: \u201cCould it be that the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect still has an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure left?\u201dFinally, the heavenly aura in his two eyes exceeded the sky; it was as if he wanted to see through the corner of the world!Back to the disciples of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. This event rendered them blank for a long time, without being able to regain their wits.An unknown amount of time had passed. Finally, a cultivator whispered: \u201cEmperor's power and immortal intent\u2026\u201d Emperor's power and immortal intent; countless cultivators had heard of this phrase, but no one had even seen its true power. Today, this one sword's edge sweeping through and turning everything into nothingness, this was the emperor's power and immortal intent!People finally understood the horror of an Immortal Emperor. Immortal Emperor Min Ren was gone for a long time, and he only left behind his emperor's power and immortal intent; however, it was still enough to cause all of the gods to tremble!While everyone was still busy thinking, the voice of Li Qiye rang from inside the sect: \u201cTie him up! Three days later, we will publicly behead him for others to see.\u201dOne did not know how long it took, but everyone finally regained their spirits. The cultivators on the sideline were shocked while the disciples of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect were continuously celebrating. Some disciples tied up Lie Zhan Hou, and they took him to the dungeon.Finally, Gu Tieshou absentmindedly returned to the sect. Inside the Zither Pavilion, after hearing all the details, he still couldn't help but lose his composure again.A while later, Gu Tieshou stared at Li Qiye, and he mumbled: \u201cThe soul of the Patriarch is here, protecting our sect\u2026\u201dHe took a deep breath, and told Li Qiye: \u201cThe Patriarch has chosen you as our savior; I hope that you can bring the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect back to its former glory!\u201dGu Tieshou could be considered the main driver of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. With these words, he has established Li Qiye's position within the sect. After one night, Li Qiye's status in the sect couldn't be shaken by anyone!Lie Zhan Hou personally led the attack on the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Everyone in the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom assumed that this was the sect's calamity. No one thought that after just one night, there would be an unthinkable reversal, resulting in the deaths of the eight hundred soldiers and the capture of the wounded Lie Zhan Hou. It all felt like a dream, but it was ten thousand exact truths.Inside the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, both the upper and lower ranks were jubilant. This was an exciting event for the disciples' morale. Defeating Lie Zhan Hou's invasion was a medicine for the heart; at the very least, it gave the disciples a glimmer of hope.With the conclusion of the battle, the upper echelon of the sect held a meeting with the elders and protectors, led by Gu Tieshou. He revealed the conspiracy of Cao Xiong and Dong Shenglong. At the moment, Cao Xiong was dead, and Dong Shenglong \u2013 along with Lie Zhan Hou \u2013 were prisoners!The protectors despised Cao Xiong's selfish actions to the bones. Just a little bit more, and the sect would have been a puppet under the Heavenly God Sect!After the five elders informed them that everything was accomplished by Li Qiye, the protectors were stunned. They had heard about the Dao instruction, but they didn't think that the Patriarch had actually chosen Li Qiye!During the meeting, the elders identified Li Qiye as the revitalizing savior of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. The protectors did not have any objections regarding this decision.After the conference had ended, they discussed how to deal with Dong Shenglong and Lie Zhan Hou.Regarding this matter, Li Qiye only had one sentence. He smiled and said: \u201cThree days later, publicly execute them for all to see. Invite the other sects inside the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom to participate in the fun!\u201dHearing Li Qiye's words, the protectors and elders were startled; what kind of absolute decision was this?A protector worriedly mentioned: \u201cBy this, I'm afraid it would truly be leaving no face for the Heavenly God Sect.\u201dLi Qiye casually replied: \u201cThe Heavenly God Sect is a mortal enemy; who cares about face?\u201d\u201cWhat if the Heavenly God Sect declares war on us?\u201d Another protector couldn't help but ask. In the end, the Heavenly God Sect was a giant monster to them. They created the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom and backed it for thirty thousand years. Now, it was difficult for anyone to shake their position.\u201cDeclare war?\u201d Li Qiye burst out laughing. His eyes became serious, and then slowly spoke: \u201cI heard that the Mortal King of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom is a powerful ruler with great ambition and wisdom, and he is no less than the Nine Saint Demon Gate's Demon Emperor Lun Ri! I'm really not afraid of his war declaration. I hope that he would personally lead the battle, then I can just annihilate all of the Royal Nobles and Enlightened Beings of their Heavenly God Sect.\u201dGu Tieshou pondered for a moment, and then he said: \u201cThis is not a bad idea! The emperor's power and immortal intent of the Zither Pavilion could be expended for a few big battles. If the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom dares to come, we will be able to destroy all of their Royal Nobles and Enlightened Beings in one breath. Even though we have no way of destroying the Heavenly God Sect and the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, but as long as we kill their Royal Nobles and Enlightened Beings, this would be enough to make them seclude themselves to recover for a few thousand years! This will give us a chance to develop the sect.\u201dListening to the first elder's words, the protectors couldn't help but glance at each other.Elder Sun said: \u201cThe Heavenly God Sect's will to destroy us had never died. We cannot keep on conceding. At this moment, if the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom wants to declare war, then we will give them a devastating blow! We will destroy everything with the emperor's power and immortal intent of the Zither Pavilion.\u201dThe Zither Pavilion and the Patriarch's Portrait were both emperor's treasures. Their powers were extremely great, but they couldn't be replenished. On this matter, they couldn't compare to an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure or True Treasure.An Immortal Emperor Life Treasure could be used countless times, but it had a high requirement for the cultivator wielding it. As for an emperor's treasure containing emperor's power and immortal intent, each time it is used, its power will lessen; it eventually will become a mortal item.This was why, at this moment, Gu Tieshou's group wanted to borrow this power of the Zither Pavilion to destroy their enemies in one breath.Li Qiye stared at Gu Tieshou and asked: \u201cRegarding this matter, I have a little question. Where is our Immortal Emperor Life Treasure? Where is our Patriarch's True Treasure?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Gu Tieshou, full of embarrassment, smiled. At this moment, the four elders stared at each other, and their expressions were awkward.[1] It is a common phrase \u2013 meaning that the ancestors are looking after them from above \u2013 still giving protection.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was of Immortal Emperor lineage! Right now, not even one Life Treasure could be found, he could not believe this!Gu Tieshou softly continued: \u201cIt is said that the Patriarch had left behind three Life Treasures and his fate protecting True Treasure; however, at the moment I took this seat, these items were no longer here. At the very least, even during the last sect master's period, these items were no longer inside the sect.\u201dLi Qiye asked: \u201cLost or stolen?\u201dImmortal Emperor Life Treasures were one thing, but the fate protecting treasure of Min Ren, also a True Treasure, was too important to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!\u201cThis\u2026 I'm not too clear regarding this matter.\u201d Gu Tieshou hesitatingly smiled and said: \u201cThe Immortal Emperor True Treasure... I am not clear about the exact details. I'm afraid even the previous sect master didn't know. That year, I heard the martial uncle's discussion. One uncle said that the True Treasure flew away a long time ago. Another uncle said that during the moment our ancestor, Mu Shaodi, was competing for the Heaven's Will with Immortal Emperor Ta Kong, he lost our True Treasure in a heaven frightening battle\u2026 I'm afraid, the last ten generations of our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect has not seen an Immortal Emperor True Treasure.\u201dLi Qiye asked: \u201cWhat about the three Life Treasures?\u201dGu Tieshou contemplated for a moment and then answered: \u201cThis, I cannot answer either.\u201dHere, he glanced at the other four elders, and he continued: \u201cI heard that there was one Life Treasure that could have been taken by ancestor Liu to the ground, and it was buried along with him. Whether this is the truth or not, I do not know.\u201dElder Sun explained to Li Qiye: \u201cAncestor Liu was our sect's first bulwark; in terms of seniority, he would be the grand disciple of Ancestor Mu. I heard that the battle thirty thousand years ago, against the Heavenly God Sect, was led by him. After our defeat and retreat back to our ancestral ground, Ancestor Liu no longer showed his face. There were many rumors about him. Some seniors said that he died in the battle, and some said that he came back wounded and met his origin within the sect.\u201dLiu San Jian was rumored to be the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's greatest genius after Mu Shaodi; however, unfortunately, he was not able to protect the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect in the end, causing the collapse of the old kingdom!At this point, Elder Qian gravely added: \u201cThe other Life Treasures could have possibly fallen into the hands of the Heavenly God Sect.\u201d\u201cInto the hands of the Heavenly God Sect?\u201d Having heard this, Li Qiye's eyes became serious. This was an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure; this type of item falling into the hands of the Heavenly God Sect was not a good thing for the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.Gu Tieshou dejectedly sighed and said: \u201cThis is the thing we are worried about the most. There is no way to verify this matter, but it is almost absolute that this Life Treasure is in the hands of the Heavenly God Sect. In the last battle, our sect lost countless Royal Nobles, Enlightened Beings, and Ancient Saints. In order to protect the kingdom, I heard our ancestors summoned the Immortal Emperor Life Treasure to face the Heavenly God Sect. Afterward, we lost the fight completely, and the entire kingdom fell. Under such chaotic circumstances, the Life Treasure's whereabouts are unknown.\u201dElder Zhou worriedly said: \u201cI worry that the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom would bring this Immortal Emperor Life Treasure to attack our sect.\u201dIf the Heavenly God Sect had a character powerful enough to carry the Life Treasure to attack the sect, then even with the Zither Pavilion, it wouldn't be able to withstand rounds after rounds of the Life Treasure's attacks.Hearing Elder Zhou words, Gu Tieshou's group lost their colors. This was indeed an extremely dangerous matter, they clearly knew the power of an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure.\u201cLet them come. It's time to see how the Immortal Emperor Life Treasure is.\u201d At this point, Li Qiye pleasantly bloomed a smile and said: \u201cWhen the flood is coming, the dam will block. When the troops are coming, the generals will hold! Our plan does not change. Three days later, behead Dong Shenglong and Lie Zhan Hou.\u201dWith a deep voice, Gu Tieshou said: \u201cWe'll do it like that. This is the first battle for our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's revival, and also the beginning our revival.\u201d He was finally determined.The elders and protectors present all hoped to revive the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and regain the glory of their ancestors, especially Gu Tieshou. He grew up in the sect and considered it as his home. The moment he was leading the sect, how could he not hope for it to become more powerful? However, he could only lament his limited aptitude and lack of power to revive the sect.Currently, with Li Qiye's miracle appearance accompanied with the protection of the Patriarch, Gu Tieshou saw a chance for the sect to come back.The second day, the sect announced Cao Xiong's conspiracy with outsiders, the betrayal of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, and also his execution! This news had been released, and the entire Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was in an uproar. The sect disciples couldn't help but spit on Cao Xiong's selfishness. A calamity was befalling the sect, so they should have been working together. Cao Xiong's actions were reviled by the disciples.As for the matter of Li Qiye being the chosen person for the resurgence, the sect did not announce it. Only the elders and protectors had the right to know, even sectional leaders were left unaware.At the same time, the sect the next day sent the news of the public execution of Dong Shenglong and Lie Zhan Hou to all of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom. This time, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect especially chose an unprecedented bold action like never before. At the time of the execution, the sect had invited many sects from the kingdom to attend.Many big sects and heavenly gates were moved by this news in the entire Heavenly Jewel Kingdom.\u201cThe Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect wants to flip the heavens!\u201d Quite a number of sects looked at each other in amazement. Just Dong Shenglong was somewhat acceptable, but who was Lie Zhan Hou? This was a general of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, a generational ferocious man under the Mortal King!Currently, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect wanted to publicly execute both of them, wasn't this the same as completely destroying the face of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom and the Heavenly God Sect!?A sect master curiously asked with a strange expression: \u201cIn the end, what is actually giving the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect such confidence?\u201dFor the last few thousand years, everyone personally witnessed the decline of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, but today, this sect dared to publicly execute these two people \u2013 this was too bold!There were many cultivators who observed the battle that night, and many of them clamored. Some felt that the sect had an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure, and some assumed that Liu San Jian was still alive!\u201cCould it be that this time, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect has an absolute ace? Otherwise, why would they risk a war with the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, and have to execute these two?\u201d\u201cMaybe they went crazy?\u201dSome felt that this was the case and said: \u201cToday, to compare the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect to the Heavenly God Sect is like throwing an egg against a rock. Even if the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect still has an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure, it would still be impossible to rescind the current situation of their decline. In present times, the Heavenly God Sect had countless geniuses and numerous Royal Nobles!\"\u201cThis is the sect seeking its own destruction, ah.\u201d An older sect master lamented. He knew the situation inside and shook his head: \u201cThe Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect has no inheritors. They became blindly arrogant; even with an Immortal Emperor Life Treasure, it is no longer an important matter for the sect. One has to know, the ancestor of the Heavenly God Sect is still alive.\u201dWhen it comes to the ancestor of the Heavenly God Sect, even powerful sect masters and heavenly lords of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom would become silent. After the Difficult Dao Era, characters like the Heavenly God Sect's Ancestor became undefeatable \u2013 this was a giant high above! The moment a character like him takes action, not to mention the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, but even a grand sect or clan would be destroyed by just his fingertip in the blink of an eye!Referring to the ancestor of the Heavenly God Sect, many extremely aged sect masters lost their colors and shivered in fear.\u201cThis ancestor had lived for tens of thousands of years. Unless Mu Shaodi is still alive, otherwise, if he becomes angry, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's existence will become void!\u201d A Royal Noble from the last generation that had seen the monstrous ancestor before gently sighed.The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect publically declared the execution date for Dong Shenglong and Lie Zhan Hou, yet no cultivators or sects dared to become their guests to observe the execution.Even though everyone wanted to know how this storm would end, but they didn't dare to show up for this execution. Of course, this did not deter many grand sects and ancient heritages from observing at a distance.Currently, the Heavenly God Sect was too powerful and controlled an entire gigantic kingdom. Inside the boundary of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, no sects dared to oppose the Heavenly God Sect! Anyone present at this execution would be the same as opposing the Heavenly God Sect, and no one was willing to tease such a giant monster like the Heavenly God Sect.However, watching from afar secretly, the Heavenly God Sect couldn't interfere in this and had no reason to send their troops.So, before the execution date, countless cultivators were watching the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's every move behind the shadows.During these three days, the disciples of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect were both excited and nervous. To the sect, the Heavenly God Sect was too powerful. Today, they had the chance to execute Dong Shenglong and Lie Zhan Hou, this was an event that motivated the disciples' hearts.At the same time, the sect had entered a battle preparation stage. All of the disciples were entering their peak concentrations, ready to enter a battle at any time.Inside the sect, only one person was at ease \u2013 it was Li Qiye. Only Li Qiye was unperturbed like an old god, seemingly as if everything had nothing to do with him.\u201cYou sure are confident!\u201d Seeing Li Qiye's god-like calm demeanor, even Li Shuangyan was perplexed. This matter, even one little mishap would be a declaration of war with the Heavenly God Sect. Even a heaven's proud daughter like herself, regarding such a matter that would pierce the heavens, would have to be cautious. However, Li Qiye didn't even consider this as an issue.\u201cIt's only a small sect, not enough to reach the apex.\u201d[1] I took some liberty with the word bulwark here \u2013 the literal term used here is \u201cprotector sect\u201d, but we already have protectors, and his status is way above them, so I chose the word bulwark instead- sect's sect protector would sound too awkward.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If I don't mind sparing a bit of effort and expending some thought, annihilating the Heavenly God Sect \u2013 this is not a difficult matter.\u201dHearing Li Qiye's words, Li Shuangyan immediately became speechless. Others would definitely think that Li Qiye was ignorantly foolish and boasting to the heavens, but Li Shuangyan didn't think so. She didn't find any signs of Li Qiye joking and boasting.Li Shuangyan couldn't help but exclaim: \u201cI don't understand how you are so confident. Even though the Heavenly God Sect had only created the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom in the past thirty thousand years, you have to know that their ancestor is an extraordinary person! If our Nine Saint Demon Gate was to become an enemy of the Heavenly God Sect, we would still have to be three parts cautious.\u201dLi Qiye glared at Li Shuangyan, and he said: \u201cBecause I am Li Qiye!\u201dBecause I am Li Qiye \u2013 such an ordinary phrase. However, coming from the mouth of Li Qiye with a nonchalant tone, it made others feel a domineering pressure; a grandeur manner that looked down upon the world naturally came to life.Li Shuangyan speechlessly stared at Li Qiye for a long time. This little boy in front of her didn't feel like a little boy! Meticulous planning and a domineering presence, he was more similar to a Mortal Emperor!After a while, Li Shuangyan stared at Li Qiye; she slowly spoke: \u201cSuch grand matters, I need to report to my master.\u201d\u201cAs you wish.\u201d Li Qiye glanced at Li Shuangyan, and he smiled. Without a doubt, he was quite satisfied with Li Shuangyan's attitude.Without a doubt, Li Shuangyan, this heaven's proud daughter, had greatly changed during these past days standing by Li Qiye's side. At the very least, in front of Li Qiye, she had let go of her arrogance as a heaven's proud daughter. Compared to Li Qiye, she couldn't find any aspect where she was superior.Three days had passed in the blink of an eye. Within these last three days, countless gazes from the darkness observed the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. There was no doubt that many great sects within the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom that wanted to personally witness the conclusion of this storm. Within the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, countless powerful characters and many Royal Nobles all hoped to directly receive the news.Since the creation of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom by the Heavenly God Sect, within thirty thousand years, it had swept through the heavens and earth. Within the most recent ten thousand years, there were few people and sects that could challenge the godly authority of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom. In the present day, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect suddenly decided to execute Dong Shenglong and Lie Zhan Hou; where did this confidence come from?Witnessing this scene, the far away cultivators, and even the tyrant of one domain, ruling over an entire sect, couldn't help but lament in silence. Just imagine, Lie Zhan Hou was someone who was known for how arrogant he was and how his rage and ferocity could easily conquer all four directions; he was the very definition of a ferociously violent white stallion. However, today, he was simply a man at death's door.If you win, you become King; if you lose, you become a bandit \u2013 this was all that needed to be said!Prior to the departure, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect became heavily guarded. Every disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect entered a state of combat readiness. All of the sectional leaders and protectors were even more diligent regarding the defensive platforms and entrances of the sect.The five elders of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect left through the gate to personally oversee the execution. In addition to the five elders, Li Qiye was also present with Li Shuangyan following beside him.\u201cWho is that disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect?\u201d Li Qiye seemed to be an ordinary disciple, his name wasn't resounded or well recognized. Now, this seemingly ordinary disciple walking and sitting alongside the five elders \u2013 seeing this scene made many of the cultivators surprised.Many cultivators were speculating, and one of them said in a surprised manner: \u201cThis disciple can actually walk alongside Gu Tieshou and the other elders; could he have an amazing origin within the sect?\u201dAfter they saw Li Shuangyan accompany them, it even resulted in some of the sect leaders being shaken; one emotionally said: \u201cLi Shuangyan, the descendant of the Nine Saint Demon Gate and Princess of Old Ox Country, she's the Grand Middle Territory's heaven's proud daughter, ah! Could it be that the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the Nine Saint Demon Gate are forming an alliance?\u201dLi Shuangyan's appearance at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, and her accompanying Li Qiye and the five elders, visibly moved many of the spectating cultivators.Under the presence of this dignified atmosphere, time slowly passed. Finally, the time of the execution arrived; Gu Tieshou lifted his head to look at the sky and he loudly declared: \u201cExecution!\u201dAt this time, not to mention the disciples of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, even the faraway spectating cultivators all held their breath. Everyone was eagerly anticipating what would happen in the next moment.\u201cPut down the blade!\u201d At this time, a loud roar resounded and it spread thunderously far and wide. A dragon horse, while heavily breathing, trod the hollow sky. The pressure of a Royal Noble suppressed the disciples in front of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's execution ground.As the dragon horse trod across the sky, a figure wearing a violet coat could be seen on top of the horse. Wearing a violet crown, the old man with broad shoulders seemed to be an important person.\u201cZi Shan Hou\u2026\u201d After seeing this old man, the onlooking cultivators changed their expressions.\u201cZi Shan Hou arrived.\u201d Witnessing this old man, a sect leader murmured: \u201cA previous generation Royal Noble, ah! Extremely experienced! Zi Shan Hou's name has been prestigious for generations. He can be considered one of the Royal Nobles at the pinnacle of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom.\u201d\u201cSo it is Zi Shan Hou who graces us with his presence.\u201d Seeing the old man on the dragon horse, Gu Tieshou's pupils were focused and his demeanor became dignified. Although Zi Shan Hou's reputation wasn't as ruthless as Lie Zhan Hou's, his strength was definitely higher! After all, he was a Royal Noble of the previous generation, and he was also at the pinnacle of all Royal Nobles!Zi Shan Hou was still seated on the dragon horse when his voice resounded again: \u201cAncient Elders, don't commit a mistake. Lie Zhan Hou is an important official of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom; you should quickly release him along with Brother Dong, and then follow me to the capital, accepting the emperor's punishment and confess.\u201dAs Gu Tieshou was about to speak; however, Li Qiye waved his hand to stop him and revealed a pleasant smile: \u201cConfess? This word isn't part of my vocabulary! While I still have no intention to kill you, you should get out of my sight immediately, as far as possible!\"\u201cWho is this child? What a bold tone!\u201d After hearing Li Qiye's words, many of the spectating cultivators couldn't help but look at each other. Who was Zi Shan Hou? He was a previous generation Royal Noble, and he was one of the Royal Nobles at the pinnacle to boot! He was an important official of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, yet Li Qiye, a junior, dared to use this kind of arrogant tone.\u201cThis child from some random place, let this seat give you a little lesson in place of your elders!\u201d Zi Shan Hou's gaze became cold. With his grinding big hands, he sent Li Qiye a palm strike!A \u201cZhang\u201d sword sound was heard, and a sword appeared from the blue sky; however, it didn't come from Li Qiye. Instead, Li Shuangyan already made a move. One sword to pillar the sky, decapitating all spirits! Phoenix odes emanated from her body, and her sword had its own spirit. Moves after moves activated; one sword released, and the mountains and rivers lost their colors.\u201cYou are worthy of being the successor of the Nine Saint Demon Gate!\u201d Seeing Li Shuangyan's sword, Zi Shan Hou let out a cold snort. His two hands formed seals, like a giant mountain, suppressing down from above.\u201cGet out of here!\u201d At this point, Gu Tieshou also took action. A Kun Peng traversed the sky, and, when the huge Kun Peng's tail fiercely struck down, it shattered the earth with a ferocious momentum.Witnessing the tail of the Kun Peng coming, Zi Shan Hou's expression darkened. He didn't dare to be reckless; he brought his hands together, and his true energy rose, blocking the tail of Gu Tieshou's Kun Peng.\u201cBang!\u201d Even though Zi Shan Hou was able to block the strike from Gu Tieshou, his dragon horse couldn't handle the pressure. It bellowed as it fell to the ground; it was no longer capable of standing back up.Regarding the fight, Li Qiye didn't pay much attention. He simply shook his head, and then he said: \u201cElder's Six Variants is needlessly complex.\u201dHearing these words, if it was from someone else, then it would sound extremely arrogant. However, after witnessing Li Qiye's Kun Peng's Six Variants, Gu Tieshou definitely did not think the words were arrogant.Gu Tieshou began to speak: \u201cLook at my Six Variants.\u201dHe wanted to let Li Qiye see his Kun Peng's Six Variants in hopes that he could get Li Qiye's guidance to serve as reference material.And so, after Gu Tieshou's words came out, he approached Zi Shan Hou.Zi Shan Hou's face was extremely ugly. As a Royal Noble of the previous generation, today, he was unable to suppress Gu Tieshou. Immortal Emperor Merit Law \u2013 truly frightening!\u201cGu Tieshou, today, I won't bother with you!\u201d Zi Shan Hou continued: \u201cToday, this seat brought his Majesty's Imperial Decree. Regardless of whether or not the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect is willing, you must let the prisoners go. Otherwise, the consequences will ensue!\u201d\u201cThe Mortal King's Imperial Decree!\u201d Gu Tieshou couldn't help but focus his gaze. The Mortal King of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom was someone with extremely high talents and a clever and calculating mind. His cultivation was extremely profound, and he was definitely someone to fear. Due to the Mortal King, the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom was now flourishing with life. It could be said that, due to the ambitious nature of the Mortal King of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, he wanted to succeed in making the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom into a never falling eternal ancient kingdom!At this moment, Zi Shan Hou's hands already brought out the Imperial Decree from the Mortal King. The imperial order only had a single character on it, \u201cAmnesty\u201d. The moment this character appeared, the torrential royal power of the Mortal King could be felt across ten thousand miles. Within this \u201cAmnesty\u201d character, the vast royal pressure of the Mortal King exploded; it was as if the Mortal King was currently present, turning others into loyal subjects.Even though Gu Tieshou was a Royal Noble, when the character \u201cAmnesty\u201d was brought forth, he could feel the immense pressure; his blood started to roll. This \u201cAmnesty\u201d character carried a pressure that was akin to an unclimbable mountain that was placed inside his heart. It was so uncomfortable that it made him want to vomit blood.The Imperial Decree only had a single character \u201cAmnesty\u201d, but this single character was already enough. This single character already represented the will of a Mortal King on his high throne. With this \u201cAmnesty\u201d character alone, it was already enough to suppress a Royal Noble!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

One could only imagine how frightening the Mortal King of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom would be! As for the other people from the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, they couldn't help but take in a deep breath.Zi Shan Hou gravely said: \u201cGu Tieshou, the Imperial Decree of His Majesty is right here; release them right now!\u201d His hand held the Imperial Decree with its compelling momentum, causing others to run short of breath.Gu Tieshou looked at the word \u201cAmnesty\u201d, shook his head, and said: \u201cDong Shenglong and Lie Zhan Hou wanted to destroy my Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Even the Mortal King's Imperial Decree wouldn't do! Execute!\u201dGu Tieshou's words changed Zi Shan Hou's expression greatly as he yelled: \u201cGu Tieshou, don't make this mistake! Defying the Immortal Decree, this would bring about a calamity that would drown your Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!\u201dGu Tieshou ignored him and exclaimed: \u201cExecute!\u201dMeeting Gu Tieshou's strong resolve, Zi Shan Hou shouted with an ugly expression: \u201cWait\u2026\u201d At this moment, he couldn't do anything but make concessions. If he didn't bring back Dong Shenglong and Lie Zhan Hou, then, not only would he be unsuccessful with his mission, the prestige of the Mortal King would also be provoked.At this time, Zi Shan Hou made a concession. He spoke in a serious manner: \u201cGu Tieshou, let me bring Dong Shenglong and Lie Zhan Hou away. The day the Evil Infested Ridge opens, there will be a quota for your Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201dHearing Zi Shan Hou's words, Gu Tieshou couldn't help but pause for a little bit. The Evil Infested Ridge, to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, was truly too important.He couldn't help but look over at Li Qiye. Li Qiye smiled and said: \u201cThe Evil Infested Ridge originally was a territory of our sect; why would we need the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom's reward?! Execute!\u201dLi Qiye's words angered Zi Shan Hou till his body started trembling. He raised the Imperial Decree in his hand, and he shouted: \u201cJunior, you should know the severity of this situation. The Imperial Decree is here! If you were to breach this decree, then all of the sects within the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom will encircle and annihilate your sect!\u201d\u201cIt's just a piece of torn paper, yet you still dare to act powerful and prestigious in front of my presence?!\u201d Li Qiye narrowed his eyes. Finished with his words, his five fingers started to pull on the zither at his chest.\u201cZhang\u2026\u201d The moment the zither's sound came about, from inside the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, a sword energy immediately flew forward. The moment the sword blade swept downward, one could only see the Imperial Decree be crushed and the word \u201cAmnesty\u201d split in half.Everyone held their breaths at this moment. Cutting the Imperial Decree of the Mortal King, this was provoking his authority.When the word \u201cAmnesty\u201d was cut in half, a \u201cDum\u201d sound occurred; just like a golden godly law, the decree combined together again. The word \u201cAmnesty\u201d suddenly radiated a terrible light. In the blink of an eye, a majestic figure appeared from this light. The moment of his inception, his royal pressure was like a tsunami; it was like a flood of pressure was rushing and wailing forward directly to the grand earth.Under the suppression of the royal pressure, even Gu Tieshou had to take several heavy steps back.\u201cThe Mortal King's will\u2026\u201d Seeing the majestic figure emerging from the light, cultivators in the far distance couldn't help but burst into cries.The majestic figure suddenly opened his eyes. It was as if this pair of eyes were real. Soaking in the sun and the moon with a rotating galaxy within them, it caused others to tremblingly prostrate on the ground.\u201cProvoking the royal honor, behead!\u201d The figure had just opened his mouth, and the thunders rang in the air. When the words have not yet come out, his huge hand had already struck down, and the power of the one slash wanted to directly destroy Li Qiye. This slash was extremely matchless; under this slash, even the moon illuminating the sky would fall and sweep across all Royal Nobles.At this moment, Gu Tieshou's colors were shaken. Even Li Shuangyan wanting to save Li Qiye was powerless.\u201cRoll\u2026!\u201d Li Qiye's gaze became serious as he coldly yelled, without making any other action.Under this fiery and thunderous slash, a loud \u201cboom\u201d filled the air. At this second, many Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's disciples couldn't bear to look because they all thought that Li Qiye would suffer a horrible death.However, the moment the slash was about to kill Li Qiye, a gigantic hand from the heavenly sky came about. A huge explosion happened, and this gigantic hand shattered the shadowy figure. The will of the Mortal King bellowed, a strand of universal laws wanted to escape from the gigantic hand. However, this gigantic hand ground it with pressure and immediately crushed it. The figure of the Mortal King became scattered ashes and dispersed like smoke.Everything happened so fast, so no one clearly saw where this giant hand came from.During all of these occurrences, in the martial ground of the far Nine Saint Demon Gate, there was a stone statue raising his stone hand. This one hand stretched across the heaven and earth directly to the end of the sky; no one knew where this hand was going!This stone hand, from the Nine Saint Demon Gate, flying from millions of miles away, easily destroyed the Mortal King's will. Even if the Mortal King's will could suppress Royal Nobles, under this gigantic hand, it was just a meaningless insect.Seeing the stone hand appear then suddenly disappear, Li Shuangyan \u2013 standing next to Li Qiye \u2013 was shocked. Others didn't know what this gigantic hand was, but she knew!A stone hand, trespassing through the world from the Nine Saint Demon Gate, reached out, and it easily destroyed the Mortal King's will \u2013 how frightening was this!Li Shuangyan had heard her master say that the four stone statues were the Heavenly Protectors of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, but she essentially didn't know how powerful these stones statues, dubbed as the Heavenly Protectors, were.Today, she finally found out the terrifying power of the four stone statues. And, she also understood why her master had acquiesced against Li Qiye that day. Demon Kings or Mortal Kings, they were nothing! Under the hand of the four Heavenly Protectors, they would easily be crushed!At this moment, not only the cultivators watching from afar but all of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was in a daze. Zi Shan Hou lost his wits from shock!The Mortal King's will frightened others so, but it was easily destroyed \u2013 who on earth did this?!\u201cOnly a Mortal King? Even a Mortal Emperor still wouldn't reach the apex.\u201d Regarding this event, Li Qiye essentially didn't put it in his mind, and he said this in an incredibly calm manner!At this moment, Li Qiye issued a command: \u201cExecute.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Dong Shenglong and Lie Zhan Hou, at the moment of death, couldn't help but let out a loud cry. They didn't think that today, even the Mortal King wouldn't be able to save them!The disciples of the sect regained their wits, and execution blades were raised, then fallen, beheading Dong Shenglong and Lie Zhan Hou; their heads rolled farther and farther.In the end, the heads of Dong Shenglong and Lie Zhan Hou were neatly placed in wooden boxes by the disciples, and, under the command of Li Qiye, were brought to the front of Zi Shan Hou.Li Qiye simply glanced at Zi Shan Hou as he calmly said: \u201cI'll leave you with one message for you to deliver to the Heavenly God Sect: whoever blocks my path, I kill without mercy!\u201d Since he was finished speaking, he turned around and left!Zi Shan Hou's expression was extremely ugly, but, at this moment, he didn't dare to be reckless. He took the heads of Dong Shenglong and Lie Zhan Hou, and then he left in a hurry!The moment the gigantic hand destroyed the Mortal King's will, in the Imperial City, a stalwart and domineering man suddenly trembled and let out a roar. His two eyes absorbed heavenly flames, and they suddenly opened. He then stood up.The expression of the man was shocked. Standing on the high platform, he was gazing at the far distance; it was as if he was directly looking at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. At this moment, his demeanor became dignified. As the Mortal King, he used to divide and repress his royal subjects; however, today, his heart was in distraught, and his mind was in distress.The man stood there with a pale expression, and he was without words for a long time. To someone with great talents like him, who had swept through the Heavenly Jewel territories, today, his Mortal King's will was easily destroyed without the slightest resistance. To him, this was not only a great shame but also an extremely harmful matter!\u201cInvite the Ancestor\u2026\u201dFinally, the man gravely spoke, and he sent a messenger towards the ancestral ground of the Heavenly God Sect for guidance! To him, this matter was too shocking.A stone hand crossed over the world, and it destroyed the Mortal King's will; inside the Nine Saint Demon Gate, there were disciples reporting to Demon King Lun Ri. Receiving the report, his expression was also shaken.Inside the Nine Saint Demon Gate, Demon King Lun Ri summoned all of the elders. Within the secret room, the atmosphere became heavy.\u201cThe news confirmed that one hand from our stone statue crossed the world, and it destroyed the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom's Mortal King's will!\u201d Even though Demon King Lun Ri didn't show his face, his voice was still ringing in the secret room.The Nine Saint Demon Gate's information gathering was extremely swift; they found out in the shortest amount of time.Such an event caused the elders to gaze at each other. This was not only too sudden, but it was also out of the Nine Saint Demon Gate's control.An elder gravely said: \u201cIt was definitely Li Qiye activating the Heavenly Protectors.\u201d This was something that couldn't be questioned; it was described vividly.Even the entire Nine Saint Demon Gate didn't have anyone who could activate the four Heavenly Protectors; only Li Qiye could do it! Besides Li Qiye, who else could it be?The moment of silence was broken by an elder: \u201cOur Nine Saint Demon Gate and the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect are separated by millions of miles, and we're not inside the same country. This one hand of the Heavenly Protectors was able to cross the heaven and earth and easily destroyed the Mortal King's will!\u201dHere, the elder paused for a moment and continued: \u201cExactly how powerful are they?\u201dRegarding this matter, the elder's hearts quaked, and they stared at each other. This was a test for them. From the past till now, the Nine Saint Demon Gate had never heard of their Heavenly Protectors making a move. In reality, before Li Qiye came, the elders didn't even know about the existences of the Heavenly Protectors.Flying across the world and destroying the Mortal King's will \u2014 this was an unbelievably sky shattering matter!\u201cIt is time for us to take action.\u201d The moment the elders were in quiet contemplation, the voice of Demon King Lun Ri slowly appeared: \u201cThe conflict between the Heavenly God Sect and the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect needs to be reconciled.\u201dHearing the Demon King's words, the elders were surprised; one of them couldn't help but say: \u201cYour Majesty, the Heavenly God Sect and the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect are mortal enemies. The Heavenly God Sect's will to destroy the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect has never ended. If we interfere, I'm afraid we would become enemies with the Heavenly God Sect.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They only established their sovereignty for thirty thousand years, yet they dared to call themselves a Kingdom? Wait until they actually have the strength of a Kingdom, and then we'll talk.\u201dWhether it is the Grand Middle Territory or the Mortal Emperor world, there are standards for sovereignty. Frontier small nations were not enough to join the standards, and they were not enough to reach the apex. The real powers have three different names, Country, Kingdom, and Ancient Kingdom.So to speak, an Ancient Kingdom has the strongest power, Kingdom was second, and Country was last. As for smaller nations, they were not included.There are also standards for these names. If it wasn't of an Immortal Emperor lineage, then it would be a Country. An Immortal Emperor lineage forming a nation would be called a Kingdom, and, if it had two Immortal Emperors, then it would be called an Ancient Kingdom.In addition to having two Immortal Emperors, there were a few ancient nations that could have been called Ancient Kingdom. These nations must have been created long ago, and they had extremely great influence.For an example, when the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect created their nation, it was called the Cleansing Incense Ancient Kingdom because their nation was founded during the beginning years of the Emperor Era; Immortal Emperor Min Ren was also the first Immortal Emperor of this era. The Cleansing Incense Ancient Kingdom made it through a whole era, so, even when it couldn't have a second Immortal Emperor, it was still called an Ancient Kingdom by others.In fact, the Nine Saint Demon Gate's nation was also extremely ancient, but their influence that year was much less than the old Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; this is the reason they only proclaimed themselves as a Country.As for the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, according to the standards, they don't have the qualification to be called a Kingdom; at most, they are a Country. However, they relied on the Heavenly God Sect's ancestor still being alive, and he was self-proclaimed to be invincible; thus, they considered themselves a Kingdom.Of course, many people feared the ancestor of the Heavenly God Sect, so they didn't dare to criticize them.Demon King Lun Ri's words shook the spirits of the elders. They glanced at each other before one of them began to ponder. He then said: \u201cYour Majesty, in terms of strength, our Old Ox Country is no weaker than the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, but the ancestor of the Heavenly God Sect is truly dreadful.\u201dBringing up the Heavenly God Sect's ancestor struck fear into the hearts of the elders currently present! The Heavenly God Sect's ancestor was truly too heaven defying. Not mentioning just the Grand Middle Territory, even gazing through the whole Mortal Emperor world, the ancestor was still a character that others were wary of.\u201cIf Mu Shaodi from that year was still here, it wouldn't be the Heavenly God Sect's turn to dominate the Grand Middle Territory.\u201d Mentioning Mu Shaodi fifty thousand years later would still put listeners in awe. Mu Shaodi was the key character for the revitalization of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Many considered him to be the second Immortal Emperor of the sect after Immortal Emperor Min Ren.Mu Shaodi was heaven defyingly invincible. The moment Immortal Emperor Ta Kong was without the Heaven's Will, Mu Shaodi would be the strongest rival of Ta Kong. Rumors had it that when they were young and competing for the vacant Heaven's Will, they were at three wins and three defeats each. This record was such a brilliant glory!\u201cAccording to reliable sources, the Heavenly God Sect's ancestor is still alive. Even though he had not appeared for thirty thousand years, he is definitely alive in this world.\u201d Another elder couldn't help but say: \u201cIf the Heavenly God Sect's ancestor comes into being, I'm afraid our Nine Saint Demon Gate would have a difficult time opposing him, ah.\u201dRegarding the ancestor of the Heavenly God Sect, no matter who they were, three parts caution had to be given. So, regarding this matter, the expressions of the elders of the Nine Saint Demon Gate became solemn.\u201cThe Heavenly God Sect's ancestor\u2026\u201d Demon King Lun Ri slowly spoke: \u201cThe Difficult Dao Era had passed, and a new era is coming. The Heavenly God Sect's ancestor's evening is already swiftly approaching. In the future, this world belongs to the young people.\u201dThe Difficult Dao Era was only the last thirty thousand years. Fifty thousand years ago, Immortal Emperor Ta Kong carried the Heaven's Will, and he became an Immortal Emperor to rule over the universe. However, for unknown reasons, thirty thousand years ago the Black Dragon King suddenly became torrentially angry, and he extorted the Heaven's Will.It was heard that the Black Dragon King, in this war against Immortal Emperor Ta Kong, fought one battle and tore apart the sky's curtain. Rumor has it that after this battle, in the end, the Heaven's Will was torn apart. Afterward, because of this, the world's energy was depleted, and the cultivators had a hard time practicing the Dao. This was why this era was called the Difficult Dao Era since this era had entirely tortured cultivators of the Nine Worlds for thirty thousand years. It was only ten years ago, when the Difficult Dao Era had come to pass, that the world's energy began to recover.At this moment, Lun Ri paused, and then he said: \u201cI greatly value Li Qiye. His future potential is second to none.\u201dHearing Lun Ri's words, the elders couldn't help but glance at each other. An elder did not completely agree: \u201cYour Majesty, even though Li Qiye is a bit demonic, he is only of Mortal Physique, Mortal Life Wheel, and Mortal Fate Palace. With this innate talent, it is difficult to achieve anything in the end.\u201dAn elder couldn't help but exclaim: \u201cThat is correct. Your Majesty, with regards to physiques and life wheels, Shuangyan is countless times stronger than him.\u201dIn reality, Li Shuangyan's mission to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was not agreed upon by all of the elders. However, Demon King Lun Ri overturned the opposition in the end, and he pushed for Li Shuangyan to go to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.Lun Ri slowly said: \u201cI did not misjudge his character.\u201dThe elders contemplated upon Lun Ri's words. Lun Ri, at the Nine Saint Demon Gate, had an extremely high status! Normally, the elders would not refute the opinion of His Majesty.An elder who was still worried asked: \u201cWhat if the ancestor of the Heavenly God Sect comes into being?\u201d\u201cThe Heavenly God Sect has its ancestor, but we have the four Heavenly Guardians! With the support of Li Qiye, we will have the support of the four Heavenly Guardians!\u201d Demon King Lun Ri deepened his tone: \u201cWe will just have to see whether the ancestor of the Heavenly God Sect is powerful; or if our Heavenly Guardians are invincible! Our Progenitor was a generation's peerless demon. He left behind the four stone statues to be our Heavenly Guardians; this is enough to indicate their sufficient strength.\u201dEven until now, no one knew how powerful the four Heavenly Guardians were; this was a complete mystery!The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect emphatically executed Dong Shenglong and Lie Zhan Hou, and this matter was spread like a storm throughout all of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom! This was a sudden shock to all cultivators and sects inside the Kingdom.Especially the part where the Mortal King's will was destroyed, this made the sect masters hearts continuously quake.Wary of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom's strength, everyone didn't discuss it publicly; however, there were many secretly discussing and dissenting.\u201cCould it be that Liu San Jian was truly alive?!\u201d Many older sect masters that knew the inside information couldn't help but mumble: \u201cThese thirty thousand years ago, Mortal Kings from the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect could be counted on one's fingers. Outside of Liu San Jian, who else could be so heaven-defying?\u201dRemembering the gigantic hand that easily destroyed the Mortal King's will caused many people's hearts to sink. The power of this gigantic hand was absolutely far above a Mortal King.A cultivator excitedly asked: \u201cThis is the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect flipping the sky. They dared to even destroy the Mortal King's will; is this a war declaration against the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom?\u201dA few big characters thoughtfully said: \u201cIt could be that the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was laying low, quietly, for thirty thousand years. They must want to wash the shame that year away and rebuild their Ancient Kingdom.\u201d\u201cEven though it is unknown about who made the move behind the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, them wanting to rebuild their Ancient Kingdom, I'm afraid is without hope. Even protecting their nest would not be easy.\u201d Someone from the previous generation that had witnessed the battle thirty thousand years ago shook his head: \u201cThat year that Liu San Jian was still alive, they still weren't able to hold their Ancient Kingdom, and they had to run back to their nest in the end! The Heavenly God Sect's ancestor is still alive! It doesn't matter if Liu San Jian is still alive. They no longer have the chance to beat the Heavenly God Sect and rebuild their Ancient Kingdom.\u201dSuddenly, there were all kinds of discussions. Some were on the sidelines waiting for the results while some were sharpening their blades. Even though the breaking of the status quo of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom could be a calamity to some cultivators and sects, to the bigger sects, this was an opportunity to rise and fish in troubled waters.Destroying the Mortal King's will \u2013 the entire Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was boiling in excitement. Before, the sect didn't dare to compete with the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, but, today, even the Mortal King's will was destroyed; this caused the disciples of the sect to have their blood boil, allowing them to see a hope for revival.The disciples weren't the only ones who were shocked by reality. Even the protectors and the five elders were ecstatic. This was a matter that they couldn't ever imagine.Within the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, Gu Tieshou was the strongest. He could be considered the number one of the sect, but the one word \u201cAmnesty\u201d of the Mortal King was enough to suppress him! However, not even mentioning the word \u201cAmnesty\u201d, even the will of the Mortal King was destroyed! In the midst of everything, the five elders placed extremely high expectations towards Li Qiye!Returning to the sect, all five elders were present; Li Qiye was also in the party. Today, Li Qiye was entirely on equal footing with the five elders, and they all considered him as the sect's revitalization leader!\u201cWe don't need to be excited.\u201d In the party, Li Qiye said: \u201cAfter all, our sect is still very weak and without any means. Regarding strength, we are not enough to compete against the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom and the Heavenly God Sect.\u201dLi Qiye's words were the truth regarding the situation of the sect, the five elders did not object. After the initial excitement, their hearts were heavy because outside of Li Qiye, their ace card, they didn't have any other secret cards.Li Qiye said: \u201cIn terms of internal and secret foundation, we are stronger than the Heavenly God Sect. Even though our Emperor merit laws are limited at the moment, it cannot be denied that we have a large amount of Virtuous Paragon merit laws and Heavenly King methods\u2026 In the end, we don't need to worry about not having merit laws; it is only unfortunate that we don't have the inheritors.\u201dEven though the sect had lost the majority of their Emperor merit laws, in the end, they were still of Immortal Emperor lineage; they had a great number of Virtuous Paragons and Heavenly Kings, so they had many merit laws from them. In reality, the sect having these merit laws still made countless cultivators and sects drool from greed.\u201cWe are short of good masters.\u201d In the end, Gu Tieshou bitterly smiled and said: \u201cI'm going to speak without being afraid of jeers. In reality, our brother's cultivations were essentially self-learned. We crawled back and forth trying to practice them.\u201d[1] There are special Chinese words that don't translate as well literally, 'comes into being' is one of them. It just means that he will show himself publically in this world and take action \u2013 not that he is being born.[2] Evening is swiftly approaching means that his time is running out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even though thirty thousand years had passed, we were still unable to recover.\u201dThe other elders were softly sighing as well. The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's decline was a foregone conclusion after that battle.For that battle, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect could be said to have exerted their entire strength in order to protect the Cleansing Incense Ancient Kingdom. After the fight, from grand elders to the ordinary disciples, eight or nine parts died in that battle. In the end, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was forced to return to their sect's ground.Before the battle, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had countless masters and many Virtuous Paragons, but only one part survived the battle.Even though there were a few powerful grand elders, elders, and protectors surviving, they were only extending their last breaths. The fight that year was too tragic! Even the surviving grand elders were gravely wounded, and they could only rely on Fate Pills and Life Medicines to prolong their lives. After they came back, they immediately went into isolated cultivation; they had no way of coming into being again.That moment, these surviving grand elders and elders, with the exception of the sect facing extinction, would not come into being again because their personal situations were not very optimistic!In reality, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect not only lost the majority of their disciples, but they also emptied a large amount of treasures and spirit medicines of the sect.During that battle to protect the Ancient Kingdom, the sect threw out many Life Treasures, immortal items, and they even wasted many physique pastes, Life Medicines, and Fate Pills. During the actual battle, countless disciples applied these medicines because, facing a grim overarching situation, they threw away caution to retaliate against the Heavenly God Sect.They emptied the sect's treasure vault, and they could now only present a few treasures and spirit medicines. The was essentially the same as not having any \u2014 extremely hard to watch.The talented disciples within the sect all died on the battlefield that year as well. This brought about the loss of the Emperor merit laws of the sect. Even with their large quantities of Virtuous Paragon and Heavenly King merit laws; unfortunately, their future disciples could only rely on themselves. Many of them went on the wrong Dao path, or a long winded path, and, without the support of Life Treasures and Spirit Medicines, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect became worse and worse as the days passed.At the same time, the Heavenly God Sect established the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom. The recruitment for disciples at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect became even more difficult. Any disciple with some modicum of innate aptitude didn't want to join the sect.Hearing the elders recalling the situation, Li Qiye could understand that it was not easy for the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect to survive that year, let alone rise up again!\u201cIf our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect wants to rise, we must let go. For the younger generation, after passing the examination with promising potential, let them cultivate Virtuous Paragon and Heavenly King merit laws. If we want to overcome this ordeal, we must groom a new generation of disciples. Even though Virtuous Paragon and Heavenly King merit laws are wondrous, we still have to let go. It would be sufficient to only hold Emperor merit laws in our hands.\u201d In the end, Li Qiye came up with this proposal.After the decline, because they lost their Emperor merit laws, the only complete Emperor merit law was the Kun Peng's Six Variants; thus, they were extremely strict with Virtuous Paragon and Heavenly King merit laws. Under normal circumstances, the ordinary disciples, without one hundred, no, several hundred years of examination, would not be taught these laws!However, to the disciples, they missed out on the best cultivation period, and, without wise masters to teach them, their cultivation was dragged even slower!The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was without an alternative course of action. The lack of Emperor merit laws made it so these Virtuous Paragon and Heavenly King merit laws were the most prized internal secrets of the sect. If they were revealed to the outside, then it would be an even greater blow to the sect.\u201cEmperor merit laws, we will get them back again.\u201dLi Qiye's words managed to persuade the five elders.Regarding Li Qiye's suggestion, the five elders ultimately unanimously agreed. Currently, the sect's only road was to rise up. Without rising up, then being destroyed by the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom and Heavenly God Sect was only a matter of time.Wanting to rise up meant great changes. Otherwise, with the current conservative rules, saying they want to rise would only be empty words.The moment the sect decided to reform themselves, at the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, a piece of news was spread. Old Ox Country, the Nine Saint Demon Gate went on an expedition to meet the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom! The Nine Saint Demon Gate's Demon King Lun Ri personally met with the Mortal King.This news brought about many large waves of commotion. Not long before this, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had just executed Dong Shenglong and Lie Zhen Hou as well as destroying the Mortal King's will. At this moment, the descendant and princess of Old Ox Country were present. Now Demon King Lun Ri was visiting the Mortal King? This was too much of a coincidence, ah!No one knew the content of the two king's meeting, but, after Demon King Lun Ri's departure, the royal city of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom released news that the conflict of Lie Zhen Hou and Dong Shenglong with the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was only a personal matter.The Heavenly God Sect did not use an official method to announce this news; they instead used a secret channel, and it was still enough to say everything clearly.Hearing this rumor, many of the sects within the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom couldn't help but glance at each other. They realized that the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had successfully joined with the Nine Saint Demon Gate.At this moment, many people understood why the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect dared to provoke the Heavenly God Sect; it was because they had the backing of the Nine Saint Demon Gate! Otherwise, with the declining state of their sect, where would they find the power to challenge the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom?\u201cThe Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and the Nine Saint Demon Gate collaborating; I'm afraid they would still not flip the waves or winds.\u201d A sect master couldn't help but say: \u201cImagine that year; the Progenitor of the Nine Saint Demon Gate was the number one personal general of Immortal Emperor Min Ren, ah! The Nine Saint Demon Gate used to be under the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Even though the Nine Saint Demon Gate is powerful now and the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect is declining, these two still worked together for hundreds of thousands of years.\u201d\u201cWater in the distance cannot extinguish the close fire.\u201d Someone else also said: \u201cEven if they work together, the Nine Saint Demon Gate is too far from the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. With how weak they are, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect will be destroyed sooner or later.\u201dThis news set out many waves in the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom. The majority of sects were loudly clamoring with others regarding the new development.As one of the main characters, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, led by Li Qiye, was unconcerned about the news.In reality, in the beginning, when the five elders heard this message, they were quite surprised. The Nine Saint Demon Gate supporting them \u2014 this was completely outside of their expectations. However, seeing Li Qiye's calm demeanor, they understood that the support of the Nine Saint Demon Gate was not for them; it was for Li Qiye.Inside the sect, Li Qiye, with the support of the five elders, began to aggressively reform the sect. He began by giving merit laws to new disciples. After examinations, the disciples with talents were given Virtuous Paragon and Heavenly King merit laws regardless of whether it was a Life law, Fate merit, or Physique technique\u2026In order to groom a group of disciples with potential, Li Qiye could be said to personally wield the blade as he selected his disciples. The distribution of the merit laws were all planned by him. His actions were to create a new central power for the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, and this new group of central power would be the future hope of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.He divided this central power into four parts. The second generation, including sectional leaders and protectors, were led by Protector Mo. Li Qiye chose Protector Mo because he was a loyal follower. He also valued Protector Mo's calm and steady cultivation. The third generation that had been formally accepted into the sect would be led by Qu Daoli. Qu Daoli was initially a disciple in the Scripture Library, but Li Qiye especially singled him out.Li Qiye had his own reasons for choosing Qu Daoli. Qu Daoli had some fame and respect within the third generation disciples. Moreover, his talents were not bad. However, the most important thing was that Qu Daoli was prudent; as long as he could be refined and groomed, he would definitely become a grand character.As for another part, it was the three hundred disciples of the Cleansing Jade Peak. This was a group personally groomed by Li Qiye. They were demonically trained under him, and this group would be led by Xu Pei.Finally, the last part was the disciples who have not formally joined the sect. They would become the reserve force, and they were also the hope of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect in the future.Initially, Li Qiye wanted Nan Huairen to lead these reserve disciples, but this brat was too smart. He willingly chose to stay by Li Qiye's side to be a personal servant, and he even quit his envoy position.If it was anyone else, they would not make the same choice. One has to know that leading a few thousand disciples that have not formally joined the sect would be akin to having the same power comparable to a protector. Plus, Nan Huairen was a disciple with the qualifications to learn the Violet Yang Ten Sun Merit Law. If he could wait a few more years and practice hard, he could even become the youngest protector of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!However, Nan Huairen didn't choose such an option. He resigned from all positions and chose to stay by Li Qiye as a servant without any status! This decision might seem idiotic, but in fact, it was the most intelligent choice!Li Qiye personally taught the Dao to the disciples with potential and strong willpower. Under the influence of Li Qiye's aggressive reformation, sectional leaders, protectors, and even the elders of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect were all practicing their cultivations even more.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the end, all five elders came to Li Qiye's door to ask him to lecture them.At this moment, all five elders were extremely convinced by Li Qiye. From their perspectives, Li Qiye was taught by the Patriarch, so he knew the ultimate profound truths of the methods inside the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.Li Qiye said to the five elders: \u201cElders have been cultivating for more than a thousand years, and your Dao foundations are fortified. Unless you destroy and redo your cultivation from the start, to greatly soar forward would be impossible. At the moment, you can only fix the defects and maximize and optimize the Dao foundation with minor changes in your cultivation. However, as long as you all remain persistent, then, in the future, there is still hope to break through the Ancient Saint realm.\u201dThe five elders had cultivated for too long, and their Dao foundations were incomplete with defects. This was a forgone conclusion; unless the Dao foundation was destroyed, to make a big change was impossible. Li Qiye could only make minor adjustments for them!Nevertheless, the elders were still very excited. They were self-aware that they had no chance of becoming Enlightened Beings, let alone Ancient Saints. At this moment, Li Qiye gave them hope and greatly motivated them.Gu Tieshou's group attributed Li Qiye's knowledge to the Patriarch teaching him the Dao in his dream, so he inherited the peerless profound truths of Immortal Emperor Min Ren.However, they didn't know that Immortal Emperor Min Ren was brought onto the road of cultivation by Li Qiye. After the flow of ten thousand ages, Li Qiye cultivated countless grand characters; he was naturally an unparalleled wise master.Another thing that stirred the spirits of the elders was that Li Qiye, from his dream, found another incomplete merit law named the \u201cNine Cauldron Life Method\u201d. The even more exciting news was that, after Li Qiye meditated the Daylight Sky Merit Law, he was able to find the Heaven's Will Secret Law, \u201cDaytime Sky Immortal Secret\u201d, of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!This caused the shocked elders to go for a long time without sleep. Heaven's Will Secret Law, ah! This would absolutely cause countless cultivators and sects to become crazy!However, the \u201cNine Cauldron Life Method\u201d and \u201cDaytime Sky Immortal Secret\u201d have become the top secrets of the sect. Besides the five elders, only Li Qiye knew about them.The moment Li Qiye's Dao instruction sent the sect onto the proper track, it was time for him to personally cultivate. However, First Elder Gu Tieshou came to his door and brought him to the triangular old building to see one thing.Li Qiye followed Gu Tieshou to the old building. Inside the treasury holding treasures and spirit medicines. They went to a corner where Gu Tieshou said: \u201cAfter what you said the last time, I especially ordered some disciples to rearrange the Scripture Library, the Weapon Armory, and the Treasure House. Afterward, some disciples found this item, but we couldn't see its purposes. It is also extremely heavy.\u201dAn ancient tablet was placed in the corner, it was pitch black without any light. The top was etched with clear engravings, they were complex to the point of being burdensome. This ancient tablet had experienced an unknown amount of years and was filled with holes on top. This was not due to the erosion of time but rather sword markings.Li Qiye, during his millions of years, had seen many treasures, but when he meticulously looked at this ancient tablet, his expression changed. This type of item, he had seen it once. Even though it was not the same ancient tablet in front of him, the item he saw was an item with a similar origin.Finally, Li Qiye asked Gu Tieshou: \u201cWhere did this come from?\u201d\u201cIt is not clear.\u201d Gu Tieshou shook his head, and he said: \u201cI was under the impression that this ancient tablet had always been in this place. As for its exact origin, I am not certain.\u201dIn the end, Li Qiye spoke: \u201cI want this thing.\u201d The origin of this ancient tablet was not ordinary, and he wanted to examine it through.Regarding Li Qiye's request, Gu Tieshou immediately agreed. At the moment, Li Qiye was akin to the sect master of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Even if the sect master, Su Yonghuang, came back, she most likely wouldn't have the same authority as Li Qiye.The moment they left the Treasure House, Gu Tieshou asked Li Qiye: \u201cThe sealed floors, is there no chance of opening them?\u201dToday, to Li Qiye, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect didn't have any secrets. Even the sixth floor of the Scripture Library was allowed for him to enter by the five elders. Gu Tieshou personally brought him to see the three sealed floors at the top as well.\u201cHard to say.\u201d Li Qiye looked at the seal of the triangular ancient building; he only smiled and shook his head: \u201cThis is not important; there might be nothing in there. There is a chance that it was just an immortal sage sealing it to inspire future generations.\u201dGu Tieshou couldn't help but to ask: \u201cCould you elaborate?\u201dLi Qiye smilingly answered: \u201cIn order to open the seal, I'm afraid it only needs a Virtuous Paragon to make a move. Think about it, the last three floors are rumored to have Immortal Emperor Life Treasures and Immortal Emperor items. The generational disciples of the sect desperately desired them, and even the protectors and elders would be eager to become Virtuous Paragons to obtain the Immortal Emperor treasures! Thirty thousand years ago, the loss in that battle was too frightening. If there really were any treasures left, I'm afraid it would have all been used during that battle; why the need to seal them?\u201dHearing Li Qiye's words, Gu Tieshou felt it made sense. Thinking about it, if there were any spirit medicines or immortal treasures, it would have been used during the urgency of that battle. Nothing was more important than protecting the Cleansing Incense Ancient Kingdom.The elders of many generations, in the last thirty thousand years, had looked forward to the Immortal Emperor treasury, but they didn't expect this. Thinking about it again, Gu Tieshou himself couldn't help but laugh, and he couldn't help but lament.Coming back to Lonely Peak, Li Shuangyan brought a piece of news to Li Qiye: \u201cThe Alchemy Caster, Grandpa Sheng, of our sect has arrived. When can we start the Physique Paste's refinement?\u201dLi Shuangyan's sudden mention of this matter reminded Li Qiye. Recently, he had been too occupied with the reformation of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. He patted his head and said: \u201cThis trivial matter, I almost forgot about it.\u201dHere, Li Qiye ordered Li Shuangyan: \u201cInform Elder Gu: tell him to carefully prepare the medicinal materials. In three days, I will prepare the cauldron, and we will start the Physique Paste refinement.\u201dLi Shuangyan didn't raise a hint of demur, and she immediately followed the order. She, this heaven's proud daughter and princess of a country, revealed her docileness and gentleness.Three days later, on Lonely Peak, Elder Gu had prepared all of the required medicinal herbs for Li Qiye, and Grandpa Sheng from the Nine Saint Demon Gate was also prepared to refine the Physique Paste.For this matter of refinement, Elder Sun himself came to observe. As an Alchemy Master, it was a taboo to let others observe, however, Grandpa Sheng unexpectedly agreed.Grandpa Sheng, in the Nine Saint Demon Gate, was not only an elder, but he was also the most powerful Alchemy Master. This time, Demon King Lun Ri sent him here for the refinement of Li Qiye's Physique Paste; it was enough to show his high respect for Li Qiye.Seeing Grandpa Sheng, Li Qiye didn't hold back and asked: \u201cHow many times can Grandpa Sheng refine?\u201dGrandpa Sheng looked like a messy old man, but Elder Sun was very respectful towards him, even to the point of fearing him. One has to know that the elders of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had no qualifications to meet an elder from the Nine Saint Demon Gate, let alone their most powerful Alchemy Master.Elder Sun understood that Grandpa Sheng coming was all because of Li Qiye's face.\u201cEight refinements.\u201d Grandpa Sheng was not a man of many words, so he was very direct.\u201cGrandpa Sheng is indeed the number one Alchemy Master of the Nine Saint Demon Gate, I can't believe you can refine it eight times.\u201d Hearing Grandpa Sheng, Elder Sun shockingly exclaimed: \u201cThis junior can do five stable refinements, but six refinements are absolutely not guaranteed.\u201dPhysique Pastes and Life Medicines could all be refined nine times. The higher the number of refinements, the better the essence!Grandpa Sheng stared at Elder Sun and said: \u201cThe true test of an Alchemy Master is neither on Physique Pastes nor Life Medicines, it is on Fate Pills! A Fate Pill is the true essential test of an Alchemy Master.\u201d\u201cThis is true.\u201d Elder Sun readily acknowledged these words: \u201cIf the Fate Pill's creation is unsuccessful, it would be a damaged pill. However, an incomplete pill was a small matter. If the cauldron was broken as well, then it would be a huge disaster. When I refine a Fate Pill, I can do three transformations, four transformations would definitely result in a damaged pill.\u201dPhysique Pastes and Life Medicines have nine refinements while Fate Pills have nine transformations. The Fate Pill was completely different from the Physique Paste and Life Medicine. If the Alchemy Master's skill was lacking, the Physique Paste and Life Medicine created by him would still be usable and only their effects would be greatly reduced.However, the Fate Pill was different. If the Alchemy Master's power was insufficient and there was a mistake, the cauldron containing the Fate Pill would be destroyed. In the worst case, even the Heavenly Cauldron would be destroyed as well.This was why there was a saying between all of the Alchemy Masters: that the true test for an Alchemy Master was the creation of the Fate Pills.This was why, under the sect's circumstance of not having an appropriate Alchemy Master, Elder Sun could still refine five times with ease. Even though the beast marrow was lacking in years, he could still take the responsibility to be Li Qiye's Alchemy Master.Even if his power was insufficient, and he couldn't make up for the lack of years in the beast marrow; the Physique Paste would not be incomplete, and the cauldron would not be destroyed. Only the quality of the Physique Paste would be greatly reduced.\u201cEight refinements, this is enough to make up for the lack of years in the beast marrow of the Hell Iron Bull. Let us get started.\u201d Regarding the ability of Grandpa Sheng, Li Qiye recognized it.To someone like him that was cultivating an Immortal Physique method, the best choice would be an Immortal Physique Paste along with an Alchemy Master that could do nine refinements. However, under the current circumstances of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, he didn't have a choice.One could even say that with the sect's current situation, this was already the best possible condition.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Emperor\u2019s DominationEmperor's Domination Chapter 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cOpen\u2026!\u201d Grandpa Sheng yelled and summoned his Heavenly Cauldron. Suddenly, a huge cauldron stood in front of Li Qiye and the others.This giant cauldron was definitely large. It was as tall as two people, and it was double the size of a large water container. This cauldron had the shape of an Auspicious Beast, and the mouth of the cauldron was like the wide sea, seemingly able to swallow the three rivers.During its emergence, strands of medicinal fragrances exuded from the body like a lingering blue smoke. This fragrance, like musk and cassia, was enough to let people know that the medicinal treasure inside this cauldron was absolutely first class.\u201cYou fed it Eight Jewel Grass, Six Daisies Leaf, Violet Coral Branch\u2026\u201d Li Qiye smelled the aroma. He listed the medicinal plants one by one then looked at Grandpa Sheng to say: \u201cIt seems like Grandpa Sheng is well versed in tempering ointments.\u201dThere was an orthodox saying between Alchemy Masters: Boil Physique Paste, process Life Medicine, refine Fate Pill, and as for ointments, tempering was the main method.For Physique Pastes, the main method was boiling; Life Medicines used processing as the key; a Fate Pill's creation was from refinement; ointments came from tempering!There were established systems for the creation of the Physique Pastes, Life Medicines, and Fate Pills. Only ointments didn't have a clear system for the Alchemy Masters.Grandpa Sheng was surprised, and he stared at Li Qiye. Having only smelt the fragrances, yet he immediately knew the medicinal plants that were used to feed the Heavenly Cauldron and he also knew that he specialized in Golden Power medicines\u2026 This could be considered an Alchemy Ancestor with a perfect understanding of medicinal plants!Grandpa Sheng astonishingly looked at Li Qiye, and he asked: \u201cYou cultivate the Dao of alchemy?\u201dLi Qiye shook his head. With a smile, he replied: \u201cThe Dao of alchemy, it is just a hobby of mine.\u201dFinished speaking, he looked towards the cauldron of Grandpa Sheng and said: \u201cThe Origin Flame has a Yin property, but inside the softness, there is also firmness. This cauldron of yours was a natural Origin Yin Flame type; however, you threw in Eight Jewel Grass that has firmness inside the softness. Coincidentally, this type of Origin Flame is the most suitable for boiling the beast marrow of a Hell Iron Bull.\u201dHere, he glanced at Li Shuangyan standing beside him.Without a doubt, Li Shuangyan had reported his exact situation to the Nine Saint Demon Gate.Li Qiye's continuous words frightened Grandpa Sheng. Understanding the essence of medicine and discerning the Heavenly Cauldron like this, this would require hundreds or thousands of years to have some minor achievement. Even more than one thousand years of studying wouldn't necessarily have such an achievement!\u201cYou truly didn't cultivate the Dao of alchemy?\u201d Grandpa Sheng was in sudden amazement, and only Elder Sun and Li Shuangyan were calm. They were accustomed to Li Qiye's unfathomable abilities.Li Qiye nonchalantly answered: \u201cIt is only a minor hobby; I've read a few medicine scrolls.\u201dGrandpa Sheng became silent. Only reading a few medicine scrolls, to immediately master the essence of alchemy and Heavenly Cauldrons, other Alchemy Masters might as well hang themselves and commit suicide. This matter was essentially impossible; even a genius wouldn't have the ability to read a few scrolls and understand everything. This required the accumulation of knowledge through time!However, this boy in front of him was only fourteen years old; where would he find the time to accumulate all of the knowledge?Grandpa Sheng naturally was unaware that the current system of alchemy originated from Li Qiye and the Alchemy God that year. If he didn't understand the essence of alchemy, then who in this world would?\u201cBegin.\u201dGrandpa Sheng was confused in a daze while Li Qiye was calm in his thoughts. This matter, to him, was not enough to reach the apex.Grandpa Sheng placed his palm on the Heavenly Cauldron, and nodded his head: \u201cBeginning.\u201dHis words had just come out when the bottom of the cauldron emitted waves and waves of flames. They were not overly powerful, but they were not faint either. These waves of flames interlaced with each other, becoming a furnace; it was as if it could refine all existences.Grandpa Sheng gravely yelled: \u201cThe corpse of Nine Longevity Tortoise, the spine of Windling Serpent, the tail of Blood Tiger, the brain of Fire Scorpion, the eyes of Fat Ghost\u2026\u201dElder Sun willingly stood by the side as an assistant. Hearing the voice of Grandpa Sheng, he immediately opened the treasure chest, and he threw in the medicinal materials, in order, one by one, into the Heavenly Cauldron; he also yelled: \u201cThe corpse of Nine Longevity Tortoise, one hundred and twenty thousand years; the spine of Windling Serpent, one hundred and ten thousand years; the tail of Blood Tiger, one hundred and ten thousand years\u2026\u201dFinally, all of the supporting medicine materials were put into the Origin Flame of the Heavenly Cauldron. At this moment, Grandpa Sheng activated the Origin Flame. The Origin Yin Flame, with firmness inside the softness, became increasingly stronger; all of the materials were melted into a medicinal liquid, and it began to boil!At this moment, the fire furnace within the Heavenly Cauldron began to emit a special fragrance; a stench without the stench, a sweet smell without the sweetness. Neither smelly nor sweet, this aroma was very unique.At this point, Grandpa Sheng loudly yelled: \u201cDrop in the beast marrow!\u201dHearing these words, Elder Sun cautiously took out a treasure box, and he opened it. Inside was an item three feet long like a bone; this was the primary medicinal bone marrow for the Physique Paste.Elder Sun threw the beast marrow into the medicinal concoction. In the beginning, the beast marrow seemed very ordinary, but, once the outside shell of the bones was melted away, the essence of blood finally started flowing out.\u201cMooo\u2026\u201d At this moment, the roar of a bull rang inside. An Iron Bull the size of a fist appeared, surrounded by a Yin aura that wouldn't dissipate. It let out a long roar and started to crazily stampede, with its feet emitting continuous thunders; it was as if it wanted to shake the Heavenly Cauldron.The beast marrow was the most important part of the spine from a Heavenly Beast. It contained all of the essences of the beast. Even when the beast died, all of its body essences remained in this marrow.Even though the Hell Iron Bull was dead, the moment its essence came flowing out, others could still see the will of the Hell Iron Bull. No matter what type of beast marrow it was, they were not willing to be refined.However, once it was inside the Heavenly Cauldron, even if it was not willing, it couldn't escape the fate of refinement.Even though the will of the Hell Iron Bull was rampaging with an unstoppable presence as if it wanted to trample over the Origin Flame; however, at this moment, the Auspicious Beast's aura exploded. One could see the Auspicious Beast channeling the universal laws of the world; the entire Heavenly Cauldron became ferociously frightening, like a master waking up.With the power of the Heavenly Cauldron exploding, it successfully suppressed the fast-moving Hell Iron Bull. In the end, the essence of the bull, along with the melted medicines, combined together.A Heavenly Cauldron was not an item without life. One could say that it was created by the heaven and earth. Inside the cauldron, it was its own world, capable of suppressing all spirit medicines.Of course, the Heavenly Cauldrons also had their own ranking. The power of the Alchemy Master was directly related to the Heavenly Cauldron \u2013 the stronger the Alchemy Master, the more powerful the cauldron would be.The moment an Alchemy Master obtained a Heavenly Cauldron, it would be the time when it was at its weakest rank. Afterward, the Alchemy Master would continuously feed it flame sparks and medicinal plants, and they would also make Fate Pills and Physique Pastes nonstop, resulting in the Heavenly Cauldron becoming more powerful. This process was considered the fusion between the Heavenly Cauldron and the Alchemy Master.Of course, there were some Alchemy Masters that inherited Heavenly Cauldrons from their predecessors. However, this inheriting process was very difficult. Especially when the rank of the Heavenly Cauldron was high, the integration process became nearly impossible for the Alchemy Master.In the end, the medicinal pillar became a medicinal paste. This paste was thick and flaky. Inside the crimson red color was a hint of purple, emitting a special medicinal aroma. Observing this type of medicine paste was enough for others to like it.However, the medicinal paste was not completed. At this moment, Grandpa Sheng changed his medicinal incantations, and he activated the Heavenly Cauldron. Inside the cauldron, a smell arose that was not of the medicinal paste, but from the cauldron's medicinal treasure.The medicinal treasure absorbed and released the essence of the paste, and it fused together with the Origin Flame. At this moment, the Origin Flame seemed to be alive as it licked the Physique Paste. The entire cauldron slowly rotated in a circle, causing the flame to grind the paste and making the thick paste become a lot smaller.This was the effect of the Heavenly Cauldron's medicinal treasure. Whether it was the boiling of a Physique Paste or the refining of a Fate Pill, only relying on the medicinal properties of the materials were not enough. Even the Origin Flame couldn't fuse all of the different properties together in harmony. At this moment, the powerful medicinal properties of the medicinal treasure were necessary in order to balance the materials \u2014 in conjunction with the Origin Flame \u2014 to achieve the harmonization of the paste.When it came to the Physique Paste, the higher the amount of refinement, the closer the fusion would be to perfection. This process, besides the power of the Alchemy Master, was also decided by the medicinal treasure of the Heavenly Cauldron.This process was no longer possible after the fourth refinement. At this moment, the Physique Paste became meticulously soft and smooth, like dragon fat. Even someone who was not privy to the arts knew that this was the good stuff.\u201cUnfortunately, the years of the beast marrow were not enough, I could only refine it four and a half times.\u201dGrandpa Sheng, seeing this process, could only sigh and lament.\u201cGreat, worthy of being an eight refinements grandmaster!\u201d Seeing the Physique Paste inside the cauldron, Elder Sun couldn't help but exclaim: \u201cIf it was me, and the years of the beast marrow were insufficient, then I'm afraid I wouldn't even be able to sustain the fourth refinement; the medicinal effects would be reduced greatly!\u201dElder Sun's Physique Paste refinement ability was stable at five refinements while Grandpa Sheng was at eight refinements. In principle, using the ability of Grandpa Sheng, five refinements wouldn't have been a problem. Unfortunately, the main driving material \u2014 the beast marrow, was not old enough, and he could only do four and a half refinements!There were also ranks for Physique Pastes, from low to high: Houtian Physique Paste, Xiantian Physique Paste, King Physique Paste, Saint Physique Paste, and Immortal Physique Paste.Not only were there ranks for these Physique pastes, but the number of refinements also affected their medicinal strength.A Houtian Physique Paste only required one refinement. Even a novice Alchemy Master could refine this rank. Xiantian Physique Pastes required two to three refinements; King Physique Pastes required four refinements to six refinements. A Saint Physique Paste required seven to nine refinements, while an Immortal Physique Paste had to be made with nine refinements!Currently, Li Qiye's Physique Paste was of the King level. At the time when the sect was looking for an Alchemy Master for Li Qiye, only two options were available: Elder Sun and Cao Xiong. Cao Xiong's ability was higher than Elder Sun by one step, and he was stable at six refinements. In theory, both of them had the qualification to refine a King Physique Paste.However, in reality, the years of the Hell Iron Bull's marrow were not enough to be the main driving material for this King Physique Paste. Both Cao Xiong and Elder Sun wouldn't be able to refine it four times, and it would have a direct impact on the effect of the Physique Paste.[1] This whole sentence is meant to be poetically sounding. Boil here means to slowly refine via fire. The word process and refine here were originally part of two words that should be together, meaning to extremely refine, but he split the words \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201crefine\u201d and left them in front of medicine and pill, which is a common Chinese literary technique. So in other words, refine could be a substitute in English for all of them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At this moment, Li Qiye was down to his trousers, and he jumped into the cauldron without hesitation, submerging his body into the paste.At this moment, the Heavenly Cauldron slowly closed, and finally, the entire treasure cauldron was sealed; however, this was far from over. Grandpa Sheng took control of the cauldron, and he slowly withdrew the Origin Flame. The flame sparks were still licking the Physique Paste so that it would slowly boil.Inside the cauldron, even Li Qiye's head was submerged into the Physique Paste. The pores in his entire body were relaxed, and he channeled the incantations of the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique!At this moment, there were thunderous sounds inside Li Qiye's body. The mercury-like Physique Paste pervasively invaded Li Qiye's body, and the essence of the paste combined with the body essence of Li Qiye.The Hell Iron Bull's beast marrow, as the main driving force, was the most appropriate paste for Li Qiye's Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique. The slush of the paste covered Li Qiye's body.He possessed a Mortal Physique. Even though he was cultivating an Immortal Physique, at this moment, his Physique had not yet been completed; thus, it was chaotically scattered.However, the Physique Paste was refining the bones and muscles of Li Qiye, purifying the blood and flesh. Under the incantations, his Immortal Physique \u2014 once again \u2014 underwent changes, and his entire body was greatly transformed and improved by the medicinal effects.Li Qiye's natural Mortal Physique was extremely weak; his muscles, bones, blood, and flesh were extremely feeble. Even though his body was improved after practicing the Immortal Physique, it was still not comparable to a natural Saint Physique.This was why this baptism was extremely important to Li Qiye. To alleviate his innately weak body, he absolutely has to use a Physique Paste, the higher rank the better, to rebuild his body.The entire process of body rebuilding was extremely painful. It was akin to the opening of all of his bones, crushing his muscles, and even taking out his bone marrow in order to use the Physique Paste to refine them.Despite the arduous and painful process, Li Qiye was still able to withstand it without whimpering once.It was unknown how long the process took. In the end, the Physique Paste was finally used up, becoming dried mud. All of its essences was refined by the Immortal Physique as it was absorbed into Li Qiye's Inner Physique.An explosive \u201cboom\u201d occurred. At this moment, the inside of Li Qiye's body was being fried through and through, and finally, his Inner Physique had been successfully refined. A fist as small as a fetus and dark like iron was formed. This tiny Inner Physique was heavy beyond one's imagination, like the heaviest godly metal in this world. At this moment, the universal laws of the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique, like strands of silk, covered this black Inner Physique!In the end, the universal laws of the Immortal Physique covered the Inner Physique, slowly hid inside the heart, and the laws finally submerged within alongside the Inner Physique. However, the universal laws continued to rotate without stopping!The Inner Physique was protected by the heart, the Life Wheel resided in the neck, and the Fate Palace was hidden in the Ni Gong meridian!A formed Inner Physique meant that Li Qiye had broken through the Physique Accumulation grand completion level and stepped into the Provisional Palace realm!\u201cRoll\u2026 Roll\u2026\u201d At this point, the Heavenly Cauldron opened its mouth. Li Qiye jumped out and smiled: \u201cSuccess. I have imposed on Grandpa Sheng regarding this matter.\"At this moment, Grandpa Sheng and the others observed Li Qiye, and they saw that his entire body was blessed with powerful muscle; it was as if it was crafted from metals. It gave off an air of unlimited strength.\u201cKing Physique Paste, ah! Truly unimaginable. Even a Mortal Physique could be refined into such a state.\u201d Seeing Li Qiye's body, Elder Sun couldn't help but become envious. The sect only had one King Physique Paste, and, at this moment, it went entirely into Li Qiye's body.The perceptions of Grandpa Sheng and Li Shuangyan were more keen, especially Li Shuangyan; she had guessed the real Physique that Li Qiye was practicing. Their conjectures were not just on the physical body. At this moment, their observation of Li Qiye was affected by a powerful force; a force as heavy as millions of jin striking at one's face. it was as if Li Qiye's body was a godly mountain with an unfathomable weight. Only his body alone was enough to suppress all existences, and, after his metamorphosis, his body was like an extraordinary weapon! It was filled with strength and violence!Li Shuangyan's shocked expression revealed that she was aware that Li Qiye refined his Inner Physique into the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique. She understood the true meaning behind the completion of the Immortal Inner Physique!Although Li Qiye had a long road ahead of him to reach grand completion, the moment his Inner Physique was completed, the foundation of the Immortal Physique was successful!At this moment, Li Shuangyan was aware that this ancient body of Li Qiye, once activated, countless Life Treasures and True Treasures would not be able to withstand his pressure!Grandpa Sheng couldn't help but exclaim: \u201cGood Physique!\u201d He didn't know the exact Physique Li Qiye was cultivating, but, just by feeling the pressure striking his face, he knew that this Physique was absolutely wonderful!As for Elder Sun, he didn't ask for which Physique Li Qiye was practicing. It could have been a peerless Physique that the Patriarch taught him in his dreams.So with regards to Li Qiye being able to absorb the entire Physique Paste, no one was surprised.Even though any cultivator could use any rank of Physique Paste to refine their body, in reality, the moment of true refinement was also dependent on certain principles.For example, a natural born King Physique, even without any Physique law, could still absorb the essence of a King Physique Paste. If the person also practiced a King Physique, then he could completely absorb the King Physique Paste's essence.However, when a natural born King Physique used a Saint Physique Paste, the maximum absorption would be limited to two or three parts out of ten. This was a waste of the Physique Paste, and this could be remedied by practicing a Saint Physique to absorb a higher portion of the essences.After Grandpa Sheng helped Li Qiye with his refinement, he didn't stay at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. During his departure, he gave a message from Demon King Lun Ri to Li Qiye, telling him that he was always welcome as a guest at the gate!Without a doubt, the Demon King greatly valued Li Qiye; otherwise, an ordinary disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect wouldn't be repeatedly extended an invitation so many times.After saying goodbye to Grandpa Sheng, Li Qiye came back to his courtyard to meditate. Regarding cultivation, he was more diligent than anyone; however, his cultivation was slowed down because of the reformation of the sect during the past half a year.After the Physique Accumulation, there was the Provisional Palace realm. This realm was about forming a new Fate Palace within the Ni Gong meridian. It sounds simple, but building a new Fate Palace from scratch was not an easy matter.Building a new Fate Palace was different from the natural Fate Palace. Cultivators called the natural Fate Palace the Master Palace while the created Fate Palace would be the Vice Palace or Servant Palace.The Master Palace was where the True Fate resided, and it was also called the True Fate Master Palace. The new Fate Palace cannot replace the Master Palace due to this.At the Provisional Palace realm, a cultivator could build one new Fate Palace; however, a cultivator during his life would not build just one new Fate Palace. In theory, a cultivator could have twelve Fate Palaces \u2014 also named the Twelve Palaces.In reality, from the ancient past till now, people having the Twelve Palaces were essentially non-existent! Some even say that this world essentially didn't have twelve palaces; at the very most, there were eleven palaces!These words were not without reason. In fact, a cultivator with three Fate Palaces was already praised as being extraordinary. With six Fate Palaces, one would be considered a genius, even if his aptitude and Physique was ordinary; as long as he had six Fate Palaces, no one could deny his future prowess. As for having nine Fate Palaces, this was an extraordinary genius as high as the heavens; even throughout the ancient times till now, it would be difficult to find one! As for having more than nine palaces, there were very few known cultivators since the beginning of time!Provisional Palace realm has five levels, and in order from lowest to highest, they are One Starting Palace, Two Gushing Springs, Three Igniting Fires, Four Breaking Grounds, Five Rising Pillars.Li Qiye had stepped inside this realm. At this moment, on top of his Fate Palace was a transforming Kun Peng, flying around his True Fate. Waves after waves of incantations affected the Master Palace, causing Li Qiye's Ni Gong meridian to change!There was a bone pillar rising in Li Qiye's Ni Gong meridian as Li Qiye channeled the Kun Peng's Six Variants nonstop. It slowly dug into the meridian, and the shape of a Fate Palace was slowly formed\u2026This was the Provisional Palace's One Starting Palace level. The process was extremely slow, but Li Qiye was not anxious. He knew this realm could not be rushed. Once a mistake appeared, it would directly cause the palace to collapse. If this happened, then opening a new Fate Palace in the future would be harder than traversing the highest sky!Throughout the day, Li Qiye was immersed in this process. The second day, Li Qiye woke up from his heavenly meditation, and he saw Li Shuangyan waiting quietly at the door.Stretching his tired back, Li Qiye signaled for Li Shuangyan to come in. After arriving inside, Li Shuangyan was just coldly looking at him, without saying a word.Li Shuangyan. This type of heaven's proud daughter, even after following Li Qiye for so long, she was still as silent and cold as ever.Li Qiye looked at Li Shuangyan and said: \u201cYour Saint level Pure Jade Physique Merit Law came from the War God Temple.\u201dLi Shuangyan gently nodded her head, without saying a word. She was a natural King Physique; in order to cultivate a Saint Physique, the Nine Saint Demon Gate expended a lot of effort in order to obtain the \u201cPure Jade Physique\u201d that was appropriate for her cultivation.Li Qiye gently nodded his head: \u201cThis Physique merit law from the War God Temple is not bad as it is capable of the Grand Dao.\u201dLi Shuangyan couldn't help but to glare at Li Qiye. The Saint level Pure Jade Physique Merit Law; this Physique was coveted by so many. Even the Nine Saint Demon Gate expended blood and sweat in order to receive it from the War God Temple.[1] I believe Ni Gong meridian is in the forehead, but this Ni Gong is a name used by this author to work with the Fate Palace, so he renamed the actual meridian to Ni Gong.[2] Way of saying thanks.[3] This sentence is redundant in English, but it is a bit more formal in Chinese, the proper name.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was already country-destroyingly beautiful, but this expression caused others' minds to sway and their souls to go crazy.Such beauty, such style \u2014 it was something only Li Qiye could slowly savor. As for Li Qiye, regarding Li Shuangyan's disagreement, he said with a smile: \u201cThe War God Temple indeed has some hidden power, and they can be some parts arrogant. The Saint level Pure Jade Physique Merit Law, to the War God Temple, could be considered a good Physique, and, to the cultivators of the world, it would be an unimaginable Saint Physique. However, to me, it was only a common merit law; it is not enough to reach the apex.\u201dLi Shuangyan gazed at Li Qiye and asked: \u201cIn other words, you have a Physique that is better than the level Pure Jade Saint Merit Law then?\u201dShe knew that Li Qiye practiced the \u201cHell Suppressing Immortal Physique\u201d, and this meant that he had the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique Merit Law.However, she was a natural Pure Crystal Physique, and her body was completely different from the Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique. Even if Li Qiye passed it on to her, it would still be useless.At this moment, she was practicing the Pure Jade Saint Physique; this could be considered a peak Physique merit law in this world. Outside of this merit law, wanting to find a Physique law that was superior to the Pure Jade Saint Physique was harder than hard, unless it was an Immortal Physique.Li Qiye didn't consider the Pure Jade Saint Merit Law in his eyes; this meant that he had an Immortal Physique of this body type. Before, Li Shuangyan had suspicions of this, but, at the moment, Li Qiye had basically admitted this; he caused her heart to shiver.A person having two Immortal Physique merit laws for different body types, what does this imply? Even looking at the whole Mortal Emperor World, the Nine Worlds, and all of the sects and lineages \u2014 especially the Immortal Emperor sects \u2014 having two Immortal Physique merit laws could not be counted past five fingers, especially not more than two fingers!However, Li Qiye actually possessed two Immortal Physique merit laws \u2014 how shocking was this? Of course, if Li Shuangyan knew that he had the Physique Scripture, then she would be at a loss for words. This was the origin law of all physiques; it could be said that all physique merit laws in existence in this world originated from this scripture.\u201cYou are not too stupid.\u201d Li Qiye smiled: \u201cThe reason I called you in is to teach you the true incantations of an Immortal Physique merit law!\u201d\u201cTeach me the true incantations?\u201d Li Shuangyan's heart was distraught, she didn't dare to believe the little boy in front of her.At this moment, Li Qiye sat formally and said: \u201cBefore teaching you the true incantations, I must make a few things clear to you.\u201dLi Shuangyan had been staying with Li Qiye for almost a year. Very few matters could change his mood and very few matters could make him so formal, so this caused Li Shuangyan to shiver.Li Qiye slowly spoke with an extremely solemn and a dignified expression: \u201cIf I pass down the true incantations to you, you must accomplish a few things. First, swear with your True Fate that, unless I give you permission, you will never pass it down to a second person, even if it was your closest person. Second, never betray or oppose me; otherwise, accept the consequences. Third, this matter will not be told to anyone; this includes your master, Demon King Lun Ri!\u201dThis air of seriousness coming from Li Qiye caused Li Shuangyan to be shaken. At this moment, her intelligence was able to guess something.Li Qiye slowly continued: \u201cYou have to truly remember that I will not only personally slay you but I will also massacre the sect or the clan receiving this law should you teach this merit law to someone else! This law, without my permission, absolutely cannot be spread to others. In the future, even if an Immortal Emperor was to protect you, I will do as I said. Without my permission to obtain this merit law, the only fate available is the complete annihilation of the clan!\u201dThis was the first time seeing Li Qiye's solemn expression. Li Shuangyan definitely trusted that his words were not originating from baseless arrogance. She believed that he will do as he said!Li Shuangyan did not know the old stories of the Physique Scripture. It was in Li Qiye's possession for millions of years. In reality, he had passed on the Immortal Physiques to not only Immortal Emperor Min Ren. That year, Min Ren was given the word \u201cYang\u201d from the Scripture, and he successfully cultivated the \u201cSolar Immortal Physique.\u201dAfterward, Immortal Emperor Min Ren didn't leave behind the \u201cSolar Immortal Physique\u201d to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect because this was the agreement between him and Li Qiye.In reality, it was not just Min Ren who obtained and Immortal Physiques. There were a few at a young age who reached an agreement with Li Qiye, and they finally cultivated the Immortal Physiques, actually becoming Immortal Emperors. However, they also didn't pass down these Immortal Physiques.Li Qiye slowly said: \u201cBy giving away the true incantations, you will have to follow me. You can sign a contract with me and choose to follow me for one thousand years, ten thousand years, or your whole life. When the contract expires, you are free to leave! However, you absolutely cannot oppose me in the future. If the pact is broken\u2026 I do not need to repeat the consequences.\u201cOf course, you can also choose to not learn this merit law. As long as you follow me, in the future, I will grant you an even better Saint merit law than the one you are currently practicing! Make your choice now!\u201dLi Shuangyan stared at Li Qiye in silent contemplation. Without a doubt, this choice would greatly affect her entire life. As the heaven's proud daughter, she had many choices; however, today, she was facing a different situation.\u201cI am willing.\u201d Li Shuangyan eventually made her choice. She formally said her answer with a resolute demeanor. She, in one breath, chose to follow him for her whole life. Having made this decision with resolution and swiftness, she was indeed an intelligent person \u2014 she just made the biggest decision of her life.\u201cOne day, you will understand that your decision is not incorrect.\u201d Li Qiye gently nodded his head: \u201cIn the future, when I crawl up to the peak, there will absolutely be a place for you.\u201dFinally, Li Shuangyan used her True Fate to make a pact, and she swore to be loyal and follow Li Qiye. After obtaining her service, Li Qiye grinned: \u201cListen well, I am passing the true incantations to you.\u201dLi Shuangyan shivered, and she focused her mind. She didn't dare to be careless. With a formal expression, she carefully listened to every word and sentence that came from Li Qiye.Li Shuangyan was a natural born Pure Crystal Physique; this was one of the twenty-four King Physiques. Pure Crystal Physique and Substance Jade Physique were the same body type, and both are of the twenty-four King Physiques. They both could become possessors of a Pure Jade Physique, one of the eighteen Saint Physiques. Finally, with an Immortal Physique merit law, these two Physiques could become the Void Imperfection Physique, one of the twelve Immortal Physiques.However, Li Qiye, at the moment, was passing down to her an Immortal Physique, directly skipping the Saint Physique. As for Saint Physiques, there were eighteen types. However, in this world, cultivators preferred to call them the twelve Saint Physiques.This was because, within the eighteen Saint Physiques, there were only twelve that have a corresponding Immortal Physique. As for the other six Saint Physiques, they were extremely rare. Many people didn't even know what the other six Saint Physiques were!Li Shuangyan was extremely serious, and she carefully listened to Li Qiye's instruction. She was a natural born King Physique, King Life Wheel, and Saint Fate Palace. Her aptitude could be counted only on one's fingers in this generation \u2014 definitely a genius within geniuses. To her, the only limitation was the merit laws because, in the end, the Nine Saint Demon Gate was not of Immortal Emperor lineage. For a genius like her to obtain an Emperor law, she would be even more unfathomable.However, the Life Wheel and Fate Palace couldn't be changed. This was bestowed by the heavens. A natural King Life Wheel will always be a King Life Wheel, and it could not be promoted to the Saint Life Wheel. Only the Physique could be promoted to a higher realm through cultivation.To Li Shuangyan, a King Physique was far from sufficient. If she could successfully cultivate an Immortal Physique, then in the future, she would truly be able to reach the peak.The Physique Scripture had six words, and, at the extremes of each word, two Immortal Physiques were born. If Li Shuangyan wanted an Immortal Physique, she would have to cultivate the Void Imperfection Physique.The Void Imperfection Physique originated from the word \u201cPure\u201d, meaning extreme purity. The two Immortal Physiques that accompanied this word was the \u201cVoid Imperfection Physique\u201d and the \u201cSoar Immortal Physique\u201d!Currently, Li Qiye was teaching her the Void Imperfection Physique, one of the two grand Physiques of Pure!Li Shuangyan's talents were extraordinary; Li Qiye only had to say it once, and she was able to memorize the Void Imperfection Physique's incantations. Her mind was extremely moved by this merit law. This was the most profound and mysterious merit law she had come in contact with. Even as a genius, she had no way to understand the absolute meanings within.Fortunately, Li Qiye explained the ultimate mysteries of the Void Imperfection Physique for her. At the moment, during Li Qiye's Dao instruction, this was the real shock for Li Shuangyan.As the absolute genius of the Grand Middle Territory, the moment she heard the incantations of the Void Imperfection Physique, she was afraid that even within one hundred years, she still wouldn't be able to understand the ultimate mysteries of this merit law. However, at this moment, Li Qiye was preaching without stop; from simplicity to complexity, from shallowness to the depths! There was no resemblance to a fourteen-year-old! This was a supreme master of a generation.Li Shuangyan, of course, didn't know that Li Qiye had spent countless years reading and meditating on the Physique Scripture. During this process, he absorbed the essence of many Immortal Emperors and the Mortal Race's immortal sages. Naturally, a genius like Li Shuangyan couldn't compare to him.After the instruction, Li Qiye said to Li Shuangyan: \u201cI have explained the Physique merit law to you. As for how much you can actually comprehend, this is up to your own cultivation. If you actually cannot successfully form the Void Imperfect Physique\u2026 then I could only say that you are the dumbest person in this world, and I was also wrong in judging you.\u201dLi Shuangyan took a long time to regain her wits. When she did, she asked: \u201cThis merit law, cultivating it together with my existing Pure Jade Saint Merit Law, would there be flaws at the moment when I form my Inner Physique?\u201d[1] Confusing paragraph, basically she is saying no sect in this world has more than two Immortal Physique Merit Laws, at most.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Emperor\u2019s DominationEmperor's Domination Chapter 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Qiye smiled and said: \u201cIf my instruction between the connection of two Physique merit laws possesses a problem, then there wouldn't be any perfect Physique merit law in this world! This merit law absolutely can merge with the Pure Jade Saint Merit Law you are currently cultivating. This Physique law is the ultimate progenitor of all Void Imperfection Merit Laws!\u201dHearing Li Qiye's words, Li Shuangyan was in astonishment. This was the same as him admitting a particular matter, causing Li Shuangyan to bewilderedly stare at Li Qiye. She hesitated for a moment before finally asking: \u201cThis Physique merit law\u2026\u201d\u201cCorrect, this Physique merit law originated from the Physique Scripture.\u201d Li Qiye interrupted her conjecture, looked into her eyes, and said: \u201cBut, this is only for you to know, understand?\u201dLi Shuangyan gently nodded her head, still in amazed. She stared at Li Qiye while exclaiming: \u201cBut, I-I heard that the Physique Scripture had not come into being for more than one million years! I also never heard of anyone ever possessing the Heavenly Scripture!\u201dThe Nine Grand Heavenly Scriptures and the Nine Grand Heavenly Treasures \u2014 these were the supreme existences of this world. To cultivators, there was nothing in this world more valuable than the Nine Grand Heavenly Scriptures and the Nine Grand Heavenly Treasures.However, since the beginning of time, no one had heard of anyone possessing a Scripture from the Nine Scriptures and a Treasure from the Nine Treasures!They both never revealed themselves in this world, so many cultivators thought that their existences were only mere fabrications, that this world essentially did not have such things.\u201cWhy is it strange?\u201d Li Qiye revealed a nonchalant and amusing smile: \"After the Desolace Expansion Era, the Physique Scripture had never appeared in this mortal world!\u201dAfter he obtained the Physique Scripture, it was immediately hidden. From the past till now, people who have actually seen the Physique Scripture were very few.Li Shuangyan stared at Li Qiye. Finally, she didn't know what to say. If Li Qiye didn't personally pass down the Void Imperfection Physique to her, if Li Qiye didn't personally say that he possessed the Physique Scripture, she would never ever believe that a fourteen-year-old boy would be the owner of the Physique Scripture. The whole world would think that he was boasting.Finally, Li Qiye asked: \u201cAny other questions?\u201dLi Shuangyan hesitated for a moment before asking: \u201cMy Life Law and Fate Law, are there any defects?\u201dAs a genius, asking a young boy much younger than her for advice \u2014 if others saw this, it would be an unexplainable matter.In reality, when Li Shuangyan saw Li Qiye teaching Nan Huairen's crowd, she was not without temptation; she too wanted to ask Li Qiye for help. However, due to her pride and her inability to let it go, she was not able to ask him until the moment she swore with her True Fate. This shortened the distance between her and Li Qiye, so she was able to open her mouth for advice.Li Qiye glanced at her and replied: \u201cRegarding the Fate Law, your cultivation of the \u201cPhoenix Bearing Method\u201d has nothing to be critical about. This was a merit law passed down by your Progenitor, but it was not created by him. Don't always think about Emperor merit laws; in reality, there are times when Emperor merit laws are not the perfect choice\u2026\u201cThe Phoenix Bearing Method was obtained by your Progenitor from an ancient heritage. It was created by an immortal sage from the Demon Race with an extremely old beginning. It was formed during the Desolate Era, and it perfected during the Desolate Expansion Era. In reality, during the Desolate Expansion Era, many grand unfathomable characters appeared; they studied the Phoenix Bearing Method, but they couldn't perfect it. All the way till later, your Progenitor was fatefully fortunate, and he obtained the completed Phoenix Bearing Method.\u201dRegarding this matter, Li Qiye kept on speaking. Outside of the late Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon, no one else knew more than him. That year, when Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon was still calling himself Nine Saint Heavenly Demon, he was without a sect. Frankly speaking, the former past of Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon was a wild chicken. Later on, he fatefully found the Phoenix Bearing Method, and it allowed him to become an unbeatable Virtuous Paragon that had swept through that generation. He could be considered the peak of Virtuous Paragons!\u201dLi Qiye continued: \u201cAs for your Life Law, the \u201cSwan Cloud Method\u201d, even though it is not a top Life Law of this world and there is indeed quite a distance between it and an Immortal Emperor Life Law, since you practice the Phoenix Bearing Method, you must choose the Swan Cloud Method. This method was created by your Progenitor because he studied the Phoenix Bearing Method his whole life. Then, he created the Swan Cloud Method Life Law that was the most suitable to go with the Phoenix Bearing Method.\u201dHearing the smooth explanation of Li Qiye regarding her own methods, Li Shuangyan was dumbfounded with her mouth open. Because she practiced these two, she formally knew the origins and circumstances of them. In reality, regarding these two methods, the disciples of the Nine Saint Demon Gate didn't necessarily know so many things; thus, Li Qiye was able to continue on with a full understanding of it.This caused Li Shuangyan to be suspicious, prompting her question: \u201cYou really aren't a disciple of our Nine Saint Demon Gate?\u201dA disciple from a different sect understanding the highest methods from her Nine Saint Demon Gate like this \u2014 if this got out, then even the elders of the Nine Saint Demon Gate wouldn't believe it.Regarding such words from Li Shuangyan, Li Qiye couldn't help but laugh: \u201cMerit laws and the Life Law are without problems to you. The truth is that you lack a Fate Protecting Killing Technique. However, your Dao foundation is based on the Phoenix Bearing Method and the Swan Cloud Method; a Fate Protecting Killing Method, you will have an opportunity to learn at any time.\u201dHere, he looked at Li Shuangyan and stated: \u201cI know that your Nine Saint Demon Gate has several Grand Killing techniques, but they are not fitting for you. Plus, you clearly put your focus on formations, so you have no way of cultivating these Grand Killing techniques to their true annihilating realms! As for the formations of your sect, they really aren't so good, ah!\u201dLi Shuangyan was a little unconvinced with Li Qiye's words. Her Nine Saint Demon Gate had several grand formation techniques.\u201cYou don't need to be convinced.\u201d Li Qiye smiled and said: \u201cThe moment I saw your formation, I immediately knew what formations the Nine Saint Demon Gate considers as grand formations. It was simply a small insignificant corner from the Formation Ancestor. You all definitely obtained a small and incomplete manual from the Formation Ancestor; however, your grand formations were not even one part out of ten of the Formation Ancestor's heritage.Li Qiye's words left Li Shuangyan feeling dejected. The grand formations of the Nine Saint Demon Gate were renowned in the Grand Middle Territory, but, in the mouth of Li Qiye, they were not enough to reach the apex. She wanted to refute; however, Li Qiye revealed the entire origin of their formations, so she became helpless.\u201cYou are adept in the Phoenix Bearing Method, not in the killing ways, so you are weak in your offensive capability. Regarding this, when comparing your talents to your battle prowess, a little gap indeed exists. Since you like formations, given the chance, I will find some Grand Killing formations for you that would be more suitable to your taste.\u201d Li Qiye finally came up with this conclusion.Li Shuangyan wanted to say something, but then she stopped. Li Qiye glanced at her and spoke: \u201cI know you have a corner of the Immortal Emperor Slaying Formation, but you need to listen to my words; don't go completing it! It would be a waste of your talents! This corner of your Immortal Emperor Slaughtering Formation is pitifully incomplete. To expend your energy on this matter would be a waste of your sweat and blood. I admit that you are a genius, but if you want to use this corner of the formation to understand the true profoundness... To be blunt, you don't have the qualifications! First, expend your effort on the Dao of cultivation.\u201dHearing Li Qiye's words, Li Shuangyan couldn't help but ask: \u201cThe Immortal Emperor Slaughtering Formation, is it still passed down to future generations?\u201dUnwittingly, she had considered the little boy in front of her as an all-knowing existence.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Li Qiye cheerfully smiled, dragging on his answer.Seeing Li Qiye's intentional teasing, Li Shuangyan snappily glared at him and said: \u201cDon't act mysterious, hurry up and say it.\u201dAgain, her tone was unwittingly a little coquettish, unlike her normal cold as icy countenance; it was a very rare sight.Li Qiye finally stared at her while answering: \u201cDon't focus your thoughts on the Immortal Emperor Slaughtering Formation. Even if you have the complete version, you don't have the strength to understand it! As for the complete formation, in the future, there will absolutely be an opportunity.\u201dHere, Li Qiye quietly sighed in lamentation. The Immortal Emperor Slaughtering Formation \u2014 such a distant memory, such unbearable memories.Seeing Li Qiye's expression, Li Shuangyan didn't dare to ask anymore. Even though she didn't know the story, she could guess that there was a hidden past that no one else knew about.Obtaining Li Qiye's instruction, Li Shuangyan began to cultivate the Void Imperfection Physique. During this time, she finally realized what was a supreme Immortal Physique and what was an ultimate Immortal Physique! It was no wonder why Li Qiye didn't bother looking at the Pure Jade Saint Merit Law; it was not comparable to this supreme Physique!What made Li Shuangyan emotional was that because Li Qiye taught her the mysteriousness of the Immortal Physique, if she still wasn't able to complete it, then she would be the dumbest person in this world. So, to her, completing the physique was only a matter of time! Li Shuangyan had ten parts confidence in successfully achieving the Void Imperfection Physique!Meanwhile, after Li Qiye had cultivated for a month, he called for Nan Huairen: \u201cWe will go to the Ancient Land to see the Ancient Land's situation for a little bit.\u201dHearing Li Qiye's command, Nan Huairen immediately obeyed: \u201cMy master had been to the Ancient Land a couple of times; I will invite him to lead the way.\u201dWhat was called the Ancient Land was the Ancient Land of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. In reality, the ancestral land of the current Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was only a tiny corner of its ancestral land that year.That year, the ancestral land of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect were several hundreds of thousand miles long. After the sudden changes on top of the decline of the sect, it caused the ancestral land of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect of today to be reduced to a few main peaks.Li Qiye wanted to return to the Ancient Land. Even though the five elders didn't know what he wanted to do, they all agreed.Besides Protector Mo, Nan Huairen and Li Shuangyan also followed him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Its emperor's foundation could be said to be unshakable!During the beginning of the Emperors Era, at the moment when the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was at its most prosperous state, it encompassed the whole Grand Middle Territory and commanded the entire Mortal Emperor World. One could only imagine how powerful it used to be.A million years had passed, and the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect finally became weak. It no longer had the power to sweep through the world and rule over the Nine Worlds like before. However, the ancestral land of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect still remained.The ancestral land of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect used to be extremely vast. Some said that when the sect was in its prime, it ranged around one million miles with thousands of ancient pavilions and countless disciples that were not just from the Mortal Emperor World! Even Charming Spirits, Heavenly Devils, and Stone Golems \u2014 these races that were favored by the heavens \u2014 joined the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\"The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect's glory was a path with no return; in the end, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had to let go of its vast land and hide like a turtle in a corner of its old land.Li Qiye's group went on their trip with Protector Mo leading the way. Because he had been to the Ancient Land multiple times, he could be regarded as a light car traveling on a familiar road.Today, there were only a few dozen main peaks and the area only spanned for a thousand miles. This was incomparable to the old scale.They left the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect on a straight road to the Ancient Land. One could see the rolling mountains and high peaks like a Dragon Tiger that was entrenched in the middle of this grand earth.The Ancestral Land of the sect used to be a beautiful scenery of mountains and rivers, just like a land of immortals. However, today, from Li Qiye's eyes, this was not the case.Closing the distance to the Ancient Land, he only saw death: dried trees and withered forest, bare mountains and empty rivers, devoid of birds and beasts; a land of stillness.Observing along the way, he found that there were ancient temples and high pavilions inside the mountain ranges and deep valleys. Unfortunately, these ancient temples and high pavilions were broken into pieces and surrounded by wild grass and a deathly aura.From the delicate engravings of these broken ruins, one could imagine the prosperity of that year, the majesty of that year.Countless undulating peaks and many ancient structures were only ruins, today!Traveling on this wretched ground, even Protector Mo gently sighed. A sadness and unwillingness to see the once invincible Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect falling into this state.Li Qiye silently trod on this familiar ground that had entirely transformed in today's time. However, the decline of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was not why Li Qiye's expression greatly changed. What moved him was that he was walking on top of a grand ground, yet he could faintly feel the evil aura under the earth!Li Qiye had felt this evil aura inside the Ghost Pavilion, before. He was familiar with it, and he knew the origin of this evil energy, but he couldn't imagine how this evil energy had appeared once again.This land used to be filled with legends. That year, when Li Qiye was the Dark Crow, he was well aware. It was the same with Immortal Emperor Min Ren. It was indeed mysterious, and it was indeed legendary; however, it also buried a frightening existence.Establishing the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect on this ground, Li Qiye had his own reasons that year. In order to get rid of future complications, Li Qiye had infiltrated the deepest part of this ground. After Min Ren shouldered the Heaven's Will, Li Qiye made him personally refine and use an invincible sealing formation on the deepest part.In principle, this evil aura shouldn't have appeared again. In reality, after Min Ren had left and when he was the Dark Crow that appeared in this world again, he was keeping track of this land. After countless years and from era to era, he was still observing this land, but this situation had never happened before.However, during his last deep slumber, only a short thirty thousand years had passed, yet this matter had happened and it greatly shocked Li Qiye.Li Shuangyan, standing next to Li Qiye, couldn't help but say: \u201cThere is an ominous thing underground!\u201dAs a genius, her spirit sense was extremely sharp. Walking on top of this land, she felt that there was an aura on the ground that caused her to become angry.Protector Mo gently shook his head and sighed: \u201cI heard that that year, there was a great change, and it brought about the decline of our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201dNan Huairen was considered to be very informed within the sect, so he busily spoke in place of his master: \u201cI heard that that year, we didn't actually lose to the Heavenly God Sect. If there was not such a strange event that happened to us, not to mention a single Heavenly God Sect, even ten would be easily destroyed by us.\u201d\u201cThe Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect did face a great calamity that year.\u201d Li Shuangyan changed her expression and said: \u201cI've heard about the grand calamity happening at the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, but the later generations assumed that the sect was making an excuse for their grand defeat.\u201d\u201cHmph, what excuses. I heard the elders say that if the grand calamity didn't happen that year, what the hell would the Heavenly God Sect be to us? When Immortal Emperor Ta Kong was still in this world, he wouldn't even dare to arrogantly say that he could destroy our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.\u201d Nan Huan Ren coldly snorted; his arrogance was as high as the heavens. Seeing his expression, it was almost as if he personally experienced the battle that year.\u201cDon't be madly impetuous!\u201d Protector Mo yelled at this disciple: \u201cAn Immortal Emperor for a generation is someone that shouldered the Heaven's Will and ruled the heavens; who are you to say such careless words!\u201dScolded by his master, Nan Huairen dejectedly lowered his neck as he awkwardly laughed. He was a lively person; even after the scolding, he didn't pay any heed and busily said: \u201cI heard that the elders said the calamity that year was a mortal blow to our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. Imagine that that year, a deadly disaster suddenly happened to our sect\u2026\u201d\u201cDon't make inaccurate statements in front of Young Master and the princess. Even Elder Gu didn't know many things regarding the disaster that year, only the bare minimum.\u201d Regarding his disciple running his mouth boastfully, as his master, Protector Mo glared at him once. At this moment, as a protector, he was referring to Li Qiye as \u201cYoung Master.\u201dNan Huairen, scolded by his master, awkwardly smiled. He finally said in a serious manner: \u201cThe unexpected event that happened that year, even the elders didn't know about it. Some said thirty thousand years ago, some said fifty thousand years. Basically, thirty to fifty thousand years ago, a strange calamity happened at our sect.\u201dLi Shuangyan asked: \u201cHow was it strange?\u201d Regarding this legend, she had also heard of it. However, she was not a disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, so there was a large chance that her sources were inaccurate.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d This question was difficult for Nan Huairen to answer. He could scratch his head for half a day without producing an answer. In reality, he only heard about this from the legends. The exact incident, he didn't know about. Even the elders \u2014 at their age \u2014 didn't know, let alone him.Eventually, Protector Mo gently sighed and revealed: \u201cThere was an ominous appearance, a strange occurrence at the center of the sect.\u201dAs for the actual details of the ominous occurrence, Protector Mo himself didn't know. The upper echelons of the sect only knew that something negative had happened, but no one knew the details because all of the disciples who had personally experienced the event were no longer part of this world.When Protector Mo and Nan Huairen answer, the initially quiet Li Qiye gravely said: \u201cThe sealing of this ground had a problem.\u201d His expression was rarely serious, but it showed a hint of coldness this time.Li Shuangyan was shocked after hearing Li Qiye's words. Inside her Nine Saint Demon Gate, there was an ancient piece of writing that contained the words left behind by their ancestor, Nine Saint Virtuous Paragon. Legend states that Immortal Emperor Min Ren sealed this land then built the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect on it, leaving behind an unshakable emperor's foundation!As for why Min Ren had to seal this land and what was sealed, the writing didn't mention. Future generations didn't know either.At this moment, Li Qiye had spoken in a confident manner; without a doubt, it was as if he already knew beforehand. Li Shuangyan was perplexed since this was such an ancient matter. Furthermore, there were no concrete documents about it, so how did he know?If one could travel around the boundary of the sect that year, then they would find that it was like a giant sea snail. This sea snail was extremely huge. Lying on the ground, it carried the entire ground of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.Today, the sect's ground was but a part of the tail of this sea snail. That year, the center of the sect was located on the spine of the sea snail.The moment they reached the center of the sect of that year, they found that all of the trees and plants were withered. From these dead trees, one could see that this place used to be filled with ancient trees and bright godly grass with heavenly vines that covered the skies. It was a shame that today, this place was now a dead ground.Stepping into the central area, they saw a strange scene. Outside of the center, all of the ancient temples and pavilions were entirely collapsed into ruins, but the center was not like that at all.As the central area of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, Immortal Emperor Min Ren used to use this place to order the whole world and accepted the worship from all of the races of the Nine Worlds. Afterward, all of the sect masters of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect resided here to command the heroic crowd.At this place, it would be described as having a forest of ancient pavilions and godly temples. However, today, they were all covered; it was as if the sky suddenly rained down mud upon them. Countless amounts of mud covered the buildings that became dried throughout the ages.All of the buildings here seemed to be stuck in a thick layer of muddy paste, causing others to be unable to recognize their true appearance.[1] Charming Spirits most likely resemble high elves, and Heavenly Devils are their counterpart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Emperor\u2019s DominationEmperor's Domination Chapter 90Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySeeing this scene, Li Qiye stood silently on top of the land for a long time. This was the commanding center of the sect. At this place, not just Min Ren, but Li Qiye himself used to command the generals and soldiers from here. He brought an invincible army from this place and started an expedition to conquer the nine heavens and ten earths.In order to revive the sect, the Ancestral Land had to be opened. Otherwise, the sect must be relocated because, at the moment, the land of the sect was too small and the earth vein that was moving the world's energy was too thin.Li Qiye intended to begin by fixing the Ancestral Land to rebuild the sect, but, once he witnessed the scene before his eyes, he immediately knew what the ominous event that had struck the sect was!The thing he hoped would never occur had happened. This caused Li Qiye to be solemn and a bit perplexed. In the end, who was the one to open the seal?! There was no chance that it was Immortal Emperor Ta Kong because, if Ta Kong forced open the seal, the entire sect would no longer exist. He would have needed to destroy the emperor's foundation, but, seeing the current situation, that was not the case.If it was not an intruder that broke the seal, then who on earth opened this seal? Thinking about this, Li Qiye quietly contemplated.Nan Huairen curiously observed everything in front of him. This was his first time here, and he couldn't help but take out his sword. He tried to pierce the stone paste on an ancient pavilion. However, no matter how hard he tried to chisel, he could only leave a small sword mark \u2014 the size of a rice grain \u2014 behind; essentially, he couldn't drill through this stone paste.Protector Mo shook his head and said: \u201cIt is useless, Elder Gu had tried doing the same thing before. It was essentially impossible to drill through. If a person with a certain cultivation was to force it, then there will be a rebound effect.\u201d\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Li Shuangyan, seeing the stone paste that encompassed the buildings, couldn't help but feel strange.\u201cThe protection of the emperor's foundation.\u201d At this moment, Li Qiye spoke: \u201cThis ground was laid with an unshakable emperor's foundation. When a calamity presents itself, the emperor's foundation will automatically protect itself. This, to an extent, suppressed the evil energy that was under the ground from spreading. The protection is still here, and that means that the emperor's foundation is still here as well.\u201dLi Shuangyan was touched by the fact that, even though there was a great calamity, the emperor's foundation was still standing. This was an Immortal Emperor lineage standing strong for millions of years \u2014 truly frightening. The hidden power of an Immortal Emperor lineage was incalculable. It seemed like, if there wasn't a huge disaster that year, even if the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect had truly declined, it was not an existence that could be provoked by the Heavenly God Sect!\u201cThis will take some time.\u201d In the end, Li Qiye said these words. The seal formation had problems, and Li Qiye knew that this matter was serious. In order to revive the sect and rebuild this land, he absolutely had to infiltrate the depths of this land once more.If this was the case, then he must have full preparations. He needs powerful generals and brave soldiers. This couldn't be rushed. Adequate arrangements must be made in order to be successful.At this moment, Nan Huairen, who was looking around, found something and loudly announced: \u201cThere is a hole here.\u201dLi Qiye's group hurried over. The place where Nan Huairen was standing was a valley of low elevation. Within this valley of dead vegetation, there was a big hole that was drilled straight down. No one knew how deep the cave was. There was only a black-as-ink color down below, as far as the eyes could see.Carefully looking at the giant hole, one could see circular line patterns; it was as if a huge drill came down vertically in its creation. It was clear that this giant hole was not formed by a natural process.\u201cThis giant hole wasn't dug too long ago.\u201d Li Shuangyan carefully observed the giant hole and eventually came to this conclusion.Li Qiye meticulously observed the hole, and he made some careful analysis. In the end, he smirked and commanded Protector Mo: \u201cProtector Mo, immediately return and bring me Violet Mulberry Trees, the more the better. Also, bring me a giant pot, three bottles of vinegar, six bottles of Dove Dark Water, and some Green Perfect Bones\u2026\u201dLi Qiye listed a myriad of medicines, and, even though Protector Mo didn't know what Li Qiye wanted to do, he still remembered each of them carefully. After Li Qiye finished his instructions, Protector Mo immediately flew away without the slightest of doubts.Once reaching the Heaven's Primal realm, cultivators could fly without relying on any treasures.Seeing how Li Qiye's wanted so many items, Nan Huairen curiously asked: \u201cOldest Brother, what are you trying to do?\u201dLi Shuangyan was also puzzled. Li Qiye's list of items, many of them she had never even heard of before.Li Qiye let off a smile and said: \u201cI want to smoke a rat out of hiding.\u201dFinished answering, he simply sat down and got cozy as he eagerly awaited for Protector Mo's return.Protector Mo didn't dare to linger around, and he immediately came back after one day.\u201cSet up the fire.\u201dAfter his return, he brought a large amount of Violet Mulberry Trees to Li Qiye; the pieces of wood were all dried. They immediately placed the dried wood in front of the giant hole and started a fire.In a flash, the billowing smoke immediately infiltrated the cave. This smoke carried along with them a particular smell; it was a scent that was hard to describe by people.The billowing smoke continuously circled into the cave. After a while, there was finally some movement. A thunderous noise appeared that shook the earth. It was as if there was a giant Earth Bull, turning over in his grave!\u201cBoom!\u201d After a loud explosion, a humongous monster rushed out from the cave. Another \u201cboom\u201d exploded; this humongous monster created a large crater on the ground when he fell down.\u201cWho dares to disturb my slumber with this unpleasant smell?!\u201d An ancient roar thundered. It was angered by being smoked out with this particular scent.Seeing this humongous monster stomping on the ground, the group of Nan Huairen was dumbfounded. This humongous monster was not a particularly dreadful beast. It was a giant snail, but a snail that knew how to speak.Seeing this humongous snail, only Li Qiye maintained his composure. At this moment, Li Qiye stood up, observed this humongous snail, and calmly said: \u201cNot too bad. To be able to achieve Six Solutions; for your tribe, this is truly not an easy task.\u201dThese words of Li Qiye greatly surprised the snail. Its two big eyes on its tentacles gazed at Li Qiye. The ancient noise resounded again, like the strike of thunder: \u201cLittle Brat, who are you? To be able to know the Six Solutions interpretation?!\u201d\u201cWho I am is irrelevant. What's important, however, is your appearance in this place!\u201d Li Qiye calmly stared at the giant snail, and he said: \u201cAs for your comment regarding the Six Solutions, it is not a big deal; even the Eighteen Solutions, I can still theorize.\u201d\u201cGood Little Brat! Speaking nonsensical rubbish!! There is no one in the world that knows the Eighteen Solutions.\u201d The giant snail shouted: \u201cNo, that is not right! If there is indeed an Eighteenth Solution, then there is exactly one person that knows.\u201dHere, the giant snail gazed intensely at Li Qiye, and his eyes triumphantly said: \u201cNot right, not right! Outside of that existence, there is no one else in this world that knows the Eighteen Solutions. You are simply a little human brat; it would be a miracle if you know the Eighteen Solutions.\u201d\u201cThe yellow peril lasting for ages, the ancient cauldron shining as deeply as the night's blue ocean, the divine scholar tree exists in the mulberry field, the Golden Crow coming and leaving\u2026\u201dAt this moment, Li Qiye opened with a profound incantation that Li Shuangyan's group essentially couldn't understand.Hearing Li Qiye's phrase, the snail was shocked in amazement. Its two eyes opened wide and glared at Li Qiye. In the blink of an eye, from under the snail's shell came a fat and gigantic hand. It suddenly grabbed Li Qiye.In just a split second, Li Qiye was gripped by the hand and moved into the sky, causing Protector Mo and Li Shuangyan to be aghast. They wanted to take action, but Li Qiye waved his sleeve, signaling for them to calm down.\u201cYou, how do you know this profound incantation?!\u201d The snail's huge eyes gazed at Li Qiye in astonishment.Li Qiye smiled, and he calmly said: \u201cIt was only the first part of the Seventh Solution incantation, nothing extraordinary; I could even say the Eighteenth Solution incantation.\u201dThe giant snail became impatient, and he couldn't wait any longer. His ancient voice yelled out: \u201cSpeak, hurry and tell me the Eighteenth Solution incantations!\u201dLi Qiye still calmly spoke: \u201cThe Eighteen Solutions is the thing that your tribe had always been searching for. For me to simply speak, it definitely won't be so easy. Follow me, and then I can think about it a little bit.\u201d\u201cIgnorant brat, you dare to negotiate conditions with this old man?!\u201d The giant snail's temper snapped, and he roared: \u201cWait until I rip apart your sea of knowledge and extract your memories; let's see if you can still hide anything!\u201dFinished speaking, one tentacle turned into a strand of universal law, and it immediately pierced the forehead of Li Qiye, directly searching Li Qiye's sea of knowledge.\u201cNot good\u2026\u201d Seeing this scene, Li Shuangyan's expression soured. She knew that the situation was not favorable.\u201cBoom!\u201d However, in a split second, the entire heaven and earth seemed to have exploded. The forehead of Li Qiye suddenly unleashed a strand of immortal light! Followed by a huge explosion, the giant snail was blown away into another corner of the world!At this moment, Li Qiye was like a grand enraged Immortal Emperor, and the immortal light from his forehead directly suppressed Nan Huairen and his master to the ground. Even Li Shuangyan wasn't able to stand steadily.Li Qiye drifted on top of the ground, and the immortal light from his forehead started to disappear. Even so, the moment this light exploded, Li Qiye was like an angry Immortal Emperor; all existences under the nine heavens and ten earths had to prostrate under this immortal light![1] These were all four words phrases, interpreting their meanings is quite difficult since they're meant to be abrupt and contextual which I am without. This is only 80% accurate at best, but the Golden Crow refers to Li Qiye I am sure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Emperor\u2019s DominationEmperor's Domination Chapter 91Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was a struggle for the fallen Nan Huairen and his master to stand up. When Li Shuangyan stood up firmly, her face was also deathly pale. The immortal explosion from earlier was truly frightening. Under this light, no matter whether it was a Royal Noble, an Enlightened Being, an Ancient Saint, or even a Heavenly King, they were merely ants and insects!At this time, Nan Huairen and his master were in awe, watching Li Qiye. They finally understood, at this moment, that Li Qiye was a terrifying existence way beyond their imaginations.\u201cYou dare to look at my sea of knowledge and search through my memories? This thing can't tell life from death!\u201d Li Qiye's expression was as cold as is. Even though his body no longer possessed the raging Immortal Emperor's aura, at this moment, he still caused others to shiver without being cold; it was as if he was a grand Immortal Emperor that was unable to be challenged.The giant snail's origin was heaven shattering, but unfortunately, he absolutely shouldn't have tried to look into Li Qiye's sea of knowledge!Since the Desolate Era from long ago, Li Qiye fell into the Immortal Demon Grotto, and his soul was sucked out to be refined into the Dark Crow. Afterward, he was involuntarily summoned back to the Immortal Demon Grotto, and his memories were read by the existence inside.It was not until much later that Li Qiye had the sufficient capacity to scheme against the whole world. He obtained the help of countless immortal sages to plan against the Immortal Demon Grotto and escaped the mind reading.From then on, Li Qiye's most dreaded fear was his sea of knowledge being opened by other people and having his memories read. After he gained power and was able to cultivate Immortal Emperors, he once again reinforced his soul, sea of knowledge, and memories.It could be said that his soul, True Fate, sea of knowledge, and memories were reinforced by Immortal Emperors. Not only Immortal Emperor Min Ren, but also Immortal Emperor Xue Xi, Immortal Emperor Tun Ri, Immortal Emperor Ba Mie, and even the Black Dragon King all reinforced his memories.If anyone touched his sea of knowledge or his memories, it would be equivalent to touching the reinforcements laid down by Immortal Emperors! They would absolutely be suppressed by the immortal reinforcement! What this meant was that besides himself, no one else could read his sea of knowledge or memories, not even Immortal Emperors!This was the result of him floating through millions of years, and the fruit of hard effort throughout the eras; he was able to defend against the one matter that he feared the most!Today, this unknowing snail dared to use a godly method to read the memories of Li Qiye, this was \u2014 without a doubt \u2014 seeking his own death!Li Qiye commanded: \u201cDrag him back here.\u201dProtector Mo and his disciple busily followed the order and left. After half a day, with loud thunderous sounds, they finally dragged the giant snail back; it was as if they were dragging a small mountain.The giant snail dragged in front of Li Qiye was motionless.Nan Huairen dragged him here and asked: \u201cOldest Brother, is he already dead?\u201d\u201cI'm only temporarily sparing his life. It'll depend on his performance.\u201d Li Qiye commanded: \u201cTake out the pot and the medicines, then cook him.\u201dProtector Mo and his disciple immediately took out the huge pot from his magical storage, and they threw all of the medicinal herbs inside. They put in the giant snail as well.It didn't take long before the water in the pot started to boil, and all of the medicines became a medicinal concoction.At this moment, the giant snail slowly but eventually regained his consciousness. Even though he woke up, he couldn't move because of the Immortal Emperor's suppression! At this moment, he was the meat on the chopping block, leaving Li Qiye to do whatever he wanted to him!\u201cYou, who are you?\u201d Submerged in the pot, he struggled to have his tentacles reach outside of the water. He opened his huge eyes to look at Li Qiye. His eyes were filled with horror. This person's memories were protected by Immortal Emperors! Who on earth was he?Seeing the fourteen-year-old boy in front of him, this matter was simply impossible to understand. The last Immortal Emperor's era was thirty thousand years ago. Logically speaking, this boy in front of him essentially couldn't meet with an Immortal Emperor.However, this boy before him had clearly not only met with an Immortal Emperor. The protection inside the boy's sea of knowledge suppressed him in just a flash. This impression left a heavy mark on him, completely unerasable. Under this absolute power, the fear in the deepest part of his soul realized that it could only be from an Immortal Emperor!At this moment, Li Qiye's expression was much better. He slowly replied: \u201cWho I am is no longer important. You have encroached upon my most important taboo.\u201dUnknowingly, the moment Li Qiye's expression became normal, the other three sighed a huge breath of relief. When Li Qiye was enraged, they felt a heavy boulder taking away their breath, like a furious Immortal Emperor, instilling fear into their souls!\u201cYou\u2026 What are you doing\u2026?\u201d At this time, the giant snail knew that trouble was coming, and he asked as he lost all colors.Li Qiye leisurely said: \u201cWhat else is there but to cook you in the pot? You tell me what I am doing? Cooking your longevity blood, and at the same time, cooking a nice snail soup to ease us in this hot sun. They have never tasted nor tried this kind of dish, before; maybe after they try it, they'll never be able to forget it.\u201dThe giant snail yelled out: \u201cThis, this is absolutely impossible! M-my body isn't something that a mortal flame can refine, nor can I be boiled by ordinary water!\u201dLi Qiye smiled and said: \u201cSomeone else would try that, but, as for me, ah! I would never attempt this. If I know your origin, then I can immediately deal with you. Do you know what the water boiling you consist of? This is definitely a recipe to cook a snail soup; it is not only delicious, but it is also extremely nutritious!\u201dHearing these words, the snail couldn't help but taste the medicinal concoction inside the pot. Tasting this, he was immediately frightened. These medicinal herbs, once combined, would definitely remove his body's protection!At this moment, Li Qiye jumped onto the pot. He took out the Invisible Dual Blades and slowly said: \u201cYou should know that taking the blood of your tribe is an art. I'm aware that your body is like a treasure, impervious to weapons and Life Treasures; however, after being boiled in such a concoction, you should be clear about the consequences!\u201dFinished speaking, he unleashed a blade as fast as lightning.In the blink of an eye, Li Qiye left many blade-shaped cuts on the giant snail's body. Marks and marks intertwined together, creating a mysterious pattern. This pattern seemed like it was just a formation, but it was also a sermon of the heavens. It was a profound dao that collapsed the defense of the giant snail!At this time, inside the many lines left behind by the blades, blood slowly seeped out. These drops of blood were extremely beautiful; they were like priceless jewels. They dripped down into the pot and mixed together with the medicinal concoction, emitting wave after wave of charming medicinal fragrances that caused others to drool and swallow their saliva.\u201cLongevity blood\u2026\u201d Seeing the drops of blood dripping down, Protector Mo was quite moved. To cultivators, longevity blood was extremely precious. There was a saying that one drop of blood was equal to ten thousand drops of worldly essence.This method of Li Qiye caused the giant snail to be scared out of his soul. The snail belonged to a mysterious creation; it was not part of the Demon race, Heavenly Beasts, nor the Longevity Spirits. Its origin was heaven shaking and it was extremely rare in this world.They had a body that could be considered impenetrable, but today, Li Qiye knew how to open their defenses; he also knew the method of obtaining their longevity blood. He knew that he had met his nemesis today!Feeling the loss of his longevity blood, the giant snail felt his soul being sucked out and his True Fate becoming weaker and weaker. If this continued, he would truly be boiled into a pot of snail soup.Finally, the heart of the giant snail shivered as he yelled: \u201cYou, what do you want? Y-you, say what you want to say!\u201d If he kept on acting strong, then he would truly become a boiled snail soup!Li Qiye took a while before he slowly glared at him. Finally, he spoke: \u201cHow about this? I just happen to be lacking a mount, so you can be by my side.\u201dLi Qiye's words caused the group of Nan Huairen, standing at the side, to be silent. A grand character always picked a mount with a nice external appearance. Not to mention the types of supreme existences like True Dragons or Phoenixes, but even a dragon horse was cooler than this giant snail in front of them.The giant snail contemplated over Li Qiye's words. Even though their tribe's numbers were few, they had a proud history. Not to mention, its cultivation was absolutely powerful. Becoming a mount for a human; this would be unbearable to him.Li Qiye glared at the silent giant snail and said: \u201cDon't be prideful just because of your three parts bloodline. Even if the patriarch of your first tribe was still alive, seeing me, he could only call himself a junior!\u201dLi Qiye's words shocked the snail. Its huge eyes looked at Li Qiye and asked: \u201cYou, who are you?!\u201d\u201cWho I am is not important. Either you follow me or I will boil you and turn you into soup.\u201d Li Qiye happily said: \u201cIn the future, if you diligently work hard with loyalty, I will pass down the Twelve Solutions to you!\u201dThis phrase from Li Qiye caused the snail to be ecstatic. He wasn't willing to become a mount for Li Qiye, and he would even prefer being boiled into a meat soup; however, when it came to the Twelve Solutions, this was a completely different matter.He was aware that since the beginning of time until now, only one existence knew the Twelve Solutions, but Li Qiye clearly was not this existence!\u201cGood, I promise you!\u201d The giant snail surrendered by making a choice.Li Qiye was without any surprise and said: \u201cUse your True Fate to make the oath.\u201dIn the end, the giant snail swore with his True Fate. This scene caused Nan Huairen and his master to be touched. A True Fate oath, to cultivators, was an extremely serious matter. Once the oath was made, one absolutely had to comply with the oath. If violated, they would be subjected to a backlash.Of course, a True Fate oath had to be willingly taken by both parties.After making the vow, Li Qiye let Nan Huairen and Protector Mo drag him out of the iron pot.[1] I think the author made a mistake here, it should be the Eighteen Solutions, not the Twelve. Unless 12-18 were all unknown by their tribe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This one pot was made from his own Longevity Blood, ah!\u201cSo? You don't want to drink? If you don't want to drink, the two of them will drink it all!\u201d Li Qiye pointed at Nan Huairen and his master.\u201cDrink, I will drink, why would I not drink?\u201d The giant snail was actually afraid that the master and disciple would compete with him so he rushed into the giant pot to drink gulp by gulp. The medicinal pot was made from his own Longevity Blood; if he didn't drink it, then his loss would be even greater. His wounds would require a longer time to recover, too.Finally, the giant snail finished the whole medicinal pot, and he took a deep breath. He just took a trip from hell and back.Here, Li Qiye commanded the giant snail, saying: \u201cWithdraw your body.\u201dThe giant snail crushed his incantations, and he quickly transformed. A thin, old man with dried flesh appeared in front of them. There were two tiny pairs of flesh on his forehead, and, at the same time, there was also a small shell behind him that seemed like a shield.\u201cYikes, this is, this is your true body?\u201d Nan Huairen was a little dazed. The old man in front of them versus his initial form was too contrasting. The snail was like a small mountain, but this thin and dried old man in front of them seemed as if a breeze could fall him in one pass.\u201cNo, this is my second body.\u201d The old man shook his head, and he smiled: \u201cEarlier was my real body.\u201d\u201cThis old man is Niu Fen; earlier, I was blinded by greed and my eyes were obscured by a single leaf, offending this Young Noble.\u201d\u201cHic\u2026 Niu Fen\u2026\u201d Hearing his words, Nan Huairen rolled his eyes wide open as he asked: \u201cThere, there is such a name like this?\u201dThe old man gazed at Nan Huairen. He somewhat embarrassingly said: \u201cIt is Niu Fen, Fen as in to put in effort!\u201d\u201cMy misunderstanding, my misunderstanding!\u201d Nan Huairen was embarrassed; he forced a smile while he busily apologized.Even Li Shuangyan, standing to the side, wanted to laugh, but she couldn't under the current circumstances; she decided to hide her amusement in her heart.Without the giant body from earlier, the current Niu Fen, who was thin and wizened, gave Nan Huairen a warm feeling, causing him to be much more friendly.He then asked Niu Fen: \u201cGrandpa Niu, you are digging a hole in the Ancient Land of our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect; what are you trying to find? Don't tell me you want to find the treasures of our sect\u2026\u201d\u201cI am just digging casually. Also, this place has been visited by countless amounts of people. If there really was a treasure, it wouldn't be my turn to find it.\u201d Niu Fen angrily glared at Nan Huairen.\u201cIf Grandpa Niu isn't here to dig for treasures, why did you dig such a deep hole?\u201d Nan Huairen didn't give up and continued to question him.Li Qiye glanced at Niu Fen and said: \u201cHe is looking for the God of Calamity.\u201d\u201cGod of Calamity? Who is the God of Calamity?\u201d Nan Huairen was at a loss; he stared at Li Qiye, and then he looked at Niu Fen.Protector Mo's expression was shaken; he stared at Niu Fen, and he said with surprise: \u201cHe is trying to find the Heavenly Guardian of our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect!\u201dHearing these two words \u201cHeavenly Guardian\u201d, Nan Huairen was also surprised, exclaiming: \u201cIn the legends, it is said to be the strongest existence in our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect! With the exception of the Patriarch, no one was able to win a match against the Heavenly Guardian!\u201dNiu Fen had to admit the truth: \u201cI was simply looking; I heard your Heavenly Guardian had left much earlier. I only wanted to go through this land to see if the great elder had left some words behind; perhaps I could have stumbled upon something profound.\u201dNan Huairen had heard about the Heavenly Guardian before, so he couldn't help but murmur: \u201cIf the Heavenly Guardian was still here, then our Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect wouldn't be like it is today.\u201dThere were many legends about the Heavenly Guardian of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.Heavenly Guardians \u2014 not all sects have them. Only the extremely powerful sects or fateful sects were able to have Heavenly Guardians.As for the origin of the Heavenly Guardian, there was essentially no limitation. It could be a Heavenly Beast, a Longevity Spirit, or maybe even other existences! Under many circumstances, the Heavenly Guardians exist alongside their sects; after the sect was destroyed, the Heavenly Guardians could leave.The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect once had a Heavenly Guardian; this protector was called the God of Calamity! This Heavenly Guardian was extremely strong. It was so strong that the future generations believed that even during the era of Min Ren, outside of Min Ren himself, no one could oppose this Heavenly Guardian! Later on, when the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was able to stand strong, to a certain extent, it was due to this existence.Regarding the origin of the protector, there were many different legends. One stated that the protector came from a Burial Ground. Another believed that the protector was born in the Ancient Earth. Some believed that it was subdued by Immortal Emperor Min Ren from an external space.The Heavenly Guardian guarded the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect era after era but one day, it suddenly left for unknown reasons. Afterward, it completely disappeared without a trace and no one had ever seen it again.Many people assumed that it disappeared fifty thousand years ago. Even more people thought that it left much earlier; however, they could only guess since the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect simply withheld the information from others.As for why it suddenly left after protecting the sect for so long, no one knew. Even the disciples of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect during that period was unaware! It became a mystery without an answer.At this moment, Protector Mo asked Li Qiye: \u201cYoung Master, where are we going now? Are we returning back?\u201d\u201cNo, all of you will bury me underground.\u201d\u201cBury? Bury underground?\u201d Hearing Li Qiye's words, Nan Huairen was stupefied. After recovering, he said: \u201cOldest Brother, this, this is an ominous sign, ah.\u201dLi Qiye didn't want to waste words. He commanded Protector Mo: \u201cBury me, now.\u201dLi Qiye chose the location and was buried at the highest peak of the Ancient Land. In addition, it was very deep underground. Niu Fen had to personally dig a hole for Li Qiye before being able to place him down.\u201cIs Oldest Brother okay?\u201d Li Qiye suddenly wanted to bury himself \u2014 this greatly shocked Nan Huairen. If his Oldest Brother was not completely normal at the moment, he would have thought that Li Qiye might have become crazy.\u201cIt is all right.\u201d Li Shuangyan shook her head; she didn't say anything else. Even though she didn't know why Li Qiye wanted to bury himself, she knew that there must be reasons for his actions.\u201cIt is only a kind of ritual.\u201d Niu Fen carefully observed Li Qiye's chosen location, the method of the burial, and he finally said: \u201cThis is an extremely rare ritual that can be considered a method of communication.\u201dNan Huairen couldn't hold onto his curiosity, so he asked: \u201cCommunication? With what? What kind of existence is he trying to communicate with by burying himself so deep?\u201dRegarding Nan Huairen's inquisition, Niu Fen didn't give an answer. He didn't know what Li Qiye was trying to communicate with, but he felt that this matter was extremely important!Li Qiye was buried underneath the earth for five days and five nights. Finally, he personally crawled up from the ground.\u201cWe shall go back.\u201d In the end, he only said this sentence after crawling up from the mud.Nan Huairen's heart was simmering with curiosity. He really wanted to ask but seeing the disappointment on Li Qiye's face, he didn't dare to do so. If Li Qiye didn't want to say it, it would be of no avail no matter who asked.Eventually, Niu Fen used his true body to carry the group of Li Qiye back. When he shifted back to his true body, his crawling speed made Nan Huairen's jaw drop to the floor. It could be compared with lightning! He was incredibly fast, and many flying treasures wouldn't be able to keep up with this speed.What was more amazing was that he could crawl in complete silence or be extremely thunderous; it was completely under his control, and no matter the style he chose, the speed remained the same.Sitting on the snail's back, Nan Huairen was completely stunned. In fact, even his master was astonished. This was their first time riding a snail, and it was also the fastest snail.Thinking about what Li Qiye had said, Nan Huairen curiously asked: \u201cGrandpa Niu, what is a Heavenly Ancestral Snail?\u201d This name, he had never heard of it before. The Heavenly Ancestral Snail was a name that was very foreign to him.\u201cA very rare and ancient existence that, after they became their own tribe, people in this world would rarely see.\u201d Niu Fen didn't get a chance to answer before Li Qiye started speaking.Seeing Li Qiye's mood improving, Nan Huairen became emboldened and smiled: \u201cOldest Brother, the Eighteen Solutions you spoke of, what is it?\u201dLi Qiye only glanced at him, he didn't say anything.\u201cIt is the True Fate Solution of our Heavenly Ancestral Calamity.\u201dNiu Fen answered. He yearned for Li Qiye to speak of the Eighteen Solutions because it was very important to him.Nan Huairen continued: \u201cTrue Fate Solution? This is a technique? Or is it an Emperor Merit Law?\u201dNiu Fen quickly shook his head and said: \u201cNo, it is not a technique, and not a profound truth either. In some sense, it was the true solution to break the cursed shackles of our Heavenly Ancestral Calamity.\u201d\u201cShackles? Eighteen chains of shackles? Once freed from the eighteen shackles, what would happen?\u201d Nan Huairen continuously asked many questions.Niu Fen contemplated for a moment before he finally replied: \u201cI don't know this myself because I have never heard of another kin member being able to learn the Eighteen Solutions. I only heard of some legends that once had obtained the Eighteen Solutions; if there are Gods in the heavens, then we would be able to slay Gods!\u201dHearing this, not only Nan Huairen, but Li Shuangyan was also shocked. Slaying Gods?! What kind of shocking words were these? Finally, they understood why Niu Fen was willing to be a servant.As for Li Qiye, he simply smiled. The Eighteen Solutions was a distant memory for him. It was not a technique nor a secret method; this was why this part of his memories had not been erased![1] Young Noble here is gong zi \u2013 think of it as a young master/young sir but commands more respects and imply the person to have some talents/skills. In the wuxia world, anyone called gong zi, you know they will be a bad ass/handsome.[2] A Chinese snail is Gua + Niu = Snail. Niu alone = Bull(ox). His name is Niu(Bull) + Fen(effort) but Nan Huairen thought it was Niu(Bull) Fen(Shit).

Seeing Li Qiye's group riding on top of a giant snail, Elder Sun was stunned; this snail was so fast that it was downright illogical.However, Elder Sun wasn't in the mood to talk about this. He looked at Li Qiye and hurriedly said: \u201cThank the heaven and earth that you are all finally back.\u201dHe then busily brought Li Qiye down from the giant snail.Elder Sun anxiously told Li Qiye: \u201cYou need to go to the ancestral chamber, fast; there might be a fight.\u201dSeeing his worried look, Li Qiye asked: \u201cEnemies from outside? Or is it that the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom has finally arrived at our door?\u201dSeeing Li Qiye's slow and calm words, Elder Sun couldn't do anything else but explain: \u201cNo, the sect master is back, and she's inside the ancestral chamber. Elder Gu's group is quarreling with the sect master! You should still hurry and see!\u201d\u201cThe sect master\u2026\u201d Elder Sun's answer was outside of Li Qiye's expectation. Regarding Sect Master Su Yonghuang, Li Qiye didn't have half an impression. One could even say that, regarding this master that he got by chance, he never really paid attention to or asked about her.Su Yonghuang's current return surprised Li Qiye. He calmly said: \u201cGood, I should meet this master after all.\u201dFinished speaking, he went inside.Niu Fen turned his body back into his second form. He became the old man once again, walking alongside Li Qiye. Seeing a giant snail turning into an old man, Elder Sun couldn't help but become lost in a daze; however, at this moment, he also didn't have time to ask about this matter.This time, inside the ancestral chamber, the elders almost flipped the table. The elders, as the highest power in charge of the current Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, should be maintaining their composure, yet at this moment, Elder Zhou and his group were all glaring with their eyes wide open. The subject of their gazes was the current sect master, Su Yonghuang, of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect.Only Elder Gu's attitude was pleasant. He simply sat in his place and didn't speak a single world.Su Yonghuang, as the sect master, was, in fact, not welcomed by the upper echelon. The reason was simple, Su Yonghuang didn't have any credentials or experience inside the sect. One could even say that she was not a disciple of the sect.Su Yonghuang's sudden appearance and becoming the sect master was an extremely sudden matter. The entire sect was not prepared for it, and they didn't even know about such a character.Her becoming the sect master was because the previous sect master was still alive. At that time, there were two or three Supreme Elders who were still alive. There was even one Supreme Elder who had lived for a very long time and was rumored to be part of the fight thirty thousand years ago; he was in isolated cultivation due to his mortal wound.Regarding the specific circumstances of this matter, no one was very clear about it with the exception of First Elder Gu Tieshou. Anyways, Su Yonghuang was declared to be the next sect master by the previous one. This decision was supported by all of the Supreme Elders. The oldest Supreme Elder even summoned Gu Tieshou, and he personally persuaded him.To sum it all up, after one night, Gu Tieshou agreed with Su Yonghuang taking the seat of Sect Master. In reality, at that time, the entire sect was in an uproar. This matter was too great; a person who no one knew suddenly became the new sect master. This matter was truly hard for the sect to accept.At that time, Gu Tieshou earnestly persuaded the group of Elder Zhou, and he suppressed the majority of the disciples who were strongly opposing Su Yonghuang. Thus, the matter was settled.However, Su Yonghuang herself seemed to know her situation. As the sect master, she didn't stay behind in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. She instead brought along a small group of disciples, including a few sectional leaders. Afterward, Su Yonghuang was the sect master and was located on the outskirts of the sect. She essentially didn't interfere with the internal affairs; however, she still kept in contact with the sect.Fortunately, with this decision, the sect finally calmed down. The six elders became the main deciders of any big decisions of the sect from then on.It could be said that, when Su Yonghuang was the sect master, First Elder Gu Tieshou was the grand contributor to the sect. Before her appearance, Gu Tieshou was the first to inherit the seat as he was the most qualified for the position.Gu Tieshou was the direct disciple of the last sect master, and he was also the most experienced within the first generation disciples, who had been in the sect for the longest amount of time. Not only this, he was also diligent and dedicated to the entire sect.If at that time, Gu Tieshou didn't persuade Elder Zhou's group, no one else would have been able to convince the rest of the upper echelon.Because Gu Tieshou was willing to give up his position and also personally took charge of the matter, Su Yonghuang was able to become the sect master.That very same Su Yonghuang who was always outside decided to come back today. Su Yonghuang had never come back to the sect with the exception of when the previous sect master passed away.Her reason for returning this time was because of the Evil Infested Ridge. She wanted to take some disciples into the Evil Infested Ridge. This was immediately subjected to opposition from Elder Zhou's group.Currently, in the eyes of the sect's upper echelon, such as Elder Zhou, Li Qiye was the leader for the sect's revitalization. He was the driver of the sect. Su Yonghuang's return naturally was opposed by the upper echelon. Plus, they didn't trust her. How could they hand over the disciples to her?Because of this, the two sides almost flipped the table on each other. Frankly speaking, the group of Elder Zhou didn't agree for Su Yonghuang to take charge of the sect no matter what.After bringing Li Qiye inside, Elder Sun hurriedly told everyone present: \u201cGood, it is good now. Li Qiye is back. Everyone can slowly talk.\u201dSeeing Li Qiye's return, the group of Elder Zhou finally breathed a sigh of relief, and the atmosphere inside the ancestral chamber clearly eased up.At this time, Tu Buyu, who was standing behind Su Yonghuang, smiled as he kindly said: \u201cBig Brother, this is our master and also our sect master.\u201dRegarding the address of \u201cSect Master\u201d, Elder Zhou's group let out a scowl as they were clearly irritated.Li Qiye observed Su Yonghuang, and he was not without astonishment! The Su Yonghuang in front of him was a woman, a very young woman at that!The woman before him seemed to be around twenty or so and possessed a charming and noble presence; she was wearing a faintly yellow robe, causing her nobility to be even more apparent. Regarding the woman in front of his eyes, her forehead was like the moon and she had eyes like the stars. Her most attractive feature was her elegant brows; they were like swords, causing her elegant charm to have three parts domineering presence. It was as if she was the heaven's royal daughter, possessing a matchless imperial air along with an unmatched grace.Comparing beauty, Li Shuangyan next to Li Qiye was not less than the woman ahead; however, Li Shuangyan didn't have the matchless imperial atmosphere along with this unmatched grace.When Li Qiye was looking at her, Su Yonghuang was also checking him out. The master and disciple were analyzing each other.Li Qiye's wits returned, and he glanced at Nan Huairen next to him, saying: \u201cYou never told me that the sect master was a woman.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Nan Huairen was stunned for a moment, and he forcefully smiled as he whispered: \u201cBrother didn't ask, ah! I thought you already knew.\u201dLi Qiye was a bit speechless. Up until now, he had always thought that Su Yonghuang was a man. Tu Buyu, as her disciple, was more than one thousand years old so his master, Su Yonghuang, should also be an old man with gray hair that was around six or seven thousand years old. However, Li Qiye didn't expect that Su Yonghuang was a woman around the age of twenty-five and possessed extreme beauty.At this moment, Gu Tieshou wanted to smooth things over, so he said: \u201cQiye, the sect master wants to bring disciples to the Evil Infested Ridge.\u201dSu Yonghuang looked at Li Qiye and then said: \u201cThe Evil Infested Ridge, to our current Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, is the best place for training; it is also the time where we harvest materials. From my calculations, it is half a year away at most, and the soonest is around three months. At that time, the Evil Infested Ridge will open. This is the one and only opportunity in a hundred years and our sect cannot afford to let it go.\u201dLi Qiye spoke as he gently nodded his head: \u201cI'm fairly clear on this. Sixty-three days later, the Evil Infested Ridge will definitely open.\u201d The moment when he was buried underground, he also found out when the ridge would open.Gu Tieshou asked Li Qiye: \u201cThen what is your opinion?\u201dAt this moment, all of the elders were looking at Li Qiye. In their hearts, Elder Zhou's group wanted Li Qiye to become the sect master of the sect.\u201cMay I have a little talk with the sect master?\u201d Eventually, Li Qiye said to the group of Gu Tieshou.Gu Tieshou and the others looked at each other. In the end, they all agreed with Li Qiye's request.Li Qiye returned to Lonely Peak, and Li Shuangyan and the others all took their leave. Inside the small courtyard, only Li Qiye and Su Yonghuang, as well as Tu Buyu who was standing behind Su Yonghuang, were present.Li Qiye stared at Su Yonghuang, and he was silent for a long time. Certain memories came back to him. After a while, Li Qiye finally said: \u201cIs the Heaven's Edge Su Clan doing all right?\u201dLi Qiye's words greatly changed Su Yonghuang's expression. Even Tu Buyu was shocked. Su Yonghuang looked at him and emotionally exclaimed: \u201cHow do you know about the Heaven's Edge?! In the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, outside of Grandpa Tu, no one else knew about the Heaven's Edge Su Clan!\u201dAs soon as Li Qiye opened his mouth, he immediately spoke of her origin. How could Su Yonghuang not be surprised? The Heaven's Edge Su Clan's name never appeared in this world, and no one knew about it in the Nine Worlds.After calming his emotions, Li Qiye nonchalantly smiled and said: \u201cThe Patriarch simply told me in my dreams.\u201d[1] Heaven's Edge means the other end of the world / a faraway place in this usage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
