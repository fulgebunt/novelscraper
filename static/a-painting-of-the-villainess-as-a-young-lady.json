The woman who requested for her own imprisonmentTranslated by YonneeThe woman stared blankly at the ceiling above her and blinked slowly.Out of the blue, Violet S. Everett recalled her previous life.Truthfully, the term \u2018out of the blue\u2019 didn\u2019t truly encapsulate her experience of remembrance. There was an incident that served as a trigger to her memories, and that trigger was a near-death experience.At the expense of having to go through a deathly crisis, she was given the chance to recall her previous life and could now calmly reflect on her actions. Could this perhaps be called a blessing in disguise?As she slowly regained consciousness, Violet thought.What is happiness?\u00a0She wished to experience that, even if it was something from a distant place that she couldn\u2019t dare reach.And so, after three days and nights of teetering between life and death, the very moment she woke up, the first thing that the ducal princess did was to visit her father.She asked Duke Everett,\u2014Please confine me to the annex.* * *There was a tendency for human beings to pursue happiness in their lives. However, such happiness was abstract, like a mirage that one could not easily touch with one\u2019s own hands\u2014something that one would yearn for during an entire lifetime, but could not easily reach.It was near, and yet so impossible to catch\u2026\u201cWhat are you even thinking, Violet?\u201dAs she had been lost in thought, the low voice brought her back to reality. His tone sounded as if there was a surging anger threatening to burst through.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dViolet did not answer his question. The reason why she came here was apparent.Three days and nights had passed since the eldest daughter of the Everett Duchy had almost drowned in a lake.So many people had come to visit the ducal princess after she rose again. A doctor came to examine the ducal princess\u2019 condition, a priest came to pray for her and wish her peace, and various servants also came to tend to the ducal princess. It seemed like there was no end to them.And amongst all those people, there was one person she wished hadn\u2019t come. It was Mikhail, the eldest son of the household, Violet\u2019s older brother.\u201cI asked you\u2014what were you thinking?!\u201dAs the loud voice growled out again, Violet grimaced. She did not answer because she didn\u2019t want to deal with him, however Mikhail continued to pressure her.This was how he was treating his younger sister, who had just come back from death\u2019s door.Still silent, Violet sat up from the bed. She hadn\u2019t yet fully recovered, so even the smallest of movements taxed on her greatly.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI heard from Father that you asked him to\u00a0imprison\u00a0you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Haa.\u201d\u201cWhat are you scheming? Are you threatening us with your life now? Are you trying to do some sort of protest under the public eye?\u201d\u201cMy head\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you not going to answer?!\u201dThe conversation went around and around with no sign of a fruitful exchange.Why was the eldest son of a ducal household acting so unrefined? Whether or not Violet was to click her tongue at his behavior, Mikhail was completely obstinate.\u201cI don\u2019t know what scheme you think I have. I\u2019ve had a chance to realize my mistakes and reflect on myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ha. No matter how you try to cover it up nicely, that kind of talk\u2026\u201dWhen she gave him a proper answer, the answer that came back was still full of rage. In any case, they were empty words. She didn\u2019t care either, and so she shrugged.\u201cI\u2019m tired, so could you please leave? With my current state, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s anything I can do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOr are you going to continue yelling and shouting in your younger sister\u2019s room in such an uncultured manner?\u201d\u201c\u2026Just you wait. Violet, whatever you\u2019re up to, you\u2019re not going to have your way.\u201dThus, the not-so-conversation came to an end. Mikhail left the room feeling more enraged than when he first entered through the door.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs soon as Mikhail left, Violet arranged herself in her seat, but she soon frowned at the immediate knock that followed outside the door.They\u2019re not even giving her a break. The moment the short permission of,\u00a0Come in,\u00a0left her lips, two people came in. They were also familiar to her.\u201cS-Sister.\u201dFluffy pink hair fluttered behind the person who spoke along with every step she took. Her tear-soaked face looked as if she was about to cry again.On the other hand, another person who had platinum blond hair beside the girl had a smile on his lips and an unreadable expression on his face the entire time.Violet let out a deep sigh.\u201cI-I was worried about you. I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re all safe and sound\u2026\u201dThe lovely young woman expressed her concern for Violet in a bell-like voice. Glad to see you\u2019re safe, she said.How adorably she smiled with such a kind expression\u2026 that you\u2019d think it was all just fake.Violet calmed down as she tried to act how she usually would. On top of her body already being in this kind of condition, being agitated wouldn\u2019t do her any good.\u201cWhy are you lying, Eileen. You don\u2019t have any use for worrying about me.\u201d\u201cS-Sister?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not happy at all that you came all this way to say things like that\u2026 You must be quite absorbed in that role of yours, this ruse that\u00a0you\u2019re\u00a0the good sister. If you\u2019ve come to me, then you must know that only spite would greet you back.\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just because her ire had not been roused didn\u2019t mean that Violet would hold back on what she\u2019d say.Meanwhile, the young man next to her was smiling the entire time with a truly unreadable expression that it was impossible to read what\u2019s on his mind. It was the Everett Duchy\u2019s second son, Roen.Glancing briefly to Roen, Eileen let out her tears.\u201cWhat are you saying, Sister! It\u2019s natural for me to worry about you because we\u2019re family. Even though you don\u2019t like me\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you knew I wouldn\u2019t want you to be here, then you shouldn\u2019t have come. I already have a headache as it is. It\u2019s going to get worse because of you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Eileen came here to see you because she was worried about you. Why are you being so cold?\u201dRight. A smile dawned upon Violet\u2019s lips at the young man\u2019s sudden interruption. She was wondering why the two of them came together, but she realized now. It\u2019s this.\u201cNo, Brother, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Eileen said. \u201cEven if Sister says that\u2026\u201dThe slender girl looked hurt and it seemed like tears would fall at any moment as she dissuaded her older brother. There was no indication that it was merely a short performance.Watching them like this, one would wonder who the real blood-related siblings were here. Snorting, Violet could be seen smiling slightly.\u201cIt\u2019s becoming a problem that you\u2019re so forgiving. Violet, you should know how to be more careful, but you\u2019re always throwing such sharp words.\u201d\u201cIf you didn\u2019t want to get stabbed, then you shouldn\u2019t have come here. Why must I welcome you?\u201d\u201cEven when you say that, you\u2019re being unusually meek, aren\u2019t you.\u201d\u201cI almost died, didn\u2019t I? Stop.\u201d\u201cYes, sure, the way you speak is still the same.\u201d\u201cDo you think a person can change in an instant?\u201dRoen laughed sardonically as he noticed the sly way Violet had changed her words and attitude\u2014formal one moment, informal the next. The only one here who\u2019s at the edge of her seat for no reason was Eileen.Unable to bear to just stand by as the real brother and sister talked, Eileen dissuaded Roen again.\u201cI really am fine, Brother. I know that Sister hates me because I\u2019m not good enough\u2026\u00a0Hiic,\u00a0I, I really want to be close to Sister, but\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Eileen. It\u2019s not your fault. Never mind, Violet seems to still be in a terrible mood today, so let\u2019s just go back.\u201dAt the retreating pair, Violet wordlessly watched them walk away and quietly raised a middle finger at them.Roen and Eileen had long since had their backs turned on her, so they did not see the vulgar action that the eldest daughter of this ducal household had just made.Her surroundings grew quiet only after all the uninvited guests had finally left.She could finally have some peace and quiet. Violet quickly lay back down on her bed, else someone might come again.Having already faced Mikhail, Roen and Eileen, she was more tired than ever now.She was grateful that her younger brother, the third son Cairn, was now at the academy.Violet\u2014no, Yeon Ha-yoon was finally left to her own world, and so she closed her eyes happily.* * *Violet S. Everett, the eldest daughter of the Everett Duchy, a household that had an extensive history.The monikers she had were not just empty words. Most wicked villainess of all time. Green-eyed monster who\u2019s eternally jealous of her sister. Everett\u2019s evil witch with an ice-cold heart.It\u2019s a wonder how she ended up with these kinds of nicknames. However Violet, or Yeon Ha-yoon, did not deny these titles that had been attributed to her.Out of the blue, she suddenly remembered her previous life.For her to have remembered her previous life after falling right into a lake and having a near-death experience, wasn\u2019t it so ridiculously contrived?Even novels wouldn\u2019t be this predictable,\u00a0Violet complained inwardly.Perhaps to clarify her situation, she had not transmigrated. Though if she were to categorize it, then she could say that she had reincarnated. She remained true to her identity as Violet, who she had lived as for nineteen years thus far. It just so happened that she recalled her previous life\u2019s memories. Because of that, she felt no such disconnect to her current self.She had lived her previous life and unfortunately back then. And here, she was reborn and she somehow recalled her previous life.If one were to define Yeon Ha-yoon\u2019s life, then it would be with this word: pathetic. As for Violet\u2019s life, then: harsh.The family she had been born into was a ducal household which had an extended history. As she had two older brothers and one younger brother, she was born as the sole daughter who was raised like the most precious jewel there ever was in the world.Nevertheless, Violet\u2019s life was exceedingly harsh.It was during the spring of the year she turned eight years old that her life turned for the worse\u2014when Eileen, Violet\u2019s younger cousin, entered the Everett family as a ducal princess and interfered.t/n: [IMPORTANT] i\u2019ve recently lost contact with my raw provider for this novel so i only have a handful of raw chapters available to me right now. that being said, updates will be very slow until i get ahold of another raw provider .if you or any of your friends can access R15 content on KKP and are willing to provide raws for me, please contact me on discord! you can ping me at the Travis Translations server or dm me directly at mikee#1150.i would love to update this novel more frequently, but in a bit of a pickle right now.thank you!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The wicked woman who did all the worst bullying, framing and manipulating towards an innocent girl.These weren\u2019t lies. When Yeon Ha-yoon looked back on the past, it\u2019s true that Violet had done many misdeeds.She hated Aileen.So, she tormented her.She\u2019d been associated with such unruly behavior ever since she was young, so it was thanks to this that the prejudices people had over her were impossible to alleviate. Rather than their own younger sister, Violet\u2019s older brothers took care of Aileen, who was their cousin.\u2018Nanny said something to me. The previous duchess is a gorgeous woman who has beautiful golden blonde hair, but why is Sister\u2019s hair silver?\u2019Recalling what Aileen had said when they were children, both Violet and Yeon Ha-yoon had the same reaction. They just pressed down the urge to smile helplessly.It\u2019s all meaningless now. It\u2019s become meaningless.That she tried to be recognized by her family, that she tried to be loved, that she tried to survive in this hellish ducal household and live.As the memories of her previous life came back to her, the two personalities blended together.The person she was now was Violet but not Violet, was Yeon Ha-yoon but not Yeon Ha-yoon. So, she decided to redraw her life.\u2014To leave everything in this reality behind. To confine myself, alone.* * *The first thing Violet did was to visit her father, even as she was still wearing her nightgown.Her body had yet to recover, so she obviously looked gaunt no matter who saw her.Despite his daughter\u2019s sudden visit, the Duke did not show any indication of unrest.The nineteen continuous years of trying to instill her with the values of a ducal princess was no more. Only silence, as sharp as a knife, loomed inside the duke\u2019s office.Duke Everett neatly swept back his black hair and looked at Violet with a calm gaze. Those eyes gave off the same impression as a lake in the middle of a snowy winter.For all her life\u2014 for all her life, she just wished that he would look her way, even with those cold eyes.The girl took a brief moment to sympathize with herself during this life. She lost her mother at a young age and his father was an indifferent man, so how could it have been possible to receive the love and affection she needed?While she yearned for the attention of the people who wouldn\u2019t even look at her, she lived persistently.For a few days, the servants discussed amongst themselves whether the ducal princess had finally gone crazy because of her behavior. Violet snorted at them and ignored their chattering.Did you also want me to die?Since my life is worthless and has no use at all, why did you spend such an astronomical amount of money to save me?Yeon Ha-yoon, Violet smiled at the duke, who did not even give her a single grain of attention.\u201cI would like to ask one question, Your Grace. To you, what am I? A daughter or a tool to be used?\u201dShe took on an elegant posture as she asked with a voice that was entirely graceful.Violet\u2019s question was both blunt and disrespectful. Even if Duke Everett were to yell at her here, it was very much warranted.But instead of condemning her for her insolence, the duke responded to the question by raising his head and looking straight into Violet\u2019s eyes.The two gazes intertwined in the air.Deep purple eyes that were like bottomless lakes, and green eyes that were good at concealing one\u2019s innermost thoughts from the experience of being a duke for a long time.The time they sized each other up was but a moment. Without any hesitation, Violet asked once more.\u201cLet me ask you again. Your Grace, to you, am I a daughter or a tool?\u201d\u201c\u2026What kind of ruckus is this now.\u201d\u201cEver since my close brush with death, my feelings have changed. There\u2019s something that I wish to do.\u201dThe ducal princess\u2019 tone was remarkably tranquil.If it was this easy to let go of one\u2019s expectations, why couldn\u2019t she let go of such expectations to be acknowledged by this household. Even if she was considered to be merely a tool, she was still being valued, to a certain extent.Of course, considering who Violet was right now, she did not need this acknowledgement.The duke opened his heavy lips.\u201cWhat is it that you want to do?\u201d\u201cFirst, I would like to renounce every single marriage proposal.\u201d\u201c\u2026You may do so.\u201dWhen Violet mentioned the marriage proposals, the duke answered quickly. At this, Violet was momentarily shaken.She couldn\u2019t throw away the value placed on her as a tool so easily. Although her reputation had already hit the floor, Violet\u2019s outward appearance was still objectively pleasant.Even though the duke could have still used her as a tool when sending her off to a political marriage, there was no hesitation in his answer.She wondered if he had another use in mind for her. Even so, Violet immediately regained her composure and continued.\u201cAnd, I wish to paint.\u201d\u201c\u2026If that is what you wish, then I can also call for a teacher.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t need a teacher either. Just giving me the necessary tools and materials is enough for me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe duke did not answer back, but Violet knew that his reaction itself seemed to be a confirmation.It was such an easy request that it\u2019s entirely possible to be allowed. Violet, again, judged how the duke would respond.Even if she added up her age in her previous life to her current life, she was still younger than the duke, and she still couldn\u2019t guess what was on his mind.Saying that she wanted to paint was more of an impulse on her part. Even if it was just the slightest whim, she wanted to continue her completely erased previous life.No. Rather, she just needed an escape. That\u2019s why she chose what she used to do in her previous life.Nothing more, nothing less.As the duke\u2019s hands had been busy with organizing his documents, they stopped moving for a moment. Violet\u2019s business with him had already been dealt with yet she still hadn\u2019t gone back, so he commented on it.\u201cYou haven\u2019t recovered yet. Go back and rest.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you worried about me?\u201d\u201cOf course I am.\u201dThere were ripples in the calm lakes that were her eyes. Violet bit her lips slightly and held her breath.Not once did the duke scold her here, even though she barged in so suddenly and made ridiculous demands.He just allowed it all. He didn\u2019t even question anything.Ah, this, too, must be easy.For a parent\u2019s attitude towards his child, he treated her so emptily. Looking at the insincere duke once more, Violet asked again.\u201c\u2026Father, do you consider me as your child?\u201dIt was a question she had never asked, not once in her life\u2014a question that Violet could ask only because she was no longer the duke\u2019s daughter.In spite of it all, her voice trembled still.I wonder, have you ever felt any love for me at all?Her purple irises quivered constantly as though they were lakes where ripples had broken out, and the duke looked straight into those eyes. He answered calmly.\u201cNot once, there was never a time that you were not my daughter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA business-like tone, through and through. It was too much for her.She shouldn\u2019t stay here any longer. She would unravel. She didn\u2019t want to show any weaknesses, and yet her tears threatened to trickle down.Managing to hold back those tears by biting the inside of her cheek, the girl smiled. It was a smile that looked as if it was about to fall apart at any given time, fragile through and through.This, too, must be easy.Violet S. Everett clawed her way through a dog-like life and became a wicked woman\u2014for what?\u201cIf it\u2019s like that, then I\u2019m relieved. I thought that there\u2019s not one single person by my side.\u201dI thought for sure that you, too, would hate me.\u00a0However, Violet swallowed back these words and instead smiled and said something else.\u201cThen, as your daughter, I would like to ask for one favor, Father.\u201dAs he heard that it was not a request made from a ducal princess to the duke, but from a daughter to her father, he looked up from the documents he had been reading through.And as Violet\u2019s next words left her lips, he had no choice but to doubt his own ears.\u201c\u2014Please imprison me.\u201d* * *Naturally, Violet\u2019s request to be imprisoned was rejected. She was easily granted permission to be stripped of her obligation to marry, yet the request to be imprisoned was adamantly refused.There were various reasons. She needed to rest because she was still unwell, he said. If the eldest daughter of a ducal household were to be imprisoned like that, then Everett\u2019s dignity would be in shambles.At the arguments presented against her request, she scoffed. Violet S. Everett was already notorious for being a heinous woman with rumors filling the streets\u2014what kind of dignity was there left to be tarnished?In the meantime, many doctors came and went to check up on her. If, by chance, an evil spirit had also attached itself to her, a priest also came by to visit her. A priest\u2019s house call could only be done through paying a costly sum.As expected, living a life with a ton of money to burn was quite different. Laying down and staring at the ceiling, Violet laughed.While her condition improved, Violet went to the duke again and asked him to confine her to a remote place.And without even asking her why she kept requesting the same thing, the duke refused every time. Still, since she was so persistent, he was forced to grant it.Violet had committed so many atrocities that no one questioned the duke\u2019s official order to imprison her.Mikhail, the eldest son, knew about the duke and Violet\u2019s back and forth during this time. He ran wild and noisily asked just what was going on. But that was all.Ten days after Violet S. Everett had fallen into the lake, all her social activities came to a halt. Bringing with her only one small luggage bag, she was soon confined to an old, dilapidated annex far away from the main mansion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The duke was adamant about this.As a matter of fact, those people shuddered at the thought of serving the depraved, wicked noble lady. And the annex itself was quite far from the main mansion, so in a way, it was as if they had been demoted.Violet briefly sympathized with the people who were forced to work in the old annex building because of her.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s wider than I thought though.\u201dThe building where Violet would be living from now on was an old structure with a simple design, if you compared it to the duke\u2019s magnificent fortress. Even so, in Yeon Ha-yoon\u2019s eyes, this was quite nice.She liked how quiet this old annex was compared to the main mansion, to the point that she could even hear the flowing breaths of other people behind her.The composition of those eleven other people were as follows:A general custodian, who would be managing the whole building.Four maids, who would be in charge of cleaning and general upkeep.One cook, who\u2019d be making meals in the kitchen, along with two kitchen maids.One stableman, who\u2019d oversee the stable\u2019s supplies and manage the horses and carriages.One gardener for the garden.And, one regular maid, who would be serving Violet directly at her side.A total of twelve people, counting Violet as well, would now be living at this small annex for the foreseeable future. Of course, the space inside the building couldn\u2019t be small enough that cleaning wouldn\u2019t be a chore, so Violet was actually perfectly satisfied.She was given no high-ranking handmaids or attendants. The duke had been disinclined about this, as it was the bare minimum that Violet should have been given, but in the end, confinement was confinement. Therefore, all the employees she had been given were all made up of commoners.In a way, this could be considered as one\u2019s aristocratic life coming to an end.Considering how she had been living a life in noble splendor until now, all the while complaining of the smallest of discomforts whenever she had been attended to by \u2018idiotic commoners\u2019, this measure\u2014to give her commoner servants instead\u2014was somewhat to provoke her into changing her mind about her self-imprisonment.Of course, however, Violet had no intention at all of returning to her status as a ducal lady. Entering the narrow room that had been assigned to her, she uttered no complaints and even stretched out, relaxed.She asked for art supplies from the duke, and it took a little while until they\u2019d arrive. While waiting, she could think of this time as a break for her, so she should rest well enough.It\u2019s only obvious that she had no plans of living the same ferocious life that she had before.It\u2019s true that Yeon Ha-yoon sympathized with Violet, but she would not deny that Violet had done many misdeeds.She could go ahead and say that Violet had been foolish to have done all that, but Ha-yoon also understood why Violet had to live like that.Because her life had driven her into a corner and made her act the way she did.Still.In the end, evil was evil.Rolling over the hard, stiff bed, Violet laughed as though she had gone mad.Ah, as long as she wouldn\u2019t see those people, then she wouldn\u2019t get tired of living like this!* * *Unfortunately, the peace that Violet achieved through her self-imprisonment did not last long. Not even twenty-four hours had passed since the first day.\u201cEldest Young Master! Eldest Young Master!\u201dIt was due to the ruckus that woke her up the next morning.\u201cCall Violet out right now.\u201d\u201cA notice of your arrival hadn\u2019t been sent beforehand\u2026 Milady hasn\u2019t woken up ye\u2014\u201d\u201cIs there a place in my own home that I can\u2019t enter? Don\u2019t make me laugh. I won\u2019t leave until she comes out. Say that to her.\u201dAt Mikhail\u2019s abrupt attack, Violet couldn\u2019t help but tousle her hair impatiently.Though it had been a long time since the sun rose from the horizon, Violet had just been sleeping this entire time. Even the maid, who was supposed to be attending to her, couldn\u2019t enter the room.It\u2019s only natural that she wouldn\u2019t be happy to see an uninvited visitor.\u201cFirst thing in the morning, seriously\u2026\u201dWell, it\u2019s going to be lunch time soon, so what she said wasn\u2019t actually very accurate.Inevitably, however, Violet was set into motion. She only did the bare minimum\u2014put an outer coat over her nightgown, minimally patted her hair down.Violet\u2019s newcomer maid was at a loss on what to do in front of the door. Antsy as she stomped her feet, she quickly followed her when Violet went out.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that you liked me this much. You\u2019ve even come to visit me so early in the morning.\u201d\u201cHa, so is this still an early hour to the likes of you?\u201d\u201cYeees. I just got out of bed, so of course it\u2019s early for me. Anyway, there doesn\u2019t seem to be smoke coming out of anywhere, but what\u2019s going on that you\u2019ve come here?\u201d\u201cAre you asking me because you really don\u2019t know?\u201dWhen Mikhail snapped back, Violet fiddled with her fingertips. The texture of the outer coat over the nightgown felt nice.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m already at this age, too. It is rude to come for a visit without sending prior notice. I would be much obliged if you could refrain from doing so again, Eldest Brother.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are you up to! What are you going to do to Aileen this time?\u201dHow could a person be so consistent? Violet didn\u2019t know whether to call him thickheaded or just simply honest to a fault.There was a time that she had looked up to him.Violet smiled nonchalantly at Mikhail, who had suddenly raised his voice.If she gave the wrong answer here, she might very well get slapped across the cheek.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the sidelines of the brother and sister, the maids squeezed their eyes shut because of the precarious situation.\u201cIf Father really had the intention to lock you up like this, then he would have done so long before. Yeah, right. What kind of scheme are you concocting this time for the sake of harassing that child, huh?\u201d\u201c\u2026Fine, let me repeat myself. I\u2019ve changed. Perhaps you should change a little as well, Brother?\u201d\u201cChange?\u00a0You?\u00a0If that\u2019s really it, then before\u2026!\u201dGrit\u2014Mikhail clenched his molars.At this, Violet was relieved that she was wearing a nightgown right now, lest he would have already grabbed her by the collar.\u201cYou should have apologized to Aileen before anything else!\u201dA loud, furious snarl reverberated all throughout.And Violet calmly took a step back from Mikhail.The one who never changes is you, Brother. Don\u2019t you know? About seventy percent of the reason that I harassed that child was you .Violet smirked, thinking of the words that would never be delivered to the person in front of her now.Apologize for her misdeeds, he said. And he\u2019s right.Violet had tormented her younger cousin so many, many times. Because she hated Aileen.Like a hedgehog that would point its spikes, she had struggled with everyone around her. Always angry, always acting however she wanted.Since it\u2019s like that.Why don\u2019t you apologize to me ?Violet laughed inwardly, once again swallowing the words that would never be conveyed.Yeon Ha-yoon did not deny that Violet had been a villainess, but at the same time, she also did not deny the way Violet had lived her life.It\u2019s not that she\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0feel apologetic, but in all earnestness, she also really\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0harbor any feelings of remorse.It\u2019s not that she didn\u2019t feel remorseful. However, at the same time, she also truly didn\u2019t feel apologetic.Human beings were, by nature, selfish. Therefore, they tend to justify their situations according to their own side\u2014their self-interest.\u201cYou\u2019re worried that I\u2019ll bother her, or that I\u2019m pretending to elicit sympathy.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. I\u2019ve decided to change. So, I\u2019m only going to stay here, quietly, without bothering or touching Aileen any longer.\u201d\u201cYou, how\u00a0dare\u00a0you\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat exactly have I done that the phrase \u2018how dare\u2019 is directed at me?\u201d\u201cHow dare you say that name with your mouth so easily!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have no intention to reflect on yourself. You have no humanity in you.\u201dHearing his enraged tone, Violet laughed. For slapping someone a few times and pouring tea on that other person, perhaps she needed to be rebuked this much.Publicly humiliating her in front of other nobles, denouncing her, blaming everything on her, throwing hot tea at her, tearing her clothes apart, ordering her to be lashed, slapping her across the cheek\u2026All the typical actions of a typical villainess constantly flashed through her mind.Yeon Ha-yoon looked back on Violet\u2019s offenses, but she soon stopped.A witch with a frozen heart. That\u2019s what she was called. Against such a woman, Mikhail turned his back.\u201cYou\u00a0will\u00a0be kicked out of this household. No matter what.\u201dThose were Mikhail\u2019s last words before he left.\u00a0You will be kicked out from this household. From Everett.At the ending of those novels out there, the villainess would normally be executed. Rather, it\u2019s quite good that all she had to face was getting kicked out.She wondered what she\u2019d do if she really did get expelled from the household. Her skillset wasn\u2019t all that wide.Violet tried to guess how much she could earn as a painter in this era. Really, any unknown artist was only bound to starve.After finishing that quick calculation in her mind, she chuckled.Violet did not see off her older brother, who was now marching away in the distance.\u201cP-Pardon me\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, I guess you\u2019ve been watching until now. Sorry, but can you let the others know that I won\u2019t be having lunch today? I don\u2019t have an appetite.\u201d\u201cY-Yes!\u201d the maid answered quickly.She\u2019s Mary, the new maid who had been watching the young duke and the ducal lady for a while now.The other employees had, likewise, silently watched the conversation between the siblings from afar. They all quickly went back to their stations.It wasn\u2019t very pleasant to be a spectacle, was it.Since her day was already ruined anyway, Violet thought about whether she should sleep in more. However, in the middle of her contemplation, she called out to Mary before she left.\u201cAh, one more thing.\u201d\u201cY-Yes?!\u201d\u201cWould you kindly relay a message to His Grace for me? Tell him, from now on, please ban Mikhail, Roen, Eileen\u2026 And Cairn, too\u2026 Ah, no, wait. Please just ban anyone and everyone from entering the annex.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cOnce he knows that I\u2019m the one who sent you, he\u2019ll just roughly let you in. Then, bye.\u201dStaring back at the ducal lady, who had a much higher post compared to herself, the maid just gaped blankly.She couldn\u2019t comprehend Violet\u2019s words. How could a\u00a0maid\u00a0seek an audience with a\u00a0duke?Mary was exceedingly restless, but she eventually lowered her head.Her superior had given her an order, so did she have a choice?The other servants briefly sympathized with Mary.And that\u2019s how bad rumors would start to circulate. They would say,\u00a0I didn\u2019t know that she would bully a new maid like this.Then, those gossiping women would also say that they hoped this little girl wouldn\u2019t succumb to this harassment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It had always been like this, but recently, even more so.She nearly drowned to death in the lake. Then, when she woke up after the incident, she had such a sudden change in attitude\u2014enough to flip the entire ducal household upside down.The servants made a lot of noise about how crazy the ducal lady had become, but whenever the duke would passed by, they would fall into a hush.No matter how indifferent he was to the household\u2019s internal affairs, he was given no choice but to pay attention to them this time.The position of the \u2018lady of the house\u2019 had continued to be empty ever since the duchess had passed away. She was supposed to be the one taking care of the household\u2019s internal affairs.Duke Everett did not pay much attention to those matters because there was a designated custodian to take care of them.And it all boiled down to this\u2014the present situation.His own daughter was harassing her younger sister. And his sons\u2026On the day that Violet asked him to imprison her, the duke ordered someone to make a report about his daughter. And, in the report that he received subsequently, all of Violet\u2019s misdeeds were written in full detail.Violet had often been witnessed to rebuke Aileen during dinner, among other things.Nevertheless, the questions continued to overflow.Her request for self-imprisonment. The question she asked him, whether he truly considered her to be his daughter. Those empty eyes, as deep as a bottomless lake.Her voice, sounding as if she was about to burst into tears.\u2018\u2026Do you care for me?\u2019When she asked him whether he cared about her.The duke granted Violet\u2019s request to be confined, but he did not intend to keep her at the annex for life.If all Violet wanted was to not get married, then so be it. If there\u2019s anything at all that she wanted, then he would listen to her wishes.However, the only request that she asked of him was for her to live in captivity for the rest of her life. He could not understand this.He was expecting her to come back right away.\u2018Umm\u2026 That is, I mean, Milady\u2026 U-Um! Milady, she, uh, s-she said that she would like to request for the Young Masters and the other Ducal Lady to be barred entry\u2026\u2019When Violet sent a young, newcomer maid, the duke thought that the message he would be hearing was about how she couldn\u2019t stand it there anymore, and that she wishes to come back.The young maid\u2019s wide eyes were full of fright, just like a rabbit. It seemed like she never really expected that she would actually face the duke.Still, despite the little girl\u2019s stuttering, she delivered Violet\u2019s request accurately. And the moment she received permission to leave, she ran away immediately.Truly, it was strange.This was no one else but Violet, who had tormented Aileen like that.Violet, who had committed many nefarious acts all of her own volition, shook up the entire ducal household with her vicious deeds, and as a result, became what the servants feared the most.Why, then, would someone like her reject everyone else like that?\u2018Did I not care for her enough\u2026\u2019While reading the report written about Violet, the duke grimaced.After entrusting a part of his paperwork to his aide, the duke stood up.* * *When the duke suddenly visited, all the servants of the annex silently screamed inside.In the morning, it had been the duchy\u2019s eldest son, Mikhail. This time, in the afternoon, it was Duke Everett himself, the lord of the ducal household.No other schedule would have made them so distraught like this.Violet, who slept through both breakfast and lunch, had to be wrenched away from her bed again because of the duke\u2019s visit. Duke Everett was someone she couldn\u2019t face in just her nightgown, so she had no choice but to change into decent clothes.Mary, the newcomer maid, didn\u2019t know how to attend to Violet properly when changing her clothes. Thanks to this, the duke had to wait for Violet for a long time. A notice was not sent to him about her tardiness.He sat in the annex\u2019s sparsely adorned drawing room, and when he finally met his daughter after a long time of waiting, he faced her without any change to his expression.Violet also sat right in front of him without any superfluous fanfare.One shabby-looking ducal lady and one luxuriously-dressed duke sat face-to-face. But neither one of them felt any different.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSilence ensued. Both Violet and the duke did not open their mouths to speak, and so the cold air inside that room sharpened like a blade. All the other people there could do nothing but hold their breaths.Tea had been served to them, but the only one who ever brought a cup to their lips a few times was Violet. The duke did not touch his tea.At this moment, some people realized that humans could also drown in silence, huh. The employees\u2014on standby so that they may serve their employers\u2014were careful not to make a sound. They couldn\u2019t even gulp.\u201cI heard that you want to ban Mikhail, Roen and Aileen from entering the annex.\u201d\u201cCairn as well.\u201d\u201c\u2026Right. May I ask why?\u201d\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to meet them anymore.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m asking the reason behind that now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe silence was enough to suffocate those people, and every word spoken were like sharp blades.Violet set her teacup down at that moment. If she hadn\u2019t, there certainly would have been one employee who would have made a sound borne out of distress.The duke and the ducal lady\u2019s conversation was frighteningly business-like. It was such a succinct conversation that, if people did not know that they were related, they would have thought that they were true strangersPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was bitter. It was not delicious.\u201cYou tormented Aileen.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe ensuing topic of conversation almost made Violet bite her tongue.Was there a single person in this ducal residence who\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0know that Violet S. Everett had been tormenting Aileen?But it seemed like the duke was that single person.Of course, the duke was no fool, so it\u2019s not as if he had absolutely no idea.It\u2019s just, he\u2019s been turning a blind eye.As long as Violet did not go too far, and as long as he could cover it up\u2014he thought that this would be enough.\u2026How could that possibly be called love.\u201cYes, I did.\u201d\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d\u201cDo what?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m asking why you\u2019ve been tormenting Aileen.\u201dJust as Mikhail did, even the duke was bringing up Aileen\u2019s name. With this, Violet felt as if her insides were being turned upside down.All she wanted was to rest comfortably, but why\u2014why\u2014must she keep hearing the name of the person she didn\u2019t want to be reminded of? And, one after another, too.Violet felt her stomach lurching.A fleeting thought passed her mind, that she would definitely throw up if she were to eat dinner later. She sipped her tea to moisten her lips.\u201cI only acted my part.\u201d\u201c\u2026Violet.\u201d\u201cSince it was like that, Your Grace the Duke, would you rather that I stood still as I was being insulted?\u201dAt Violet\u2019s answer, the duke paused for a moment. It was too misleading to call Violet\u2019s actions thus far as just mere retaliation for insults.\u201cEven so, it was too much.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat poor child lost her parents\u2026\u201dThe duke expressed his sympathy towards Aileen.Too much, he said.As Violet reflected on what the duke said just now, she smiled in vain.Objectively speaking, it\u2019s true that her actions had been severe.If she couldn\u2019t bring Aileen down just by bumping into her, Violet would impulsively resort to raising her hand and hitting her. That was just the mere basics of it.Even so, Violet just laughed.Oh, this must be what it feels to lose your mind.She knew that he didn\u2019t intend to point that out with what he said just now.But even though she knew it, she had no choice but to open her mouth.At the very least, you shouldn\u2019t do this to me.\u201cYees,\u201d she answered. \u201cThat\u2019s why, uh-huh. Yeah, it\u2019s because of that\u2026\u201dAt the sight of his daughter suddenly giggling as she mashed her dessert with a fork, the duke fell silent.Silently eroding, more and more.\u2014What else could aptly describe this sight if not for the very definition of madness.\u201cWhy, you ask. Why did I torment her.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAt first, I felt wronged. I felt wronged, so I\u2026 Well, I\u2019m not sure about what happened next. I hated Aileen, and I also hated being framed for things that I didn\u2019t do.\u201d\u201cViolet!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just. I wanted everyone to disappear.\u201dThat\u2019s why I harassed her.A red stream flowed down from the pulp of strawberries crushed by a fork.At first glance, you\u2019d think that the ducal lady, without thinking about it, was merely playing with food that she would not eat. However, this was madness itself.She had been given the title of \u2018villainess\u2019, and it was not attributed to her for nothing.Violet might have just been framed at first, but thereafter, it continued under her own will.\u201cIn the end, Your Grace is also the very same. It\u2019s alright. By now, I\u2019ve learned not to hold expectations.\u201d\u201cI did not want to hear that kind of answer to the question I asked.\u201d\u201cWhat excuse must I spout then? It doesn\u2019t change the fact that I tormented her because I hated her, and that I did vicious things to her attendants\u00a0because I hated her.\u201d\u201cViolet!\u201dThe moment the duke bellowed, all of Violet\u2019s actions stopped completely.At the same time, the duke looked straight into Violet\u2019s eyes, and he had to swallow back a gasp.Purple eyes.Purple eyes that once shone like gemstones.Purple eyes that had shined so brightly as she smiled more innocently than anyone else could.Purple eyes that, now, was devoid of any light.\u201cI am not here to quibble over what\u2019s right or wrong.\u201d\u201c\u2026Right, of course. You\u2019re not here to quibble over what\u2019s right or wrong, yes\u2026\u201dThen what are you doing right now?It would end up like this anyway.Even if she were to give up and make no excuses, the end result would have been exactly the same. This would have happened eventually.\u2018\u2014Ah, I caught myself having expectations again, huh.\u2019Violet set her fork down and laughed. The answer that she\u2019d be giving would, from now on, never be what the answer that the duke would want to hear.\u201cDo you know, Your Grace the Duke?\u201dViolet addressed her father respectfully as the duke. Clearly, she was drawing a line between them.This is the only relationship between you and me.\u201cTo me, this ducal household is a lake. Humans can\u2019t breathe underwater, right? When I fell into that lake, I had a realization. So\u00a0that\u2019s\u00a0the reason I can\u2019t breathe, I thought. For ten whole years, I haven\u2019t been able to breathe properly in this household\u2014 is what I realized.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThen I asked myself, why can\u2019t I breathe? I\u2019m the ducal lady. I am House Everett\u2019s esteemed daughter. Why is it so hard, why is it so\u00a0painful\u00a0to breathe.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy does everyone hate me.\u201dClatter.The teacup had turned over. A dreadful moment of silence stretched between them. The maids could only hope that, amidst this piercing silence, they would not accidentally make a noise.\u201cEarlier, you asked me why I did those things.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLet me direct that question back to you, Your Grace. Why in the world did\u00a0you\u00a0do that to\u00a0me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why have you presented me with this hell? Why must I die underwater, not given any chance to breathe?As Violet asked this, she smiled. The words that lay between the lines were dreadfully sharp.While Yeon Ha-yoon sympathized with Violet, she thought that Violet was foolish. Even so, she still had to admit that Violet had no choice but to be as vicious as she was.\u201cIt would be best to stop this discussion here. Please go back, Your Grace.\u201dThere was a smile on Violet\u2019s lips as she said this to the duke.And, there was a frown upon the duke\u2019s face as he caught a glimpse at his daughter\u2019s resentment.He replied,\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll visit you again soon.\u201dNo, you don\u2019t have to come.\u00a0Violet thought so as she dabbed her lips with a handkerchief, staring at the duke\u2019s retreating back.At last, the maids were once again at ease the moment the duke left. The atmosphere just now had been so heavy that they could only now release the breaths they had been holding.No one saw the duke off as he left the annex.* * *A week after Violet had started staying at the annex, the servants realized that the young noble lady, who they were serving, had changed.She was not just acting. She no longer punished the servants for every little thing she found fault in.She just slept her days away, and you wouldn\u2019t even know if she was there or not. Besides that, she was not eating properly.Did the noble lady change after the shock of inhaling all that water into her lungs?Two sides were in constant disagreement\u2014the first side being those who saw Mikhail visit Violet and yell at her like that, and those who didn\u2019t.Still, despite all the differing opinions, they all agreed on one thing: after she had practically died and was brought back to life, the noble lady had changed.And their assumption was correct. Violet had regained her past life\u2019s memories that very day, and subsequently, her personality shifted, and she now took pleasure in a life of peace.She thought that it was worth living in this way for the very perk of not needing to see the people she did not want to see.She would have only been faced with those that wouldn\u2019t change, no matter how much she strived for it, or no matter how much she clamored for it. So, after running away from all that, things changed little by little.For a week straight, Violet\u2019s time was used solely for sleeping. The worst of it was one time when she slept for seventeen hours.The only one who worried over Violet and tried to serve her food constantly was her personal maid, Mary.She slept in a hard, lousy bed that couldn\u2019t even compare to the bed she had in her room in the main mansion, he wore rough, out-of-fashion clothes, and she ate dishes made with ingredients that were slightly less fresh.Even so, she did not care about anything. Violet was content with her present life.Wasn\u2019t this enough?Rather than living as a person so immersed in splendor and extravagance, she didn\u2019t have to live that kind of life.In the end, no matter what it is that you\u2019re doing with your life, if you\u2019re happy and content with what you have right now, then what\u2019s the point in troubling yourself with other things?While looking out a window, rays of sunlight streaming through, Yeon Ha-yoon laughed.In novels, if there was someone who was in the same circumstances as her, wouldn\u2019t they usually vow to get revenge?As she thought about the novels that she often read in her previous life, Violet rose to her feet.Usually, after regressing, the answer would be revenge. Or, perhaps after being hurt or betrayed by family members or a significant other, the answer, too, was revenge.It would be great if all situations could change so dramatically.Violet renounced any and all thoughts of getting revenge.She did not know the future because she was not a regressor. She had not been directly murdered either, so she had no intention to kill anyone at all.After she weighed all her options in the palm of her hand, there was nothing left to consider.Violet did not have any wherewithal to do anything else.All she wanted to do was to live quietly like this. Without much stress, just a quiet and calm life\u2026In front of her door, she saw that there was some food left for her there by someone who was concerned about her health.For as long as it had stayed there, the dish\u2019s original warmth had already left the plate, however, Violet did not care.She brought the cold bread back to her spot next to the window. As she stared outside once more, nibbling on that piece of bread, the sudden sound of footsteps could be heard.\u201cM-Milady! Lady Violet!\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cMilady, the items you requested have arrived!\u201dFor the first time in a long while, a spirited look graced Violet\u2019s expression.The news pertained to the arrival of the art materials that she had requested.Violet headed towards the studio at once.* * *The room that was reserved to be Violet\u2019s studio was now filled with all sorts of art materials. From canvases to even shiny paint made by grinding gemstones.As she felt the softness of one brush with her fingertips, Violet marveled at the sight before her.At just one glance, it\u2019s obvious that these were all very expensive luxury goods. She was confined right now, but she had to wonder\u2014was a duke\u2019s daughter not allowed to use cheap things?Or perhaps it was just to preserve the dignity of\u00a0those\u00a0people.\u201cUwah, all of these are art materials?\u201dStaring at the hundreds of art materials, Mary chattered on like that. The young maid had only heard rumors about Violet, so she was not so frightened to talk to the ducal lady. Rather, perhaps it\u2019s because the ducal lady was calmer than she was expecting that she was more forthcoming.With the sheer number of art materials presented before her, it was enough that Violet was rendered speechless, so what more with a commoner maid.After confirming that there truly were a hundred different shades of purple paint, Violet smiled softly and started organizing the tools.\u201cCan you organize all the paint by color and type, Mary?\u201d\u201cY-Yes?\u201d\u201cJust sort them by oils, watercolors and\u2026 Oh, you might not know anything about this. Just go ahead and sort them by color. And with your strength, don\u2019t organize the heavy materials by yourself.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dAfter checking the items, Violet yawned and went on her way back to her room.It was just the start of the day, and yet she was still so sleepy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now, however, she finally stood in front of a canvas for the first time.Mary was at a loss when she watched Violet set up the easel and put on the canvas herself.She insisted that, whilst painting, she wanted to do everything herself.When Violet had suddenly changed, it\u2019s thanks to this that Mary was required to do only half her job but got paid in full, and she happily gave up on more work while just staying by the ducal lady\u2019s side.Since the materials and tools were expensive, the paint was applied smoothly upon the canvas.However, that was all.Even if she was a painter in her previous life, she was Violet now in this current life, and her skills did not carry over in this body. Violet had learned a little during her culture classes, but they were only brief lessons.Without a sketch, Violet used a brush to apply gesso on the canvas, but she suddenly laughed. Mary did not say anything and just watched.Shhk, shhhhk.As the wide and large brush traveled smoothly on the canvas, the paint that\u2019s on the brush was subsequently spread on this surface.In Mary\u2019s eyes, rather than doing a painting, it\u2019s as if Violet was wielding the brush.The paint splattered around. Violet did not care.Two different hues were mixed and smoothed down on the canvas. As her hand was clumsy, these colors did not blend well.Nevertheless, Violet\u2019s hand did not stop.Blue. Purple. Red. Green. All these colors filled the canvas.Rather than painting a picture, it would be more apt to say that she was expressing her emotions.Don\u2019t people say that painting could be considered therapeutic? What do people think as they paint? If emotions could take on a physical form, would they look like what\u2019s painted on the canvas?Violet thought constantly as she brandished her paintbrush.As her deep-seated anger surfaced, it materialized through the form of color, and it was covered, stained, smeared by various other colors.Violet continued to laugh.And as though to portray the state of her mind right now, melancholy hues covered the canvas entirely.Oh, how satisfying it was to express all these pent-up emotions!As she had painted for an hour, the end result of it all was bizarre.Mary admired the bizarre work of art.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dIt was nothing but a canvas filled with color, with traces of brush strokes still left intact\u2014nothing but depressing, gloomy shades of dark blue that evoked pent-up anger. However\u2026Was it because Violet\u2019s attitude towards painting was serious? The piece standing before them now seemed to reveal the painter\u2019s feelings.\u201cGood grief, what a mess.\u201d\u201cH-How did you do that, Milady?\u201d\u201cHuh? I just did it though?\u201d\u201cWow, wooow!\u201dAs the innocent Mary\u2019s reaction made Violet feel somewhat embarrassed, she took a step back. A lot of paint splotches were left on her arms and clothes. She thought fleetingly that she\u2019s glad her clothes were cheap.She\u2019d have to ask for a smock and some arm warmers. No, rather, perhaps she should just ask for work clothes, the same as what the employees wore.Thinking about this and that, Violet stretched out.\u201cI\u2019m quite famished. Shall we go and eat?\u201d\u201cM-Milady\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou have to wash up first!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s less than before, but Mary was still afraid of Violet. She still went ahead to say everything she had to say though.With a frown on her face, Violet looked down at the paint on her arms. She was thinking that she just needed to wash her hands.Mary scrambled to her feet, then went out to draw a bath. Violet had no choice but to follow after the maid. There weren\u2019t any bath attendants here, so how long would it take to finish this?As Violet was washing up, she dissuaded Mary from cleaning up the studio. Then, by the time she was finished with her bath, it was already time for the sun to disappear down the horizon little by little.When the ducal lady expressed her willingness to eat\u2014for the first time, of her own volition\u2014the people in the kitchen were thrown into a flurry.They were worried that she would, yet again, find fault in the employees\u2019 work.However, all Violet did was eat quietly and gracefully. And after that, she went back to her room.Now, Mary thought that the lady was different from the rumors that were floating around about her.So, today once more, Mary endeavored not to be a salary thief\u2014she followed Violet in a hurry.Meanwhile, Violet thought that she would need to rehabilitate her craft. Her hands were too stiff, and she couldn\u2019t even paint properly. At this, she clicked her tongue.Technically speaking, it wouldn\u2019t be right to say that she\u2019d \u2018rehabilitate\u2019 her craft since this was a different life.How much time would it take her to catch up to at least the skills she had in her previous life?Violet picked up a sketchbook and pencil, then headed towards her room.With nothing of her master\u2019s to hold, Mary seemed very much like a salary thief. It was because of this that she looked like she was about to cry all on her own.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Painting of the Villainess as a Young LadyCH 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was just this year that Mary had started working as a maid, and she had come to the conclusion that Violet S. Everett was very different from the rumors about her.The Violet who Mary saw was, to put it simply, a quiet person who kept to herself.She slept most hours of the day, and when it came to eating, she\u2019d have to be served food against her will, lest she\u2019d skip most her meals.It was in stark contrast to the rumors about how she would go ahead and have a servant\u2019s tongue cut off if they so much say the wrong thing.You could hardly say that Violet was harsh with the servants. She never yelled at them, and she never nitpicked their mistakes.She would only keep to herself, as though she was not there.Perhaps it was because of this that Mary started doubting if Mikhail\u2019s attitude towards Violet, when he had come to the annex the other day, was warranted.There was a time when Mary herself had her wrist forcibly grabbed by someone she did not wish to see, and so she had come to think that the household\u2019s eldest son was a very frightening person.On the other hand, the rest of the annex\u2019s servants were ill at ease around the ducal lady. Some of them had worked for quite a long time here at the duchy, and they had first-hand accounts of Violet\u2019s viciousness.It was a common notion amongst them that Violet thought of a servant\u2019s life to be lighter than the weight of a single sheet of paper.They also heard of a time when she had poured scalding tea on her younger sister.And, there was even a rumor going around that one particular maid, who had been taking care of her thus far, had her eyes mercilessly gouged out of their sockets.The wicked woman of House Everett. The witch of the century, who had a glacier for a heart.Nevertheless, in Mary\u2019s eyes, she was simply just a quiet person who seemed to have a lot of wounds.The head maid repeatedly told Mary to be careful, however she had already stopped being terrified of Violet. Instead, she was even comfortable around her.And true enough, even as Violet saw just how at ease Mary had become around her, she just let the young maid be.\u201cThe sunlight isn\u2019t enough here.\u201d\u201cWould you like me to fetch a lamp, Milady?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. It\u2019s not to the point that I can\u2019t draw.\u201dAt first glance, it seemed as if Violet had a sacred aura about her as she sat there, against the sun\u2019s illumination, drawing silently.With silver hair gently that meandered along with the passing breeze, with calm, purple eyes that held the depth of an abyss. And, with lips, carefully closed, that contained a hint of persistence.At least, during this brief moment, as Violet was sketching beneath this sunny spot, her appearance was truly far from the image of the wicked woman from all those rumors.\u201c\u2026Pretty.\u201dThat\u2019s why the word unknowingly popped out.At Mary\u2019s murmur, Violet suppressed a chuckle.Only then did Mary realize just what she said, and she hurriedly covered her mouth.Violet continued moving her hand, which was holding a pencil.After she was confined to this annex, not once did Violet endeavor to take special care of her appearance. She didn\u2019t try to maintain her clear skin, nor did she even try to control her diet for the sake of her weight.That\u2019s why Violet couldn\u2019t figure out why Mary even said that after looking at her.Still, she did not hate the innocent girl\u2019s admiration. So, she let her be.Violet sometimes showed her artwork to Mary.Unlike the bold brushstrokes that she applied onto a canvas that first day, Violet had just been doodling on a sketchbook for a while now.Well, in Mary\u2019s eyes, they literally were \u2018doodles\u2019. Really, like worms wriggling about on the page\u2014doodles that didn\u2019t look like art.\u201cUmm. I\u2019m sure that it contains Milady\u2019s feelings, so\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to force yourself to compliment me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAt the sight of the little girl who couldn\u2019t bring herself to lie, Violet smiled as she patted Mary\u2019s head. Not long after, Mary\u2019s face grew bright red.She did those doodles only a couple of days ago, but Violet\u2019s drawing skills had undergone remarkable changes over this brief course of time.Those haphazard strokes, which looked like wriggling earthworms, were soon infused with much elegance. Those doodles, which previously could not be properly identified, gradually took on proper form.This wouldn\u2019t be possible if you were not a genius of the century.\u201cMilady, you must truly be a prodigy at art!\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know about that.\u201dIt\u2019s only because of her previous life.An ambiguous smile found its way on Violet\u2019s lips.After a few days of working hard, she managed to get to a similar level to that of her art skills in her previous life, so it would be more difficult from here on out in her reincarnated life.The rate at which her skills would improve would plateau now, slowing down without improving significantly.In any case, this didn\u2019t matter to her. It\u2019s not as if she\u2019s planning to be a famous painter of this era.All Violet hoped for was to enjoy a quiet life.And so, as Violet was adjusting to her new life here at the annex\u2026\u201cLady A-Aileen has come to visit you, Milady.\u201dAll of a sudden, Aileen decided to visit her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 12": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Painting of the Villainess as a Young LadyCH 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt\u2019s a matter of absolute improbability for Aileen\u2019s visit to please Violet.She just recently requested for that girl to be barred entry from the annex, but why was she now going all the way over this part of the duke\u2019s property?Violet clicked her tongue as she heard the news from Mary, who was now her personal maid.While she was still living her life entirely as Violet, she couldn\u2019t understand Aileen at all. And now that she had Ha-yoon\u2019s consciousness as well, it was even harder to understand Aileen.\u201cI don\u2019t want to see her. Tell her to go back.\u201dIt\u2019s only now that she could finally breathe comfortably, but why was trouble persistently coming after her?Mary, who had become a messenger, hastily hurried to tell Aileen Violet\u2019s response, however she returned not even a while later.\u201cM-Milady, she says that she won\u2019t leave until she sees you\u2026\u201dAileen\u2019s dogged stubbornness was also something formidable.Mary wordlessly tried to gauge Violet\u2019s reaction for a moment, then she told her that Aileen brought a sketchbook with her.\u201cHa, I\u2019m at a loss for words, seriously\u2026\u201dI already left and moved to this faraway side of the property, but are you saying that you\u2019ve chased after me just to provoke me?Rising from her seat, Violet brushed a hand over her face, her actions evidently showing how irritated she was.\u201cI already said that she should leave. \u2026Mary, let\u2019s go eat some snacks.\u201d\u201cP-Pardon?\u201dShould we do that?The question was practically written across Mary\u2019s forehead, but instead of answering, Violet just laughed.Perplexed, Mary followed after her.* * *The employees of the annex had resigned themselves to working at this place.The new lady they were serving now had such a vicious temper\u2014enough to grant her several terrible nicknames\u2014so they all just kept their heads down, trying to survive as they continued to work.Still, there were just four regular maids and two kitchen maids. Although the annex was small, it\u2019s difficult for only six people to handle everything. They had to go as far as taking turns just to cover for each other.And they all pitied Mary, who sometimes had to stay by the lady\u2019s side.Each and everyone of them declined the position of Violet\u2019s personal maid, so it inevitably went down the line and fell onto the newbie\u2019s lap.However, contrary to their worries, Mary told the other employees of the annex that Violet was not like how the rumors painted her out to be.Even as the atmosphere was filled with a somber, sympathetic mood towards her, Mary defended her master to the end.One maid, who had been working here longer than Mary, recalled the incident wherein Violet ordered her to cut off the tongue of another employee herself.This maid didn\u2019t believe what Mary was saying now, but she also did not deny that Violet had changed.As a matter of fact, Violet often shared her food with Mary.And Mary was a simple girl. Anyone who shared food with someone else was, she believed, a good person.Thus, inside the annex, the people\u2019s impression on Violet changed little by little.\u2018I mean, maybe she changed because she practically died and came back to life.\u2019\u2018Maybe she finally started to reflect on her actions.\u2019\u2018Good gracious,\u00a0that\u00a0Ducal Lady who\u2019s so conceited that it\u2019s like she\u2019s the center of the whole world?\u2019\u2018Back then, the Young Master might have gone too far when he came here and yelled at her like that. She\u2019s his younger sister after all.\u2019This all was a positive thing.Violet\u2019s image was about to become more settled now, and it was all thanks to Mary\u2019s defense of her.However, it was around this time that\u2026Aileen came again.And they all quickly realized that Violet\u2019s true nature had not changed.* * *\u201cMy goodness, how many hours has it been now\u2026\u201dAlthough it was already early spring, the winter\u2019s frost had yet to subside completely.In that kind of weather, Aileen arrived while wearing a thin dress, imploring to come in so that she could visit her older sister.And despite Violet telling her to leave and her refusal to see her, Aileen waited for hours on end.The maids watched as Aileen trembled outside the annex, and because they felt sorry for her, they gave her a thin blanket.House Everett\u2019s angelic second daughter replied with a smile.\u201cThank you. I wore this so that I can be more presentable in front of my older sister, but I didn\u2019t know that it\u2019s going to be this cold.\u201dAnd it was this remark that repulsed Violet completely.\u201cHaa, I\u2019m going crazy\u2026 Just tell her to come in.\u201dAfter more than four hours, Violet was the one who raised the white flag.Yet again, rumors were bound to circulate about how she bullied her younger sister and made her wait at the front door for that long.Violet sighed, pressing down on a throbbing temple.In the past, even if one entire day had come and gone, she would never have let Aileen in. But because of the weather right now, it couldn\u2019t be helped.\u201cSister\u2026!\u201dAfter she had been left to wait outside for four hours during early spring, Aileen finally entered the small drawing room. Her cheeks were red.Compared to Violet, who did not take care of her outward appearance at all, Aileen was still ever so lovely.Violet had to let out a\u00a0deep\u00a0breath again, just to center herself. She held onto her patience with a vice grip, lest her hand would slip and pour tea straight into that girl\u2019s face.\u201cHic, hiic\u2026\u00a0I was so worried about you. You suddenly got confined to this place, and you even said that you wouldn\u2019t meet me and our brothers\u2026\u201dWell, there\u2019s no reason for me to meet the people I hate, now is there.Barely holding herself back from lashing out with these harsh words, Violet managed to keep the smile on her lips.The taste of this annex\u2019s unsavory tea overwhelmed her senses far stronger than how it usually did.\u201cS-Still, I\u2019m glad to see you again. Sister, you\u2019re happy to see me again, too, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019d be happy only if your face is far out of my sight.\u201d\u201cSister, your face has grown so haggard\u2026 I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because you\u2019ve been suffering a lot here, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Haa.\u201dViolet\u2019s face was far from being haggard.As clear as her environment was now from all the stressors that deteriorated her mental health, her face was as equally clear of any blemishes at all.While making a guess at Aileen\u2019s inner feelings, Violet narrowed her eyes.Aileen\u2019s gaze continued to scrutinize Violet\u2019s clothes.Her flimsy, black paint-stained dress was fraying at the edges. It was an outfit that did not suit the usually elegant and well-dressed Violet.Mary looked back and forth between the two sisters. Well, to be more precise, the two cousins.Violet was wearing clothes that were old and unseemly, while Aileen was wearing a dress that was new and cute, which matched her appearance.Nevertheless, what\u2019s astounding here was that there\u2019s no difference in the beauty they each held.\u201cSo that\u2019s what you came here to say?\u201d\u201cNo, not at all! Umm. I heard that you\u2019ve taken up painting here at the annex, Sister.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I brought this for you, just in case you\u2019ll like it.\u201dAs she said this, Aileen shyly offered a sketchbook.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Like how it would be if you don\u2019t like someone\u2014 just hearing their voice was bound to grate on your nerves.Violet could grasp Aileen\u2019s true intentions. As soon as she received the sketchbook, a smirk found its way on her lips.For as long as Aileen had been using the same old tactics\u2014ever since they were children, in fact\u2014it\u2019s unlikely that Aileen would stray that far from the same pattern now.\u2018I wonder. Will she finally leave if I throw tea on that face?\u2019Violet had already done so dozens of times before, but Aileen never gave in. In the past, for the express purpose of kicking Aileen out, Violet impatiently thought to do various things.\u201cI\u2019m quite certain that you\u2019ve been barred access to this area. But maybe that\u2019s exactly what made you come here?\u201d\u201cNot at all! I, I came to visit because I missed you so much, Sister.\u201d\u201cThat mouth of yours is good at yammering about, as always.\u201dWhile saying,\u00a0I missed you, Sister,\u00a0Aileen\u2019s eyes were drawn up to narrow, crescent moons. Soon after, however, her expression promptly crumbled.Look at how quickly this girl\u2019s face changes.Despite getting slapped and thrown tea at so many times before, she still willingly appeared in front of Violet without fail. She did all that, and yet why was she making such an expression now after just one rebuttal?Violet\u2019s attention was directed back at the sketchbook that Aileen handed to her.\u201cRight, and you drew this.\u201d\u201cYes! I just want to find something we could have in common, Sister\u2026 I\u2019m still quite bad at it, right?\u201dAileen smiled innocently.In turn, Violet took another sip of tea as she flipped through the pages of the sketchbook.Objectively speaking, Aileen\u2019s drawings were well done. It seemed like the kind of artwork she put in days of effort into drawing, and of course, under the tutelage of a professional.\u2014But that was all.\u2018Drawings that give off the feeling of an entrance examination.\u2019Violet unhesitatingly critiqued it. Aileen\u2019s paintings looked good, yes, but they were stiff.\u201cUmm, if you don\u2019t mind, can I see Sister\u2019s artwork, too?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI said\u00a0no.\u201d\u201cB-But you looked at\u00a0my\u00a0art, Sister, so\u2026\u201dWhen Violet refused her request, then ensued Aileen\u2019s waterworks. Tears welled up in the corners of her eyes.Violet\u2019s expression hardened.\u2018You\u2019re the one who forced this thing on me and made me look first.\u2019Violet answered inwardly. She had a headache now, and so she gently pressed her temples.This girl showed her artwork first then asked reciprocity, but when Violet refused, now she\u2019s about to cry.In the end, Violet was the only bad guy here.Seeing through the girl\u2019s obvious schemes, Violet put down the sketchbook.\u201cI just\u2026 I just wish to see Sister\u2019s art\u2026 But for you to refuse so coldly,\u00a0hiic.\u00a0It should be enough\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what you say, but it is\u00a0not\u00a0reason enough for me to show you my art.\u201d\u201cHiic\u2026\u201dIn spite of the firm refusal she was faced with, Aileen still refused to back down.There were so many things in this life that were impossible to solve with tears alone. But, oh, House Everett\u2019s dear angel was a miracle worker. She made it possible to solve so many things with her tears.Violet felt a bitter taste in her mouth. The only one who looked restless was Mary, who was standing nearby. Aileen sobbed even harder.\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me that you\u2019ve forced yourself into a place that\u2019s supposed to be off limits to you, just because you want to see my art. What a mess.\u201d\u201cSister\u2026\u201d\u201cYou seem to consider the words of His Grace the Duke to be merely a joke. You were given an order. Shouldn\u2019t you make sure to follow it?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so mean. How can you dismiss my feelings like this?\u201dIt was good to be flexible depending on the situation, but certainly not when there were non-negotiable rules in place.Violet clicked her tongue as she considered Aileen\u2019s actions. She insisted on doing whatever she wanted and kept ignoring the rules.Her eyes then turned towards Mary, who was at the side.Although it wasn\u2019t her intention, the fact that Violet had made Aileen wait outside for four hours would surely be spread all across the ducal residence by tomorrow.\u201c\u2026Still as ever, you really just keep doing things without any regard to your behavior.\u201dViolet gestured to Mary.Soon, the maid rushed in with the sketchbook that Violet had been drawing in until now.Mary opened it in front of Aileen.Go ahead and take a look, then kindly piss off.Violet hoped that Aileen would just quickly disappear from her paradise.\u201cWow, your art is\u2026\u201dNow that she had finally achieved her purpose, Aileen smiled and returned Violet\u2019s sketchbook.It was full of measly doodles anyway. It didn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re shown to someone else.\u201cHow fascinating. I would\u00a0never\u00a0have drawn something like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe way you express things through these lines are especially distinctive. I wonder how you made your drawings look like this\u2026 Sure enough, you purposely drew in a way that\u2019s quite different from the art style that\u2019s popular nowadays, right? As expected, Sister is truly unique.\u201dThen, Aileen side-eyed Violet\u2019s clothes.At this, Violet grinned sardonically.\u201cIf you think I can\u2019t draw well, then just say it outright. Why must you resort to sophistry?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No matter what kind of studies Violet pored over, no matter what kind of hobbies she\u2019d take up, it was the same outcome each and every time.Whether it was a deliberate scheme, or an attempt at getting closer to her\u2014 what was it, really?Aileen continuously said that it was because she\u2019s trying to be closer to \u2018Violet\u2019. So, in the end, Violet had stopped banking on the likelihood of that premise.Since it\u2019s like that, then Aileen just had to watch her mouth.Violet couldn\u2019t understand Aileen\u2019s mental gymnastics. How could she\u00a0want\u00a0to be closer to the very person who supposedly kept tormenting her?\u201cYes, yes. You were taught to paint this by a teacher, right? You did great by following what\u2019s standard. Good job. Commendable, even.\u201dAs Violet said this with a crooked smile on her lips, she tilted her teacup forward and spilled tea all over the sketchbook.\u201cNow leave. And don\u2019t ever show up in front of me again. If you ever come to this place once more, the next thing that\u2019ll be poured tea over is your face.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThen, she smiled brightly.Steam started to rise from the sketchbook, and the tea\u2019s stain began to spread further across the pages.As she could not grasp the situation, Mary was the only one who watched the scene unfold with a blank expression on her face.\u201cAre you deaf? Get out of my sight. This instant.\u201d\u201cUh, hiic, hiic\u2026\u00a0I-I just, I just wanted to hear a compliment from, from you, Sister\u2026 You\u2019re so mean. You always\u2026 always keep putting me, me down. I, I only\u2026\u201dDrip, drip.\u00a0Transparent droplets trickled down from Aileen\u2019s clear green eyes.For a moment, Violet contemplated whether she should pour the rest of the hot tea right into that face. But eventually, she loosened her grip and set down the cup.\u201cSince Aileen is leaving, do see her off up to just the main door. Be sure to wipe the spilled tea on the floor as well.As Violet succinctly gave this order, Mary quickly snapped back in attention.\u201cY-Yes!\u201dIt seemed like Aileen was refusing to move. Mary moved to soothe the crying girl, but all Violet did was turn around and leave them behind her. She pressed down on her temples and went back upstairs to her room.This was going to worsen Violet\u2019s notorious reputation again.Rumors would be running rampant at the main mansion yet again tomorrow.Oh, dear kind, angelic Aileen laboriously made an effort to draw something for her older sister Violet, all because she had wanted to get close to her. However, oh! The evil Violet poured tea all over those drawings and went as far as to kick the girl out.But even before all that happened, Violet left the dear, frail young woman outside and made her wait there\u2014in this freezing weather\u2014for four hours before even letting her in.Violet thought, should she have suppressed her emotions? She had been fine when she saw the faces of those other people, but the moment Aileen\u2019s face was set before her, it seemed impossible to remain unbothered.Violet pushed down the urge to let out a long sigh.She had only recently gotten close to Mary, but now that the girl had been faced with that kind of scene, it\u2019d undoubtedly be awkward again from tomorrow onwards.A human being wouldn\u2019t be able to continue living without any form of relationship. Emotions flowed like water. If it was stuck somewhere without any direction to flow towards, all it could do was accumulate.How long would she last living like this, just focusing on painting alone, talking to no one at all?Violet started to calculate the exact date she might go insane, but she stopped. She might\u00a0already\u00a0be crazy at this point.She was lying in bed now, but her simmering resentment refused to abate. Violet tried to regulate her breathing several times over.If only she could express her feelings in color, then it would be completely black, dirty water, to the point that no one would come near her.An overwhelming sense of lethargy surged within her like a wave. However, at the same time, a certain urge arose as well.With these feelings as her driving force, what kind of piece would come out of this if she were to paint now?As she pondered one thing after another, she soon heard a hesitant knock on her door.\u201c\u2026Come in.\u201dThe moment Violet gave her permission, Mary came in through the threshold. In Mary\u2019s hands was a tray, and atop it was a sweet tart and a drink.\u201cUmm, I heard that it\u2019s good to eat sweets when angry. \u2026Are you alright, Milady?\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you asking me how I feel?\u201d\u201cYes? Y-Yes! You must be upset, and\u2026 I-I must be meddling unnecessarily\u2014 Pardon me, I\u2019ll take these back!\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. Bring it here.\u201dViolet was momentarily stunned by the unexpected response, however, her gaze soon softened as she looked at the small girl.Embarrassed, Mary squirmed a little and averted her eyes.She brought the tray to a nearby table and looked at Violet again. It seemed like she had something more to say.\u201cI-It\u2019s more delicious if you eat and drink these before they get cold!\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA brief moment of silence then blanketed the room. Mary determinedly remained inside Violet\u2019s room, still very much gauging her mood.It\u2019s true that Violet thanked the girl for the refreshments, but she didn\u2019t really have any intention of eating or drinking any of these. Still, she eventually spoke up.\u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t you afraid of me?\u201d\u201cHuh? Why?\u201d\u201cWhy, you ask\u2026 You saw what happened earlier.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 Lady Aileen slighted you first, Milady.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAt the girl\u2019s fast reply, Violet was rendered speechless.Mary cut up the tart into bite-sized pieces and offered the plate to Violet.Still dazed and unable to comprehend the situation, Violet unknowingly went on to eat the tart.\u201c\u2026Why do you think that Aileen was the first to do something wrong?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You even asked His Grace the Duke to keep this area off limits to her.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLady Aileen is prohibited from coming here in the first place, and you\u2019ve asked her many times to leave, but none of that worked\u2026 And besides that, you also refused to show her your art when she demanded it. You said no already, but Lady Aileen just kept forcing you, didn\u2019t she, Milady?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah. I guess so.\u201dPerhaps it\u2019s because it\u2019s been a long time since anyone took her side, but Violet was stunned and couldn\u2019t reply properly.Mary didn\u2019t see Violet\u2019s baffled expression and began to chatter on.\u201cI\u2019ve experienced something similar. There\u2019s this brutish, ugly boy named Thompson who keeps forcing me to marry him. But I don\u2019t want to! Even though I said no so,\u00a0so\u00a0many times, people around me kept pairing me up with him. After that, I ended up being the only weird person there just because I refused\u2026\u00a0Huu, so I tried to find a way for me to live my own way, and that\u2019s how I ended up working here at the ducal residence\u2026\u201dOnce the floodgates were opened, Mary let out an outpour of chattering.She talked at a breathtaking speed, as if she was letting out all the words she had been begrudgingly holding in all this time.\u201cO-Oh\u2026 I see.\u201dAstonished as she was, Violet couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say but this.\u201cAh, um\u2026 I-I apologize! I didn\u2019t even realize I\u2019ve just been talking and\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. Your story\u2019s interesting.\u201dMary belatedly noticed that she ran her mouth a bit too excitedly in front of her master just now, and it was only now that she covered her mouth.In response, Violet only chuckled.\u201c\u2026Are you not afraid of me?\u201d\u201cI already answered the question before, Milady\u2026\u201d\u201cI want to hear a proper answer. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the rumors about me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Um, I did think that you were scary at first. Juuuuust a little bit.\u201dConscious of Violet\u2019s reaction, Mary hurriedly added another thing.\u201cBut when I finally met you in person, you\u2019ve been nothing but nice! You always give me delicious food, too. The Ducal Lady I heard about in all the rumors is like a different person!\u201d\u201cNice, you say\u2026 But you know, the rumors are true. At least half of them are.\u201d\u201cHuk\u2014\u00a0Then, did you really order someone\u2019s tongue to be cut off, Milady?\u201d\u201cYes. You\u2019re still not scared?\u201d\u201cUmm, yes, I\u2019m not scared! It\u2019s just, well, that servant must have said something they shouldn\u2019t have first!\u201dWith the cheerfulness of a typical sixteen-year-old girl, Mary let out a peal of laughter.While realizing that she hadn\u2019t had a proper conversation with someone else in such a long time, Violet brought a piece of the tart to her lips. It\u2019s too sweet.\u201cMilady, you\u2019re not the kind of person who\u2019d give an order like that on a mere whim. Earlier, too, I saw how hard you tried several times to endure Lady Aileen\u2019s selfish behavior.\u201d\u201cFufu\u2026\u201d\u201cUh, perhaps, did I say something funny?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard anyone say that to me before. Yes, I didn\u2019t give that order on a mere whim.\u201dIn the past, the servant whose tongue Violet ordered to be cut dared to stand in her way and curse right in her face.\u201cYou wicked woman!\u201dEven if that servant had said it in an effort to stop Violet from slapping Aileen\u2019s cheek, it was still fundamentally wrong for a subordinate to interfere with the affairs of their superiors.It\u2019s only right that a tongue like that\u2014one that did not know the concept of time and place, or hierarchy\u2014were to be cut off.It was a barbaric way to deal with things, but considering the era in which Violet existed, and considering how she was a great noble in these parts, it was justified. The action was warranted, but also full of spite.\u201cEnough about that. Now, you won\u2019t be asking me to have your tongue cut off just because my mood has soured, will you?\u201d\u201cSuch gruesome words\u2026\u201d\u201cHehe,\u00a0I thought so.\u201dHaving lived in the modern era before, Violet no longer had any intention to conform to the barbaric methods of penance in this era.But apart from that, couldn\u2019t she at least be allowed to express her anger\u00a0when\u00a0she\u2019s angry?With that fleeting thought, Violet soon shook her head slowly.\u201cWell\u00a0I\u00a0think that there must have been a good reason behind your decision back then, Milady.\u201d\u201c\u2026That doesn\u2019t erase what I did wrong though.\u201d\u201cBut still! Ummm\u2026 Then, would it be alright if I ask why you did that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHuk\u2014\u00a0I-If you\u2019d rather not talk about it, then you don\u2019t have to!\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m just organizing my thoughts a little. It\u2019s my first time talking about the incident.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cNo one asked. And even if I did say anything, people already automatically assume that I\u2019m at fault before I utter a single word. They wouldn\u2019t be able to see that I wasn\u2019t at fault.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBewildered, Mary\u2019s eyes fluttered open and close for a moment. Violet was still thinking about how much more she should tell the girl, but she soon became flustered the moment she saw Mary\u2019s expression distorting to the fullest.\u201cSeriously,\u00a0no one\u00a0heard you out, Milady? They all just automatically thought you\u2019re evil\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMilady, did they all just say you\u2019re bad?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re right in saying that I am though. It\u2019s nothing new.\u201d\u201cB-But\u2026\u201dFull of empathy, the girl ended up crying. Violet patted Mary on the shoulder.\u201cThen, you must\u2019ve been lonely\u2026\u201d\u201cLonely, huh.

They\u2019re case is a bit more unique, but they generally act that way too, yes.\u201dSwear words bubbled up at her lips, but Violet narrowly corrected herself in a graceful manner.Mary noticed Violet\u2019s heavy-handed correction, and she smiled widely. Soon, however, tears welled up in Mary\u2019s eyes once more.\u201cIf half the rumors are true, then the other half must be false. But despite it all, nobody took your side, they all just thought that you\u2019re evil, they never tried to talk to you even once and just continued like that\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThen,\u00a0hiic.\u00a0Milady, you continued to\u2026 You just kept on\u2026\u201dViolet soothed Mary again, patting the girl\u2019s back and giving her a piece of the tart. Mary took out a handkerchief and sniffled, and continued to speak with such melancholy.\u201cMy dearest Lady\u2026 You\u2019re not evil. You\u2019re so kind. But everyone just kept\u00a0saying\u00a0you\u2019re bad, so\u2026\u201dWho knows, she\u2019s not really kind. Still, Violet did not deny that she was a wicked woman, but at the same time, she no longer denied Mary\u2019s words.Perhaps it\u2019s because her environment has shifted, but\u2026 No matter who it was, it felt good to have someone on her side.Instead of making excuses to justify herself, Violet merely ate tarts together with the girl, and they had a long chat.* * *No matter what happened, time moved forward.It had already been fifteen days since Aileen\u2019s visit.After learning that Violet hated Aileen, Mary deliberately did not bring up the other ducal lady.In the meantime, Violet made three paintings to let out her negative emotions.Although she still wasn\u2019t satisfied with the skill level that she was at right now, her paintings gradually looked more like paintings as she practiced again and again.Of course, this was entirely Violet\u2019s assessment of herself. Her art style way ahead of the current era, and the abstruse painting would surely make anyone exclaim the moment they saw it.The only person who was seeing her paintings was Mary, whose eyes kept chasing every move that Violet\u2019s making.It\u2019s not as if they had deep conversations, but after talking to each other a few times, Violet found that she had become close to Mary, and the two of them often had tea together.The refreshments that came with the tea seemed to have had sugar poured into them, but it\u2019s not all that bad.Her taste buds seemed to be attuned to sweet things, so she thought they were good, too.And as Mary could see this from her point of view, she was very satisfied as well. She especially got those expensive desserts from a well known patisserie that\u2019s difficult to buy from due to the demand.Mary wasn\u2019t the only one who got closer to Violet. As unexpected as it was, Violet became close to all the employees of the annex.Well, their relationship was a bit too ambiguous to say that they\u2019re \u2018close\u2019 now. But at the very least, they weren\u2019t anymore afraid or hostile towards her like before.This was all thanks to Mary, too.After learning about Violet\u2019s true situation, Mary had been filled with a sense of duty. She went around, actively explaining Violet\u2019s side.Since there\u2019s no reason for her to stop the girl, Violet left Mary alone as she did those things. Thus, Violet\u2019s position in the annex shifted ever so subtly.\u2018She\u2019s become nicer.\u2019\u2018She was never a bad person at all.\u2019\u2018She\u2019s actually very kind, she just got angry.\u2019Many such words came and went.Regardless of which answer was correct, it\u2019s true that Violet was not as vicious as she had been. Because of this, more and more people slowly became more comfortable around her.In fact, the employees of the annex had been a bit lax these days, but Violet did not reprimand them. Rather, the employees would heatedly reprimand each other whenever they saw her be so generous towards them.In any case, whether it was Violet or the employees, they were all in the same boat. They all got kicked out from the main mansion, and they were not staying together in this small corner of the ducal residence, here at the annex.It\u2019s only natural for them to strengthen their bonds in their own way.Besides, aristocrats\u2014to them\u2014were like faraway beings that would be out of reach. However, though Violet still carried herself with the same air of nobility that an aristocrat would, it felt as if she was a real human being\u2026 just like them.Violet treated employees as, exactly that, employees. They work for as much as they\u2019re paid.Blood flowing through one\u2019s veins shouldn\u2019t be considered high or low. After all, it\u2019s all just red blood, so she was straightforward about treating other people.With that attitude, the employees of the annex also became closer to Violet.But\u2026 Perhaps she became too familiar to them?Violet couldn\u2019t help but think so after she\u2019d been told that there was a dog that gave birth to puppies recently in the barn of the friend of the younger cousin of Angelica, a kitchen maid.How exactly has it come to this, really.Well, this could all be credited to Mary herself. The girl truly had such a high level of sociability. She\u2019d been standing up for Violet so much these days, worried that the lady might be harmed.Nevertheless, Violet just stayed on the sidelines. Even if she were to be transformed from the villainess of the century to the\u00a0victim\u00a0of the century, there would actually be no difference to how she would act.Nevertheless, even if they weren\u2019t on especially friendly terms, she thought this was preferable enough.Since they were more comfortable around her now, just in time, she wanted to practice some croquis.\u00b9 She decided to ask the employees of the annex to be her models....One would think that the situation was getting better\u2026However, there soon arrived people who served to rain all over this parade.\u00b9 [From Wikipedia] Croquis \u2013 is a quick and sketchy drawing of a live model. Croquis drawings are usually made in a few minutes, after which the model changes pose or leaves and another croquis is drawn. The word croquis comes from French and means simply \u201csketch\u201d.(sidenote)See also: \u2018Spirit Fingers\u2019, a manhwa set in the modern era. They do croquis a lot in their art club, but more than that, it\u2019s a wholesome coming-of-age story centered on art, friendships and personal growth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And the air was even heavier because all three people had a tendency to conceal any and all emotion from their expressions.Why were these people seeking her out again?Violet glanced at Duke Everett and her second older brother, Roen. As much as she wanted to let out a long, drawn-our sigh, she had no choice but to keep it in.\u2018I guess I\u2019ll need to drink some digestive medicine before dinner tonight.\u2019A three-way encounter like this could be explained by going back a little in the past.Still, Violet could do nothing but stare at the two men in front of her, holding back a sigh of irritation.* * *By no means could the relationship between Violet and the employees of the annex be called \u2018family\u2019, but at the same time, it wouldn\u2019t be right to say that they had\u00a0no\u00a0relationship at all.Rosie, the maid who was asked to be a model for Violet\u2019s croquis, quickly faltered from her pose because it was too awkward.\u201cI would much prefer it if you just act naturally.\u201dBut hearing the ducal lady say this, the employees wept.They\u00a0couldn\u2019t\u00a0act naturally. They were trying to work as they usually did, but the ducal lady was behind them, sketching.But Rosie held back on uttering these words.The maids did not protest, but they would freeze up the moment they\u2019re in front of the lady. Violet didn\u2019t really point out their discomfort though.This eraser can erase lines so smoothly. Who made this?Violet only had these kinds of thoughts in her mind as she leisurely observed the maids as they worked. Basking underneath the warm sun, Violet stretched out and stood up from her seat.She slept in a lot, ate when she\u2019s hungry, painted a little in her studio, and walked around the annex, sightseeing. Whenever she was bored, she would read a book or paint. She also took up the hobby of observing the employees because she needed them as her models.For the first time in her life, Violet\u2019s days flowed leisurely.Incarceration was not simply about locking people up\u2014it\u2019s about tying down one\u2019s use and worth as well. So\u00a0that\u2019s\u00a0why people who were exiled to remote places were so focused on creative activities.Violet reached this epiphany as she was staring up at the sky, yawning languidly.It\u2019s boring to have nothing to do, so she had no choice but to do\u00a0something.In any case, however, Violet didn\u2019t feel bitter about any of this. She was the one who chose to confine herself.As she was enjoying her free time\u2014\u201cM-Milady\u2026 The, the second Young Master has come to visit you\u2026\u201d\u2014her peace was broken just like that.\u201cHe won\u2019t leave even if you tell him to, huh?\u201d\u201c\u2026He said he brought a present for you.\u201dWhy were none of these people taking the duke\u2019s order seriously?No, to spin this in a positive manner, it\u2019s a good thing that they\u2019re not abiding by the duke\u2019s words. In this place, even basic manners were not being followed.Violet pressed down on her temples, feeling the rising migraine.Still, a private meeting with just Roen was tolerable enough. As long as he\u2019s not provoked first, then he wouldn\u2019t start anything either.\u201cBring him to the drawing room. I\u2019m busy, so if he wants to talk to me, he has to wait about three hours.\u201d\u201cY-Yes!\u201dAs it was, Violet entered her studio and immersed herself in her fourth painting.Would he really wait three hours though? Roen was a busy man in his own right. There\u2019s no way he\u2019d waste three hours just for the sake of humiliating his younger sister....It was a few hours later that Violet laid down her brush, doubts still swirling in her mind. However, soon enough, Mary delivered the bleak news.Roen was still waiting for Violet, drinking tea as leisurely as ever.As soon as Violet heard this, she decided to quickly finish her work just to send Roen back.Violet deliberately headed towards the drawing room. She was still in her paint-stained clothes.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201dRoen greeted Violet with a smile. His demeanor was lax, conveying not a single hint of agitation despite having been forced to wait for a long time.\u201c\u2026It hasn\u2019t been that long.\u201d\u201cI heard that your face had gone gaunt, but now that we\u2019ve met each other again, I can see that you\u2019re doing well enough. I\u2019m glad.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your business here?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t an elder brother have a chat with his younger sister?\u201dRoen smiled.Really, that smile of his never failed to remind Violet of a snake.It was impossible for\u00a0these\u00a0siblings to have a normal conversation face-to-face. All Violet wanted now was to sort out what Roen came here for quickly and make him leave, but this snake-like man continued to slither through the conversation with ease.\u201cFather declared the annex to be off limits to you.\u201d\u201cOnly verbally though.\u201d\u201c\u2026I had no idea that you\u2019d want to talk to me separately like this.\u201d\u201cCome on now. I always worry about you, Violet.\u201dHe hadn\u2019t even taken a sip of tea yet, but look at him lie.With her lips on the rim of her teacup, she clicked her tongue. The tea was bitter.\u201cI heard that you\u2019ve had a few inconveniences in your day-to-day life here. But here, I brought you a new dress and a new pair of shoes. Will you accept them?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll accept them with gratitude.\u201dThe new dress and shoes must have designs that were in vogue. In other words, clothes that were unnecessarily ostentatious and would only bring her discomfort whilst painting.When Aileen returned after being humiliated like that, what exactly did she say to this crafty guy? And to the extent that he came all the way here?Violet tried her hardest not to let her emotions show plainly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Roen didn\u2019t insist either, as if he didn\u2019t want a definite answer.\u201cThe tea is more bitter than I thought, too. If you were like how you were before, you would\u2019ve already had the maid\u2019s hands cut off by now\u2014the one who made this tea.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t give out such cruel commands.\u201d\u201cYou truly have changed. As expected, was it because of the lake?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dViolet deeply regretted coming here. She should have just ignored Roen, went back up to her room and tucked herself right into bed.It\u2019s taking too much time to just make this guy leave.\u201cYou\u2019ve changed this much, so\u2026 I wonder why.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat child returned to the main mansion while crying buckets. And she was hugging her sketchbook that\u2019s drenched entirely in tea.\u201dViolet lowered her gaze to Roen\u2019s body. She felt another headache coming on, and so she took a sip of tea before matching Roen\u2019s gaze once more. The bitterness of the tea calmed her down a little.As she was thinking of a way to get rid of this person\u2014\u201cM-Milady!\u201dMary burst into the drawing room in a hurry.\u201cH-His Grace the Duke has arriv,\u00a0hiccup!\u201dYet another bomb was dropped.A new visitor had come. And it wasn\u2019t just anyone\u2014it was her father, the duke.Roen seemed shocked as well, but it was too late. Violet was still trying to calculate whether it would be better to remove one landmine first before the bigger bomb would arrive, or if she should just let them detonate together. In the end, she quit doing that.\u201cCan you lead him here?\u201dFine. Since they\u2019re going to detonate anyway, why not make them detonate together?\u00a0Violet concluded merrily.It\u2019s clear as day that Roen visited this place while disregarding the duke\u2019s order.\u201cYou mentioned that His Grace\u2019s order was made only verbally, so I guess you don\u2019t have to keep it, right?\u201d\u201cDid I say that?\u201d\u201cYes. I heard you loud and clear when you said that. Mary, lead His Grace here.\u201dSeeing Roen unable to escape, Violet smiled brightly. It took a lot of courage to interrupt the lady and the young master\u2019s conversation, and just that made Mary\u2019s face go pale. She soon scuttled out of the drawing room, frantic.She was not well versed in the proper etiquette, however the young maid did her best to attend to the duke.As he entered the room, the duke\u2019s eyes widened as he saw his daughter and his son, conversing with each other here despite it being in complete violation of his order..,,Thus, the present situation came to be.Even after seeing Roen here, the duke did not rebuke him much.It was only now that the stillness between these three Everetts subsided.\u201cI see you have a visitor.\u201d\u201c\u2026Because Brother said that it\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dViolet made up an excuse that Roen never said. Guilty as he was, Roen couldn\u2019t say anything to refute her anyway.\u201c\u2026How have you been,\u201d the duke stoically asked.\u201cI\u2019ve been quite alright, thanks to you.\u201d\u201cSeeing the state of your clothes, you seem to enjoy painting.\u201d\u201cNothing for me to be proud of.\u201dThe conversation between brother and sister brought down the atmosphere so heavily, but the conversation between the father and daughter was even more stifling. Even so, Violet calmly replied to the duke like that, referring only to her artwork when the duke pointed out her dress.\u201cBut you look a little uncomfortable. I\u2019ll tell someone to send more comfortable clothes for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201dRoen, too, came to visit with a dress to give as a present, though one that was extravagant. His smile slipped ever so slightly. Unlike Roen, the duke was completely taking into consideration what should be convenient for Violet.\u201c\u2026It seems like I interrupted your conversation arbitrarily.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Father,\u201d Violet replied.\u201cIt also has been a long time since we\u2019ve had dinner together, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d Roen asked.But instead of answering Roen\u2019s question, the duke only drank tea. It was sure to taste bitter and overall terrible, and yet raised not even a single brow.\u201cAileen visited, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dWhen the duke pondered like so, the two siblings took that chance to breathe in. Even as the duke was in front of his own children, he did not let go of the lid on his emotions, evermore maintaining his sharp composure.\u201cRight, now that I think about it, you were never assigned an escort knight.\u201d\u201c\u2026That is the case, yes.\u201dViolet reflected on herself as well. There were surely a lot of people here and there who held grudges towards her. And ever since she was confined to this remote corner of the ducal residence and as her privileges as a ducal lady had decreased, it\u2019s impossible to know when or where she\u2019d next be attacked.\u201cI shall have this resolved as well. I will have escort knights sent here tomorrow.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRoen held his breath.This was a warning to both Aileen and Roen, who dared overlook the duke\u2019s order.\u00a0Do not go to the annex again.Violet responded calmly, nevertheless.Her safety wouldn\u2019t be an issue. Regardless of whether someone would send an assassin her way because of a grudge, she didn\u2019t really care. She gave up on thinking about hypothetical concerns.All Violet needed was rest and serenity. She\u2019d rather not exhaust herself by thinking about such grueling imaginary scenarios.\u201cYou do seem to enjoy painting quite a bit\u2026 I\u2019d like to take a look at your work if possible.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not good enough as I\u2019m still inexperienced.\u201d\u201cNo one\u2019s good at anything after having just started. I won\u2019t impose perfection on you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Alright then.\u201dAmidst the arid mood, this heavy, muddy conversation took place. Indeed, where\u00a0ever\u00a0could they find someone who was perfect right from the start?As Violet briefly recalled the past, she stopped the corners of her lips from tugging up to form a bitter smile.Violet asked Roen as well, only acting upon common courtesy.\u201c\u2026Would you like to come as well, Brother?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d love to, if you\u2019ll allow me.\u201dHe should be well aware that she\u2019s uncomfortable around him, yet he wouldn\u2019t take the hint, hah.Violet was filled with the urge to hit that snake Roen squarely in the face, even just once.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Perhaps her imagination had become a little too rich.And still with paint-smeared clothes, Violet went on to guide the two men to her unorganized studio.Mary was just standing quietly outside the drawing room, and so she followed behind the three of them as well.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Nothing to be proud of, as I said.\u201dThe two newcomers to the studio went silent.First of all, the entire room was messy.No, not just messy. It was positively chaotic.The walls had been splashed with paint, and various tools\u2014like easels, brushes and palette knives\u2014were strewn all around. It looked like they had been organized in their own way, but it still looked quite cluttered.\u201cThat\u2019s why I told you I should organize the room, Milady.\u201d\u201cIt gets confusing when things change locations suddenly though.\u201d\u201cBut I still should have cleaned up a bit.\u201dWatching how completely stunned the father and son had become while they stared into Violet\u2019s sketchbook, Mary and Violet whispered as sneakily as they could to each other.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRight after they got shocked from the mess of a studio, yet again, they were filled anew with surprise as they caught sight of Violet\u2019s art.Seeing that Roen somehow couldn\u2019t school his features, Violet frowned at him.What was he going to tell Aileen again this time?Regardless, however, whether she\u2019d grimace or not behind them, Roen and the duke just stared at her art for the longest time, perhaps grappling with their thoughts.This painting packed a punch, that\u2019s true. But it was way ahead of its time. Even so, this was the only way Violet knew how to express herself.In the era in which Violet was living now, what mattered was how realistically the artist could capture the world as did the human eye. The more similar the painting was to the subject it aimed to depict, the better it would fit the standard of beauty of this era.Violet recalled how cameras were the exclusive property of a rich aristocrat nowadays. Art movements were bound to shift along with the development of photography, but in this world, the standard was still quite antiquated.It was glaringly obvious that Violet\u2019s art was much too ahead of its time.Although this was a portrait, the style in which Violet painted her subject was with obscure, indistinct shapes.And, the person\u2019s face was covered with flowers, making it difficult to distinguish whether it was a man or a woman. Besides that, the person was shedding tears of azure and obsidian shades.At first glance, one might think that there were truncated horns in between the petals, and this suggestion might elicit the image of the devil.Aside from that, petals were typically painted with bright colors, and yet they were depicted with a gloomy blue hue here\u2014how else could this be interpreted if not odd?Gobsmacked, the duke and Roen continued flipping through the pages of the sketchbook. However, the colors that were used became brighter and brighter, with more pastel hues, as they reached the more recent pieces.But of course, they were still not painted in the style of realism.\u201cThis is, indeed\u2026\u201dActually, if Violet had come back to an era four centuries prior, she would not be able to protest even if she\u2019d get sent to the holy tribunal and condemned as a witch.Roen and the duke thought the same thing at that moment.\u201cIt\u2019s not bad\u2026 I didn\u2019t know that you had a talent such as this, my daughter.\u201dIt seemed as if the duke liked the painting nonetheless, even with that first impression.In response, all Violet did was scratch her brush and palette knife on a canvas on a whim, smiling awkwardly.\u201cYou must have reached this point because there wasn\u2019t a teacher beside you. It would be great to see the art world shift into this new direction. This is truly unique.\u201dThe duke elucidated various insights from Violet\u2019s work. Watching the duke talk a lot all so suddenly, Violet couldn\u2019t help but press down her hand in surprise.Certainly, her art was strange and eccentric, but at the same time, it had a mysterious charm that had the power to pull in the viewer.The color combinations she used were not ones that could be typically seen, and the brush strokes and textures she left upon the canvas were placed in just the right spots, proving her excellent skill.Especially, though the blue light that was shining upon the subject was quite unusual, it was beautiful.\u201c\u2026I only heard that you drew in a unique manner.\u201dAs Roen\u2019s eyes continued to remain affixed on her paintings, he murmured these words weakly.What exactly did Aileen say for him to react like this?But instead of answering him, Violet just casually shrugged her shoulders.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAll the paintings here by Yeon Ha-yoon\u2014by Violet\u2014revealed her innermost thoughts and feelings.Truncated horns. Face covered by giant petals. Black-blue teardrops, trickling down.It was the first painting that Violet made after she fell into the lake and came back to life, and it was especially dark in color.Still staring at the painting, Roen\u2019s lips moved slightly. In the end, he really couldn\u2019t say much.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s very different from what I heard.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t even know what you might\u2019ve heard.\u201d\u201cViolet, you\u2026\u201dRoen had opened his mouth to ask something else, but he was cut off mid-sentence.Duke Everett, who had been staring at Violet\u2019s painting for quite a while, finally spoke.\u201c\u2026If it\u2019s alright with you, I would like to ask for one of your paintings as a gift. Even His Majesty the Emperor would be envious.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I will have it sent to you as soon as you request it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 fine.\u201dRather, it was Roen who was more taken aback by the duke\u2019s words. It seemed like the duke genuinely liked Violet\u2019s art\u2014it wasn\u2019t just empty talk. Perhaps his younger sister and his father had the same taste?Roen briefly questioned if such tastes ran in their blood.\u201c\u2026And I would like to have tea with you again next time, if possible.\u201dRoen watched, aghast, as the duke finally concluded with what he\u2019s been wanting to say. Roen already couldn\u2019t take it, but the next thing he heard made him even more baffled.Violet smiled brightly.\u201cI refuse.\u201d\u201c\u2026Just a little of your time.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also fine for you to come to the main mansion.\u201d\u201cWhat a dreadful thing to hear. Your Grace, are you rescinding your order? While pretending like nothing ever happened?\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2014\u201dKe-hum.The duke\u2019s dry cough reverberated throughout the narrow studio. Roen took a step back from Violet.\u201c\u2026Roen, both you and Aileen are to stay in your rooms for an entire week.\u201dAt last, their punishment was handed down. Roen got trapped along with Aileen, and he didn\u2019t even get what he wanted out of this visit. He bit his lip.\u201c\u2026You really have changed.\u201dInstead of further admonishing Violet, the duke simply turned to face the painting once again, then left after saying just one phrase.Violet interpreted those words in a simplified manner.\u00a0Your temperament has died.* * *After the storm had finally passed, Violet was free once more, and so she lay back on her bed as if she had melted. There was no need for her to see them off.Leaving behind the tense atmosphere, Mary also followed after Violet.\u201cMilady, would you like a massage?\u201d\u201cNo, you must be tired. You should go and rest up. Tell them I won\u2019t have dinner tonight.\u201dStill, Mary vowed to wake Violet in time for dinner to make sure that her master would eat. She didn\u2019t want to be a salary thief again today.* * *A new member had come to the annex. It was the escort knights that the duke promised to send.For a woman who had been confined for her misdeeds to be protected by knights\u2026 Aptly enough, there\u2019s no other way to describe this than \u2018waste of manpower\u2019.At the garden, where no handmaid was in sight, Violet stared at the escort knights as she smiled in vain. The look in their eyes was clear as they glanced up at her from where they\u2019re kneeling.The duke sent a total of two knights to the annex.Of noble birth and one of the most powerful men in House Everett\u2019s chivalric order, Zylo Benthel. And, a commoner knight, Alec Hans.They rose from the ground, finishing their first greeting to their new master. Obviously enough, they looked unhappy.They must have been forced to do this. But Violet did not point out their discourtesy.Zylo Benthel was such a talented man that there were talks here and there about how he would be the next captain of the chivalric order. And since he had established a close enough friendship with Mikhail, the household\u2019s eldest son, he was too good to have been sent to the annex.The same was true of Alec Hans. He was quite known for his robust sense of justice. And even as he was a commoner, he overcame the barrier of \u2018status\u2019 due to his capabilities. He was promoted as an official knight, and it would be too much to assign him to the post of just an escort knight.As Violet gauged the knights, so too did they gauge Violet.The most wicked villainess of all time.Everett\u2019s ice witch.The cold-hearted woman who has neither blood nor tears.It\u2019s said that the number of people who\u2019d been affected by her evil deeds exceeded three digits. It was bad enough to serve her as a master, even worse that they had to treat her as a lady. This was just a temporary arrangement, but it was still terrible.Just what was the duke thinking?Zylo glanced up at Violet, but soon lowered his eyes. Just like him, Violet was also trying to figure out what could possibly be going on in the duke\u2019s mind.She then gestured as she spoke.\u201cThere won\u2019t be much to do here for knights like you. Since you\u2019ll have a lot of time on your hands, you can do whatever you wish to do.\u201dIf you\u2019re bored, then just train or something.That\u2019s what she meant.At this, Alec flew off the handle.\u201cIf you think that we came here merely to play freely\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026Watch yourself. Her Ladyship is still the Duchy\u2019s esteemed daughter in the end.\u201dAs he immediately calmed down the furious Alec, Zylo again gauged how Violet would react.However, the eyes of the wicked woman stared back at them not with fire behind her eyes, but dull, lifeless ashes....That was how new members came into the annex.* * *As they were assigned to be escort knights, there really\u00a0was\u00a0nothing that they could do here.The annex was too quiet, too peaceful.Even as she had ordered for various servants to have their tongues, hands or legs cut off, Violet was also too calm.Rather than escorting Violet, the knights had taken up this post with another objective in mind\u2014to deal with her posthaste if she were to act up. But then, they were met with only surprise as they took in the peaceful scenery before them.Besides that, Violet often talked to the maids. And it\u2019s not because she constantly gave them orders. They had \u2018conversations\u2019.Well, the maids chatted one-sidedly and Violet only answered insincerely, but it was still quite the surprising sight.Was she truly the same wicked woman from all those rumors?Zylo himself heard a lot from Mikhail, but he was now doubting his own eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 21": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Painting of the Villainess as a Young LadyCH 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAnyway, since daily life in the annex truly was so peaceful\u2014to the point that their concerns and worries were overshadowed\u2014the dispatched knights eventually decided to heed Violet\u2019s suggestion of training leisurely.And whenever they had the time, they also helped out the employees of the annex with their work. Regardless of the knights\u2019 intentions, the employees were just happy that two strong men had come forward to work here at the annex.Still, as he spent more time here, Zylo\u2019s suspicions continued to deepen.True enough, it was strange how the annex\u2019 employees, including the lady\u2019s exclusive maid, were all favorable towards Violet.Perhaps the lady was in shock after being abandoned by the family she once had faith in. Or perhaps her attitude changed after going through the crisis of a near death experience.Zylo had many theories and speculations going on in his mind as he observed Violet, who was unbelievably staying calm. In any case, all his guesswork was for naught until he\u2019d personally get an explanation.Violet was especially close to her exclusive maid. Unlike how indifferently she would interact with the others, her expression revealed a sign of sincerity whenever she was talking to the younger girl.\u201cMilady, you\u2019re going to get sick if you keep starving yourself like this!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve had breakfast and lunch. I don\u2019t have an appetite for dinner.\u201d\u201cEven just a simple meal would do\u2026 I\u2019ll get some soup and a salad from the kitchen.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do as you please.\u201dShe smiled normally, and she would get annoyed sometimes only at an ordinary level. Unlike the wicked woman from all the rumors.No, in the first place, she was far from the very picture of a prestigious dukedom\u2019s esteemed lady\u2014let alone a wicked woman, as her moniker would suggest.Zylo seriously considered whether there had been a demon lurking from underneath the lake all this time, and it had been wearing the ducal lady\u2019s outward appearance as a mask while imitating her. Alec, too, was claiming that Violet had been possessed by the devil.That\u2019s how this contemplative time passed, of them debating whether she was a harmful person or not. And in the end, they both\u2014no, Zylo was no longer wary of Violet.Now at ease, the escort knights then trained hard so as not to lag behind the knights stationed at the main mansion.And then\u2026\u201c\u2026What are you doing, Your Ladyship?\u201d\u201cCroquis.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, you must not know it, Sir Knight. It refers to a drawing practice where simple sketches of objects or people are made. It\u2019s to improve one\u2019s skill in drawing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2026He became a model for Violet.Yet again, Zylo was thrown into the waters of confusion. Has the ducal lady always been like this? She\u2019s acting much too different compared to what he heard from the young duke\u2026In agony over his thoughts, Zylo lowered his sword.Rather than the devil that Zylo thought had possessed her, Violet had become influenced by her previous life\u2019s memories. She moved her pencil with tranquil ease.\u201c\u2026I came to protect Your Ladyship under His Grace\u2019s command.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201c\u2026I am not here to be a model.\u201d\u201cI suppose so, yes. Ah, if you\u2019re going to train, can you do it while wearing your inner garment? It would be easier to observe your form through your clothes that way.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThis kind of brazen behavior fit her nickname of \u2018wicked woman\u2019 in a way. There was also that particular arrogance in the way she brushed aside others\u2019 refusal, just as how aristocrats typically did. He picked up on her arrogance, but could not win against her nevertheless.Violet\u2019s mild attitude was not limited to only the annex employees. For a second there, the young knight let his guard down, and he reproached himself inwardly. He pressed down on his simmering temper.If he were to recklessly go wild in front of the ducal lady, his knighthood might get revoked.\u201cOnce again, Your Ladyship, I am here under the command of His Grace the Duke.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to repeat yourself. You and I both know well enough that you have absolutely no intention to serve or protect me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to force yourself to serve someone you dislike just because you were ordered to do it. Ah, but I implore that you bear with me if only to be my model. As you may know, there aren\u2019t many adult men with robust physiques here.\u201dAfter she said this, Zylo could only stare at Violet blankly.Feeling the extent of his gaze, Violet shrugged.\u201c\u2026Why me?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s quite a prejudiced look in Sir Hans\u2019 eyes. And I kind of have a feeling that he\u2019s going to protest against me no matter what for the sake of justice? Ah, but regardless of that, I don\u2019t think he has a good sense of\u00a0judgment. Like a certain blockhead somewhere out there,\u201d Violet criticized.Realizing that she was the object of comparison was Mikhail, Zylo gritted his teeth. He wondered if he had the same prejudiced gaze, and he wondered if he\u2019d be ordered to pull out his own eyes.Most of all, what she said just now was not something that could just be taken lightly.What would have happened if the knight stationed here right now was not him, but Alec? Perhaps he would have already turned on the ducal lady by now. Many scenarios took place in his mind.She mentioned that as if it was nothing, but in fact, it was a significant matter. Beyond the matter of hierarchy, his loyalty must lie with the ducal household. And apart from that, he was to fulfill the role of vassal and knight to the ducal household. If these could not be done, then his value had collapsed.And with such recklessness, the same was true for Zylo as well.\u201c\u2026I shall be more mindful.\u201dPersonal feelings and work must remain separate. Even if his eyes were filled with prejudice, how fortunate it was that he could still see reason.Seeing as how the knight made the right decision, Violet laughed.After Zylo said that, he began to focus on his training again.Violet propped her chin on one hand as she watched him do basic sword swings and forms repeatedly.He didn\u2019t flatly refuse to be her model, so he might be fine with her drawing him. But then again,\u201cSir Knight, you\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHis Grace must have sent you here against your will. I heard that you\u2019re a well-renowned knight, but it\u2019s a pity that you have to waste your time guarding me in a place like this.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her voice was as dry as a desert. However, when she said, \u2018it\u2019s a pity\u2019, her tone contained sincerity.But shouldn\u2019t she be delighted that she was being guarded by an outstanding knight? It meant that she hadn\u2019t been completely abandoned by House Everett yet.Somehow, ever since the day they first met, Ducal Lady Violet had been continuously disparaging the value of her own existence.In front of her, Zylo was conflicted as to what he should say. His mouth opened and closed again and again, before he finally spoke.\u201cYour Ladyship\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can just call me comfortably.\u201d\u201cWhy do you call the Duke \u2018His Grace\u2019?\u201dNoticing the meaning behind Zylo\u2019s question, Violet smiled softly. Her hand was moving until now, but it stopped and let go of the pencil between her fingers.She stretched languidly, then answered with a smile evident in her tone.\u201cHis Grace is His Grace, that\u2019s all.\u201dHer answer was succinct.Zylo could not say anything back. He was filled with a sense of incongruity from head to toe.In the short moment that their gazes met, the corners of her eyes curved upwards.Silver hair cascading gently downwards, purple eyes that were as still as a lake.The person standing here and now was a human being. Not House Everett\u2019s villainess, not a witch with an ice heart\u2014just a nineteen-year-old girl who had never been acknowledged by her family.\u201cIt\u2019s almost time for lunch. Will you continue training?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, do you have your meals at the main mansion, Sir? It wouldn\u2019t be good for your health if you keep training with an empty stomach.\u201d\u201c\u2026My duty is to guard you, Your Ladyship.\u201d\u201cComfortably, now.\u201dYou don\u2019t have to address me so formally.As Violet\u2019s quiet murmur reached his ears, Zylo fixed his grasp on his sword.* * *The dispatched knight managed to shed his prejudice against Violet after a little while.The Violet who he saw with his own eyes was a simple person.Firstly, she was not a big eater. It\u2019s not that she didn\u2019t want to take care of her own condition, it\u2019s just that she didn\u2019t really enjoy the taste of the food itself. Therefore, the luxurious meals that had been prepared for her would always end up being shared amongst the employees of the annex.The clothes she wore were also simple. She only picked dresses that would still be fine even if paint were to splash on them.If that\u2019s not enough, Violet slept most of the time, and this troubled the maids a lot.Far from the very picture of a regal aristocrat, the impression she would give was, in many ways, that of an idle person.Far from the rumored wicked woman, she was just a poor, pitiful girl.And in fact, there was a rumor going around that Violet had personally gone to the duke to request her confinement.Considering the high, noble status she had, for what reason would a woman like her kick herself off to a miserable corner like this?Most people dismissed the rumor and thought it to be false. Zylo had been of the same mind as well.But now that he had met Violet in person, he was convinced that the rumor was true.Despite being a ducal lady who had been abandoned by her own family, she carried herself with an out-of-place disposition of tranquility.And whenever Zylo was faced with Violet, he could not immediately connect her with the \u2018ducal lady\u2019 from all those rumors.Besides that\u2026\u201cShe must have been possessed by a witch!\u201d\u201cSay something that makes sense, will you.\u201d\u201cBut you should know this as well! A spell must have been cast on all the people in here, too. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201dAlec\u2019s attitude had gone beyond recklessness and now to the realm of complete disrespect. As Zylo was a witness to this, he vaguely realized why Violet\u00a0had\u00a0to become the \u2018villainess\u2019.For whatever reason there might be, if she were to order any severe punishment unto someone, it would automatically be labeled as an evil deed.But at the same time, not a single doubt was given as to whether the subordinate might or might not have made a mistake in the first place.Still, even if her side were to be considered, would her actions still be labeled as good deeds?In the end, she was only enforcing her authority.With a commoner background yet with such remarkable skill that he was ordained as a knight in his own right, Alec Hans was undoubtedly competent. Even so, he had this one, certain trait: his persistently single-minded sense of justice. It was because of this that he would not even try to listen to the other person\u2019s side just because she had once been labeled evil.\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense! How could that witch who did so many wrongdoings just run scot-free like this? And for her to be so happy by herself here while going\u00a0haha! hoho!\u00a0with everyone else? Even now, I hear that Lady Aileen continues to cry at the main mansion\u2026\u201dAt this point,\u00a0only\u00a0his competence was certain.Zylo\u2019s head was pounding from all of Alec\u2019s squealing. He pressed a hand against his own forehead.If all the impertinent things that Alec was spouting now were to reach Violet\u2019s ears, what would happen? If her reputation rang true, then she just might come out and order, \u2018Hack away at his tendons, give him thirty lashings, and kick him out to the streets.\u2019Of course, no one would be able to refute that order, and no one would blame the person who ordered it. After all, it was justified.No. Rather, if an ordinary noble were to order such a thing, nobody would speak against them.However, if Violet were to act in such a way, she would never be able to avoid criticism.\u201cIf I may ask, is the Ducal Lady you\u2019ve seen with your own eyes that kind of witch?\u201d Zylo asked.\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying! Everyone\u2019s been trapped in that witch\u2019s spell! You just haven\u2019t been able to see a painting by that witch, Sir Benthel. She surely must have used malicious witchcraft.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And if one were to give up on individual judgment to the precedence of the crowd\u2019s voices, then those original characteristics would soon transform once more into ignorance.Zylo was well-acquainted with one such person who\u2019s like that.He closed his eyes, recalling what Violet said the first time they met.\u201cThere won\u2019t be much to do here for knights like you. Since you\u2019ll have a lot of time on your hands, you can do whatever you wish to do.\u201dWhen Violet said this, there was a serene expression on her face. However, the rising connotation behind her words was different.\u2018You wouldn\u2019t want to protect me sincerely anyway, so just do as you please.\u2019Her words had been twisted as such from another person\u2019s perspective.The people around her were so blinded by prejudice, to the point that they wouldn\u2019t believe the truth even if it was laid bare right in front of their own eyes, and they continuously accused an ordinary person like her of being a witch.One after another, she received such malice and spite. How then could she be able to survive?\u201cSir Benthel?\u201d\u201c\u2026Raise your sword.\u201dThe cure to insolence was a good lashing.* * *Zylo raised his sword several times as he reprimanded Alec for his impertinence, but the latter man\u2019s rude words and actions would not let up easily.Even when the lady was only doing something easygoing, Alec constantly suspected her of being a witch who was concocting an evil scheme. Seeing the guy run wild like that, Zylo\u2019s sighs only deepened further.What was he to do with this blockhead. It would be a problem if he\u2019d report it to their superiors, but it would also be a problem if he would not.Surely enough, however, he was serious when it came to the chivalric order. Zylo spent more than half the day beating up Alec.But still, Alec refused to admit his mistakes. He denied his willful ignorance.For as strong one\u2019s principles could be, the collapse of such would consequently endanger one\u2019s own ego.It was so tiring to deal with just one person like this. How worse could it possibly feel if anyone and everyone were to look at you with such a prejudiced perception?Malicious rumors could break a person ever so easily.For a person whose spirit had been broken in that way to smile again, they would have to recover themselves once more, tend to their wounds and overcome all that they experienced.In reality, Violet\u2019s fabricated smile was not just detached\u2014it was\u00a0empty. She looked so lonely even as she was smiling.Zylo thought of Violet, then thought of Mikhail, the liege who he would be serving in the future. For as long as he could remember, Mikhail had always regarded Violet with hostility.Mikhail\u2019s disposition was similar to Alec\u2019s.But, no. Zylo corrected his own thoughts, shaking his head vigorously. He mustn\u2019t compare a dukedom\u2019s heir to a commoner.Right now, what he\u2019s meant to do was\u00a0not\u00a0to ruminate....Meanwhile, Violet was already aware that Alec had been talking nonsense about her. She knew, and yet she did not enforce any punishment onto the young man.She just smiled quietly as if she was used to it. And this was an established fact\u2014this always happened, after all.\u201c\u2026Good grief.\u201d\u201cI shall correct his impertinence.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not even saying anything untrue. Why don\u2019t you just let it go?\u201dZylo felt frustrated. In contrast, Violet was calm. She had long since learned not to waste any more time and energy on unnecessary emotions.She did not bother to point out the knight\u2019s insolence, did not bother to get angry, and did not bother to order for him to receive lashings. Although punishing the knight was something an ordinary noble would have naturally done, all she did was pay him no mind. She didn\u2019t want to deal with someone who detested her to that degree.\u201c\u2026I shall correct his impertinence.\u201dThe upright knight repeated the same words. Even if Violet had chosen to sit still about this matter, as a knight of this ducal household, he could not find it in him to leave that unruly guy undisciplined.Alec\u2019s \u2018loyalty\u2019 was in direct contrast to the \u2018order\u2019 he had been given and with \u2018justice\u2019 in itself. Nevertheless, he\u2019d still argue that his actions were brought about by his own principles.In the first place, his definition of \u2018justice\u2019 was not righteous.It\u2019s true that what Violet had done in the past could clearly be considered immoderate. Still, it was also the righteous punishment based on the law, which she had an obligation to uphold as a noble.Under that pretext, would it still be right to pour such criticism onto a ducal lady\u2014no, onto a human being?Yet in the end, these were all futile concerns.Whether or not Alec\u2019s impertinence would rise to the sky, Violet actually just drew and painted without giving him a second of her time.Besides that, even if Alec were to run wild, no one would stand by him. At least, not here.With Alec being especially hostile towards Violet, the employees of the annex did not like him one bit.As a natural result, he\u2019d become ostracized at the annex. The more isolated he became, the more his hostility against Violet burned. However, that flame burned only by itself.Sometimes, during the days that he had to go back to the chivalric order at the main mansion, Alec worked busily to proliferate Violet\u2019s \u2018misdeeds\u2019.He even started saying that she had entered a contract with a demon that was conveniently hiding away at the annex, and that she was using that demon\u2019s power to brainwash people.People sometimes needed a common enemy in order to band together. And if that common enemy was someone who they could not directly confront, then their imaginary notion of that person was bound to swell out of control.Without fail, time marched on.And all the while, various stories and rumors about Violet were exchanged.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And, still as ever, her art had the ability to ensnare the viewer\u2019s heart.Among all the things that Alec said, the only thing Zylo somewhat agreed on as well was how \u2018Violet\u2019s art looks like a witch\u2019s painting\u2019. If she had been born a few hundred years prior, she would have been recorded in the history books as exactly that\u2014a witch.Even so, while her art continued to rattle the viewers\u2019 minds, her daily life did not change all that much.Violet still got along with the employees. And she secretly enjoyed chatting with the maids, it\u2019s just that she liked to listen to them more rather than to talk.She spent long hours working on her new painting, and even more hours sleeping.The days were peaceful.The position of Violet\u2019s model for her sketches had eventually been relegated to Zylo; they were always together anyway. In the end, he resigned himself to being her croquis model.With how much hustle and bustle this all was, a picnic\u2014or something like a picnic\u2014was naturally how they spent those leisurely hours.The same was true of that day. Mary laid out a mat where Violet usually sat, and even brought out some snacks that had been prepared beforehand. Zylo was usually given some snacks to eat as well.\u201cSince we\u2019re already here, I want to observe your muscles, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026I will pretend that I did not hear that.\u201d\u201cOh, Uncle\u00b9! Is your body in good condition?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not an\u00a0uncle.\u201d\u201cMary, all knights are quasi-nobles, so you have to be more careful with how you talk to them. Besides that, Sir Benthel is clearly of noble birth.\u201d\u201cOh gosh, I apologize deeply.\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s fine.\u201dMore peaceful days followed, except for one.* * *Alec was eventually kicked out of the annex.Well, it would be vague to say that he was \u2018kicked out\u2019. Nonetheless, it\u2019s a good thing to Violet and everyone else that he no longer returned to this place.It was Duke Everett himself who expelled Alec from the annex.Though he was a very busy man, Duke Everett dropped by the annex at least once every two weeks.No particular commotion led to Alec being expelled. Rather, unlike how obviously he bared his teeth in front of Violet, he laid flat on the ground while he was in the duke\u2019s presence. He showed such a weak disposition the moment he was faced with someone stronger than him.Still, he was demoted.At the duke\u2019s singular behest.And the reason behind this was simple\u2014that man\u2019s eyes were insolent.Alec did not dare protest against the duke\u2019s command. His name removed from the dukedom\u2019s chivalric order and was promptly demoted to serving a vassal householdZylo lamented briefly. Another knight would have taken that guy\u2019s place long before if only he reported this earlier. If he did, the duke would have overturned the entire chivalric order on the grounds that they all dared to behave recklessly against their superior.Then again, the person involved herself did not care a single bit about anyone who was hostile to her, and this included Alec.Of course, the duke, too, was not exempt from her indifference.The meetings between the ducal lady and the duke were always simple. They could have a brief chat over tea, then they would go upstairs so that the duke could take a look at Violet\u2019s paintings. The duke did not have a lot of time to spare, so there was only a limited number of things he could do during that time span.Standing by them as they interacted in this way, Zylo was quite tired of watching the father and daughter like this.Herron, the duke\u2019s aide, gave Zylo a comrade\u2019s smile. The only one who was already used to the sight of the father and daughter was Mary, and she followed and attended to Violet without fail.\u201cBut when will you send me a painting\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you truly wish to have one?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not one to say empty words.\u201d\u201c\u2026We do not have enough manpower here to send someone out separately.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll send another new escort knight tomorrow.\u201d\u201c\u2026Please do not send more than one. I dislike it when things get complicated.\u201d\u201c\u2026Alright.\u201dAs he listened to their conversation, Zylo recalled one from long ago.Mikhail once vented his anger to him, saying that the duke\u2019s favorite child was Violet.After the duchess passed away, it\u2019s true that the duke did not take particular care of the household\u2019s internal affairs, but there weren\u2019t any talks about him giving the ducal lady special treatment either. So, Zylo brushed this off lightly, thinking that it must just be something that only the siblings thought.But he found out later. As a matter of fact, the duke favored the ducal lady. Indeed, despite the ducal lady doing such terrible things, the duke did not give her any punishment. This proved his favoritism.Still though, with the duke\u2019s demeanor towards her bordering more on apathy, it\u2019s difficult to say whether that kind of affection\u00a0was\u00a0affection, let alone favoritism.Zylo observed the father and daughter in front of him again. Being a witness to the duke\u2019s unusual taste in art and the ducal lady\u2019s resolute attitude\u2026 Zylo unknowingly took another step back.Beside him, Herron smiled faintly. There\u2019s a chance that he\u2019s only calculating how much leftover work there was and how many overtime hours he\u2019d have to face later, but nevertheless, his smile was mixed with a hint of lamentation.* * *The new escort knight that the duke sent was a quiet man.He might be under the notion that the same thing might happen again if he were to send a knight from a commoner background, so the new knight that the duke sent was a member of a vassal household, just like Zylo.The new escort knight, Ozen, was taciturn\u2014in as much that he could not be read. Well, Violet didn\u2019t bother to wonder what\u2019s going on in his head anyway, so she soon moved on.Even the people of the annex did not reject the new knight who was not making any racket.But no matter what kind of change went on around her, Violet continued drawing or painting whenever she felt like it. In fact, there\u2019s nothing else that she had to do besides this.\u201cMy body\u2019s a little stiff.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it because all Milady does is lie down or draw every single day? You also have to move your body sometimes!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dViolet was, for the most part, serene. However, there were still times when her excessively peaceful life would be struck with anxiety.This ducal residence was not a peaceful place at its core. Just as the emperor ruled over his empire, the duke, too, ruled over his enormous duchy. As such, the duchy contained such politics and its own government as well.And it\u2019s for this reason that the duchy was overwrought with political intrigue, while incidents and conflicts were never-ending.\u00b9 Uncle \u2013 translated from \u2018ahjussi\u2019, and I wanted to translate it as \u2018mister\u2019 instead, but it\u2019s a term of address that I\u2019d like to reserve for later in case it\u2019s needed. Basically, Mary called him \u2018uncle\u2019 because he seemed too old to be called \u2018brother\u2019, to which Zylo feebly protested against.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since it was physically far from the main mansion, so too was the annex far from the problem of successors and complicated political issues between households.It\u2019s quite ironic, really. Everett\u2019s wicked woman, who was always at the center of each and every mishap, had found rest and tranquility while isolated all alone.\u201cI\u2019m bored.\u201d\u201cMilady? Despite everything, you\u00a0do\u00a0know that you mustn\u2019t do the laundry or the dishes, yes?\u201dMary put on a stern expression the moment she heard Violet\u2019s languid murmur.These days, Violet was feeling especially bored.All the more so because her hand wouldn\u2019t follow what kind of image she had in her mind as she was painting.Well, it\u2019s right to say that she\u2019d been painting recently, though she had only ever used black paint on the canvas a few times. She began to look for other things to do besides working on the painting.And those other things included doing the laundry and washing the dishes. Naturally, the employees of the annex became frantic when they saw her doing that.\u201cI already said I won\u2019t do it, so don\u2019t worry. Eshika made so much fuss about it, and now you\u2019re doing it too.\u201d\u201c\u2026You really can\u2019t.\u201d\u201c\u2026I already said I won\u2019t.\u201dAfter that, Violet snooped around the annex for a long time, looking for something\u2014anything\u2014else to do besides painting.In the end, she couldn\u2019t overcome her boredom and thus dropped a bomb.\u201cShall we go out?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cOutside. To the nearby town. You know, the town outside the gates.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dFor a moment, Mary doubted her ears completely, and so she asked back twice. Carrying out his escort knight duties in the background, Zylo and Ozen\u2014the new escort knight\u2014were also surprised.\u201cIsn\u2019t it okay for me to just go for a little stroll? And the town near the ducal residence isn\u2019t a bad place for that.\u201d\u201cS-Still\u2026\u201dMary weakly tried to reason with Violet. Then, Zylo let out an outburst.\u201cYou cannot!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t?\u201d\u201cHas Your Ladyship forgotten why you are here now?\u201d\u201cAh, right.\u201d\u201cEven if you are allowed to go out for a while, it\u2019s not possible for you to do so with just two accompanying knights!\u201dWhat kind of fool would let a detained individual wander freely? These two guards here, who were sent to enforce the probation, still had to do as they\u2019re ordered obediently.Even if this was really just confinement in name only.Growing a little sullen, Violet murmured to herself in a melancholy voice.\u201c\u2026I really can\u2019t?\u201d\u201cNever, no matter what, by no means at all. But if you truly wish it, Your Ladyship will directly have to ask His Grace the Duke for permission.\u201d\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t wanna do that though.\u201dOn the other hand, Zylo sincerely answered inwardly.If Your Ladyship personally tells His Grace about it, His Grace would go ahead and tell you to just come back to the main mansion altogether.In any case, the outing that Violet\u2014or Yeon Ha-yoon\u2014wanted to go on was an ordinary outing. She didn\u2019t want to go around the streets being lauded as a ducal lady. Even if she\u00a0was\u00a0given permission, the places she could go to would still be limited.She just wanted to go out freely, but she\u2019d be met with only sad news either or.\u201c\u2026Hmm.\u201d\u201cNo matter the case, Your Ladyship cannot go out. For as long as I keep my eyes open, it will never happen.\u201d\u201cI got it, I got it.\u201dWhen Violet hinted at giving up, it\u2019s only then that Zylo felt relieved.He escorted her back to her room and didn\u2019t train for the day.\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t, huh.\u201dOf course, humans were such virulent creatures whose desires burned deeper when they\u2019re told that they\u2019re not allowed to do what they wanted to do.* * *Two days had passed ever since Violet mentioned that she wanted to go out.In the meantime, the upright knights watched ever so vigilantly with dark shadows under his eyes.As the annex had turned into a makeshift family, everyone there regarded Violet as a niece, and they all defended her in her wish to go on an outing.The simple reason behind this was this: people turn strange if they just stay at home all the time.\u201cEven so, Your Ladyship really cannot.\u201d\u201c\u2026Your Ladyship does not even have to consider it.\u201dIn response to the knights, Violet merely shrugged.Then, wouldn\u2019t it be alright to go around the forest that\u2019s surrounding the annex?But Zylo dutifully replied that the forest was very wide, and so it\u2019s more likely than not for her to encounter dangerous monsters in there.If it\u2019s so dangerous being close to those monsters, wasn\u2019t it also true that it\u2019s dangerous to stay at the annex since it\u2019s\u00a0surrounded\u00a0by the forest? So what\u2019s new?Violet wanted to ask this, but she just pressed down the urge to do so. The knight in front of her was so fiercely opposed to letting her go out.After four days of this war of nerves, Violet disappeared from the annex.\u201cWhere is Her Ladyship? Is she not awake yet?\u201d a knight asked.\u201cYes, of course, it\u2019s, normal,\u201d the maid answered awkwardly.\u201cAh, Sir Knight, would it be alright if you chop some firewood since you\u2019re here? It\u2019ll be good to do it in advance,\u201d another maid suggested.\u201c\u2026But isn\u2019t it strange that Mary\u2019s nowhere to be seen even though Her Ladyship has overslept?\u201d\u201cOh, right! Where has my mind flown off to. I forgot to turn up the fire, so\u2026\u201d\u201cSir! Wait a second!\u201dIn short, Violet went out with the help of the employees of the annex.She escaped right out of the gates while disguised as a maid. The coachman, Georges, was her accomplice.Zylo interrogated the maids and soon found out how the lady escaped. His heart pounded heavily at the thought of what kind of admonishment he\u2019d be receiving once the duke would find out about this.In this whole world, what kind of maid has silver hair, purple eyes and such smooth hands?It couldn\u2019t be helped since she already escaped. He had to secretly bring her back as soon as possible.If he couldn\u2019t find her, then he would have to confess the truth to the duke so that the chivalric order could lead a search party.Did the lady even know what kind of trouble she\u2019s stirring up right now!Well, regardless of all that, Violet was now wearing some borrowed clothes from the kitchen maid Rosie, and thus set off for a trip to town. She was just happy that she had something new to do today.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And the third was Eshika, a kitchen maid of the annex.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people even though it\u2019s still the morning.\u201d\u201cBecause this is the largest commercial district in the entire dukedom! Ack\u2014 Milady, you can\u2019t walk around on your own.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I remember coming here a few times.\u201dBack then, she wore only flashy dresses and went straight to the boutique.Violet laughed. Thanks to Mary\u2019s efforts, she had gotten a little closer to the people in the annex as they were nothing but strangers before.Since she had lived all her life as a high noble, it\u2019s only natural that she wouldn\u2019t know how commoners lived.With that thought in mind, Violet smiled as she took in her surroundings. Everything\u2019s a bit more advanced compared to how she recalled them in her memories.She also recalled how Aileen was sent the same designs of the clothes she bought from the boutique she often frequented. Oh, how furious she had been back then. But it\u2019s all in the past now.\u201cMilady, this way.\u201dEshika was in charge of guiding her around the area, and so she led Violet dutifully. Mary was a new maid, so she didn\u2019t know her way around. The group followed Eshika calmly.\u201cIs there a particular place you would like to visit?\u201d\u201cI just wanted to go out, so there\u2019s no particular place that I actually wanted to\u2026 Ah, wait. Is there an art supplies shop around here?\u201d\u201cArt supplies\u2026 I\u2019m not quite sure, but I believe there\u2019s a general store nearby.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s start there then?\u201dGeorges considered himself to be the girls\u2019 guard today, but in the end, he became their porter.After looking around at the general store, they all ate together at a nearby restaurant.Although the quality of the ingredients there wasn\u2019t as good as what she\u2019d get at the ducal residence, Violet commented that it was delicious.Though it seemed tactless, Mary even asked Violet if they should have these dishes made for her at the annex next time.No one pointed out the ducal lady\u2019s demeanor as she enthusiastically enjoyed the street food she encountered.After eating, they also drank tea. There were quite a few customers at the teahouse, which was frequented by wealthy merchants and wealthy commoners alike.Just looking at this scenery made her feel a bit sentimental. Violet\u2019s outing ended simply in this manner.They returned to the annex using the same carriage they rode on their way out.Upon seeing Violet, Zylo grabbed the back of his neck and looked like he was about to collapse from high blood pressure.* * *Since then, Violet\u2019s outings became more frequent, and it became sort of like a routine. Zylo would object, but as the employees of the annex would feel sorry for the girl who\u2019s trapped here together with all of them, they all banded together to protest. Even the righteous knight couldn\u2019t resist.He finally gave up when he reported this to the duke.The duke merely told him to accompany her as her escort knight.Violet was vehemently against standing out in the crowd, so Zylo had to dress up as a commoner as well, and he had drinks together with the ducal lady as well.Not so different from Violet, Zylo himself had been brought up as a noble as well, so these outings with Violet became a special experience for him.It felt as if no hardships or sufferings had happened before this.Violet wandered around town, saying that she was going to buy some paint, but at some point, she settled down in front of a fountain and began to draw.Curious passers-by gathered around her, and she started making portraits of them at low prices.Quite indignant as he stood by her, Zylo glanced down and asked why she willingly found work for herself like this.Silvery white hair, purple eyes with the depth of lakes.Despite being dressed as a commoner, her aristocratic disposition could not be obscured. Though they didn\u2019t know who she was, some people started whispering amongst themselves about the posh young lady.It never occurred to them that the duke\u2019s esteemed daughter herself would go out in the streets in an outfit like that, but nonetheless, everyone seemed to have guessed right away that she was of high nobility.Besides that, it would have been stranger for them to immediately guess her true identity, what with the spiraling rumors about her outside the ducal residence.Rumor went that she regularly bathed in the blood of virgins to protect her own youth and beauty, or that she\u2019s heavily involved in a physical relationship with a man to the point that each day was a raucous spectacle.How could she be so misrepresented in such rumors?One could only wonder who was behind this. Unlike rumors based on facts, the rumors going around in the streets were so terribly far from who Violet fundamentally was. Still, since all those rumors were so unlike her, Violet easily brushed off their rudeness.Despite such rumors, the one consistent thing was that Aileen was playing the role of the poor little princess who was being tormented by a wicked witch.Violet didn\u2019t pay these whispers any mind. Rather, the ones fiercely against these rumors were Marie, Rosie and Georges\u2014but Violet held them back. As she was immersed with painting, she said, \u2018Don\u2019t arbitrarily make a fuss here.\u2019All those who received a sketch-like portrait from her were delighted. It\u2019s not good enough when compared to the kind of portrait one could get from an official painter, but in the first place, it was not so easy to have one made if you weren\u2019t born of nobility or of wealth.Apart from the insidious rumors about Violet going around everywhere, the expressions of those who received portraits were moderate enough.It was a peaceful, but not completely peaceful outing.Lost in thought for a moment, she thought back to the little boy who threw a stone at \u2018Violet\u2019 when she went out in the past. What happened to that kid? Was he dead?After all those malicious deeds that had been committed, it\u2019s far too late to feel guilt or remorse.She could not deny that she inflicted pain unto others.In a self-deprecating mood, Violet drew today\u2019s outing to a close....One day, as Violet went out secretly in search of small happiness,A summons for her came from the main mansion,With the news that Aileen drank poison and had collapsed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Painting of the Villainess as a Young LadyCH 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDeath is the scariest thing in this mortal realm.It was the very antithesis to life.The end of life. The conclusion of one\u2019s story.Who in this world would welcome death.\u201cIf I die, will I be able to feel at ease?\u201dWho in their right mind would wish for death.Violet, who was also Yeon Ha-yoon, recalled her death in the past.In its own way, the mundane life she had lived was something to be proud of. Even so, it was a fact that Yeon Ha-yoon\u2019s life was unfortunate.Her life had been so luckless that it could be called \u2018squalid\u2019.The matter of being impoverished couldn\u2019t only be through poverty of the material sense. For example, if you\u2019d like to buy something but you didn\u2019t have enough resources for it, you\u2019d have to sacrifice a portion of your life to get what it was that you wanted. This, too, was proof of poverty.Which was why it had been a great act of rebellion for her to take up painting. It was the kind of rebellion that an eldest daughter could do in a family of four\u2014with one son and one daughter.Once upon a time, Yeon Ha-yoon thought she had talent.But this thing she called talent, too ambiguous to be distinguished, became a shackle that had bound her. This ambiguous talent was a hole in the ground, a pit into which she had fallen.The painting she so very liked, at some point, became a duty. From then on, she could not find joy in it any longer. And after that, the life she led was nothing special.Even her death wasn\u2019t all that distinct. It was a rainy day. It was an accident. She followed the pedestrian signal, yet was nonetheless killed in a traffic accident because one car skidded in the rain.She had died relatively young. During the period in which she had\u00a0just\u00a0managed to stand up on her own two feet, when she was\u00a0just\u00a0about to try finding small things that she wanted to do\u2026She died and was reborn as Violet. This second life was not in the least sense mundane, yet it was arduous. She used all her strength in an endeavor to be acknowledged, and she used all her power to crush others so that they would not look down on her.Even so, how could one say that this had been a proper life? All she did was lower other people so she could raise herself into a noble being.It was a challenge she had taken on, yet could not win in the end. She only hurt herself. So one day, as she was filled with only malice and hostility towards all others, the young woman\u2014whose sympathies lay only with herself\u2014fell into a lake.She hated Aileen. She hated that girl like hell. So she harassed the girl.She harassed her, and harassed her again, and harassed her even more. She was so overcome by this all-consuming malice that it had inevitably turned self-destructive.She tried to live as a dignified ducal lady. Touting her birthright, she crushed anyone and everyone who dared look down on her.But on the day that she fell into the lake, Violet thought.How did it turn out like this? Why did I have to become this way?Violet was not inherently evil. Unlike Yeon Ha-yoon, Violet had been born into a wealthy household, and she was a daughter who was loved by her family.Her two older brothers loved her enough, and her younger brother had been quite attached to her.And regarding Aileen, her relationship with the girl wasn\u2019t bad from the very beginning either.Aileen was her cousin, and their ages were apart by only a few years. During their childhood, Violet took care of Aileen as if she was her younger sister. They were close because the only girl around her that was close to her age was Aileen.It was like this until Aileen\u2019s family had passed away from an accident. The small child was then taken into the household as Violet\u2019s real younger sister.At first, it was mere jealousy. No, perhaps it was just a misunderstanding.The ducal lady, who was dying because she could not breathe underwater, thought this:Malice is a double-edged sword. Malice unto others would inexorably return as malice unto yourself.As a matter of fact, the malice that had returned to her was greater than even the malice Violet had actually shown to Aileen.She was an older sister who persecuted a small child who had lost her parents; an evil little girl who bullied a child who would have already been miserable on her own even without the torment she was subjected to.Why did hatred, spite, and malice surge within her in the way that it did?\u201cNanny said something to me. The previous duchess is a gorgeous woman who has beautiful golden blonde hair, but why is Sister\u2019s hair silver?\u201dDuke Everett had black hair. The late duchess had beautiful blond hair. How could a child with silver hair be born between two such people?The innocent child had posed an innocent question. There was no malice behind her curiosity.However, Violet got angry.She got so angry that she shoved the younger girl straight away.\u201cOwwie\u2014 I-It hurts.\u00a0Ugh, hiic\u2026 uwah\u2026\u201dChildren were smarter and sharper compared to how little adults gave them credit for.The first time might have been just a fluke\u2026But the second time.On that second time, Violet became certain.She was only an eight-year-old kid. What was it about her that made them all hate her so much?Even compared to six years old, eight was still young. What\u2019s so hateful about a child, who\u2019s just two years older than the other, that she had to take all of those people\u2019s malice?And after being fed with more provocation and an abundance of rumors, that malice budded into something much bigger.It\u2019s impossible for a little girl to bear it all.Like waves upon waves crashing into her, the more she was expected to be perfect, the more the little girl solidified into a \u2018bad child\u2019 in their eyes.In a current wherein it\u2019s impossible to swim, the reprieve of respiration eluded her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The servants reviled her. The people she believed she was close to gossiped about her behind her back.\u201cSister, you brought it all onto yourself.\u201d\u201cSister, you will never be loved.\u201d\u201cSister, you know what? That place you think is yours has always been originally mine.\u201dOn the very day that Aileen mocked her and said all these things, Violet was thrown into a realization of just how meaningless it all was.It was at this moment that she hoped for death to come to her.So, she did not rebel against death.Once she\u2019s dead, would there be at least one person who\u2019d mourn for her?But the silent lake did not answer.With no will to live, Violet sank endlessly until she plunged to the bottom of the lake.Death was right in front of her now, but this was what she thought:I want to live.I just don\u2019t want to live like this .I also want to receive everyone\u2019s recognition.\u2018I also\u2026 want to receive\u2026\u2019It was for this reason that she broke down.She knew that her death would not hurt them at all, but at the very least, she hoped that they would be a little saddened by it.However, Violet did not die. The duke rescued his daughter and spent an astronomical sum of money just so she could be saved.She was deprived of even death. Whether it was out of the intention of using her life, or whether it was out of love\u2026 Whatever the case, she was not allowed to die.It was thanks to this that Yeon Ha-yoon opened her eyes to this world, and she did not want to die. She wanted to live longer.Thus, her yearning for life was revived, and the two personalities within her blended together.Yeon Ha-yoon sympathized with Violet. Granted, she thought that Violet was foolish, but she knew that the girl had no other choice.* * *Calm purple eyes met furious green eyes.The resentment in his gaze was palpable. Violet pretended to be calm as she faced the raw anger that was being hurled at her.\u201cVIOLET STELLA EVERETT!\u201dMikhail bellowed at the top of his lungs without any restraint. He was bristling to the point that it looked like he was about to march right up to Violet to slap her across the cheek.\u201cYou really can\u2019t resist making a huge mess, can you.\u201dAll his anger was suppressed with that single line, and it was as sharp as a dagger that\u2019s flung straight at Violet.In the past, perhaps she\u2019d have shouted back and said that it\u2019s unfair? Nevertheless, Violet sipped her tea casually.\u201cThe culprit hasn\u2019t been clearly identified yet, yet you\u2019re already shouting like this. Do you have any proof that it was me who did it?\u201d\u201cHa, haha\u2026 Is that, is that something that even has to be asked\u2026\u201dWith fury that couldn\u2019t be chalked up to immaturity, dejected laughter filled the banquet hall. Roen muttered something to himself. The duke just watched the whole scene unfold.By any chance, would he really slap her while so many eyes were watching?But Violet smiled at Mikhail, who already had a track record of doing so.\u201cOther than you, is there anyone else in this entire residence who would scheme against Aileen?\u201dOh, there were a lot. Since time immemorial, there were many things that Violet didn\u2019t actually do but were credited to her. So, it could be said that there really were a lot of people who were conniving against Aileen.She did not answer.\u201cPeople were saying that you\u2019ve been quiet ever since you were confined to the annex, but it was all a ruse\u2026!\u201dSince arriving at the annex, the only thing Violet ever pursued was her own happiness. It was accurate to say that she\u2019d been quiet.Although, there were of course times that she snuck out.In any case, Mikhail continued to be indignant.\u201cAnd you\u2019ve resorted to poison now?! What the hell is it that\u2019s making you hate that child so much!\u201dWhat, he asked? Was he really asking because he didn\u2019t know what had been urging and fostering her behavior?Nonchalance painted upon her face, Violet asked back.\u201cDo you think that if I\u2019d have really resorted to poison, the outcome would be as sloppy as this? I would have made\u00a0sure\u00a0to take her life, you know.\u201d\u201cRight now, what did you just\u2026!\u201dViolet laughed.If she had really been set on killing Aileen, it wouldn\u2019t have ended this way. She would have very much made sure that she\u2019d never see that hateful face ever again.On that note, why hadn\u2019t she thought of killing that girl before?Briefly lost in thought, Violet asked herself, but the answer quickly came to her.All she wanted was her family\u2019s recognition.Even if she had killed Aileen without anyone knowing, it\u2019s obvious enough that her family still wouldn\u2019t have given her their time of day.Or perhaps the thought of taking someone else\u2019s life just never crossed her mind. Everett\u2019s wicked woman had a more innocent side than expected.Yet again, Mikhail became infuriated as he watched Violet acting so carefree. The atmosphere of the dining hall was oppressive.\u201cStop.\u201dThe duke, who had been watching until now, finally moved to calm the situation down.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s not like Father summoned us here for no reason.\u201d\u201cEvidence? What evidence is even needed?! Is there anyone in this residence who doesn\u2019t already know that the culprit is Violet?\u201dThe seething Mikhail was like a hot-headed bull right now. A bull that\u2019s rushing into everything in its sight.Roen\u2019s words made Violet smirk. It\u2019s hilariously ironic how Roen himself\u2014someone who\u2019s quite adept at persecuting people without clear evidence to back up his claims\u2014was saying a fact such as this.True enough, she had plenty of ways to prove her innocence. But you wouldn\u2019t have to be a genius to know that nobody would believe her.\u201cI already told you to stop, Mikhail.\u201dThe duke\u2019s stern voice reverberated throughout the hall. He spoke in a sharp, dangerous tone, and at this, Mikhail flinched and sat back down on his seat.\u201cViolet, speak.\u201d\u201cI am not the culprit behind this poisoning incident.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dViolet spoke simply without a single word of excuse.Even if she were to try and make excuses, she didn\u2019t even know the whole story. She hated hearing even the slightest mention of anything regarding the main mansion, so the employees of the annex only talked about small things here and there that were unrelated to this place.Violet couldn\u2019t have known about the current situation because she had distanced herself so much from the rumors inside the residence, and she didn\u2019t really pay attention to them either.Quite literally, she knew nothing about the incident.\u201c\u2026Then how do you explain this?\u201dMikhail gnashed his molars. He asked the duke for permission to let someone in.\u2018Hm\u2026\u2019Violet grimaced slightly as she saw the fairly familiar face. On the other hand, a sense of triumph entered Mikhail\u2019s features.\u201c\u2026Her Ladyship has been going out regularly, about twice a week.\u201dIt was Ozen, the knight who the duke appointed as her escort knight to replace Alec, who got demoted.\u201cHow do you explain that, huh? You can\u2019t even refute this at all. You went out as you pleased, but have you forgotten that you\u2019ve been confined? It\u2019s obvious that you used this opportunity to instigate the poisoning.\u201dMikhail let out an impassioned speech. Violet sighed as she felt a throbbing migraine pounding at her head.The duke and Roen\u2019s eyes also turned to her. Three pairs of green eyes were now fixed upon her.Without meeting anyone\u2019s gaze, Violet answered.\u201cIt\u2019s true that I snuck out, but I did not instigate the poisoning.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cYou still insist on lying?! Every time you open your mouth, you just spew lies! It\u2019s been like this ever since you were a child, and nothing has changed!\u201dAt the same time, someone hummed to himself and another one answered with rage. Sweeping a hand down his face, the duke gestured towards Mikhail once again to calm him down.\u201c\u2026Have you forgotten your situation, Violet?\u201d\u201cI apologize deeply.\u201d\u201cI shall hand down a separate punishment for this.\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201d\u201cFATHER!\u201dSeeing as the duke showed no signs of treating Violet as a criminal, Mikhail shouted directly at the duke. From Violet to the duke, Mikhail\u2019s wrath was redirected.\u201cFather, it is your lenient attitude that has caused this situation.\u201d\u201cDo not behave rashly.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dViolet watched the scene unfold before her. She was quite surprised.Under normal circumstances, she would have been immediately accused. Above all, what bothered her was that Roen was being calm.Glancing sideways at him, Violet knew just what kind of snake-like craftiness Roen possessed.While skimming through the documents in front of him, Roen frowned slightly.\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t it possible that she\u2019s not lying?\u201d\u201cRoen, even you now\u2014!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m talking about a mere possibility, Brother. If you look at the reports, you can see that Violet only bought a few things at a general store, ate at a restaurant, and opened a stall by the fountain.\u201d\u201c\u2026How do you know that?\u201d\u201cYou seriously believe that drivel right now?!\u201dViolet and Mikhail answered at the same time.Displeased, Violet scowled openly. Roen shrugged and handed the documents to her.As she read through the documents, Violet felt her energy waning.\u201cDeparted the annex at 1100 hours, accompanied by Zylo Bendel as escort\u2026\u201dThe report contained Violet\u2019s whereabouts, which even she couldn\u2019t fully recall. Her bewildered gaze turned to the duke.The duke, as ever, remained expressionless.\u201cDid you really think that I wouldn\u2019t have attached someone to you with how often you go out.\u201d\u201c\u2026I, I apologize.\u201d\u201cThough you have been confined, do not forget that your surname is Everett.\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201dIn other words, the duke already knew about Violet\u2019s outings, he was just letting them slide. He even secretly had people following her.Was this what it felt like to be trapped in a large cage? It was so enormous that she didn\u2019t even know that she was, in fact, inside a cage.Only now realizing that escort knights had been following her from the shadows for her safety, Violet withered.t/n: just gotta say, complaining in the comments section does nothing to boost my motivation to update more. rather, it would just achieve the opposite effect. this chapter has been posted soon after the last one only because i\u2019m following the novel\u2019s internally established schedule, not because of a single comment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You must\u2019ve made the servants do the work for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you saying that I coerced my employees to poison someone?\u201dMikhail was firm with his rebuttal. For a moment, Violet wondered if her older brother was not right in the head and perhaps delusional.\u201cIt\u2019s only obvious that you\u2019ll refute it. You\u2019ve been lying ever since you were a child.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hah.\u201dViolet let out a sigh that\u2019s full of frustration. It\u2019s so annoying to constantly be accused of lying even though she never once lied.He\u2019s even bringing up her childhood.Violet stared at Mikhail. She thought that she had managed to give up on everything, but amidst the burnt ashes flitting behind her eyes, a spark of burning anger flickered.Then, Roen spoke up.\u201cBrother, I\u2019ve told you over and over again, but it would be better if you can just calm down.\u201dBANG!The moment Roen said these words calmly, Mikhail hit the table. The action born out of fury made Roen grimace.\u201c\u2026Tell them to enter.\u201dThen, suddenly, the duke gave an order.A total of three people came in. Two were familiar faces to Violet, while the remaining one was a stranger.\u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201c\u2026It is true that Her Ladyship went out, but she did not do anything else besides what\u2019s been reported, Your Grace.\u201dEven though he was suddenly called here, Zylo was calm. On the other hand, Mary was visibly distressed.Violet prayed that the young girl would not accidentally make a mistake here.\u201cZylo!\u201d\u201c\u2026I am telling the truth, Young Duke.\u201d\u201cWhy, you\u2026!\u201dHearing the testimony of his once close friend, Mikhail became indignant.Oh, the irony. Ozen was siding with Aileen, while Zylo\u2014who was close to Mikhail\u2014was siding with Violet.\u201c\u2026But it is true that Her Ladyship went out without permission,\u201d Ozen said.While Zylo added, \u201cIt was I who could not fulfill his duty. However, I can assure you that Ducal Lady Violet did not do anything related to instigating someone\u2019s poisoning. I stake my last name on the line.\u201dA person\u2019s last name carried significant weight amongst the aristocracy.It carried one\u2019s blood relatives, as well as one\u2019s status\u2014basically, it held the very value of any noble\u2019s life.Seeing Zylo trying to prove Violet\u2019s innocence at the risk of his last name, Mikhail grabbed the back of his neck, his temper rising to its limits.\u201cI-It is true, sir! Milady didn\u2019t do anything much\u2026 And she did not meet anyone else!\u201dThis time, Mary stood up for Violet. Mary had always been insisting on Violet\u2019s innocence in the first place\u2014anytime and anywhere. As always, she shouted stubbornly.\u201cMilady is a truly good person! Why would she do such a thing! And I am constantly by Milady\u2019s side. I never saw her hold a bottle of poison or anything like that!\u201d\u201c\u2026Can you take responsibility for what you\u2019re saying?\u201dAt Mary\u2019s insistence, Mikhail asked.Wasn\u2019t what he\u2019s doing considered intimidation of the weak? Violet sighed.\u201c\u2026Mary has nothing to do with this case,\u201d Zylo said.\u201cCan you really say that with your last name on the line? Ha, haha. For all we know, she made that little maid do all the work.\u201d\u201cStop! I already told you not to act rashly!\u201d The duke bellowed.This was the reason reputation must be built well.Mikhail persistently kept refuting her innocence despite there being witnesses to prove that she was not guilty. Watching him like this, Violet felt her mood sinking.If she could, she wanted to pour hot tea right on that face.\u201cYou, speak.\u201dThe last person who had entered the hall was a young woman around Violet\u2019s age. She had just been looking at other people\u2019s faces until now, but she suddenly dropped to the ground and prostrated.\u201cT-The Ducal Lady ordered it!\u201d\u201cWho are you even?\u201dThe baffled Violet asked back reflexively.Roen answered calmly.\u201cShe was the maid next to Aileen when she collapsed after ingesting poison.\u201d\u201cAh, sure\u2026\u201dViolet\u2019s bitter murmur filled the hall. No one could speak at that brief moment.\u201c\u2026Are you telling the truth?\u201d\u201cY-Yes! I-I am telling the absolute truth, Your Grace. I was threatened\u2014I had no choice but to do that terrible thing\u2026\u201dIs that so.The duke stroked his chin.For a second here, Violet wanted to crack open her father\u2019s head.He was the kind of man who would maintain that same poker face in front of his children at all times. There was no way to know what he\u2019s thinking.\u201cCan you take responsibility for your words?\u201d\u201cH-Hiiiek!\u201d\u201cThe consequences to committing the crime of contempt against the Duke would be incalculable.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019ve\u2026! I-I\u2019ve been framed!\u201dViolet rummaged through her memories and finally recalled the name of this young woman.Wasn\u2019t she a daughter from a lower noble house? Violet had no need to remember this woman, so she forgot all about her, but she would have never expected for this woman to hit her on the back of the head like this.\u201c\u2026Drag Selena Alton and Ozen Veroel to prison. As for you, Mikhail. You will be placed on house arrest for one month.\u201dThe duke neatly wrapped up the case like so.Violet couldn\u2019t help but think that her ears heard it wrong. She asked, unthinkingly.\u201cWhy?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m just wondering why you\u2019ve come to this decision.\u201dIn response to Violet\u2019s query, the duke held out several more documents. Everything written in them were more details about Violet\u2019s whereabouts.The previous documents contained just her simple routines and the records of her outings. But these\u2026 These contained even words that Violet had uttered in verbatim.Just one glance was all it took to know that the level of investigation with these was different.In general, they were mere accounts of how she had been idly sleeping her days away, but the level of surveillance was so severe that Violet felt her head starting to throb again.\u201cI merely declared an innocent person to be innocent. Or, do you not believe in my competence?\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s not that.\u201d\u201cYou seem to be objecting.\u201d\u201c\u2026Have you been putting me under surveillance all this time?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not surveillance. It\u2019s only an investigation.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t mean to invade your privacy at will,\u201d the duke added.But even when he said that, Violet\u2019s face continued to express just how futile she thought it all was.\u201c\u2026The charges against me have been cleared up, so may I leave?\u201d\u201cYou are on a one-week probation.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why?\u201d\u201cYou snuck away several times without permission. You didn\u2019t think you\u2019d get away with that, did you?\u201d\u201c\u2026No. I understand.\u201dThis case was closed, for the time being. Violet could not object any further because she was still guilty of sneaking out.Along with Mary, Zylo and several other knights, Violet went back to the annex.The duke assigned those additional knights to Violet because, while she was nonetheless confined, it was still deemed dangerous to have too few knights when Aileen had been poisoned not long ago.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201dAnd before she went back to the annex, she clearly heard that weak apology.It was from Roen.With one hand covering most of his face, he continued to look through the documents with a face full of shame.* * *It was a farce of a trial\u2014nothing but a theater play of sorts for an audience to watch. They already knew that Violet was innocent from the start, and even knew who the real culprit was.It was a theater play just to display how exactly the people of the ducal estate had been treating Violet.\u201c\u2026Father, you.\u201dFurious that none of his opinions had been accepted, Mikhail stared at the duke.\u201cFather, are you really letting Violet get away with no charges?\u201dUntil the very end, he continued to insist on Violet being the culprit. In truth, his suspicions against Violet were valid because of her actions in the past.\u201c\u2026What is it that you want to say.\u201d\u201cThis always happens, Father. You\u2019re always biased.\u201dMikhail snarled those final words before he stomped out the dining hall\u2019s doors.He was not wrong. Favoritism in the guise of indifference was the inherent cause for a situation like this to happen. Perhaps it would be right to say that the duke was the sole person at fault for all this.\u201c\u2026When did you start investigating?\u201d\u201cI did so only because it\u2019s needed.\u201d\u201c\u2026Violet had never lied.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThroughout the trial, Mikhail shouted and insisted that Violet was a liar.But she never lied. In a number of similar situations in the past, Violet swore by her innocence every time.\u201cFather, do you believe that Violet should not be blamed?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, of course not. It can\u2019t be. Because it\u2019s true that she harassed Aileen.\u201d\u201c\u2026Roen.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like that. It was certainly like that\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll leave that to your own judgment.\u201dThe duke rose from his seat, swiftly ending the discussion. Being as busy as he was, he still needed to take care of the rest of his work.The people who faced Violet, all engulfed in a flurry of hatred, would never be in the right disposition to judge fairly. So eventually, the truth would slip away to who knows where.\u201cHa, haha.\u201dRoen laughed in vain. Ever since he met Violet at the annex, he had been grappling with such conflicting thoughts within him.How did a person, who always looked at everyone with such poisonous eyes, be left with absolutely nothing but emptiness behind her gaze now?One person tried to talk to the other, yet the other only ignored that person.An older brother ignored his younger sister, who always shouted and begged for him to listen to her.She asked him to believe her over and over again, but he dismissed all her words as mere lies.It was Roen himself who did all that.\u201cBrother! Look, look. Isn\u2019t this flower pretty?\u201dWas Violet vicious from the very start?Did she only ever hate and bully Alieen from the very beginning?No one ever listened to her story. No one believed her and only ever thought of all her words as lies.So now, she would not defend herself anymore.Even though Violet had enough opportunity to prove her innocence.She thought that it was no use.She gave up.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dViolet had tormented Aileen, this was true.Yet, to the point that she had no choice but to do so, to the point that she could not help but become wicked, and to the point that she could only ever live amidst endless malice\u2026Who was it that pushed her to the precipice of haplessness?Who was it that forced her to give up on everything?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But still, it\u2019s impossible for Violet to have poisoned her.On the one hand, Violet admittedly thought that she herself was half-crazy. But so was Aileen\u2014that girl was also out of her mind.Whenever a similar incident happened before, Violet surmised that there must be someone else other than herself who disliked Aileen.\u201cM-Milady\u2026 Are you alright?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m okay.\u201dViolet hesitated to answer for a short while, but she eventually replied grudgingly. Her escort knight just followed silently behind her.It\u2019s not as if she wasn\u2019t used to this already.\u201c\u2026But you\u2019re not, Milady.\u201dAfter they returned to the annex, Mary calmly took one of Violet\u2019s hands in hers.I\u2019m used to it. I\u2019m okay because I\u2019m used to it.Violet replied to herself, but she paused. Only then did she realize that she was trying to answer, but she couldn\u2019t because her throat was all choked up.I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m used to it. And maybe the same thing won\u2019t happen again. I\u2019m okay.As Violet was about to give this answer, she moved her lips slightly.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not okay.\u201d\u201cMilady\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m, not okay. I, I\u2026\u201dJust because she\u2019s used to it didn\u2019t mean she was fine. Tears trickled down.But because she\u2019s not fine, it\u2019s all the more reason to\u00a0be\u00a0fine. She did not want to show how much she was struggling at the bottom of the abyss she was in. As ever, she held onto the aloof demeanor she used as a mask.The more something like this happened, the more her self-worth crumbled. But she continued to act the same way.Mary glanced towards the door. Standing there, Zylo sighed and left the room. After a while, the tactless knight brought in a tray of tea that might help stabilize the lady\u2019s mind and body.Violet once asked Aileen.\u201cWhy! Why in the world are you doing this to me! What did I do so wrong!\u201d\u201cSister.\u201d\u201cI hate you. So what? What do you want from me?! I just, again, why must I be\u2026!\u201d\u201cSister, you brought it all onto yourself.\u201dThat day, something broke inside Violet.It was just another day when Violet had pointed out Aileen\u2019s etiquette at the family dinner, and in retaliation, her brothers criticized her for doing so.It was the same as usual, but it was especially heavy for Violet that day.Finally letting go of her pride, Violet shouted.What in the world did I do so wrong?!Of course, there were countless wrongdoings attributed to her. However, how could a person who\u2019s been so eroded by self-deprecation recognize her faults?Then,\u201cYou really don\u2019t know? You brought it all onto yourself. Everything.\u201d\u201cBrother Mikhail, and even Brother Roen\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already spelling it out for you, Sister. The things you did wrong. Why are you talking as if you never did anything wrong?\u201d\u201cSister, you brought it all onto yourself.\u201dAileen said all these things, and she was not wrong.But she wasn\u2019t quite right either.How could she say that everything was Violet\u2019s fault when there\u2019s clearly\u00a0someone\u00a0who\u2019s causing all this?Yet, neither could Violet claim that Aileen was to blame.It\u2019s my fault. It\u2019s all my fault. Because I\u2019m bad. Because I\u2019m not a good kid. Because I\u2019m an evil person.Her thoughts became like that.Because Aileen said so.\u201cPoor Sister Violet\u2026\u201d\u201cSister, you will never be loved.\u201dAileen laughed.So many people praised her to be the very embodiment of an angel, but to Violet, the girl was terrifying.It\u2019s laughable how the most loved person was saying such a thing.While looking at Aileen\u2019s eerie smile, Violet unknowingly took a step back.And when Violet finally collapsed, Aileen smiled again.\u201cSister, I want to be close to you.\u201dIt was neither a bashful nor a contemptible smile. It was the girl\u2019s natural smile.\u201cSister, you know what? That place you think is yours has always been originally mine.\u201dThe place she was talking about was that of a splendid ducal lady, a noble position Violet owned that was bound to be envied by everyone.As Aileen proclaimed that it was originally hers, she gave Violet a natural smile.Aileen tore Violet down as she pleased, and she was satisfied watching Violet break down into tears while running out the room.It was on that same day that Violet plunged into the lake.\u201c\u2026I want to hear your story, Milady.\u201d\u201cI, I\u2026\u201dViolet did not tell Mary her story. She said that she felt lonely, that she felt wronged, but she could not bring herself to tell the story behind these feelings.And Mary did not force Violet to pry open her wounds.Though she felt that her previous personality had blended together with Violet\u2019s, she had been unconsciously trying to separate herself from Violet all this time. An indistinct smile graced her lips.Zylo, who brought tea with him, watched the two young women awkwardly, unable to find the right timing to leave.* * *The relationship between Violet and Aileen was not bad from the onset.Aileen\u2019s father was the older brother of the current Duke Everett. He gave up his right to succession for the sake of love.Having achieved his small happiness, he sometimes brought his family over to the ducal estate, and Aileen often played together with her cousins.She was a younger cousin who was close to Violet\u2019s age.Violet had been quite fond of the lovely little girl because she only had brothers.But when the duchess passed away, this painting-like harmony began to collapse.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It took him quite a long time to function again.And less than two years after the duchess\u2019 death, Duke Everett\u2019s older brother died as well. It was a carriage accident.The sudden accident claimed the lives of both the duke\u2019s brother and the wife of his brother. They were just a young couple. The only survivor was their small daughter, who wailed at the funeral.\u201cWhen\u2019s Mommy and Daddy coming back, Nanny? You said they\u2019re getting Allie a gift\u2026\u201dStill unable to comprehend death, the little girl cried and wailed throughout the solemn funeral. The duke adopted the child and entered her in his family registry.Ever since the duchess departed, a shroud of glacial air hovered over the ducal estate.Duke Everett wasn\u2019t formerly very involved with the household\u2019s internal affairs, and the children were still in shock after their mother\u2019s death. They no longer ran around and made a lot of noise inside the house\u2014it became completely quiet.In a place seemingly frozen by a midwinter storm, one bright child came in like spring itself.Violet, at eight years old, could not easily understand why her cousin suddenly became her younger sister.However, she wished to become a wonderful person just like her late mother, and so she started behaving like a dignified adult despite being a child herself.And so, in this ducal household, the only child who remained a child was Cairn.As a cousin, Violet quite liked Aileen. But not as a younger sister.Ever since the girl was adopted into the family, the attention of Violet\u2019s brothers and father were all focused on Aileen.But she\u2019s a pitiful girl. As a big sister who was two years older than her, Violet figured that she should take care of Aileen.In truth, Violet also needed the care and attention of someone older. But until two years prior, she endured the heavy, oppressive air in the household all alone.The start of it all was, yes, only a trivial matter.Something small and forgettable that no one else but Violet remembered.\u201cNanny said something to me. The previous duchess is a gorgeous woman who has beautiful golden blonde hair, but why is Sister\u2019s hair silver?\u201dIt was a very small opening.Such a thing was whispered covertly amongst the maids and the handmaids, but Violet did not know that. She heard it first from Aileen.Violet got angry.She merely threw a tantrum as a child would, and she pushed Aileen straightaway. But the moment the little girl burst into tears, the brothers came running.\u201cWhat did you just do, Violet?!\u201d\u201cBut she started it first!\u201d\u201cShut up. It doesn\u2019t matter who started it. Is it right for you to use violence like this?!\u201dOne small child had collapsed to the ground and was crying. Another small child was huffing with anger.On the surface, it was obvious which child was wrong. So, the person who got scolded was inevitably Violet.Violet was only eight years old. She was also young, and she also just lost her mother.But in this situation, Aileen was outwardly more pitiful.Violet defended herself and was outspoken about her innocence, but she was completely ignored. Mikhail carried Aileen in his arms and scolded Violet for a very long time.Mikhail was yet another child who was pretending to be an adult. But, in the end, it\u2019s obvious that he was not a mature adult just yet.It couldn\u2019t be counted just how many more similar incidents occurred, even though they all started with only normal squabbles between children.Aileen secretly wore Violet\u2019s clothes, but when she returned them, they\u2019re all ruined. So of course, Violet got angry.Because Violet could never seem to understand her younger sister, and because she was always angry at the girl, Violet was the only one who always got scolded.The day that Violet finally exploded was the day Aileen lost the necklace that the duchess had left behind.A fight broke out.The memento Violet had of her mother\u2019s was lost. It was only obvious that she\u2019d be furious the moment she saw Aileen again. She had told Aileen not to touch her stuff over and over and\u00a0over\u00a0again, but the girl would not listen.And Violet\u2019s anger intensified further because no one ever sided with her.Then, the duke stepped in.\u201cShe took my stuff! I told her not to!\u201dShouldn\u2019t their father react differently?Unlike Mikhail, who was only pretending to be a grown-up, and Roen, who never failed to follow behind the eldest brother\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re grounded for a week.\u201dViolet was expecting something different, but all her hopes were disastrously shattered.She was punished for the reason of not behaving properly as a ducal lady.Aileen was also reprimanded for taking Violet\u2019s belongings without permission, but it was nothing more than a light slap on the wrist.Once or twice could be called a coincidence, but a third time could never be just that.Violet could not understand why Aileen kept doing it\u2014she didn\u2019t know what kind of thoughts went on in the girl\u2019s mind whenever she did.But at some point before, the roles had already been set.Violet was the bad older sister who always bullied her younger sister.Aileen was the pitiful younger sister who was always persecuted by her new older sister.And that was the time that Violet\u2019s life began to fall apart.\u201cHiic, hiic\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat happened this time?\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m okay. B-But Brother\u2026 Sister, she\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Haa. Violet,\u00a0you\u00a0again. How many times must I tell you\u2014\u201d\u201cBut she started it first!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re making the same excuse again. Fine, I guess it\u2019s impossible for you to treat your younger sister kindly. But why are you always so eager to harass her?\u201dOh so consistently, the timing was always perfect.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She\u2019s a child who always had to walk on eggshells. She\u2019s a poor, pitiful child.There were countless reasons behind Aileen\u2019s circumstances. Violet herself realized the solidified truth that her words, whatever it was that she\u2019d say, were all futile.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ignore her, Milady? Don\u2019t give her any attention and pretend that she\u2019s not there.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you really think that\u2019ll work, Nanny?\u201d\u201cOf course. Milady doesn\u2019t need to do anything. I\u2019ll make sure to explain everything to the young masters.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dLooking back, Violet recalled that there was a time when someone was on her side.But she soon gave up trying to remember the face of the nanny who never failed to side with her.\u201cViolet.\u201d\u201c\u2026What.\u201d\u201cThat child follows you around because she likes you so much, but you don\u2019t even care about her.\u201d\u201cBrother Roen, are you talking about that kid?\u201d\u201cPlease, just take care of her even a little.\u201dIt was easy for Violet to treat Aileen as if she was not there.It was fine at first. She didn\u2019t have to get angry.But for some reason, Aileen started following Violet around.\u201cBrother, you too! You like her more than me!\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s not what I mean.\u201dThen, this time, she became a bad older sister in a different sense.One night, Aileen cried and cried all night to the point of losing her voice. All because she wanted to get close to her older sister, but Violet kept ignoring her.Roen pacified Violet, but did not forget to tell her to get along with Aileen.Aileen, who was nice and angelic.And Violet, who was unlike the kids around her age, who was immature, and who was prone to doing such wicked acts.\u201cSister, look at this. Aren\u2019t these flowers pretty?\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s pretty.\u201d\u201cBrother Cairn picked these flowers for me. But I\u2019ll give some to you, too, Sister.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t need it.\u201dAileen approached Violet while pretending to be friendly. Violet thought Aileen was being nothing but abominable.She hated Aileen. The girl stole her dresses, her jewelry, her food, her family\u2019s love.Everything.\u201cYou pumpkin! Who the heck are you to bully the angel!\u201d\u201cI never bullied her.\u201d\u201cIf the angel\u2019s giving it to you, just receive it properly. The angel\u2019s crying now!\u201d\u201cWhy is she an angel? And I\u2019m not a pumpkin.\u201d\u201cArgh! Just take it! Take all the flowers!\u201dSympathy was such a devious thing.Those flowers were offered to Violet as if they were mere alms for the poor, so she didn\u2019t want to receive them. Even that was a pathetic sight.So, uselessly, she built up her pride.She tried to change her circumstances, but the ending was always the same.Aileen was a pitiful child. Violet was a mean older sister who refused to understand her younger sister.And, at some point, Violet did not have a single person to lean on anymore.Her nanny said that she was going back home because of a family problem.The maids who used to take good care of Violet disappeared some time or another.The person in charge of Violet\u2019s education made a point to stamp out Violet\u2019s viciousness.The handmaids, who once doted on Violet very much, now liked Aileen as if it\u2019s been that way forever.\u201cI wonder why it became like that. I don\u2019t remember how it started, but I just kept my guard up all the time.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d\u201cIt came to a point where I couldn\u2019t even take a step out of my room. But at least I could still ask the maids to bring me some books so I could pass the time\u2026 Things like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBut then I heard that I apparently tore apart a stuffed toy. The stuffed toy that that child cherished a lot.\u201dOne day, while she already had her guard up, she exploded in anger once more because she couldn\u2019t\u00a0not\u00a0say anything.Violet became responsible for something she never did.Everyone automatically thought that Violet was completely at fault. After all, she hates Aileen.Violet insisted on her innocence, but nobody believed her.\u201cYou\u2019re even resorting to lies now.\u201dThis was also the first time that Mikhail showed such contempt for Violet.Violet never tore up Aileen\u2019s stuffed toy. She wasn\u2019t in the position to do so.While staring at the teddy bear that had been cut up with scissors, she wondered just how much she tried to protest against the injustice being thrown at her.But still, nobody believed her.The teddy bear was Mikhail\u2019s first gift to Aileen, so Mikhail was particularly angry about it.She was being blamed for something she never did. Who in the world wouldn\u2019t feel wronged in this situation?Violet screamed the whole time. No one sympathized with her.\u201cThat kid can destroy my things, but I can\u2019t destroy hers?\u201dThe same thing happened more times after that.Violet merely pointed out Aileen\u2019s clumsy etiquette, but at some point, Violet\u2019s actions became interpreted as a one-sided attack against someone who never did anything wrong.There were so many things that Violet was not responsible for, yet all of them were attributed to her anyway. She was criticized even more.Being a little grouchy turned into a colossal mistake.One day, she shouted directly at Aileen, expressing her frustration.\u201cI really didn\u2019t do it\u2026! You know this!\u201dWhat Aileen said in response\u2026It was one of Violet\u2019s unforgettable memories.\u201cSister.\u201d\u201cSister, you hate me, right?\u201dAt that moment, the flabbergasted young ducal lady could not say anything back.For the first time, the quietly smiling girl showed that face.That innocent, yet at the same time, goosebump-inducing face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was determined to become that kind of elegant and refined person.She thought it would be okay as long as she remained superior to that girl.\u201cBut people have such cunning minds. Rather, the more I did that, the more I was held to such higher expectations.\u201dThe late duchess had acted better under the same circumstances.She had been charismatic and generous at the same time.Even if she was generous, she made sure not to let it damage her authority.But how could a child and an adult reach the same results? The more Violet imitated a dignified adult, the more other people\u2019s contradictory words were hurled at her, constricting her so much.And meanwhile, her heart truly became twisted in earnest.It was because of the steady accumulation of false accusations, even if they\u2019re only small, and the cold provocation that Aileen did to her once in a while.Violet hated Aileen. She\u00a0despised\u00a0the girl. But at the same time, she was jealous of her. She violently loathed her.It was a miscalculation for her to think that she was going to be okay as long as she was superior to Aileen. The only thing it did was accelerate her isolation.\u201cLook at the sight of you. Do you truly call that a proper walk? No matter how I look at you, you shouldn\u2019t be called a Ducal household\u2019s esteemed daughter.\u201d\u201c\u2026What you\u2019re wearing is practically a rag. Do you not even consider how much your actions will bring down the Duchy\u2019s reputation?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a hypocrite. You keep acting according to your whims, but can\u2019t you think about how much trouble that will cause?\u201dSometimes, Violet\u2019s own words sounded too harsh even to herself. But those words slipped through her lips regardless.In an attempt to smear Aileen\u2019s standing, all Violet achieved was the destruction of her own character.Perhaps out there, there\u2019s one or two people who admired Violet\u2019s actions. Well, it was only during those days.Fourteen years old and twelve years old. Both girls were still young, but Aileen was younger than Violet, and Violet\u2019s standards of etiquette were much too high.Whenever this happened, Mikhail, Roen and Cairn would all criticize Violet for her harsh words. However, Aileen would dissuade the brothers. She even cried.The people around them praised Aileen\u2019s kind heart for defending her older sister.Never once did Mikhail listen to Violet.He always just told her the same things.You should be more understanding of her younger sister because you\u2019re the older sister.Why can\u2019t you be more understanding of your younger sister?The onslaught of harsh words made Violet, at some point, turn into a narrow-minded, petty person.Mikhail started thinking of Violet as a liar, and he considered every word that came out of her mouth to be false.As for Roen\u2026 Since when was it.Unlike the other two brothers who openly despised her, Roen did not stop smiling at her.\u201c\u2026So, there was a time when I hoped that Brother Roen would listen to me.\u201dViolet smiled lightly. What was it that Roen said in response?\u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t act like that. If you try acting differently, people will believe you, too.\u201dWhat he said was abominable, pretentious and hypocritical.Violet asked back.\u201cBut until what point should I be good?\u201dThe fourteen-year-old Violet was already doing the best that she could as she was at that age. After being poured with such malice, she didn\u2019t know how to act anymore.Nobody listened to her story.All she heard from others\u2014from those outside the barriers she had erected\u2014was a bunch of hypocritical words.\u00a0You can change,\u00a0they said.Despite Violet\u2019s retort, Roen just spewed more hypocrisy.Your actions are wrong, so you\u2019re to blame. That\u2019s why you have to be good.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s not that there was absolutely no one who listened to me.\u201dViolet made friends with young noble ladies of her age. One of them deeply sympathized with Violet, but at some point, she started keeping her distance. Then, she started hanging out with Aileen.Aileen always compared herself to Violet.\u201cI\u2019m not good enough compared to Sister.\u201d\u201cUnlike Sister, I\u2019m just\u2026\u201d\u201cOther people will like someone like Sister a lot more than me.\u201dAs she continued to say such things, more and more people were cutting themselves off from Violet.Aileen\u2019s way of comparing herself to Violet was quite peculiar.Whenever she did so, it was always framed in a way that Violet was a \u2018villainess\u2019.Aileen sometimes told stories about things that Violet didn\u2019t do as if she really did.To be misunderstood for things that she didn\u2019t even do\u2026 Was there anyone else who knew best?If Violet couldn\u2019t trust anyone, then she had no choice but to stay alone.After trying, struggling, fighting to be acknowledged, finally Violet became perfect.But no one acknowledged her.She had already been stigmatized as a bad child, and so the moniker of \u2018villainess\u2019 gradually blossomed.Thus, as the ducal lady had nowhere left to lean on, she finally gave in to that title.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Isn\u2019t that really, truly, terribly sad?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I did those things. I figured that I might be less sad if I get criticized for things that I\u00a0actually\u00a0did.\u201dWhich was why Violet finally became the villainess everyone thought her to be.She ordered for a gossip monger\u2019s tongue to be cut off.She poured wine all over Aileen\u2019s abominable face.She slapped the girl across the cheek at a banquet hall.She tore up all the clothes that Aileen dared to copy from her.She humiliated the girl without hesitation in front of others.She ordered the legs of someone in her way to be cut off.She flung things, she broke many belongings, she screamed while thinking that everyone was cursing at her.Seeing that she didn\u2019t have some things that Aileen had\u2014realizing that she lacked compared to the girl\u2014she threw many things away and worked harder than anyone else to get results.No one around her was trustworthy, so she spitefully acted out against everyone. That\u2019s when she was labeled with the term, \u2018vicious\u2019.No one believed her, so she was perfectly isolated.Aileen sometimes took off that \u2018good girl\u2019 mask of hers. The girl did so only whenever she was alone with Violet.She could not trust anyone. There\u2019s no way they\u2019d believe her. She hated the girl\u2019s pretentiousness, her hypocrisy. There shouldn\u2019t have been a need for her to turn wicked just because she hated pretentiousness and hypocrisy.But her vicious behavior could not be excused, even if it all started only because she wanted to fight against that.Violet went on to act out against anyone who dared to come close. She used violence against them without fail.Among all those people, could she truly believe that there\u2019s a single person who would be on her side?In the end, it\u2019s impossible to consider Violet as a completely innocent victim.Whether it was pity, attachment, compassion, or rationalization\u2014whatever it was that they felt towards her, no one truly wanted to get close to Violet, the villainess.Not a single grain of expectation was left in her heart.Yeon Ha-yoon sympathized with Violet because she knew that Violet didn\u2019t have a choice but to do those things. But at the same time, she did not deny that Violet was, in fact, a wicked woman.A wicked woman who had no choice but to become the way she was. She had no other option, but evil was evil.\u201cMary, did you see it too? When Mikhail yelled at me. Ah, I\u2019ve also been slapped by him before. I hit him first though.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s always been like that. What could I possibly say when no one believes me? They all say that I\u2019m a liar.\u201d\u201cMi\u2026lady.\u201dMalice was a double-edged sword. Violet\u2019s voice trembled as she spoke, but she tried to pull herself together by the end.\u201c\u2026Aileen\u2019s right. It\u2019s my fault, after all. Everything I did was my own responsibility, and everything I\u2019ve received is in retaliation to my wrongdoings.\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be true! What, what has Milady done so wrong\u2026\u201d\u201cThere were people who lost their homes because of me, people who I insulted and inflicted pain against unnecessarily. Would they think the same?\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s only because they attacked you first!\u201d\u201cEven so, there are some things in this world that shouldn\u2019t be done.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re, you\u2019re not at fault, Milady.\u201dMary sobbed audibly. Violet closed her eyes and slowly stroked Mary\u2019s hair.In the end, malice was detrimental for all people involved.Without a start, there would be no end. Without a cause, there would be no effect.Violet was able to break that cycle of malice as she was in the middle of it.However, it remained unfair that she had tormented innocent people for no reason.Mary also knew well enough that Violet had done terrible things. But still, she continued to say,You are not to blame.At this moment at least, I am on your side.\u201c\u2026I believe you, Milady.\u201d\u201cFufu.\u00a0Thank you for that.\u201dViolet chuckled. She was smiling now, but her voice was still shaking.Mary shed tears for Violet.If Roen truly held any concern for Violet, he should have consoled her in this way. He shouldn\u2019t have tried to resolve things blindly.\u201c\u2026To be honest, I wanted to die.\u201dIn the midst of the subdued atmosphere, Violet\u2019s words filled the silence of the room.She never did anything good, so what else was there for her to do if not to wish for death?\u201cIt\u2019s just, a fleeting thought passed through my mind. Would they regret it after I die? If I die like this, at least one person might regret it, right? Someone might think of me. Even just a little bit, someone might think of me\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cRidiculous, aren\u2019t I. I wanted to die, but I couldn\u2019t. No one would feel sorry for me if I lived and died just like that.\u201dViolet spoke calmly, but Mary carefully hugged her and patted her on the back quite awkwardly, but it contained the sincerity of the small girl.\u201c\u2026Ke-hum.\u201dAs the conversation came to a lull, Zylo\u2014who had been standing next to the two girls while still holding the tray of tea\u2014awkwardly cleared his throat.The mood changed in an instant.\u201cI\u2019m on your side, Milady,\u201d Mary continued.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo matter what anyone says. Other people, too\u2014Eshika, Rosie, Angelica. Everyone\u2019s on Milady\u2019s side!\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dMary didn\u2019t mind Zylo at all. Somehow, Violet found the situation funny, and so she laughed.\u201cCome to think of it, you\u2019re close to Young Duke Mikhail, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Mary asked.\u201c\u2026That is\u2026 was the case.\u201d\u201cAre you going to tell him?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMary practically growled at him. Zylo flinched right away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Nothing changed much except that she could not paint.Violet wondered what she could do except sleep.Meanwhile, a new knight came again. This time, it was not the duke who brought him in, but Zylo.The new knight was still young. Although he hadn\u2019t been officially ordained as a knight yet, he was a promising boy with remarkable talent.Because he was still young and was very obedient towards Zylo, the young knight treated Violet with caution. He didn\u2019t think that his respected superior would tell him anything incorrect.The reason Zylo managed to pick out a knight personally was because he told the duke, \u201cYour Grace, the new knight will be escorting Her Ladyship together with me. So, to ensure that we can work well together, I would like to choose him personally.\u201dZylo pleaded to the duke because he could not trust the duke\u2019s eye for people.Likewise, Violet also thought that the duke had a terrible eye for people, and she briefly thought about the future of the Everett Duchy. She couldn\u2019t believe that a duke like him had no eye for people.She didn\u2019t have much lingering feelings about her family anyway, so she didn\u2019t care very much.As she continued her life at the annex with the people who now surrounded her, she noticed that she had gained some weight.Stretching with a body that felt heavy, Violet stood up.\u201cOh, Milady? Why are you holding a sword?\u201d\u201cNothing much. I guess just to exercise?\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201dWhile wearing a temporary, soft armor, Violet wielded the sword and did a few stances. Mary clapped as she watched.Zylo expressed his suspicions.\u201cDid you learn how to use the sword, Milady?\u201d\u201cA little, back when I was a kid.\u201d\u201c\u2026You learned just a little, you say\u2026\u201dZylo\u2019s eyes became clouded.It\u2019s not like female knights weren\u2019t common in this time period. Definitely, as long as one would practice steadily, they\u2019d see good results eventually.Violet laughed as she noticed what the knight was thinking.\u201cThere was a time when I wanted to be perfect in it. But Aileen copied me, so I quit right away.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dBecause he had listened to Violet\u2019s story the other day, Zylo understood and sighed briefly.Aileen used to copy whatever it was that Violet did. Sometimes Aileen was better than Violet, sometimes worse.Whenever she was better than Violet, Aileen was rightly praised. In front of Violet.And whenever she was worse than Violet, she was comforted. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, Violet was subsequently reprimanded for criticizing Aileen.When it came to swordsmanship, Violet was more talented than Aileen.However, Violet quit one day.It was the day she was slapped by Mikhail.\u201cBy any chance, would you like to pick it up again?\u201d\u201cPerhaps for self-defense, but I don\u2019t think I have the aptitude for it, so I don\u2019t want to continue. Though I can take it up as a hobby sometimes, I guess.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBriefly, a hint of melancholy flashed in Zylo\u2019s expression.He had to ask\u2014were all of the current duke\u2019s talents passed down to Ducal Lady Violet?Violet, who genuinely thought that she had no talent in swordsmanship, practiced for a few minutes and eventually put it down.Huk, huuk\u2026The two people who were sitting at the side watched silently as the lady breathed roughly.Despite her talent, Violet had too little stamina. And of course, this was because she only leisurely hung out and ate for two months.\u201c\u2026Milady, you should exercise every morning. How much do you usually move?\u201d\u201c\u2026About thirty steps?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026No, I walk more than that!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m\u00a0abysmally\u00a0lacking in physical strength.\u201d\u201c\u2026My younger sister is like that, too, and granted, noble young ladies don\u2019t move a lot, but Milady, you\u2019re just\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAnd so, Violet declared that she would build up her stamina during her one-week probation.Mary also exercised together with Violet after Zylo told her, \u201cYou should be able to protect yourself, too.\u201dIsn\u2019t that the job of the escort knights though?Mary grumbled back in a low voice. However, Zylo stubbornly said that he was not obligated to protect his master\u2019s maid.Thus, the knight pushed the two young women into a healthy lifestyle.* * *Violet set down her wooden sword and breathed out.The loudest thought in her mind right now was that she wanted to go back to her room and rest\u00a0right now.\u00a0After that, the next loudest thought was that she wanted to paint instead of exercising.In the first place, she was only working out because she couldn\u2019t paint, so of course she wanted to paint.However, exercise was a must for Violet. Her physical strength was considerably depleted, and it was difficult to sit down for long periods of time while painting. That\u2019s why Violet was now working diligently, trying to stamp out the unnecessary thoughts in her mind.She didn\u2019t particularly hate moving around, but what she found difficult was the fact that she had to match the too early wake-up time of her escort knight.\u201cThe food\u2019s delicious these days.\u201d\u201cHehe. Auntie Anna said that she prepared these with all her heart. She must\u2019ve remembered all the dishes that you said were delicious, Milady.\u201d\u201cReally? I should express my gratitude to her.\u201dIt was a simple meal, but Violet liked it quite a lot. She was even smiling now.In the novels she read in her previous life, all of the Koreans who transmigrated or reincarnated in other worlds talked about how much they missed kimchi. She wondered if she should try requesting a spicy dish.As Violet mulled over this small concern, she saw a passing maid smile at her.\u201c\u2026Why is everyone smiling at me? Did I do something wrong?\u201d\u201cUh, I\u2019m not very sure\u2026\u201dThe employees of the annex were originally amiable towards Violet though, but the atmosphere had somehow turned strange ever since she was put on probation.Mary could only smile awkwardly in response to Violet\u2019s question.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Painting of the Villainess as a Young LadyCH 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWelcome.\u201d\u201cGood morning!\u201dThe knights, who arrived here first to train, greeted Violet with fervor.The young knight\u2014though not yet formally ordained\u2014was a newcomer just like Mary. Violet waved helplessly at him.\u201cYoung Miss\u2014I mean, no, Your Ladyship! We\u2019ll be in your care again today!\u201dBurdened by the boy\u2019s eyes, which sparkled with kindness, Violet turned her head slightly.As long as someone was from inside the ducal residence, there\u2019s no way they wouldn\u2019t have heard the rumors about her.However, as the days went by, it became more apparent just how strangely they\u2019re treating her now.It would have been normal to see this behavior from the people in the annex, but it was completely strange coming from people whose faces she wasn\u2019t even familiar with yet.\u201cThe way people are treating me has become strange. Do you know anything?\u201d\u201cAh, you mean that?\u201dZylo answered calmly as he watched Violet wielding a wooden sword.\u201cThe answer is what you told us.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cAbout what happened when Your Ladyship was summoned to the main mansion.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cI mean to say, it\u2019s the story that you told that day, Your Ladyship.\u201dNext to Violet, Mary slapped a hand over her forehead.Violet had barely been able to tell Mary her story, and Mary responded by saying that she was on the lady\u2019s side. However, it seemed like that story was spread around in the meantime.Violet was stunned.That day, when others had asked Zylo what had happened, he just answered calmly and told them about it.He didn\u2019t look like it, but this knight was quite loose-lipped.\u201cI-It\u2019s just what I heard. After knowing about Your Ladyship\u2019s circumstances, I\u2026\u201dRumors had no bounds.It\u2019s unknown just how twisted and misinterpreted the same words could become when passed around from one person to another.Wasn\u2019t she the very epitome of a victim of rumors?Seeing Violet\u2019s incredulous expression, Zylo asked back.\u201cShould I not have said that?\u201dYet again, a tactless question.Violet despondently answered no.\u201cYou already told them, so it couldn\u2019t be helped\u2026\u201dWho in the world would be happy to know that one\u2019s own misfortunes had degenerated into a fun story for others? A rumor based on goodwill might be alright, but Violet was not happy with it.\u201c\u2026I just hate tiresome things.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, Milady.\u201dAfter what Violet said, even Mary started apologizing. At this, Violet\u2019s eyes filled with despondency were turned to Mary.\u201cThey also kept asking me, and I didn\u2019t know how else to make them stop\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt roughly went this way.When Zylo was asked by others about what had happened at the main mansion, Zylo briefly told the whole story of that incident.As a consequential reaction, the members of the annex also hounded Mary about the details.Rumors traveled quickly. Public sympathy for Violet arose.\u201cNo, just forget it, seriously\u2026\u201dThe rumors, which formerly pulled her back and dragged her down the abyss, had changed its form.\u201cDid it spread to the main mansion as well?\u201d\u201cUm, a little.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going crazy.\u201d\u201cHuk!\u00a0Milady, please don\u2019t go crazy!\u201dTrifling chatter ensued.Hearing that her story had reached the main mansion, Violet schooled her features into a stern expression.It was already unpleasant to know that her story had been laid bare to the people who felt amicably towards her and to people she knew, but it was doubly unpleasant to know that the same thing was spread to strangers.Even more so because it\u2019s impossible to know just how much those rumors would twist and change in the meantime.Violet predicted that there would later come a story about how it\u2019s a \u2018malicious story that\u2019s been spread by the villainess so as to frame Lady Aileen.\u2019And her prediction hit the nail on the head.There weren\u2019t many people in the main mansion who sided with her because of her notoriety.\u201c\u2026Well, it doesn\u2019t matter because I won\u2019t need to see those people again. Let\u2019s just focus on exercising.\u201d\u201cY-Yes!\u201dZylo let out a few dry coughs before returning to the swordsmanship training that eventually became a regular morning exercise.The newcomer knight, who was even more tactless than Zylo, shouted next to Mary with such passion, \u201cI shall clarify the situation!\u201dActually, there was one fact that Violet was unaware of.Her reputation had apparently changed ever so slightly ever since the poisoning incident.The duke and Roen had put a lid on the incident and concluded that it was not the work of Violet.Still, all that did was divide public opinion.For many days, the duchy\u2019s servants chattered on about whether or not Violet really instigated the poisoning. Half of them thought Violet did it, while the other half kept saying that the allegations were false.Above all, Violet\u2019s image had changed rapidly, perhaps because she had never gotten herself involved with the main mansion\u2019s affairs ever since she was confined to the annex.Mary\u2019s defense was working little by little as well, to the point that even some of the servants who only stayed at the main mansion sided with Violet.Amongst the rumors, one particular rumor was floating around about how \u2018Aileen orchestrated a self-written play and drank the poison herself.\u2019 However, this was the opinion of a small minority.Of course, there was no way for Violet to know this. All she hoped for was that the troublesome rumors wouldn\u2019t spread too much.But then.\u201cHello, Violet.\u201dRoen, as authorized by the duke, had come to visit the annex.It was about two weeks after the poisoning incident.* * *Roen\u2019s visit was sudden.Furthermore, he entered the annex with the duke\u2019s permission this time.Put in a difficult situation, Violet inevitably frowned.Was this guy here to provoke her like last time?Seeing her expression, Roen smiled lightly at her.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll show you to the studio then. Although it\u2019s a shabby place.\u201d\u201cShabby, you say\u2026 Right.\u201dCalling back to what she said the last time they met, Violet spoke sarcastically at her older brother, but Roen only laughed despondently in response.\u201cWhat business do you have here.\u201d\u201cDo I need a reason to see you?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t exactly have an amicable relationship, do we.\u201d\u201c\u2026Right. We\u2026\u201d\u2026don\u2019t.At the end, Roen\u2019s voice carried a hint of bitterness.Violet\u2019s eyes narrowed as she looked at Roen. With how he\u2019s acting right now, it seemed like he had eaten something wrong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As the employees were looking at Roen, their gazes had a subtle gentleness to them.Mary put down the saucers in front of the brother and sister.The small girl\u2019s thoughts were clearly stamped across her forehead. Violet sighed inwardly.This little maid sometimes acted foolishly.Violet was thankful that Mary was always sticking out for her, but it was extremely dangerous. Violet made a mental note about later teaching Mary what she could and couldn\u2019t do.\u201cSo, what is it that you want to say?\u201dViolet asked then sipped her cup of tea, which was still tasteless. Roen followed and likewise sipped his tea, then immediately put down the cup.\u201cYou\u2019ve changed a lot.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re here to say only that?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s only the start.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThough Roen was smiling gently right now, there was an air of mystery to that smile.Violet hated Roen\u2019s manner of speaking.\u201cDid you change after you got confined to this place? Or did you choose to be confined because you changed?\u201d\u201c\u2026Just get to the point.\u201d\u201cWe haven\u2019t even been talking for long. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019d be a shame if I got to the point right away?\u201dViolet briefly pondered whether she really should hurl tea at Roen\u2019s face.But her reputation had barely improved lately. Throwing tea at someone\u2019s face wouldn\u2019t be a good idea.She set down her cup quietly.\u201cThere\u2019s a rumor going around that you\u2019ve changed. That you\u2019ve finally come to your senses, Violet.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBut at your core, you still haven\u2019t changed. You still hate Aileen, you still don\u2019t like me, and you still despise Elder Brother. Still the same.\u201d\u201c\u2026What are you getting at?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s simple.\u201dRoen took another sip of tea.In the past, Violet would have already exploded in anger, asking about who it was that dared to serve tea like this to a ducal lady. That is, tea that tasted like dirty water squeezed from rags.\u201c\u2026What made you change?\u201dRoen\u2019s green eyes turned to Violet. Subjected to that searching gaze of his, Violet laughed in vain.\u201cIt is you, Brother, who said that I haven\u2019t changed. Yet you\u2019re asking me what made me change.\u201d\u201c\u2026I worded it wrong.\u201d\u201cIf you insist on saying the same things, just go back and\u2014\u201c\u201cWhat did I\u2026 No, what did we do that made you change?\u201dClatter.At that moment, Violet paused sharply.The only one who couldn\u2019t understand what Roen was saying was Mary, and she stared wide-eyed.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou harassed Aileen terribly. You never changed before, even when we were children, even now\u2026\u201dThe tremor in her fingertips began to subside.Violet realized why Roen had come to see her.You came all the way here to talk about that?But the question remained on her lips, unsaid.Besides her realization, her emotions began to fluctuate.\u201cThen it must be us, not you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to talk to you. But it\u2019s you, Violet, not me who\u2019s going to tell the story.\u201d\u201cRight now, you.\u201d\u201cTell me your story.\u201d\u201cWhat story are you even\u2014\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry for being late.\u201dClatter, clatter.The teacup trembled endlessly in her hand, which had lost strength.Even if she told herself, \u2018It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay\u2019 over and over for a long time, there was no effect.Roen smiled. It was not a fake smile, but a smile that carried sincerity.\u201cI\u2019m here to apologize to you.\u201d* * *Of course, Roen was kicked out.After bluntly saying, \u201cThere is no story to tell,\u201d Violet kicked out her older brother and went up to her room.It took a long time to tell the story to even Mary.The wound was still open, and it was undeniably difficult to dig through that wound once again to bring back her memories from those days.It hurt so much to remember them now, even though she knew that she\u2019d have to look at that wound one day.So, she had turned a blind eye to her open wound. She refused her older brother\u2019s apology.But Roen had apologized first. Violet wouldn\u2019t be able to ignore him for a long time.Even if she\u2019d have to dig through an old, long-standing wound.\u201cMary.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cWhat should I do at a time like this?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m not sure either, Milady.\u201dMary also couldn\u2019t give an answer. Violet turned around to face the knight, who was standing there silently.Zylo wouldn\u2019t be able to give a normal answer, that\u2019s for sure.Yeon Ha-yoon, who was inside her, asked.Should I hear him out first?But the one who answered was the hurt child inside of Violet.I don\u2019t want to.It\u2019s not necessary to accept his apology. No, it\u2019s difficult to consider that as an apology in the first place.Wasn\u2019t he one of the people who cut her down repeatedly with his vicious words?Violet briefly pondered the possibility that Roen\u2019s actions were calculated.It\u2019s a well-deserved supposition.If Roen couldn\u2019t be called \u2018calculating\u2019, then who else could?In the end, for the sake of getting the right answer, Violet herself had to know what she wanted.What was it that she wanted from Roen? And, what was it that those people wanted from her?Forgiveness? Easier said than done.All she wished was to live the rest of her life without seeing those people.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Collapse to the ground why crying\u2014crying endlessly. Live while being tormented, live while being miserable.However, she also had no intention of wielding the axe of retribution. It was truly contradictory.And she couldn\u2019t say, \u201cJust drown yourself to death with your nose poking into a bowl of water,\u201d towards someone who came to apologize.Above all\u2014\u201c\u2026I feel wronged.\u201dThroughout all the years, her desire to be acknowledged could not be fulfilled, and merely remained as flickering ashes after the fire had been put out.However, the problem was this: that abyss-like desire had not completely disappeared.Would it make any difference if she told him the whole story?As she munched on a cookie, Violet agonized over her thoughts.\u201c\u2026If it were me\u2026\u201dThe knight, who was standing watch quietly, opened his lips to speak. Two pairs of eyes turned to him at the same time.Zylo coughed lightly.\u201cI\u2019ll start with a punch.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m weak.\u201d\u201cWould you like me to hit him in your stead?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that\u2026 You don\u2019t need to.\u201dIf a knight were to hit a duke\u2019s son, he\u2019d be charged with blasphemy. It\u2019s only obvious that Violet was dissuading him from doing so.But at the same time, she inwardly agreed.\u00a0Let\u2019s start with a punch.\u00a0That didn\u2019t sound bad. Perhaps, could she sock him in the kisser?Violet smirked, imagining the scenario over and over again until she got tired of it.In the end, she couldn\u2019t come to a conclusion right now, even if she mulled over it as much as she could.All the emotions and resentment she had endured before\u2014all that she was enduring even now\u2014were all screaming so, so desperately.She was emotional right now, and she knew that she wasn\u2019t in the right headspace to make a decision in her condition.\u201cGive me more cookies.\u201d\u201cMilady, you already emptied a whole plate.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t worked out today yet, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSighing, Violet rose from her seat.When the mind\u2019s plagued with many thoughts, the best course of action was to move the body.* * *It\u2019s been a week since Roen apologized.And for the entire past week, the second young master of the ducal household sent many gifts to the annex.Flowers, food, clothes, paint, a lightweight rapier, and more. There was a great variety to the gifts.One time, after receiving the gifts for the day, Violet pressed her fingertips against a throbbing temple.Most of the clothes that she received had simple designs. Perhaps he realized that she had no need for ostentatious dresses. Instead, the fabric of all the sent clothes was very soft.\u201cHow very sincere\u2026\u201dHow very sincerely and crazily wasteful.\u201cWhat did the Young Master say today?\u201d\u201cNothing much, just asking if my day is going well, I guess?\u201d\u201cThe Second Young Master is a very different person from what I had imagined.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t fraternize with him. A guy like him is the most dangerous type.\u201dAlong with the gifts born out of Roen\u2019s crazy spending spree, he sent one card everyday as well.Most of them contained only simple greetings.\u201cUm, Milady\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing strange rumors lately. I\u2019m not sure, but\u2026 Maybe the Second Young Master isn\u2019t such a bad guy.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHearing the words Mary said with hesitation, Violet sighed.A situation like this was one that she hated like hell.Such a situation was bound to change people\u2019s minds, to make them be inevitably swayed as if they couldn\u2019t help it.If she were to continue avoiding Roen, in the end, she\u2019d become the bad person yet again.Was this what Roen was aiming for from the beginning?Barely pressing down the simmering urge to scream in frustration, Violet gestured to Mary.In turn, Mary immediately stopped talking. She was constantly attuned to Violet\u2019s mood.Now that Violet thought about it, Mikhail was being too calm despite Roen\u2019s recent remarkable track record. Mikhail should have stormed the annex and hurled his fury at her by now.Recalling that unpleasant guy, Violet frowned and set down her paintbrush.* * *\u201cSir Knight.\u201d\u201cAh, are you done with your activity, Milady?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m just feeling a bit sore.\u201d\u201cThen are you here to exercise?\u201d\u201cNo, just here to look around.\u201dZylo perked up for a moment, but he soon deflated again. The newcomer knight, who\u2019s being practically beat up by Zylo, shouted briefly, \u201cPlease save me, Your Ladyship!\u201d\u201cDo you know what that guy\u2019s doing these days?\u201d\u201c\u2019That guy\u2019?\u201d\u201cYoung Duke Mikhail.\u201d\u201c\u2026Aren\u2019t you family?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t exactly have the type of relationship where I\u2019d normally call him \u2018Dear Brother\u2019.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dWhile still sparring with the young knight, Zylo contemplated shortly and soon answered.\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure, Milady, but there\u2019s a rumor going around that Young Duke Mikhail\u2019s status as the Duke\u2019s heir might get revoked. I hear it\u2019s due to his arrogant and condescending behavior, but I honestly can\u2019t say for sure.\u201dViolet wasn\u2019t expecting to hear this.\u201cBesides that, there\u2019s a large-scale lay-off in progress\u2026 Anyway, there\u2019s many things going on. And I also heard that the rumors about you are also spreading.\u201dWhat Zylo heard could be summarized in this manner:First, Mikhail\u2019s status as the duke\u2019s heir was on the verge of being revoked.Second, the employees of the main mansion were being fired on a large-scale.Third, favorable rumors about Violet were spreading.Even though all of these were somehow or the other connected to her, Violet had no idea at all that this was going on. She cradled her forehead with one hand.She was completely blindsided by these developments. She could feel a migraine coming on.Everything was changing to her favor, and it felt so unfamiliar. To the point that she was getting rather frightened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ll be in your care.\u201dJust what on earth was this guy thinking.Violet was forced to move her hand.To explain why they\u2019re now face to face like this, a bit of a rewind is needed....Violet\u2019s probation had been lifted for a while now, but she was suffering from a bit of lethargy. At the recommendation of the people around her, she began to do more activities here and there.She exercised, painted, and sometimes chatted with Mary.And, while trying to gauge the right timing, she had also been preparing for her next outing. She\u2019s aware that the duke had put a tail on her, but she couldn\u2019t protest against it because it was done at the pretense of protection.It was already made known that she had been sneaking out during her period of confinement anyway. Unless there\u2019s officially a problem going on, she\u2019s free to roam around.However, Violet had various reasons as to why she hadn\u2019t gone out just yet.The biggest reason was this: she\u2019s not confident about facing the rumors head on.So, it was only after she was in the right headspace, to some extent, that she started going out little by little.It was nice to go out for the first time in a long while.There were some people who recognized her, but she heard none of the rumors that she was so concerned about. So, Violet enjoyed her outings freely.She wore marginally loose clothes, ate at noisy restaurants, and went around the shopping district to buy a few things that caught her eye. Sometimes she got ripped off, other times she haggled.Violet was happy with doing all these things. It was also more enjoyable because she gained more strength and stamina from all the exercise she had been doing.She also regularly sat in front of the fountain and opened a signboard to indicate that she was open for business, drawing portraits as usual.She was satisfied with her peaceful days.Since the first time, Violet started going out often.The first couple of times, she was begrudgingly a bit self-conscious because she knew that the duke\u2019s people were watching her. However, as she tasted the sweetness of escape, she was too busy to pay any mind to such self-consciousness.Zylo, who so desperately opposed Violet\u2019s outings at first, was now the very person who was doing the most to ensure that she was free during her outings.Violet exchanged greetings with some people who she had become familiar with after seeing a few times, and she also drew simple portraits to those who wanted them.The day she went out for the third time\u2026\u201cAre you still open?\u201d\u201cAh, yes. This will be the last\u2026\u201d\u201cHiya~?\u201dViolet looked up to find Roen in front of her.He seemed to have gone out without a single guard, and he was dressed casually.He wasn\u2019t even hiding his identity as a high noble, yet he\u2019s asking her to draw him a simple portrait at a place like this.\u201cOh, perhaps you\u2019re done for the day already?\u201d\u201cNot\u2026 yet.\u201d\u201cThen, please. I\u2019ll be in your care.\u201dPeople started staring.Violet\u2019s looks alone were enough to attract much attention, but in addition to her, Roen\u2014very obviously a young nobleman\u2014attracted even more attention.Feeling the useless attention being directed at her, Violet ducked behind her sketchbook and quickly moved her hand.She had no idea how she found herself in a situation like this, but right now, she was just focused on quickly finishing up his portrait so she could send him away as soon as possible.\u2018Why\u2019s this person here?\u2019Violet felt a sense of injustice surging within her.Why did this guy want Violet to draw him when he could easily just call some famous artist to paint him the portrait that he wanted so very much, huh?And besides that, why today of all days.It\u2019s true that she\u2019d been sneaking out to play despite being in confinement\u2026 But she didn\u2019t want that fact to spread at the main mansion.\u201cIs there a reason why you draw portraits in a place like this?\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s a hobby.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to be the same as what could be seen at a studio.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a hobby.\u201d\u201cHaha. Considering it\u2019s just a hobby, you\u2019ve got amazing skills.\u201dWas he making fun of her?Listening to Roen\u2019s nonchalant way of talking to her as if they didn\u2019t know each other, Violet inwardly recited the Buddhist scriptures in her head.She had been forced to memorize those scriptures when she was a kid, and she realized how useful they were at times like these.Whatever kind of expression Violet wore now, Roen\u2019s smile did not leave his lips.With the situation already like this, Violet began to imagine all kinds of scenarios after this\u2014just what kind of threats or blackmail attempts this guy was going to throw at her.Unable to bear the thoughts any longer, Violet drew one last dot on Roen\u2019s portrait, stabbing the paper.\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026\u201dDue to Violet\u2019s simmering anger, the Roen depicted in her drawing was a little\u2026 ugly.Though, to say \u2018a little\u2019 was too vague as it was, but it\u2019s clear that Roen\u2019s appearance in the portrait was uglier than the one in the flesh.\u2018Do I really look so shrewd?\u2019While Roen struggled with this thought, Violet quickly got up and organized her tools. The group, who was escorting her by her side, had long since been frozen because of the sudden appearance of the duke\u2019s second son.\u201cWait a minute, Vi\u2026 Lady.\u201d\u201cI apologize, but I need to go.\u201d\u201cI was wondering if you could spare me a moment.\u201dOne of the sneakily watching bystanders whistled as they saw Roen suddenly trying to hold Violet back.Violet\u2019s head was throbbing.\u201cLooks like he\u2019s confessing,\u201d someone whispered.\u201cMiss Ella\u2019s quite pretty after all,\u201d someone else answered.Violet suppressed her boiling wrath as she heard the hushed voices around her.Excuse me, we\u2019re full-blooded siblings.But Violet couldn\u2019t say this. She gritted her teeth and forced a smile.The words barely comprehensible through her clenched teeth, she said, \u201cSir, I don\u2019t have the time\u2014\u201d\u201cI fell in love with you at first sight. Do I truly have no chance at all?\u201dThis fucker?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zylo, on the other hand, looked nervous.The boy knight asked, \u201cThey have that kind of relationship?\u201d and promptly got hit by Zylo.One thing led to another, and so some of the onlookers uttered the horrendous words, \u201cAccept him!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll only be a moment.

Just a moment then.\u201d\u201cYep, thanks.\u201dHearing her inevitable permission, Roen laughed....He mentioned that he had something to say to Violet alone, so Mary and the escort knights had to be sent away.To appease the knights who protested slightly while saying that they couldn\u2019t be sent away for safety reasons, Roen took Violet to a teahouse.It\u2019s the teahouse that\u2019s usually frequented by wealthy merchants and the occasional aristocrat. There\u2019s no one else inside.Noticing Violet\u2019s quizzical expression, Roen said,\u201cI rented it out for the whole day.\u201dIndeed, this was the kind of crazy spending that a lofty second son of a duke would do.One waiter guided them to a table by a window, and as they sat down, awkward silence stretched between them. There was no longer any need to keep up an act since there weren\u2019t any eyes on them now.\u201cWere you keeping me on surveillance again?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not surveillance though\u2026 Why do you think I\u2019ve been doing that?\u201d\u201cAt first, I tried to chalk it up to coincidence, but seeing as you\u2019ve rented out the whole place, and seeing as you\u2019re being escorted after all, it\u2019s hard to believe that this isn\u2019t premeditated.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t deny that I rented this place for the purpose of meeting you. But I wasn\u2019t monitoring you, or investigating you.\u201dViolet\u2019s cold voice urged Roen to smile softly.Reading the room, the employees stepped out to give them privacy.Even after taking a sip of tea, Roen had an expression on his face that said he\u2019s still parched.\u201c\u2014Then what.\u201d\u201cI just heard a rumor. That there\u2019s someone who opens a portrait stall by the fountain in the town square. That the artist is quite young, and is a silver-haired beauty.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSilver hair isn\u2019t very common, is it?\u201dNo, it\u2019s not,\u00a0Violet answered inwardly.Even if she tried to do a headcount to ascertain the statistics, the answer was certain.\u201cIt\u2019s unpleasant to meet you like this. I don\u2019t want this to happen again.\u201d\u201cBut you never find it pleasant to meet me, yes? You don\u2019t even answer any of my letters\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to talk to you. What\u2019s the point of trying to talk now?\u201d\u201cThere may be a point, there may not be a point. Who knows?\u201dViolet took a sip of tea. There was a hint of acidity in its sweetness. She found it delicious.\u201cAnd it\u2019s dangerous for you to go around like this, Violet. No, you\u2019re Ella here, aren\u2019t you. Don\u2019t think that you\u2019ve been safe until now because you\u2019re lucky.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, whatever I do is none of your business, so\u2014\u201d\u201cYou know that your appearance stands out. You\u2019ve got silver hair and purple eyes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWas he threatening her?Violet frowned when he pointed out her physical features.She had already imagined countless scenarios when it came to Roen, but she tirelessly held herself back from making her imagination a reality.\u201c\u2026It should hardly be worth all this trouble for such a\u00a0great\u00a0story.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be so burdensome since it\u2019s a story that\u2019s already been told before.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dStill walking on eggshells, the waiter came back and served them refreshments. Violet frowned as she looked at the tart that had a lot of blueberries on top.Violet had hardened her resolve since a while back. She would\u00a0not\u00a0willingly tell him her story.Even after three weeks of sending gift after gift yet constantly rebuffed and rejected, Roen smiled.He gingerly cut a piece of the tart with a knife and fork for her.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dHe got straight to the point first.\u201d\u201cAbout not listening to you, and not believing you, and only ever pushing you to become a bad person.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry for everything I did to make you bad.\u201dHis voice dropped to the quietest hush.She had hoped that this wouldn\u2019t happen, that he wouldn\u2019t apologize to her. That way, she could stay a bad person until the end.She hadn\u2019t decided how to treat him just yet.Violet thought she heard him wrong for a moment. She was in disbelief.So many emotions went rampant inside her mind, and she tried to suppress them all.She should not act recklessly while she was in an emotional state. Even more so because she didn\u2019t know how one impulsive act would affect her later.However, who was it that owned this storm of emotions? Who was it that endeavored to stay calm?Even if she now had Yeon Ha-yoon\u2019s memories, Violet was the one living her current life. She knew that she would not be able to turn a blind eye to her pain forever.\u201cI\u2026\u201dBarely managing to talk with her shaking voice, Violet let out a faint sound.Her words could hardly be discerned. Her voice constantly trembled, as if it was about to collapse at any given moment.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t deserve to receive any apologies.\u201d\u201cViolet.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t pushed to become a bad person. I\u00a0am\u00a0a bad person.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you going to deny all of the actions I\u2019ve done until now?\u201dHer purple eyes were still.Roen knew those eyes very well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How is it possible for you to say such a thing? That my actions were not evil\u2026 That I\u2019m not a bad person?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLaughable, really.Even if she was a victim, it did not change the fact that she did malicious things to others.The sea of people who lost their normal lives due to Violet\u2019s whims would most definitely snort if they ever heard Roen\u2019s words.Yeon Ha-yoon, too, was well aware that Violet was a bad person.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s not easy to say.\u201d\u201cThen the whole thing must just be a joke to you. Well, there was a time when everything was\u2026\u201d\u2026hell for me, yet it meant nothing to you.Violet thought that Roen\u2019s apology was much too light.There\u2019s no way in my hell that I\u2019d let you be rewarded for such an apology. The time spent being hurt by others and hurting others is considered a bygone time in the past only by you .This whole thing that pushed me into the abyss\u2026It was a terribly selfish feeling. But she knew that such selfishness was the essence of her being.Laughter spilled through Violet\u2019s lips. It was so difficult to deal with a burst of many emotions.\u201cWhy are you apologizing to me? Why now?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t a bad person, you say\u2026 Hah, hahaha. I\u2019m not bad, I didn\u2019t do anything wrong\u2026\u201dSaid this person, who was the very person who mocked and ridiculed her during the time that she wanted someone\u2014anyone\u2014to be on her side. This person, here and now, who only looked at another person\u2019s wounds from afar.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201dForcing the mouth that would not open, Roen once again apologized.Plik, plik.The overwhelming emotions that could no longer be contained came out in the form of tears.With a vicious look on her face before, Violet never once cried. She had just cursed at everyone with poison in her eyes.She had built a more solid wall around her.\u201cWhy? You always said that before, right? That I just need to be good. Because I\u2019m bad, not good. I\u2019m bad for not being able to treat that girl kindly, I\u2019m bad for tearing her clothes to pieces, I\u2019m bad for throwing her things out and for harming the people she cherishes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t\u00a0try, I\u2019ve amounted to only this much. She\u00a0worked hard to produce the most brilliant results, yet I\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a villainess, so it\u2019s natural that I\u2019m bad. That\u2019s what I was\u00a0told.\u201dThe exasperated voice stopped speaking.Don\u2019t say anything more. Don\u2019t feel any more pity for me. I should not show my emotions. I still have not changed\u2026Violet bit her lower lip. Her mouth kept moving on its own even though she had tried to suppress herself over and over again.\u201cIs it only\u2026 Is it not such a huge deal that it\u2019ll end in only a few mere apologies?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMany times, I wished for you all to die. I prayed each and every day that you would die a more painful death than I would, that you would become as miserable as me.\u00a0 I wished for you all to lie face down and grovel beneath my feet. I wished for you to crawl on the floor, to say that you were wrong, to collapse miserably and suffer.\u201dAs Violet continued, any semblance of a smile disappeared from Roen\u2019s expression. She talked about such curses, and the hatred in her voice cut deep.\u201cSo, what did you do wrong?\u201dAnd as she asked this question, the emotions swirling behind Violet\u2019s inexplicably complicated.Fidgeting with the teacup in his hands despite himself, Roen\u2019s lips opened and closed many times before he finally spoke.\u201c\u2026For saying that what you didn\u2019t do was your fault.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cFor not listening to you or believing you because I was prejudiced and called you a liar\u2014\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026And for making you wicked. Everything.\u201dViolet thought that Roen\u2019s apology was flimsy, but as he continued speaking, his voice started shaking heavily towards the end.\u201cI won\u2019t do those things again. I\u2019m not saying this lightly. So at least once, I thought we should talk and\u2026\u201dIt was a crude apology and excuse.There was once a time when Violet longed for her family\u2019s affection. She hoped to gain their acknowledgement, hoped that they would come to regret it all.She wished for the day that they would apologize.Looking further into the resentment she was feeling, it was a fact that her\u00a0family\u00a0was the one who created this resentment.\u201c\u2026Young Lord.\u201dViolet uttered the term of address as if she was chewing on the words.\u201cWhat is it that you want?\u201dAs she asked, Violet\u2019s expression was indescribable.Roen, who had investigated Violet\u2019s whereabouts and the people she was involved with, finally realized what he had done to his younger sister.\u201cYou\u2019ve apologized now. And then\u00a0what?\u00a0Do you want me to\u00a0forgive\u00a0you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, should we go back to how it was in the old days?\u00a0Haha, hoho,\u00a0just laugh like that? Ah. I wonder when we ever did such a thing in the past\u2026 Then instead, would you like us to imitate a harmonious family? Or perhaps, you just want to be unburdened by your own guilt?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAfter coming here and apologizing like this,\u00a0what do you want from me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had already given up on her own life.For as long as she had lived, she remained true to her identity as a duke\u2019s daughter. But she gave up on that and asked for self-imprisonment.It\u2019s become this way in the end.Violet\u2019s resignation was a given, and she went on to sever ties with everyone.Even if those ties were connected by blood.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not apologizing in exchange for your forgiveness.\u201dRoen continued speaking, weakly.\u201cIt\u2019s as you said. I had wronged you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just because of that. That\u2019s why I\u2019m apologizing.\u201dPerhaps part of it was to comfort himself and to abate some of his guilt. It was an apology that the other person didn\u2019t want to hear, and yet he went ahead and said it even though he knew that a few mere words would not be able to compensate for all the pain that had been inflicted upon her thus far.And yet, it was better than saying nothing.\u201cHowever you think of me is up to you. And it\u2019s also completely up to you whether you\u2019ll accept my apology.\u201d\u201cI just wanted to apologize. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dAs Roen spoke, the expression on his face was familiar to Violet, too.An expression that she had never seen since a decade ago, back when he was still taking good care of his younger sister.\u201cI will not accept your apology.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cI will never call you \u2018Brother\u2019 anymore.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d\u201cI, I will still hate you.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cI pray that such an unpleasant matter won\u2019t be brought up again in the future.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201dAs she managed to finally calm down her emotions, Violet observed Roen calmly.This person was the one who degraded her with eloquence, who said that everything was her fault without a shadow of a doubt, who always defaulted to fait accompli due to prejudice.How many times did she trust him? How many times did he stab her in the back in return?There were so,\u00a0so\u00a0many instances when she hoped that Roen would believe her, but each and every time, she was left with a perfectly shattered heart.The wounds inflicted upon her during her childhood had yet to heal. Even though she pretended to be calm, that hurt child was still in her heart.No one believed her. Everyone criticized her. That little child was still crying in so much pain.Violet did not try to gauge whether or not the emotions behind Roen\u2019s expression were sincere.Instead, she uttered the following words with suppressed anger.\u201cI pray that what happened today will never happen again.\u201dAfter saying so, Violet was about to rise from her seat, but she stopped.\u201cYoung Lord.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cCan I hit you?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dBefore Roen could even finish uttering the single word, Violet\u2019s fist was already planted squarely on his face.As Violet punched the second noble young master of the Everett Duchy, there was no hesitation at all in her movements.\u2018God, that feels good.\u2019Violet, who hit Roen once as advised by her escort knight, promptly left the teahouse without looking back.Roen sat there, eyes dazedly wandering in the air, one palm cradling the spot that had gotten hit.Violet\u2019s hand was really heavy.* * *Time flew whether one wanted it to or not. And, ever since the apology, Roen sought out Violet more often.She faced Roen with a sour look.\u201cYou must be utterly brimming with free time.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m actually busy.\u201d\u201cThen why do you insist on coming here to see me?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only right to make a conscious effort when trying to reconnect a broken relationship.\u201dHow impertinent, those words. She certainly didn\u2019t expect him to come here so confidently under the pretext of restoring their relationship.Violet managed to calm herself. She diligently pressed down on the urge to throw tea at Roen\u2019s face.Even as he saw Violet\u2019s expression darkening by the second, Roen shrugged anyhow.\u201cIt\u2019s not a lie that I\u2019m busy. There are many things that I have to do.\u201d\u201cSure\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to believe me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re originally such a busy person, Young Lord. So of course you\u2019re suddenly busy with more things.\u201d\u201cShould I just be glad that you do believe me\u2026\u201dHere was a matter of fact: The only person who\u2019s calm in this room was Roen and Roen alone.Even the young knight, who was standing next to Violet for escort duty, looked quite uncomfortable. When faced with someone who\u2019s as brazen as Roen, any normal person would feel like they were sitting on a thorn cushion.\u201cOh, the tea has become a little better.\u201dRoen\u2019s face wasn\u2019t just an iron plate. It\u2019s made entirely of orichalcum.\u201cOh, right. By the way, there will be some news for you soon. Though it might take a little while to arrive because it hasn\u2019t been confirmed yet.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026\u201dAs she answered half-heartedly, Violet frowned.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me. Are things going on even without my will\u2014\u201d\u201cHalf-right. I\u2019ll be sure to ask for your permission first before anything. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dThinking that his younger sister would like it, Roen averted his eyes.Violet only sighed.The aristocrats of this time period really didn\u2019t know how to respect the opinions of other people.\u201cAnd, Violet.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt would be better if you don\u2019t go out on your own from now on.\u201d\u201cUnnecessary meddling.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not totally unnecessary. Tell me, do you have ordinary physical features?\u201dWith a faint smile, Roen continued.\u201cYou haven\u2019t only been lucky to be safe until now. Regardless of how modestly you dress\u2014no, the more modestly you dress, the more crooked people will try to approach you. And if the worst happens, it can\u2019t be stopped with just two escort knights.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRoen\u2019s warning was reasonable, but the young knight bristled.Meanwhile Zylo, who was standing further behind, quietly nodded in agreement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That\u2019s the only reason she had been able to walk around outside without any problems thus far.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t just think about it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dViolet\u2019s eyes turned to Roen.Clearly enough, there was a blatant look of discontent behind those eyes of hers, but Roen just smirked nonchalantly.Even if she were to feel frustrated with staying only at the annex, it was inevitable.\u201cIf you want to go out, get official permission. You\u2019ll be assigned more escort knights that way.\u201d\u201cYou speak as if you know everything, don\u2019t you, Young Lord.\u201d\u201cI do though?\u201d\u201cWith all due respect, you\u2019re being obnoxious. You\u2019re already detestable enough, so being obnoxious like this makes you even more so.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u00a0is\u00a0a problem, isn\u2019t it\u2026\u201dThe conversation ensued with jest from only one side. Violet glared at Roen. She was about to ask, \u2018Didn\u2019t you say you feel apologetic towards me?\u2019 but she decided against it.Roen\u2019s attitude was much too brazen, considering that he was supposed to be someone who\u2019s apologizing to her.What exactly was going on in that brain of his? Roen\u2019s expression was as unreadable as it ever was, so it\u2019s difficult to grasp his intentions.As Violet continued to try guessing what Roen was thinking, the short meeting between them ended.Seeing as his face looked quite tired, it didn\u2019t seem like a lie that he\u2019s very busy. He soon left the annex, leaving behind a pair of new shoes. It was today\u2019s gift from him to her.It was yet another purchase by that crazy spender.* * *Relationships were fragile. How great it would be if it\u2019s as easy to fix as it was to break. But, in the end, it\u2019s difficult to fix a relationship once broken.With a plate, even if it\u2019s possible to reconnect all the pieces, the traces would still be quite obvious, wouldn\u2019t they?This could apply not only to Violet and Roen.\u201cSo many things done, huh. Why didn\u2019t I know any of this.\u201dWhile watching the documents burn, Roen let out a sigh.Whether that person was brazen or just foolish, he didn\u2019t know.If there was no lion, the fox would proclaim itself to be the king. And, as it was lording over the others as king yet simultaneously pretending to be a rabbit, it would take a lot of effort to catch such a fox.There were quite a few people who entered House Everett along with Aileen when she had been adopted.Since Aileen\u2019s mother and father had passed away, there was no one left to manage their household, and many of their employees were on the brink of being left to waste in the streets without a job.So, the duke generously wrote them letters of recommendations so that they could find jobs elsewhere, while all those who were close to Aileen were hired directly by the ducal household.But at some point, those who were close to Violet were dismissed. This was because the authority to control the duchy\u2019s internal affairs fell into the hands of the fox.And that fox\u2019s trail was very subtle. Roen unknowingly let out a sound of admiration.If this matter was of no concern to him, Roen would have praised the culprit for being so smart. Well, they had inefficaciously left behind evidence, but the manner in which they went about this scheme was undoubtedly crafty.Moreover, if the fox\u2019s target wasn\u2019t Violet, he would have gladly released that fox and let it continue wreaking havoc in the ducal manor.But Violet hated Roen\u2019s slyness. She hated the fact that he\u2019d use anything to his advantage.So, what he would do from here on shouldn\u2019t reach Violet\u2019s ears.\u201cNow then, what should I do about this.\u201dThe snake laughed.* * *Mikhail U. Everett was a man of integrity.Rather, he was consistent about holding fast to his beliefs, even though they\u2019re actually false convictions. It\u2019s difficult to say whether he\u2019s truly upright and incorruptible, or actually just plain ole stupid.He inherited his righteousness from his father\u2014a knight\u2014and grew up imbibing many expectations because he was the eldest son. He was particularly inflexible and obstinate.\u201cYou\u2019ve just been doing useless things these days,\u201d Mikhail snarled.\u201cThey\u2019re not useless though\u2026 But Brother, don\u2019t you need to be more careful with your actions and words since your successorship is at stake?\u201d\u201cUseless drivel.\u201dThis young man had been the heir to the duchy from the moment he was born.Perhaps it\u2019s because of that, but apparently, he never once thought that he was wrong.The young duke scoffed.\u201cBrother, you still think that Violet poisoned Aileen?\u201d Roen asked.\u201cYou\u2019re still talking nonsense?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m asking you sincerely.\u201dMikhail scowled at the widely smiling Roen.Mikhail himself had been having a difficult time sleeping properly because of the rumors that were spreading inside the main mansion. It\u2019s all getting on his nerves.He was like a ticking time bomb these days, but then here his younger brother was, seemingly pushing his buttons deliberately. How could he endure\u00a0not\u00a0exploding?\u201cIf you say one more useless thing, I won\u2019t let you get away with it.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, useless? You\u2019re not going to answer my question?\u201dWearing a calm fa\u00e7ade, Mikhail strode straight towards Roen. As he had a huge physique and was over 190cm tall, he carried with him an oppressive atmosphere.Despite that pressure though, Roen just smiled broadly.\u201cHave you gone insane after blissfully hanging out with that damn villainess?\u201d\u201c\u2026She\u2019s still our younger sister.\u201d\u201cHa, being siblings with that thing.

You asked whether I still think that Violet poisoned Aileen, right? It\u2019s only a given. In this residence! Violet is the only one who hates that poor child! Who else do you think is there who\u2019d poison the Ducal Lady?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRoen took a step back from Mikhail.Violet used to argue back against Mikhail even in a situation like this.Realizing just how much spite had accumulated within his younger sister, Roen smiled bitterly.\u201cYou just keep saying useless things.\u201d\u201cViolet didn\u2019t do it. There\u2019s evidence to prove it, isn\u2019t there?\u201d\u201cEvidence or documents like that can be forged many times over.\u00a0You\u00a0of all people should know that.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that Father\u2019s investigation was flawed?\u201d\u201cHe is Duke Everett.

She wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do anything to hurt Aileen. She doesn\u2019t see any importance in her family or a clean reputation. You know that fact better than anyone else, don\u2019t you?

Everett.\u201dAs Mikhail continued to speak, Roen\u2019s expression hardened.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that from the beginning.\u201d\u201cWhat exactly are you getting at?\u201d\u201cHave you ever thought about\u00a0why\u00a0Violet had to act like that?\u201dMikhail snorted.\u201d\u201cI knew it, you\u2019ve gone crazy now, too. It\u2019s deplorable how\u00a0no one\u00a0in House Everett is sane.\u201dAs he had become antsy due to the spreading rumors, Mikhail scowled viciously.Roen laughed. He agreed to what Mikhail said just now.How had Violet been able to breathe all this time when not one single person around her was sane?He had no idea how suffocating it was to be unable to communicate with other people. It felt as if he was talking to a wall.Roen sighed.\u201cAs expected, you shouldn\u2019t be the next duke.\u201d\u201cYou talk as if you\u2019re going to do something about it.\u201d\u201cWhy, yes, I\u00a0am\u00a0going to do something about it from now on. It\u2019ll be a huge pain in the neck if the likes of you will become the next duke.\u201dAt his ambitious younger brother\u2019s declaration, Mikhail\u2019s eyes were set ablaze. In response, Roen merely smiled and took a step back. If looks could kill, he\u2019d have been impaled by now.Once upon a time, Mikhail loved Violet dearly. It was very, very long ago, and even Roen couldn\u2019t remember when that time had been.How in the world did it come to this?But Roen knew that he was not so different from his older brother. He swept a hand over his face, exasperated.He\u2019s\u00a0this\u00a0frustrated after talking to that wall for only a few minutes\u2014just what kind of world did Violet have to live in until now?Thinking about his younger sister, Roen smiled despondently with a dark look in his eyes.For the sake of completely overthrowing Mikhail from his position as the duke\u2019s successor, there was going to be a lot for Roen to do.* * *Aileen had been unconscious thus far from the poisoning incident\u2014which happened while Violet was confined to the annex, by the way\u2014but she finally woke up.As soon as she did, she examined her condition and dressed up.The next thing she did was listen to the complaints of the maid who was responsible for what\u2019s been done to Aileen.\u201cMilady! I\u2019m so glad that you\u2019re safe\u2026\u201dWith tears in her eyes, the maid recounted the events that had transpired while Aileen was unconscious.The bulk of her complaints was about the fact that Violet had been deemed completely innocent, and this led to strange rumors going around within the ducal residence.\u201cReally? I\u2019m fine. Sister, she\u2026 I don\u2019t believe she\u2019d try to harm me on purpose. I believe in my older sister.\u201d\u201cMilady\u2026\u201dAileen smiled. The maid cried once again as she was graced with the smile of the angelic ducal lady.\u201cMilady, you are this sweet and lovely. Who else out there would want to hurt you if not for that villainess\u2014ah, no, the First Ducal Lady?\u201dThe maid continued like so.At this, Aileen just smiled wordlessly.The maid cried for a long time after that, then eventually left the room, saying that she would call for the doctor.After seeing off the maid, Aileen was now alone in her room. She slapped a fist against the wall irritably.Not only was she unable to bring down that great noble Violet due to this incident, but negative rumors were now spreading about Aileen, too. This was a huge blow to her.\u2018Just what the hell was that bitch doing in that shabby place?\u2019Aileen tore hair out, terribly frustrated.When Violet had been teetering between life and death after the lake incident, the duke had spent an astronomical amount of money just to call a priest to heal her.On the other hand, Aileen was assigned only the duchy\u2019s family doctor to tend to her after she had been poisoned.She still had a long way to go.\u2018I guess something really happened to her when she almost drowned to death.\u2019As Aileen was anxiously biting her lower lip, she suddenly heard a knock on her bedroom door. This made her scowl.\u201cCome in.\u201d\u201cAre you feeling better now?\u201dIt was Roen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Aileen was never sure what\u2019s going on in his mind, and so to her, he was a bit burdensome to face.\u201cYes, my recovery is thanks to your concern.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe.\u201dHolding a bouquet of pale pink flowers in his hand, the young man had a gentle smile upon his lips as he entered the room.\u201cLet\u2019s see. It doesn\u2019t seem like you have a fever\u2026 But your face has become quite gaunt in the meantime.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m really alright.\u201d\u201cYes. If you say so, then you really do seem alright.\u201dRoen\u2019s smile was directed at Aileen, who likewise had a soft smile for him.\u201cUmm, the culprit\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m afraid the culprit hasn\u2019t been caught yet. I believe that Father is trying to be careful about this matter.\u201d\u201cI heard someone say that Sister did it. By any chance\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. As she is confined to the annex, Violet\u2019s alibi has some strength to it.\u201d\u201cHiic,\u00a0but you can never know for sure. When I visited her last time too, towards me, she\u2026\u201dAs she trailed off, her faint voice echoed in the room. Roen slowly patted Aileen\u2019s hair.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cA-As expected, it\u2019s not her. No matter how much Sister hates me, she won\u2019t go as far as poisoning me, right?\u201dRoen\u2019s green eyes briefly observed Aileen.And Aileen, who looked and seemed innocent, shook her head slowly as she said that.\u201cAileen.\u201d\u201cYes, Brother.\u201d\u201cIf you truly conducted yourself in a proper manner, would anyone raise a hand against you?\u201d\u201cH-Huh?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s always a reason for everything. So if, say, Violet really poisoned you, wouldn\u2019t there be a reason for it?\u201d\u201cBrother?\u201dHer flustered voice resounded throughout the spacious room. But regardless of her reaction, Roen continued to smile as he always did.\u201cOf course, Violet didn\u2019t actually poison anyone, so it\u2019s a useless hypothesis.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dUnable to hide how flustered she was, Aileen\u2019s trembling eyes remained on Roen.But compared to her, Roen was much better at managing his expressions. Still as ever, he looked at her with a tender gaze.\u201cThen, Brother, what should I do?\u201dAileen quickly schooled her features and asked with a melancholy tone.\u201cBecause Sister has hated me ever since the first day we met\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\u201cIf you think it through just a little, Aileen, then you\u2019ll know the answer.\u201dRoen patted Aileen\u2019s head slowly.\u201cDidn\u2019t Violet tell you why? And everyday, for that matter. You have to conduct yourself properly.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMy poor younger sister. What should I do with you when you\u2019re being so na\u00efve\u2026 Shall I tell you how you can get along with Violet?\u201d\u201cBrother Roen\u2026?\u201d\u201cThat child always said the same thing, didn\u2019t she? So, if you want to be on better terms with Violet, just listen to what she says and follow through with your actions.\u201dIf she told you not to come, then don\u2019t. If she tells you not to covet her belongings, then don\u2019t. Abide by what you have to abide by.But the thing was, when it came to a normal relationship between two people, you shouldn\u2019t have to enforce such bare minimum rules to keep things civil.Roen bitterly laughed at his own thoughts.Meanwhile, Aileen\u2019s face began to turn deathly pale as she heard what he said.\u201cI\u2019m glad you regained consciousness safely, Aileen.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, and about the culprit who instigated the poisoning.\u201dLook at her, unable to hide her thoughts from her expression, yet she\u2019s been controlling the ducal household all this time.Roen clicked his tongue.\u201cThe suspect has been singled out. And that person will be interrogated by the end of the day.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201dAileen cried out as Roen spoke. But despite the momentary outburst, she went rigid once more and she shook her head.At this, Roen chuckled.\u201cMy kind, good-natured younger sister.\u201d\u201cBrother, Brother\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re even worried about the very person who tried to kill you, hm? It\u2019s alright. This older brother of yours will take care of everything. So, just conduct yourself properly like a good little sister.\u201dBehave, alright?The whispering voice that followed had a sly tone.Aileen froze completely.This baby fox, which was pretending to be a rabbit, could never beat a snake.* * *Regardless of how the world continued to spin around its axis, Violet\u2019s daily life had not changed.Violet drew and painted whenever she thought of wanting to. And, in what it seemed like a blink of an eye, her studio was instantly crammed with so many of her artwork.Most of them were unfinished pieces, practice studies, or paintings that could no longer be salvaged.Even so, Violet\u2019s paintings were so bizarrely beguiling that Mary considered all of the unfinished paintings as masterful works of art. It was lamentable, really.Besides that, the duke would occasionally urge Violet to send some paintings to him.Violet could not understand her father\u2019s tastes\u2026 even though it was\u00a0her\u00a0who made those art pieces, ironically enough.If there\u2019s one thing that changed in her daily life\u2014which seemed to have changed so much, actually\u2014was that she kept wondering the same thing.Why was she being visited regularly by this unwanted guest?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, this changed a few days ago when he started to come visit her often.Violet did not know what to do with this man in front of her.She refused to accept Roen\u2019s apology. The wounds she suffered through were much to painful and much too deep for her to accept him easily.Even if her anger burned to the point that only ashes were left, the pain would still not disappear.What had her life been like thus far? Would that come to a close with only a mere apology?To his credit, Roen also did not force his intentions onto Violet. He was very well aware of the extent of her pain.At least, he\u00a0should\u00a0be, but it was getting ambiguous in Violet\u2019s perspective.\u201cClingy men aren\u2019t very popular.\u201d\u201cReally? But I\u2019m actually quite popular, if I do say so myself.\u201dViolet spoke out to him first, but she ended up getting rendered speechless. Even when she let out a low sigh, Roen just chattered on regardless.\u201cThe new chef worked at the Imperial Palace before, you know. Maybe it\u2019s because of that, but his skills are top notch. And I thought of you, so I asked him to make a blueberry pie I could give you.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t even bake it yourself, but you\u2019re so proud of it anyway.\u201d\u201cWould you rather that I baked for you personally?\u201d\u201c\u2026Would you like to see the kitchen employees faint, Young Lord?\u201d\u201cCold as ever, I see.\u201dViolet\u2019s mind spun with many questions. She and Roen were not close enough with each other. Because of this fact, the atmosphere between them was quite odd.\u201cSo, what\u2019s the matter?\u201dUnable to stand the awkwardness of it all, Violet was the first to show her feelings about it.And, seeing this, Roen grinned.\u201cI know. Surely were not close enough and we should only meet when there\u2019s official business that needs to be\u2014\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, Young Lord. So, if you have nothing to do here, I ask that you please go back.\u201d\u201c\u2026You really are still uncomfortable with me, huh.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s impossible for her to\u00a0be\u00a0comfortable around him. Violet\u2019s mind quickly went on to analyze the situation.However, it\u2019s hardly easy to guess what Roen was up to.\u201cRight, it\u2019s not like I came here for nothing at all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou said that you\u2019ll be sending a painting to Father, right?\u201d\u201cI never confirmed such a thing\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to ask for one as well\u2014as a gift. I\u2019d very much like to lord it over that punk, the Crown Prince.\u201dJust what in the world were this duke and duke\u2019s son doing now.The duke was asking for a painting to allegedly make the emperor jealous, and here was the duke\u2019s son asking for a painting as well, but for the express purpose of lording it over the imperial crown prince.While trying to recall what she could remember about the crown prince, with memories buried deeply, Violet visibly looked annoyed.Violet had lived as a high noble for all her life, so she might not feel the same way; however, the version of Violet with Yeon Ha-Yoon\u2019s personality inside her was\u00a0not\u00a0a fan of talking in a roundabout manner.So, she decided to be frank.\u201cI don\u2019t have any desire to give away my paintings as gifts to people I\u2019m uncomfortable with. I refuse your suggestion.\u201d\u201c\u2026As expected. I understand.\u201dRoen propped his chin on one hand. Violet said it so straightforwardly without any hint of trying to keep up decorum. A scowl even flashed across her features briefly.\u201cDo you remember, Vee? When we were kids, you made a coronet out of violets for me before.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRoen brought up the story out of the blue.And hearing that nickname, which she couldn\u2019t even remember until now, made her grimace. She sipped her tea with pursed lips.\u201cI\u2019m just saying, you know. There was a time like that. Elder Brother also adored you, and Cairn\u2026 Um. Well, that kid\u2019s the same then and now.\u201d\u201cWhat are you getting at.\u201dSuddenly hearing a story about their childhood made Violet\u2019s voice tremble.\u201cI told you. It\u2019s only right for me to\u00a0try\u00a0when rebuilding a broken relationship.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 You tried to keep our relationship intact, but you eventually had to give up. You rather chose that there should be nothing between us. You resented us to the point that you kept it all buried\u2014so much so that it seemed as if there were no feelings of hatred and anger at all.\u201dAs Roen continued to speak in a relaxed manner, Violet\u2019s expression distorted more and more.What should she do to prevent herself from shedding any tears.Her tenacious pride remained firm within her, and it was the very part of her that did not want to show any weaknesses to others.She made sure to cease the trembling of her voice before she answered briefly.\u201cI see.\u201dThe monotonous response made Roen smile again.\u201cSince you\u2019ve already given up, it\u2019s my turn to try.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to try and try until the day comes that you can accept my apology. That you can consider me your family again.\u201dRoen said so while maintaining that same smile, which looked rather awkward. For someone who was good at hiding his emotions, his expression was notably out of place.Was this a mask, too? If so, then what a competent man he truly was.Violet held back these bitter words inwardly.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t want it.\u201d\u201cI know. It\u2019s simply a wish of mine that we can be close again.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dViolet could press down on those bitter words, but not her emotions.She would not have been able to continue living until now if even her emotions were suppressed.As he noticed that Violet\u2019s voice had started trembling again, Roen smiled tenderly.It was not a smile that contained pretense and hypocrisy, but a smile that was full of sincerity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I have a terrible reputation, and trying to sell me through my name would gain you nothing. I will not marry, and that smears my worth even more. Once that\u2019s been announced, even this appearance of mine would be useless.\u201dHer voice was calm. Apart from that, however, what she\u2019s saying was nothing but dubious.Violet knew her position in the duchy. She didn\u2019t consider herself as a human being. No, she thought her\u00a0family\u00a0didn\u2019t consider her as such.She\u2019s not their family, she\u2019s not a human to them\u2014just something to throw away one day after it\u2019s been used. Or perhaps, she could be likened to a chess piece that one couldn\u2019t bear to throw away.A person who was not loved and not respected. Just some useless thing.\u201cWorth\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s impossible for Roen not to know what Violet was talking about.Dying all alone, drowning and unable to breathe in this world where no one was by her side\u2026 In the end, the ducal lady abandoned her own self.She let go of all expectations.Her self-worth chipped away at her motivation, her emotions or any faint hope she could have still been harboring. It had rendered her view on her existence to be utterly worthless, plummeting deeper and deeper\u2014to the bottom of the lake.Roen reached out towards her.For a moment, Violet flinched. She thought she might get hit.However, contrary to what she thought, his hand only patted Violet\u2019s head slowly and gently.It was a soft, careful, tender touch. The last time she received such a thing was when she was a child.\u201cBecause we\u2019re family.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re my younger sister.\u201dA familial relationship, as he mentioned, had always been something that seemed easy to throw away.As a family member to another, one could be far crueler than any stranger at all, and it\u2019s for this reason that Violet did not feel the cling to such a relationship. The closest enemy one could have was family.Violet could not let go of the hatred she felt for the person in front of her now, and she had long since abandoned hope that she would receive any love from him. Yet here, he was one-sidedly pouring out affection towards her as her older brother.She stared blankly at him.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said once more.Along with his feeble apology, he retracted his hand from her head.For a second there, Violet could not process what had just happened.Right before Roen\u2019s eyes, he could see just how much vigilance there could be in response to only reaching a hand towards a person. And, right before his eyes, he could see the culmination of his own supposed principles\u2014of keeping relationships with others only based upon their worth.It was all his doing. He realized that he was the one who made her like this.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t need it. I\u2019m uncomfortable, so let\u2019s just call it a day. You already know your way around, so get out on your own.\u201dAs Violet said this, her eyes were so full of hostility. Her voice contained a deep-seated anger that just wanted to announce itself loudly.She withdrew into herself. If she were to start hoping again, she would just be abandoned someday once more.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry, Vee.\u201dRoen murmured as he watched Violet\u2019s retreating back.A deep wound could not be easily healed.Now, he would never again see that child who could have been lovingly embraced by her family. He would never again see her trying hard to be acknowledged.Regrets always come too late.* * *Clatter.The sharp sounds of tableware hitting each other filled the quiet room. They weren\u2019t very loud, but the noise was particularly grating because all the people seated around the table were utterly silent.By nature, the duke ate quietly.It had already been months since Violet had disappeared from the dinner table. Their meals always seemed to be full of pleasant conversation between the siblings who got along well, but now, there was only silence.Not to mention, Mikhail was in a despondent state due to the doubts raised against his qualification as the duchy\u2019s heir, while Roen just observed and said nothing.The clattering was not that loud. It\u2019s not so much that it would be against proper etiquette.Even so, it was bothersome.If Violet was here, she would certainly say something like, \u2018Your conduct\u00a0must\u00a0remain suitable to the Everett name.\u2019\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Roen asked, his tone much the same as any other day.It was the kind of question that a kind older brother would worriedly ask his beloved younger sister.\u201cAh, Brother Roen\u2026 I\u2019m quite alright now.\u201dAileen smiled softly.\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019ve completely recovered yet, Aileen. You don\u2019t seem to have enough strength in your hands yet.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Yes.\u201dHe uttered the question with such a sweet and gentle tone.To the point that no one here would think that Roen was pointing out Aileen\u2019s etiquette.\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m still lacking in many ways. I should work harder, shouldn\u2019t I? To become a splendid person\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. You can\u2019t be spoiled forever. You have to be more careful in the future.\u201dRoen continued to speak kindly, and Aileen couldn\u2019t help but shrink at those words.\u201cOh, as expected I\u2019m, I\u2019m still\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about, Aileen? What\u2019s lacking about you! You just have to stay healthy and well, just as you do now. And don\u2019t get hurt from now on.\u201dAileen\u2019s sullen voice was drowned out by Mikhail\u2019s outburst.Hearing what Mikhail said, Roen frowned slightly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Would he have said that all she needed to do was not to get sick because she wasn\u2019t lacking at all? Would he have believed that she could do better?It\u2019s safe to say that these were all meaningless questions. The answer to all of them would be a resounding \u2018no\u2019.Self-deprecation festered into a spreading sense of guilt within Roen.He had never been good to her. Roen swallowed a bitter smile.\u201cNo, Brother Mikhail. What Brother Roen said is right. I\u2019m not good enough compared to Sister. She\u2019s so elegant, after all\u2026 I\u2019m never going to be able to reach her standards, but I should\u2026 I should try, shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cWhat does that hateful wench have to do with anything! You\u2019re fine just the way you are right now!\u201dMikhail\u2019s spirited bellows filled the dining hall.Until now, the duke had only been eating silently, and he remained as such.What a farce.All of the painful experiences that Violet had to go through were just like terribly written plays.Mikhail was the blockhead that he was, and the duke whose favorite was Violet simply left the whole problem unchecked.Once the silence was broken, the dining hall was quickly filled with chatter. Mikhail and Aileen continued their conversation.The main topic of their drivel was Violet. Whenever Aileen would cautiously say, \u2018Sister is so great, while I\u2019m not,\u2019 Mikhail did not hesitate to refute those words. Then, Aileen would say nothing to deny that refutation and would just innocently smile.This was how Aileen made herself out to be the nicest child ever.Truly. What a farce.\u201cI just hope that Sister\u2019s confinement gets lifted soon. If I try\u2026 I\u2019m sure my sincerity will reach her.\u201d\u201cYou. You\u2019re just such a good kid that I don\u2019t know how you\u2019ll survive in this harsh world\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, Brother. I can harden my heart, too! But Sister\u2026 Why do you think she doesn\u2019t like me so much? Even though we\u2019re family.\u201dIf Violet heard this, she surely would have said many things in return.But really, what\u00a0family\u00a0was this.Roen gave it a brief thought. In the meantime, the conversation between Aileen and Mikhail flowed as such.Aileen consoled Mikhail, who might soon be stripped of his status as the duke\u2019s heir. But then Mikhail acted tough and said, \u2018Then who else would be the next head of the family?\u2019It didn\u2019t\u00a0just\u00a0sound awkward\u2014you could even say that it felt contrived.Roen smiled gently.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to force yourself to seek out someone you dislike, of course.\u201d\u201cHiic\u2014\u00a0Brother, but how could I let Sister continue thinking of me that way? She might never know my sincere feelings.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m saying this from my own experience, Aileen. If you\u2019re truly thinking of the other person\u2019s well-being, you can\u2019t just force yourself on them. Isn\u2019t that so?\u201d\u201cB-Brother\u2026\u201dRoen didn\u2019t quite have the right to say such a thing as he had been visiting Violet everyday recently, but still.There was a strange expression on Mikhail\u2019s face, looking as though there\u2019s something he wanted to say. However, the duke set down his silverware right then, and Mikhail closed his mouth.Now, Roen had finished his meal and so he stood up from his seat. He could feel it already\u2014if he wouldn\u2019t drink some digestive medicine any time soon, he\u2019d surely throw up everything he had just eaten.\u2018Oh, back then\u2026\u2019Roen grimaced slightly as he recalled one particular day in the past where he saw Violet letting out dry heaves after dinner.Before Roen stepped away from the dinner table, he did not forget to leave the last word.\u201cBrother,\u201d he said to Mikhail.\u201cWhat is it this time.\u201d\u201cTake good care of yourself.\u201d\u201cW-What?\u201dThe duke continued to say nothing even after Roen left the dining hall first.In the silence that blanketed the air, Aileen cried as she lamented, \u201cDoes Brother Roen hate me now?\u201dOf course, Mikhail hurriedly consoled her.The truth was a very strange thing.* * *\u201cSo, that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why do you even have to come visit me and tell me something like that\u2026\u201dViolet\u2019s expression was completely sour.It\u2019s only natural. Just one mention of those people was enough to make her nauseous, so listening to such news about them would certainly make her lose her appetite too.Violet couldn\u2019t understand why Roen was bringing them up. She let out a frustrated sigh.\u201cAt the very least,\u201d Roen said. \u201cI believe you should know.\u201d\u201c\u2026I do\u00a0not\u00a0need to know.\u201d\u201cInformation adds to one\u2019s strength. And knowledge is something you can wield with authority. It\u2019s better than being clueless, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dViolet said nothing in return.Seeing the evident discomfort in her countenance, Roen tried to gauge Violet\u2019s reaction. Was he wrong to do this?Roen looked away. Violet continued to remain silent.The higher the position a person had, the worse they were at interpersonal relationships. Mary shook her head.\u201c\u2026I said I don\u2019t need it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dRoen still couldn\u2019t see what the problem was, but he at least knew that he should just stop talking about that. Surreptitiously, Roen then decided to shut his mouth about that topic.So, he swiftly changed the subject.\u201cAnyway, the Crown Prince has taken an interest in your art.\u201dHowever, Roen\u2019s words only served to further worsen Violet\u2019s already displeased frown.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Actually, he\u2019s been urging me to become his aide, and he sends a letter to remind me every day\u2026 I\u2019m pretty sure he just wants to saddle me with all his tiresome work.\u201d\u201cOkaay\u2026\u201d\u201cHe says he wants to meet you soon, but honestly, I can\u2019t get a handle on what goes on in his mind. He\u2019s a snake-like guy, so if you meet him later, try to keep your distance.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOne snake-like guy was warning her about another snake-like guy. Violet pressed down the urge to say what she wanted to say.The imperial crown prince\u2019s image was not good in Violet\u2019s eyes. After all, their first meeting ended up as a total failure.Besides that, what reason did an exiled ducal lady have to meet the empire\u2019s heir to the throne?Violet\u2019s eyes narrowed. Regardless, however, Roen chattered on as he was.\u201cIt\u2019s obviously just an excuse. The imperial family\u2019s elders have been hounding him about welcoming a crown princess consort. Honestly, if he had a little bit more of an agreeable personality, he would have already sent a letter of proposal to you long before.\u201d\u201cBut for him to send a letter of proposal to someone who\u2019s at the center of many disturbing rumors, the imperial family must be a mess\u2026\u201d\u201cHow you\u2019re perceived in the capital and within Everett is different. And if you think about Rajaden\u2019s personality, he might just send letters of proposal to both you and Aileen while declaring that you should compete for the position of his consort.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dViolet had no will to converse, whereas Roen was overflowing with the energy to chatter.When Violet watched the corners of Roen\u2019s lips tugging up as he mentioned Aileen\u2019s name, she tried to calm down her boiling resentment.Just in time, Mary stepped in to change the brother and sister\u2019s tea. And, once again, Violet had to press down on the urge to throw scalding hot tea into Roen\u2019s face with greater difficulty.\u201cThat\u2019s very good news\u2026\u201d\u201cWould it not bother you if Aileen becomes the crown prince\u2019s consort?\u201d\u201cWhat would that have to do with me?\u201d\u201cI believe it would matter a lot. Do you think she\u2019ll leave you alone once she becomes the crown princess, and later the empress?\u201d\u201cSo, again, what does that have to do with me\u2026\u201d\u201cA lot, really. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be here to protect you.\u201dRoen spoke such sweet words as if he was a caring older brother.\u00a0Blargh.\u00a0Violet suddenly had the urge to puke. What\u2019s this guy talking about now.\u201cIt\u2019ll be alright. Or, perhaps, you won\u2019t allow me to protect you?\u201dViolet was relentlessly appalled by the nonsense that Roen kept spouting. On the other hand, Roen just grinned.\u201cAnd why in the world must you protect me?\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re my younger sister.\u201d\u201cExactly, why in the world\u2026\u201dViolet was fed up. As if he was unaware of that fact, Roen smiled again.\u201cAnyway, have you thought about holding an exhibition for your art?\u201d\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t keep up with the flow of this conversation, Young Lord.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a waste to keep your paintings here in the annex. An opportunity will surely come in due time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dViolet decided to give up on responding to Roen at all.* * *While Violet was truly quite fed up, the situation in the main mansion was slowly changing. Even so, things couldn\u2019t possibly change that much overnight.Many things did not change in an instant because of the firmly established impressions that have remained in place until now.This was especially true for the angelic image that Aileen had manufactured for herself.Duke Everett was just the kind of man who\u2019s impossible to read. It was like that even for his own children.What kind of emotions he harbored, what kind of thoughts he had, and what kind of attitude he\u2019d convey\u2014everything was a mystery. Nevertheless, he was a prominent duke brimming with respectability.After what had happened during their dinner together the other day, Roen had given up all hope that their father would resolve the situation.Mikhail kept insisting that the duke was playing favorites and that his favorite was Violet, but in Roen\u2019s eyes, this was not the case.The further he investigated, the more it was revealed just how much of a spectacle the truth was.Since the duchess\u2019s passing, there had been no one managing House Everett\u2019s internal affairs.This had been going on for more than a\u00a0decade.Amidst this mess, the fox proclaimed herself to be king, but the biggest problem was actually the head maid, who had been reigning over the residence as though\u00a0she\u00a0were king.That person had originally been Aileen\u2019s nanny, and she was an outsider who followed Aileen into the duchy when the girl had been adopted. Throughout the years, she helped Aileen, then she finally took the position of head maid for herself.In the end, no matter how much the weak Aileen acted like a fox, she was just a kid. There\u2019s a limit to the number of tricks that a child could think of.It\u2019s a wonder how all this came to be, but there was apparently someone pulling the strings from behind.What a spectacle it was\u2014truly a spectacle\u2014just how much the head maid so thoroughly schemed to ostracize one single child.There was once a time when Violet had cried and asked Roen for help. As he recalled that time, Roen couldn\u2019t help but ruffle his hair haphazardly.Sometimes, oftentimes\u2026 such memories resurfaced and caused him pain.He thought about how he should slowly cut off the head maid\u2026 But the people who served as her hands and feet were a problem, too.Clicking his tongue, Roen soon sighed. There\u2019s already been a change of hands in the personnel, but there\u2019s still quite a few filthy rats left.If those people had been affiliated with the family\u2019s enemies, House Everett would have already fallen to ruin.Father, have you always been so terribly incompetent?Lost in thought as he was gauging the situation, Roen eventually stood up from his seat.Since he had already made up his mind, it was best to finish it right away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was announced shortly after Mikhail had been stripped of his position as the duke\u2019s heir.Any decisions related to the household\u2019s successorship certainly couldn\u2019t have been done in haste, but in this case, it was as good as done from the onset.The day Aileen was notified that she would be studying abroad, she vaguely noticed that the atmosphere around the duke\u2019s residence was changing.\u201cYou there, by any chance, have you seen Affela anywhere?\u201d\u201cPardon me, Milady?\u201d\u201cUmm, I\u2019m talking about my maid.\u201d\u201cAh, yes, Affela. I believe she has left for House Rindello. It was sudden, but the circumstances must have called for it.\u201d\u201cReally? But for her to leave without telling me\u2026 Anyway, thank you.\u201dAs Aileen gave her a bright smile, the maid blushed. That lovely face of hers never failed to have a strong influence on others.Only a fool would not notice that the people around her were gradually changing.Now that there was no one around her, Aileen bit her fingernails, but the moment she sensed someone\u2019s presence behind her, she stopped what she was doing and hid her hands.\u201cMilady?\u201d\u201cAh, hello. You\u2019re a newcomer, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes, Milady. People call me Letty. Here, I\u2019ve brought some refreshments for you.\u201d\u201cLetty. So you\u2019re called Letty?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something I would like to ask.\u201dHolding onto the maid\u2019s arm, Aileen smiled very brightly at her. The maid, being a newcomer, had no resistance to her charm.But she looked apprehensive.\u201cDid Brother Roen say anything? I think he kinda doesn\u2019t like me these days\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible, Milady. It wasn\u2019t long ago that the Young Master had asked me about your wellbeing.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 I heard that he got very angry at the people who talked about Sister. All they did was talk about Sister, but they got into big trouble\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you happen to know anything?\u201d\u201cIt is not my place to talk about the matter thoughtlessly. Once you\u2019re done eating later, I\u2019ll come back and clean up, Milady.\u201d\u201cWait\u2014 wait a moment!\u201dWhether or not the lovable noble lady tried to make her stay put or not, the new maid moved quickly. Having finished what she came here to do, she hastily escaped from Aileen\u2019s room.\u201cThis can\u2019t be. This absolutely cannot be\u2026\u201dChewing her nails once more even though there were snacks perfectly placed on the table right there, Aileen muttered to herself anxiously.The servants who had merely\u00a0talked\u00a0about Violet were all rebuked for breaking the code of conduct. They were groundless rumors that had been spread as though they were facts, but regardless, she could only wonder whether such an act was worth the punishment they had faced in return.\u201cThis can\u2019t be.\u00a0I\u2019m\u00a0right here\u2026\u201dScowling to the fullest, Aileen threw her pillow with much annoyance.She was in the middle of letting off steam to ease her restlessness, but she froze at once. She heard the sound of someone\u2019s movements.\u201cHi, Aileen.\u201d\u201cBroth\u2026er?\u201dThe visitor was none other than Roen.No way. That maid.Did she already reach Roen in the meantime?But how could a mere maid talk to a duke\u2019s son? Thinking it impossible, Aileen quickly schooled her features and smiled.\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d he greeted.\u201cYeees, good afternoon, Brother.\u201dIt was peaceful. If it wasn\u2019t for the thinly veiled war of nerves between them, anyone who\u2019d see this sight would think that they were on ardently good terms.\u201cWhat brings you here\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been busy lately, and I know I haven\u2019t been spending enough quality time with you. I\u2019m actually here to bring you a gift, and\u2026 I kept knocking, but I guess you couldn\u2019t hear me. I took the liberty of letting myself in.\u201d\u201cO-Oh?\u201d\u201cJust asking, but is anything troubling you these days?\u201dWith an amicable expression pasted upon his features, Roen strode forward and placed a large teddy bear next to Aileen.In an instant, her complexion deteriorated.\u201cI heard that you\u2019ve been very anxious about many things these days. In particular, with matters regarding me?\u201d\u201cW-Whaat? T-That can\u2019t be! How could I, with you Brother\u2026\u201d\u201cI know, our kind-hearted Aileen. You must have been worried about me because you\u2019ve just got such a big heart, don\u2019t you? Perhaps it\u2019s the people around you who have exaggerated the rumors\u2026\u201d\u201cTh\u2026at can\u2019t be. They\u2019re all good people.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t be so sure about what goes on in people\u2019s minds, actually. When surrounded by only ill-intentioned people, isn\u2019t it terrible that my kind-hearted younger sister is getting painted in such a bad light? Maybe I should pay more attention.\u201d\u201cBrother, I really am alright. They have a reason for doing so\u2026\u201dThe more her clear, ringing voice evidently contained sadness, the darker the smile on Roen\u2019s lips became.Along with the teddy bear, Roen also brought a hairclip for Aileen. He tucked away a lock of her hair gently, then spoke.\u201cMy kind-hearted younger sister\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cAileen. This world isn\u2019t as forgiving as you think.With the clip now on her hair, its green hue going together well with her pink locks, it sparkled.Roen chuckled.\u201cYou\u2019re a good child, so of course you won\u2019t understand. In this world, there are people who take advantage of another\u2019s kindness, and those people would take that kindness for granted. That would result in the collapse of the status quo.\u201d\u201c\u2026Broth, er.\u201dWhat he said just now were the same words that Violet once told Aileen.If one stroke of kindness could topple the status quo, in the end, who would be held accountable?\u201cBut you\u2019re a good child, I know.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cStill, you don\u2019t have to know about such squalid matters. Because you\u2019ll always be a good, kind-hearted child.\u201dShhk.\u00a0The touch of the hand patting her hair remained gentle.Aileen could only look up at Roen with a vacant look in her eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And that a good child can\u2019t talk about other people\u2019s business recklessly?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dThat\u2019s right, good girl.Until the moment the older brother\u2019s gentle hand left her hair, the blank look on Aileen remained. She could not fix her expression at all.* * *Violet disliked Roen.The reason she disliked him was not simply because he had been cruel to her before, but simply because of his nature.A good child shouldn\u2019t behave like this,\u00a0he\u2019d often say.Roen\u2019s cunning ways used to be directed at Violet\u2014chipping away at her all that time\u2014however, they were now directed at Aileen.The image of a \u2018good child\u2019 that Aileen had manufactured for herself was solid through and through, yet it now became a shackle that she could not escape.After her study abroad at some unknown place had been decided, Aileen\u2019s behavior began to be constantly controlled. There was not a single time when she could rebel or abandon her image as a \u2018good child\u2019.The reason Aileen Everett had been able to live as an Everett until now was, of course, her image.Mikhail had no control over the situation either.Each and every one of his actions in the past had been pointed out and brought to light, leaving him constantly bombarded. Though he was the duke\u2019s heir, he had no ability to overcome it.The smallest of words or deeds were assessed, and this evaluation served as a turning point in the present.Surveillance was relentless. One small act became a rumor that would spread immediately.Thus, there was nothing Mikhail could do for his beloved younger sister.\u201cAileen, what\u2019s the matter? The area beneath your eyes has gone dark. Perhaps you didn\u2019t get enough sleep\u2026\u201d\u201cN-Not at all. Brother, I just\u2026\u201dEven if the two siblings who cared a lot about each other were to meet, their hands were tied. The older brother, who loved and cared for his younger sister, lamented that there was nothing he could do for her.\u201c\u2026Just what the hell have you been doing, Roen.\u201d\u201cSlander between siblings now? I\u2019m hurt, Elder Brother.\u201d\u201cBullshit. You\u2019ve changed ever since you got close to that villainess. If you don\u2019t stop this right away, I\u2019ll make damn sure you\u2019ll pay for it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Either way, the retribution you speak of has already commenced. With you, Elder Brother, and\u2026\u201dAs Roen trailed off, he glanced at Aileen. Being met with the gentle expression on his face, Aileen flinched.Roen was no fool. Ever since he realized what kind of life Violet had been living until now, not a day went by that he didn\u2019t think about it.Roen was tormented by guilt.For him to have bullied Violet for ten years by stigmatizing her as a \u2018villainess\u2019\u2026 He couldn\u2019t stand what he had done to her. The inside of his mouth tasted bitter.Even when there was no one by her side, she just endured it all on her own.Nevertheless, whether or not Roen sympathized with Violet, what happened in the past would not disappear.The day that Violet would call Roen \u2018Brother\u2019 again would never come.\u201c\u2026Manipulative prick.\u201d\u201cI do believe that\u2019s better than being an halfwit.\u201dThe one who had already realized his transgressions laughed at the two who still remained ignorant.Roen, who was looking at Mikhail, turned around.* * *Regardless of whether the main mansion had been overturned or not, Violet\u2019s days were full of leisure.The ducal lady had been allowed to go on outings once a week, and she used this time to freely wander around the city.She had two official escort knights, and\u00a0several\u00a0unofficial escort knights.One short outing of the ducal lady required considerable manpower, but Violet was clueless about this.The portraits that she would do in front of the fountain had since become a specialty of the town. People who could ill afford professional painters or camera photographs were in a flurry to meet Violet.Some quarrels broke out, too. There were plenty of people who disliked the fact that Violet had not learned formally in an atelier.Though there were many individuals secretly stationed here and there as the ducal lady\u2019s security detail, they couldn\u2019t stop some painters who went so far as to disguise themselves as customers.\u201cDid you seriously draw this? Hah. I already had low expectations for art from a\u00a0girl\u00a0like you, but this is rather abysmal.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Sure.\u201d\u201cBack in my day\u2026! For a little girl to\u2026!\u201dViolet\u2019s expression clouded over.This guy was a customer so she drew a portrait for him, but he happened to be a backwards-thinking boomer[1].Violet was in the middle of taking down her signboard, but the man continued to nag about his long experience as an artist one after another. She shook her head.Then, when he mentioned that he had been invited to the duke\u2019s residence to paint a portrait, Violet replied offhandedly.\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met you before though\u2026 That\u2019s strange\u2026\u201d\u201cW-What?! Of course! There\u2019s no way a wench like you would have been able to meet me!\u201dBut if he, indeed, was invited to the duke\u2019s residence to paint a portrait, she should have met him at least once, right? But why didn\u2019t she know him?As he watched the man constantly being impertinent, Zylo reached a hand towards the hilt of his sword and growled.Still though, Violet was unbothered.Compared to the life she had lived, this was just adorable.\u00b9 Violet used the slang term \uaf30\ub300 here, so I went with \u2018backwards-thinking boomer\u2019 for its translation. Basically, \uaf30\ub300 means a nagging older/elderly man who forces down his old-fashioned values down your throat, especially if you\u2019re young.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t remember seeing you anywhere in the ducal residence.\u201d\u201cW-What?!\u201dThe stationed guards were called.When Violet stood up, Mary swooped in and hurled one insult after another at the man.Hearing the delicate Mary\u2019s cusses made Violet chuckle.\u201cI mean, she\u2019s obviously very elegant, but is she really a noble?\u201d\u201cGood gracious, why is a noble drawing in a place like this? Not only that, but even taking portrait commissions.\u201dViolet\u2019s words just now caused a brief stir among the crowd. One of them looked intently at Violet\u2019s silver hair and said, \u201cBy any chance\u2026\u201d And soon after, the others followed....In any case, her usual outings were peaceful.That was, until she met Mikhail.\u201c\u2026What are you doing here?\u201d\u201cHa, haha. I am the Everett Duchy\u2019s successor\u2014the Young Duke himself. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m not allowed to go anywhere.\u201d\u201cYeess. I see.\u201dShe sent Roen back the other day when he had troubled her. Today was a good day for her though, since it started out with a nice meat pie for breakfast, and it put her in a pleasant mood.After she had finished her morning exercise, she went out to town and was just walking around the streets while carrying her materials in a bag.It was a few days ago that rumors started circulating amongst the townsfolk that she\u2019s a noble, and the looks they gave her shifted strangely. Violet did not mind this though.Anyone who treated Violet awkwardly just received a refreshing smile from her, and she\u2019d tell them that they didn\u2019t have to care about her standing.So, as they realized that Violet was more easy-going than she looked, people tried to treat her as they usually did again.However.\u201cAnd where are you going?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m just going on my way.\u201dMikhail was now blocking her path, so it\u2019s only natural that her good mood quickly went down the drain.\u201cI asked you\u00a0where!\u00a0Are you really going to act recklessly in front of me?\u201d\u201c\u2026It hurts. Please let me go.\u201dAt the sidelines, Zylo watched restlessly as his old friend showed such an ugly side of him.Instead of Zylo, it was the young knight, Leon, who zealously reached for the hilt of his sword. However, Mary hit his hand.\u201cWhy are you stopping me!\u201d\u201c\u2026For now, just leave it to Milady.\u201dAs Violet heard what the others behind her were saying, she grimaced. Mikhail had served both as a military officer and a civil official, so it was only natural that he was strong.\u201cThink of your reputation, Sir.\u201d\u201cHa, haha. Reputation, you say\u2026 You\u2019re Everett\u2019s wicked woman, but it\u2019s possible for you to be conscious of such a thing too, huh?\u201dMikhail\u2019s words incurred waves of murmurs from the people around them. Even those who had already guessed her identity were shocked enough to stare blankly at Violet\u2019s silver hair.\u201cDid he really just say that Miss Ella is the wicked woman?\u201d\u201cYeah that\u2019s what he said, but maybe the rumors are wrong?\u201dHearing their rising clamor, Violet bit her lower lip lightly. She didn\u2019t want her identity to be revealed like this.\u201c\u2026Is there anything you have to say to me?\u201dNervously shaking off Mikhail\u2019s hand from her wrist, Violet asked this question.However, Mikhail\u2019s eyebrows furrowed at this.\u201cHa, haha. Do I have anything to say, you ask. Are you not aware of just how you are acting in front of me now\u2026!\u201dAs he growled in anger, Violet took a step back. Zylo grabbed the hilt of his sword. This time, Mary did not stop Leon.\u201cYOU!\u201dViolet took a step back, but Mikhail took one step forward. Because he was tall and had a huge physique, he was entirely intimidating.Every time Violet tried to step back, Mikhail would prowl forward again.\u201cYou\u2019re not even aware of what you\u2019re doing now!\u201dSLAP!A deafening sound rang out.For a moment, Violet could not grasp what just happened. She stared blankly.Then, Mary collapsed in front of her.\u201cMary\u2026!\u201d\u201cM-Milady.\u201dWith how forcefully she had been hit, red blood started flowing down Mary\u2019s nose.Right here and now, Mikhail so easily tried to slap his younger sister. However, he started shaking in rage once again. The loyal maid caused him to miss his target.\u201cWhat have you done!\u201d\u201c\u2026Changed, my ass. Now isn\u2019t this a\u00a0show.\u201d\u201cKeep your reputation in mind. Do you have any idea just how much your actions right now are undermining the prestige of the household?!\u201d\u201cIn the end, it\u2019s still that damn household\u2019s prestige with you. That\u2019s all you know how to say. Do you know who I am?! I\u2019m Mikhail U. Everett! You can\u2019t tell me what or what not to do!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s impossible to communicate with him.Violet bit her lower lip again. Since Mikhail revealed his identity, there was no one here who could stop him.\u201c\u2026I heard you were deprived of your status as the Duke\u2019s heir. So that\u2019s why. Now I get it.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell do you know about me.\u201d\u201cWhat do I know? As a matter of fact, I know very well just what kind of personality you have, Sir Mikhail. You were deprived of your status, yet there was nothing you could do about it, and now you think you can act however you want.\u201dAfter her beloved Mary had been slapped across the cheek, Violet decided to throw away any attempt at civility.If she herself had been the one who\u2019d been slapped, she would have just let Mikhail be. After all, it had happened many, many times before.However, she could not bear to see that her person had been assaulted.It was someone else who had cornered Mikhail. But, of course, he was here before Violet to vent his anger.As soon as he heard the rumors that the wicked woman was drawing portraits at the town square, he came all the way here.\u201cYou! Everyone in the world knows what kind of false rumors you\u2019re intentionally spreading! Everyone knows exactly what kind of nonsense you\u2019re up to right now! Rather than changing, you\u2019ve just become more vicious! You think people won\u2019t know how much you\u2019re harassing that child?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re doing all sorts of things now, huh? You\u2019re really\u2026 Fine. I lost my position as the Duke\u2019s heir\u2014but it must have been\u00a0you\u2019re\u00a0doing, I\u2019m sure of it. You must have whispered something to Father.\u201d\u201cYou\u2014\u201dViolet was about to say something, but at that moment\u2026Zylo pointed his sword at Mikhail.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Leon had also unsheathed his sword.\u201cThis is\u00a0exactly\u00a0why you were stripped of your title as heir.\u201dViolet\u2019s eyes blazed with a raging fire. Instead of being subdued like lakes, her eyes were truly burning with anger.\u201cYou\u2019re still not admitting your sins until the end?!\u201dMikhail roared once again. Commotion rose like waves amongst the watching bystanders. The situation had truly gone out of hand this time.\u201cViolet, if you\u2014!\u201d\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t expect you to be this foolish, Elder Brother.\u201dAt that moment the situation was brought to a halt only because Roen, who now stood on equal grounds with Mikhail in terms of his position, had arrived.Even though Roen was up to his neck with work, he made sure to hear out the reports relentlessly being sent to him about Mikhail\u2019s unexpected behavior.And, the reports quickly reached the duke\u2019s ear as well, but it was Roen who arrived to deal with the situation.\u201c\u2026Under the orders of the Duke, drag him away.\u201d\u201cRoen, you\u2026!\u201dSighing, Roen brought a hand to his forehead.He found out recently that Mikhail had been indulging himself with alcohol. Even so, he didn\u2019t know that Mikhail would go as far as this.He heard that Mikhail had slapped Violet many times before. It was frightening when an ignorant person was so set on his beliefs, but this was exactly who Mikhail was.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dViolet glared at Roen. It wasn\u2019t the kind of gaze that you\u2019d give someone who\u2019s here to help.Roen smiled bitterly.In Violet\u2019s case, there\u2019s no particular reason why she was displeased to see Roen. She was receiving help from him, but the fact that she managed to escape the situation only through this manner made her feel helpless\u2014that\u2019s why she was glaring at Roen.She had no other place to vent her feelings.Even though Roen wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong.\u201c\u2026The carriage is on standby. The maid can be examined by the family doctor.\u201d\u201c\u2026I will not thank you.\u201d\u201cI know\u2026 and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201c\u2026Even if you say that, I will not feel grateful.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just\u2026 here to deal with Elder Brother. You don\u2019t have to thank me.\u201dViolet helped Mary into the carriage. Roen\u2019s assistance was something to be thankful for, but rather than feeling any gratitude at all, Violet felt only contempt.It was a renewed sense of contempt for herself. She wished she could be honest and thank him.Zylo and Leon remained and were tasked to help the other knights stabilize the commotion. Roen, on the other hand, dispersed the spectators and told them not to spread false rumors.\u201cMary, are you okay?\u201d\u201cThat, shi\u2026 If I could just shove cow and pig fodder into that punk\u2019s mouth to shut him up\u2026\u201dEven as they were already safe in the carriage, Violet was still worried about Mary\u2019s condition. Nonetheless, she was relieved to hear the maid\u2019s colorful swearing.All this time, Mary had been refraining her potty mouth from saying all sorts of curses in front of her lady, but it was all being released now.Hearing the various creating swears spilling through the girl\u2019s lips, Violet smiled softly.It was a good thing that, though she had been slapped, Mary seemed to be fine.\u201cI feel so fortunate that you\u2019re my maid. Although I feel the opposite about how you have to go through this.\u201d\u201cI feel fortunate that I can serve you, too, Milady. If I hadn\u2019t stepped forward, you\u2019re the one who would have been hit. I\u2019m the one who voluntarily took it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Still.\u201d\u201cMilady will make sure that I\u2019ll be treated, right?\u201dWithout a word, Violet drew Mary into an embrace.Mary fumbled for a moment, but she soon patted Violet\u2019s back.Violet truly thought that she was lucky to have Mary as her maid.* * *The one who\u2019s on the receiving end of Mikhail\u2019s rampage was Violet, who was under probation.Violet did not complain about her probation, and the reason behind this was simple\u2014she was too lazy to do so.So, while Violet was slacking off under the pretense of her probation, rumors about Mikhail went rampant.\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but it seems the Young Master slapped the Young Lady on the cheek.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s probably the Young Lady\u2019s fault.\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t though? My friend was right there when it happened, and I don\u2019t know about you but\u2026\u201dGroundless rumors also began to spread quickly. Or, well, rather than a groundless rumor, perhaps it\u2019s better to say that they\u2019re rumors that had shaky foundations?Roen did not stop these rumors from spreading. No, he even added a bit of lies here and there to bolster the truth.Mikhail caused such a disturbance because of Aileen, and one poor maid\u2019s head had gotten lopped off.If Mary would have heard of this, she\u2019d undoubtedly be shocked to hear it. After the incident, she received only the best treatment for her injury and was currently living a normal life.\u00a0 Rumors were rumors, after all.Moreover, for the duration of Violet\u2019s probation, she was not allowed to be visited by anyone at all. Her activities had also been restricted.As she was keeping a low profile again, Violet only snorted. Ever since she had been confined to the annex, she had already been placed on probation several times.It was obvious that the duke only handed down this order for Violet\u2019s protection. The knights stationed everywhere around the annex were testament enough to this. Of course, Violet did not care.As escort knights who failed to fulfill their duties to guard Violet, Leon and Zylo asked to be punished but did not receive any such punishments.They wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop a duke\u2019s son anyway, so it had been acknowledged that their actions were warranted.The others\u2019 daily lives were also peaceful. As was usual, Mary made a fuss while taking good care of the ducal lady, and the ducal lady herself, who was called a \u2018villainess\u2019, just went about her days leisurely and did nothing.As they each spent their time freely, Roen couldn\u2019t even get any shut eye because of how busy he was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The duke allowed it.The second son did not hand down punishment to the first. Instead, he visited his older brother and had a conversation alone with him.Just the two of them.Ever since Violet and Cairn had been born, they rarely had any reason to be alone together.Mikhail glared at his younger brother. Albeit weak, hostility was evident.Roen said nothing. He\u2019s the one who initiated this conversation, yet he was just maintaining this dreadful silence. Thanks to this, the air in the drawing room had become endlessly heavy.Silence, stillness. Tempered hostility and a low sigh.In the room where even the faintest sound of a droplet could be heard, it was Mikhail who broke the silence first.\u201cIf you have something to say, then just say it already. I am in no mood to listen to your unpleasant word games.\u201dA punishment would soon be imposed upon him, yet he still carried himself with the confidence of an innocent man.Yes. As a matter of fact, Mikhail thought that he was not at fault in any way at all.\u201c\u2026Brother.\u201d\u201cSure, carrying yourself in such sanctimony now, aren\u2019t you? You must be here for quite an\u00a0important\u00a0talk.\u201d\u201cStop it with the bullshit,\u201d Roen said with a smile.At this, Mikhail\u2019s expression hardened.Watching the older brother who he once looked up to in admiration, Roen swallowed a sardonic smile.\u201cBullshit?\u201d\u201cYeah. Bullshit. Without any of the unpleasant wordplay you dislike, I\u2019m asking you directly, Brother. Do you truly not know what situation you\u2019re in right now? Why aren\u2019t you aware? Unless you\u2019re quite literally a halfwit, there\u2019s no way that you\u00a0wouldn\u2019t\u00a0know. I can\u2019t believe I have a fool for an older brother\u2014\u201d\u201cYou atrocious\u2014!\u201dHowever, regardless of Mikhail\u2019s furious outburst, Roen quickly cut him off.\u201cHow can you be so blind and senseless? Ah. No, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m here to say.\u201d\u201cThen if you\u2019re here to say something, just do it right! If you don\u2019t want me to hit you, just\u2014\u201d\u201cAlright, then let me be straight. There\u2019s no way a fool like you would ever apologize or reflect on your actions. Just keep this in mind. Do\u00a0not\u00a0show yourself in front of Violet anymore. Don\u2019t talk to her. Don\u2019t touch her. Just consider her as someone who doesn\u2019t exist. And above all\u2014\u201dDo not hurt her.Clatter\u2014\u00a0His teacup was brought down upon its saucer.Mikhail looked at Roen with a more incredulous expression than when he was called a halfwit. He could not believe his own ears.\u201c\u2026I did say that I will refrain from the word games you revile.\u201dThough Roen spoke in a seemingly nonchalant tone, his voice conveyed his seething anger.\u201cDo you hate that child that much?\u201d\u201cRoen.\u201d\u201cDo you truly hate her? So much so that you\u2019d blame her even when she\u2019s done nothing wrong?\u201d\u201cRoen E. Everett!\u201dBang!His fist hit the table. At the roaring noise, Roen looked at Mikhail as he sipped his tea.As the man who lived as a knight displayed a frightening amount of rage, the man who lived as a scholar only laughed.\u201cYou know, Brother.\u201d\u201cShut your trap.\u201d\u201cThis time, it\u2019s not Violet\u2019s fault.\u201d\u201cI told you to shut up!\u201d\u201cAnd even all those times before\u2026 Many of them were just pinned on her. No, even if she hadn\u2019t been framed, none of those actions were deserving of such criticism.\u201dBANG!He hit the table once more. The teacups shook, and the tea spilled on the flat surface.\u201cSo.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSo are you saying that I should have just stayed still and watched everything, you damn punk?!\u201dMikhail\u2019s blazing green eyes were completely filled with rage. His words were directed at Roen, but his anger was\u2014always, always\u2014directed at Violet, even at this moment.Even to the bitter end, you keep hating that child.Roen smiled.Seemingly, Mikhail\u2019s anger was justified. However, that was not true.The one and only target of his hatred and derision was always just Violet.Because Violet S. Everett was a villainess. Because she was a bad child.However, right here and now, Mikhail had no right to be angry at Violet.\u201cIt\u2019s your fault that you were deprived of your status as the Duke\u2019s heir.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, in some way, you could blame me for that. I\u2019m the one who officially asked Father for the position of his heir.\u201d\u201cYou, right now\u2026\u201d\u201cBut then, why are you angry at Violet and Violet alone? As if she was the only one in this world who\u2019s evil.\u201dWhat stood against evil was justice.And justice could be served when a righteous man were to punish an evil woman.Thus, Mikhail was a \u2018righteous man\u2019.\u201cYou know what? In the old days, I used to look up to you, Brother. You were kind, admirable and righteous.\u201d\u201cHave you seriously gone mad after falling for that wicked woman\u2019s sweet talk?!\u201d\u201cHow did you end up like this\u2026 There was once a time when you cared for Violet, when you didn\u2019t hate her this much. Why did you become a person who just keeps blaming her for anything and everything?\u201d\u201cROEN!\u201dThe malice in the knight\u2019s voice was not something that a weak scholar could endure.Roen\u2019s fingertips trembled. However, without showing any sight of this, he laughed.How did this happen? When did their relationship start deteriorating so horrifically?Roen considered himself to be smart, and yet what was it that had been blocking his view? What was it that made him blind to all of this?There was only one answer.And Roen agonized over that fixed answer.Just as Violet was Roen\u2019s younger sister, so too was Mikhail Roen\u2019s older brother.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The guilt he had towards his younger sister had long grown uncontrollably within him.Even if he were to treat her well now in the name of atonement, it would not erase all the times that he had hurt her in the past.\u201cYes, there was a time when I thought it was right to think and act like you, Brother. Violet was always angry. She insulted Aileen, did vicious things and harmed other people out of spite. All of those were terrible acts, and such acts are worth despising.\u201dAs Roen spoke slowly, he could barely keep his voice from trembling.\u201cBut I have to ask you, Brother. Was there ever a time that you thought about why she did that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cJust once. Did you try listening to her properly?\u201d\u201cWhat is it that you\u2019re getting at.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like this when we were younger.\u00a0We\u00a0weren\u2019t like this, not you, not me, not Violet\u2026 Vee.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cEveryone just started to hate her, everyone just kept saying that she was wicked\u2026 Yet she was only a child. For as young as she had been, was there anything that she could have done?\u201dViolet was always enraged. She always lashed out in anger and acted viciously against anyone in her path. She carried malice towards everyone.A person who had only received hatred would also only return hatred.\u201cShe asked us for help.\u201d\u201cDo I have to repeat myself each time? What is it that you\u00a0want.\u201d\u201cShe begged us for help over and over again\u2014to listen to her, even just once\u2026\u201d\u201cRoen!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been saying what I wanted to say for a while now, Brother.\u201dWe\u2019re the ones who made her do that.\u201cIf that child is a wicked woman as everyone says, it was us who made her that way.\u201dAt the quiet words that continued to flow, Mikhail\u2019s eyes glinted.No matter what reason there was behind it, evil was evil. Malicious acts should never be dismissed as the fault of others.Regardless of anything, Violet was a wicked woman.\u201cSo you, what you\u2019re saying right now\u2026\u201dGood and evil were the opposite of each other. He who punishes evil was a good man. Therefore Mikhail, who did not tolerate evil deeds, was a righteous man.He must be a righteous man.\u201cYou\u2019re saying that I.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the bad one here, huh?\u201dHis glinting eyes trembled constantly. Not a single grain of guilt could be seen in those eyes.Roen smiled.\u201c\u2026You were wrong, Brother.\u201dRoen took a sip out of his tea. His mouth felt dry as he smiled bitterly.\u201cEverything you\u2019ve done so far\u2026\u201dMalicious acts should not be dismissed as the fault of others, as he said.\u201cWere things that should not have been done.\u201dViolet did not blame others for any of her own misdeeds. She did not even show any guilt for them.But here Mikhail was, insisting that Violet was to blame for everything\u00a0he\u00a0did.\u201cWe were wrong. All we did was criticize her for her faults without asking why, all we did was get angry at her, and\u2014right\u2014all\u00a0you\u00a0did, Brother, was use violence against her. We kept pushing her and telling her she\u2019s at fault. But you\u2026\u00a0you\u2019re\u00a0the one who\u2019s wrong.\u201dPhysical violence was not the only kind of violence.In this world, there were a plethora of ways, invisible to the naked eye, to inflict harm upon others.Bang!Mikhail\u2019s hand hit the desk once more. As he hit the hard surface with his bare hand several times now, it had turned red.The air trembled due to the aura that now covered both of his fists.Roen looked straight into Mikhail\u2019s glinting eyes.\u201cThat, cannot\u2026\u201dHe did not admit any of his wrongdoings.\u201cThat can\u2019t be! You\u2019re saying that I was wrong? That I\u2019m at fault? I\u2014\u201dI am Mikhail!Roen looked into Mikhail\u2019s eyes, hoping that they would contain even a small hint of guilt.But there was no such thing.Just unabashed haughtiness remained in his gaze as it always did. This man did not admit to his guilt. He would not even acknowledge it.\u201cWhy must Violet\u2019s\u2014 Why must that evil thing\u2019s wrongdoings be attributed to me?!\u201dHad he not heard a single word that Roen had uttered thus far? He inwardly clicked his tongue.He really didn\u2019t know if Mikhail\u2019s brain was capable of a single thought or if it was just truly mere decoration.\u2018Indeed, if he had a functional brain, he would have stopped persecuting Violet long before.\u2019Time and time again, Mikhail vilified Violet. He kept on telling her that she was the one who did everything wrong. How ironic was it that he lived with such double standards.Contrary to Mikhail\u2019s line of logic, it was impossible for the world to be divided simply between good and evil.Everett was a noble household and a founding family of the empire.As a household that had power second only to the imperial family itself, House Everett was leading numerous other vassals. The family carried with them an aristocratic blue bloodline that served to protect the country, and the responsibility they carried on their shoulders included the lives of countless other people.\u201c\u2026There\u2019s a limit to subjecting others to such bullshit. Leave.\u201dThus, House Everett\u2019s successor, Mikhail, had to be completely flawless.And Roen could only scoff at that man\u2019s obstinacy.There was no perfect human being in this world. The position of a household heir was a heavy one; even if he had gone mad because of it, must he have numbed himself as he went crazy?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In this world, it was all complicated.Just as it was possible for a victim not to be completely good, so too was it possible for a perpetrator not to be completely evil. Each person had their own reasons.\u201c\u2026I see. So that\u2019s your answer, Elder Brother.\u201dMikhail leaned back on the sofa and closed his eyes. When Roen said that, his expression somehow looked forlorn.The next Duke of Everett.A talented person versed in both literary and martial arts.A righteous knight.\u201cBrother is so nice. How can such a cool person like you exist?\u201dHis life was without any stains.Except for only one\u2014his younger sister who never failed to go around doing evil deeds.\u201cDo not lose sight of your status as the Duke\u2019s heir. Conduct yourself appropriately.\u201dHe had always lived a knight\u2019s chivalric life. At the same time, he did not neglect his studies so that he could assume the responsibilities of a military officer.The amount of studying and pressure he had gone through was beyond one life, but the number of lives he had to bear was countless.Mikhail had to think and act like the duke\u2019s heir at all times. If not, just one mistake of his might kill dozens, hundred, thousands.\u201cBrother is so much like a righteous knight.\u201d\u201cAh, I read a book yesterday, and the knight in that story\u2026\u201dAileen\u2019s voice echoed in his ears like a hallucination. That poor child.Violet had persecuted that poor younger sister.She despised the girl because they had not been born from the same womb.Half of Aileen\u2019s blood was of lowly origins, that\u2019s why she had been criticized.\u201cWhenever the princess is in danger, the prince always appears and saves her. A prince on a white horse!\u201dViolet did not hesitate to insult the girl, nor did she forgive any slightest mistake.She had thrown hot tea at the girl, deliberately spilled wine, and slapped her across the cheek.\u201cYou are the coolest and most righteous older brother in the world!\u201dTo have looked down on the girl so openly in front of others, what could that be called if not evil?\u201cI.\u201d\u201cConduct yourself appropriately.\u201d\u201c\u2026I was\u00a0wrong?\u201dHe just did what he had to do. It was Violet who was wrong.\u201cI\u2026\u201dThere was no answer that could be as clear as black and white, as unambiguous as good and evil.Thinking in such a way would just be shallow.Immersed in himself as he did not look back at others, he cut the world to just conflicting opposites, building relationships based on only his own criteria.Holding firm to one\u2019s beliefs was a noble act, but nothing was more twisted than obstinately clinging to false beliefs.If those beliefs were to be broken, what should he do?Should he justify his own actions just so he could protect himself?However, if self-justification was impossible, the thing that\u2019s left in its place.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat could it be?* * *The punishment that Roen decided for Mikhail was simple.House arrest for one month. And, thereafter, seven days of probation.Considering that Violet was also on probation, this punishment was very light.Even so, the problem that Mikhail instigated when he ran wild and smeared the duchy\u2019s reputation was somehow resolved.There was no need to outwardly show political strife from within the family. It was good to use rumors to one\u2019s advantage in moderation, but it\u2019s wise to stop once the goal was reached, which was overturning the bad rumors about Violet.Despite the penalty given to him, Mikhail was much too quiet. Aileen made a fuss about meeting her older brother, but she was not allowed to visit.Perfect solitude and isolation.Neither Mikhail nor Aileen were in much different positions.Besides that, after Mikhail had been stripped of his status as the duke\u2019s heir and when Roen was thus proclaimed as the next duke, the news about it spread throughout the empire.Some were skeptical about whether the weak Roen would be able to handle the position. But on the other hand, those who knew his true nature only shuddered.All of this happened so quickly, but there were no rumors going around about Violet.As he was worried about the stability of Violet\u2019s health\u2014both physical and mental\u2014Roen had blocked any information about her from leaking out.\u201cIs this your home, Young Lord?\u201d\u201cMmh. What do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cYou come and go as if it is.\u201d\u201cWell, technically speaking, it\u00a0is\u00a0my home. There\u2019s no place in the ducal residence that I can\u2019t go to.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs Violet was not completely aware of the goings-on outside, she only looked at Roen incredulously.It\u2019s a bit of a spectacle to see him coming here to personally report how he had blocked the rumors about her.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you came all the way here just to say that.\u201d\u201cOf course not. There\u2019s many other things I\u2019m here to tell you. First of all, I told you about how Elder Brother is going to be stripped of his position as the successor, right? He\u2019ll be sent to Ashbourne soon, too.\u201d\u201cAh, that seaside town.\u201d\u201cI can deal with him easily and disguise it as a death from an illness or an accident, but we\u00a0did\u00a0get along before though.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dViolet was born and raised in this world, but as she kept a modern way of thinking, she reacted to Roen\u2019s words seriously.Roen just added that he was merely kidding.\u201cNow, onto the next piece of news.\u201d\u201cIf you have nothing substantial to say, I\u2019d like for you to leave now.\u201d\u201cBut like I said, I\u2019m here because there\u2019s something I have to tell you. I\u2019m heading to the capital\u2014would you like to come with me?\u201dRoen asked her casually.Violet had to do everything she could to resist the urge of raising her voice.\u201cI already turned you down last time\u2014\u201d\u201cIs it because of the Crown Prince?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t even know his face.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Of course, if you don\u2019t wish to marry, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to go.\u201dViolet flatly rejected Roen\u2019s suggestion.For a moment, Roen made a sulky expression. He looked so abominable in Violet\u2019s eyes that the thought flashed across her mind that she\u00a0really\u00a0might throw tea at that hateful face.\u201cYou know, Vee\u2014\u201d\u201cThere is a limit to such things. That is enough.\u201dAs Violet coldly recited as such, Roen appropriately quieted himself.Strangely sullen because he couldn\u2019t freely call her with her childhood nickname, Roen looked at Violet\u2019s expression.\u201cWhat do you think of Father\u2014His Grace the Duke?\u201dBroaching the subject carefully, Roen asked. In turn, Violet narrowed her eyes, trying to see through his intentions.\u201cI believe that he is a great person.\u201d\u201cAh, ah. Not like that. Rather, as a father.\u201d\u201cExcuse me, Young Lord, but I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re trying to get me to say.\u201dViolet expressed her suspicion.At this, Roen smirked.As he picked which words might be right, Roen intertwined his fingers. There was a soft smile on his lips as he looked at Violet.If anyone was there who might not have known their relationship, perhaps they\u2019d guess that Roen was determined to win her over. It was worth seeing that gaze behind his eyes.\u201cInstead of as a Duke, what kind of person do you think he is as a father?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dStill as ever, it was difficult to surmise what Roen\u2019s true intentions were.Violet frowned slightly. If she were to give the wrong answer here, she wondered if she\u2019d be eliminated.One might say that she could only be overthinking. Even so, she couldn\u2019t let her guard down.Right now, this was a place where the duke reigned like a king. Regardless of whether she held blood relations to him or not, the question that Roen had posed to her was akin to poison.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing for you to be so wary of. Then, shall I tell you what\u00a0I\u00a0think first?\u201dAs good as he was at reading other people\u2019s thoughts from their demeanor, Roen smiled brightly.The duke\u2019s second son, who had not known about Violet\u2019s situation until only recently, continued to speak freely as he was perfectly piercing through other people\u2019s minds so well.\u201cCertainly, as you say, he is an incredible duke. He governs his domain in such a way that clamor would not be heard anywhere.\u201dTap, tap.Roen used one index finger to tap against his cheek in a playful manner.\u201cIt is originally the duchess\u2019s role to take care of the house\u2019s internal affairs. However, even after Mother had passed away, no major internal problems arose. So, perhaps it\u2019s correct to say that His Grace the Duke is impeccable at managing both the internal and external affairs of the household?\u201dRoen had brought up a taboo.And at once, Violet frowned deeply. Roen smiled again as he saw that his younger sister wasn\u2019t even hiding her reactions from him.It had been a long time since the duchess passed away.She\u2019s always had a weak constitution, and when she had met her demise, it was due to an illness. She did not meet a painful end.Nevertheless, Violet bristled quietly with anger.\u201cWhen I said that there\u2019s no problems with the household\u2019s internal affairs, I mean to say that there were no problems in the financial department, and there were no cases of embezzlement. It\u2019s even more marvelous to think that it\u2019s like this when the household deals with astronomical sums of money constantly.\u201dRoen was speaking calmly. Though he noticed that Violet\u2019s fingertips were trembling, he did not stop.\u201cBut as a matter of fact, everything was in shambles. Wasn\u2019t there a time when you ordered for a maid\u2019s tongue, ankles and fingers to be cut off?\u201dAt this, Roen had to pause.Thud.Violet hit the table with one hand.Roen stared at Violet for a moment, but soon continued.\u201cFor a servant to ridicule one\u2019s master, this was a fully legal mode of punishment.\u201dWatching as Roen sipped his tea nonchalantly, Violet clenched her hand into a fist. If her fingernails were a little longer than they were now, they would have already dug into the inner flesh of her palm, letting out streams of blood.When looking back on her past behavior, Violet concluded that there was nothing else she could have done. But at the same time, she didn\u2019t think it was right.Yeon Ha-yoon, who was deep in her consciousness, would have said, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t do that.\u2019However, even though Violet had regained the memories and the modern sensibility of her previous life, she was, after all, a person residing in\u00a0this\u00a0era.She had absolutely\u00a0no\u00a0intention of apologizing to those people.\u201cEven so, I overreacted.\u201d\u201cYou did, yes.\u201dRoen refreshingly agreed to her answer. Stumped, Violet looked up at him.There was an unreadable smile on his face.\u201cFather favors you. This is an undeniable fact.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why he didn\u2019t do anything about your actions. What\u2019s dreadful about this, however, was that if he had at least done\u00a0something\u00a0about it, things wouldn\u2019t have turned out this way.\u201dKeeping her hands clenched until now, Violet let out a slow exhale.And at last, the true Violet once again faced Roen\u2019s green eyes.\u201cSo, let me ask you the same question from a while ago, Violet. What do you think of Father?\u201dShe still couldn\u2019t grasp Roen\u2019s intentions, but she went on to give him an honest answer.\u201cI believe that he is a great duke.\u201dHearing Violet\u2019s response, Roen smiled.There were two things he needed to confirm.How heavy the past weighed on Violet, and how much emotion she had left for her family.He couldn\u2019t proceed with the matters related to her however he wanted.\u201cAh, yes. That\u2019s your answer from the start.\u201dHe had rambled on for as much as he had, yet still received the same answer the first time. Even so, Roen smoothed his chin and continued to smile at her with his eyes.A good man. A good duke.From the very beginning, Violet had not shown any signs that she considered the duke to be her \u2018family\u2019.She thoroughly regarded him as a stranger. Just some person she received good will from.\u201cBut not a good father, of course,\u201d Roen quipped.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was true to both before and after the death of his beloved wife.He pressured his eldest son, Mikhail, while he was indifferent to his second and third sons. Some might say that his favorite was Violet, but even the favor he held for her was mired with indifference.Human beings did not change easily.\u201cDo you really not want to go to the capital with me?\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019ve been talking circles for a while now.\u201d\u201cI believe I\u2019ve explained my cause well enough.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs Roen said this, Violet paused.The duke was not a good father. His negligence, under the pretense of love, was what ruined this family.A man who was regarded as \u2018His Grace\u2019 by his own children could not be a loving father.He could\u00a0never\u00a0be a good father.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHonesty was a virtue that could sometimes be so frustrating.Even though the duke had realized his mistakes and was trying to change, both the past and the duke\u2019s nature could not be changed.As for Violet, all she wished for was to be able to live quietly while painting, then she would die.But right now, because of Duke Everett\u2014who was only a \u2018duke\u2019 to her\u2014she couldn\u2019t fulfill that wish.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d\u201cThen, I\u2019ll be hoping for a positive answer.\u201dHow could a person change.After finally receiving the answer he wanted to hear, Roen grinned broadly.* * *Violet\u2019s trip to the capital was quickly decided.After days and days of contemplation, she gave her reply to Roen. Cairn would be returning from the academy soon, and as soon as she heard about this, she acquiesced and said that she would be heading to the duchy\u2019s townhouse in the capital.Mikhail was a miscreant, but at the very least, he was mindful about losing face. Of course, he\u2019d been hellbent on criticizing Violet as of late, to the point that it didn\u2019t look like he cared about the household\u2019s dignity anymore, but that was beside the point.Compared to Mikhail, Cairn didn\u2019t care about the consequences of his actions at all.The abuse that Violet had received all these years was mostly psychological, but physical violence was also thrown into the mix sometimes.Mikhail accounted for thirty percent of said physical abuse, while Cairn accounted for seventy percent. The times that Cairn had attacked Violet, without any self-restraint, was more than ten times in total.Once Cairn was home, how would he react the moment he\u2019d take a look at the current situation?Roen gazed at Violet with an elated\u2014though slightly mixed\u2014gaze.He was well aware of Cairn\u2019s actions towards Violet as well. He knew about it all, but he had turned a blind eye.\u201c\u2026Violet.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re done with your business here, I suggest that you please go back.\u201d\u201cUm, this much can perhaps be called teatime between a brother and sister, so\u2026\u201dHowever, as he was subjected to Violet\u2019s contemptuous gaze, Roen wilted.Though he hadn\u2019t been formally appointed yet, House Everett\u2019s second son was now the duke\u2019s heir.Even so, he asked Violet carefully.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to be the next head of the household?\u201d\u201c\u2026Is that supposed to be a joke?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious here.\u201dYou\u2019re capable enough. Why aren\u2019t you aiming for the position?Roen asked the question. In response, Violet glared at him ever deplorably.A sullen, puppy-like gaze met with Violet\u2019s glare. It truly seemed like she was absolutely disgusted by him.Just as Roen said, Violet was also qualified enough to be the next duke. Of course, with the exception of her reputation.Throughout the years, she did everything she could just so she could receive her family\u2019s recognition, and in doing so, she had accumulated countless qualities and capabilities.The duke gave his four children equal education. The young siblings thought that the matter of succession would follow primogeniture, thus naturally surmising that Mikhail would be the next duke. Even so, they all received the same education that the heir required.Aileen, however, did not receive this equal education. She had been given the opportunity to take it, but she had not been able to keep up with the rigorous lessons. And so, the duke took the initiative to make the order of changing Aileen\u2019s curriculum.On the other hand, Cairn declared that he wasn\u2019t suited to just sitting around at a table while studying all day, so he went on the skip class.Thanks to this, only Mikhail, Roen and Violet had received an heir\u2019s education.And now that Mikhail had been deprived of his right to inherit the duchy, only two candidates were left.If Violet were to have both Roen and the duke\u2019s support, she could very well be the next head of the household. In this era, while it\u2019s certainly rare for women to take up leadership positions in the government, it was not unheard of.Besides that, becoming the next duke was her surest path to revenge.The utter sweetness that power could bring was beyond imagination.However, even during the time that Violet had been acting as a wicked woman, she had never once tried to covet the position of \u2018heir\u2019.A glacial air settled upon Violet\u2019s demeanor.She had wondered the same thing long ago, but Roen\u2019s question now was nothing but thoughtless.\u201cYoung Lord, do you want me to be the next head of House Everett?\u201d\u201c\u2026A little.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s quite the statement from the very person who\u00a0asked\u00a0His Grace the Duke that he be given the position of heir.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just, to protect you\u2014\u201d\u201cPlease. Refrain from uttering such\u00a0nauseating\u00a0things.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026\u201dRoen\u2019s heart sank.And Violet didn\u2019t care.\u201cSure, if I take up the position of the next duke, I will most certainly be able to enact my revenge. With only the Imperial Family above me in terms of power, I can do whatever I please.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBut then, what\u2019s the point?\u201d\u201cThe point?\u201d\u201cOnce upon a time, I wished for revenge. I wanted you all to kneel before me, to apologize and beg me for all the wrongs you\u2019ve done unto me. In my head, I\u2019ve already executed every single one of you over and over and\u00a0over\u00a0again.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEven if Roen had a hundred mouths, he would not be able to say anything back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And it didn\u2019t feel nice at all. It was just this sticky unpleasant feeling that you\u2019d get from drinking unfizzy softdrinks.This resentment wouldn\u2019t disappear after just a few words.\u201cLet me ask you the same question. Do you think you\u2019ll be happy once you\u2019re the duke?\u201d\u201c\u2026No.\u201dTalking about the matter of revenge abetting revenge was a moot endeavor. As a matter of fact, revenge was a good thing. It might even improve one\u2019s quality of life a little.\u201cIt\u2019s a frightening and heavy position to carry.\u201dThe sweetness brought by power would no doubt be addictive, however the weight of responsibility loomed not far behind.If the villainess were to become the duke\u2019s heir, the intensity of all the criticism against her would become even stronger.It would end up with just this: damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t. If she couldn\u2019t do well, she\u2019d be cursed at. If she could do well, she\u2019d still be cursed at.Political enemies would come in droves just to bring her down. They would spread more rumors about her, they would press her down with all their power and might.The same was true if she were to become the crown prince\u2019s consort. Power was bound to carry such responsibilities and criticisms.What Violet wanted was just one simple thing.To spend the rest of her life painting without having to worry about starving.This was the happiness she was hoping for.Roen smiled bitterly.The man, who now carried an insurmountable weight of responsibility all for the sake of apologizing to his younger sister, stopped asking meaningless questions.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll move up the schedule of our departure to the capital so that we can leave before Cairn returns. Rest comfortably for now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRoen had been stopping by Violet\u2019s residence regularly these days even though he had such dark circles under his eyes. After a short goodbye, he left the drawing room.Still as ever, there was no such thing as a prolonged goodbye between the two of them.* * *Rumors started going around about how Violet would be going to the capital with Roen. The whispers continued spreading with no signs of stopping.Some people said that the wicked woman would be released from her confinement, while others said that she might only have been framed.Some people said that she must be aiming for the position of the crown prince\u2019s consort, while others said that Violet had never been truly incarcerated in the first place.Public opinion about Violet had certainly changed, but there were still droves of people who continued to vilify her. In that sense, her decision to leave the Everett household was a good choice.The rumors spread little by little and eventually reached Aileen.\u201c\u2026Why.\u201dAs she muttered under her breath, the girl clutched the pillow in her hands so hard that it might soon burst.From a cursory glance of her room, it looked as if a storm had swept through the space. It was a mess. Broken objects were strewn everywhere.She couldn\u2019t do anything. The image she had built up all these years had caught her by the ankle.Her outward image of a \u2018good child\u2019 was the key point to her being able to receive all that love, but at the same time, it was the very thing that shackled her.\u201cWhy! Why the hell!\u201dAll her actions were controlled. Even the smallest mistake would come back to bite her in the form of criticism. The wide, wide duchy had become a cage for Aileen.\u201cWhy, why did this happen. Nanny, Nannyyy\u2026 Where did you go? Why, why\u2026\u201dAileen was neither an angel nor a saint.In the end, she was just a human being. In such a situation where she was suffocating, she was unable to endure.And it only worsened further when her nanny and maids, who acted like her hands and feet, had disappeared.As she had been loved all her life, the girl could not overcome the violent environment she now found herself in.* * *Moonlight rested above the lake\u2019s surface.Violet looked down quietly into the lake where she had once plunged into. Considering that the weather hadn\u2019t been good that day, it was a miracle that she had survived.The grass beneath her bare feet made her skin itch. Though she was scheduled to leave for the capital the very next day, Violet had come out for a stroll on an impulse.In the middle of the garden, she was a sole woman who was walking barefoot, wearing only a nightgown. If anyone were to see her, it\u2019s only natural that they would point a finger at her.Even so, she nevertheless went on this stroll and enjoyed it as much as she pleased.Violet would be leaving the Everett residence tomorrow.She would be leaving her hometown, which was also her birthplace.She did not feel regretful about this. However, she could not stop the urge to take a tour around the residence.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt would be the last time before she\u2019d leave\u2014to capture with her eyes the hometown that she would not be returning to.\u201cIt\u2019s time to say goodbye.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was cold.How could this feeling be expressed?She said that she wanted to be happy, but she had long since forgotten how to\u00a0be\u00a0happy. It\u2019s possible to breathe on land, but she had long since forgotten\u00a0how\u00a0to breathe.Goodwill received from other people sometimes served as violence as well. Or, it could prove to be overly addictive.Violet trusted Mary, her maid.She cared for those who had faith in her as well. Even so, she also knew that those people were the same ones who used to curse her and talk about her behind her back.Faith and trust were such shallow things.\u201cYou should be prohibited from coming to this place.\u201d\u201c\u2026I heard that you\u2019re leaving tomorrow. I won\u2019t be able to talk to you outside of today.\u201dSo, Violet knew well enough that this sweet, addictive goodwill could change at any given time.Aileen, who she met here, seemed to have something in mind.The girl had many small scratches here and there, as if she had walked through a rough path in order to get here somehow without being seen by other people.Ruined by the sudden change of her surroundings, the girl glared scathingly at Violet.Green eyes, seemingly calm but just beneath the surface, there was a simmering outburst of anger.And purple eyes, subdued and indifferent.\u201cYou\u2019re here to talk, huh. What is it that you have to say to me?\u201d\u201cI hate you.\u201d\u201cHow honest. Even though you\u2019re the child who used to follow me around, saying, \u2018I want to be close to you, Sister.\u2019\u201dHer laughter reached Aileen\u2019s ears. It was both a sneer and a self-deprecating laugh.Violet slowly drew nearer to Aileen.\u201cYou\u2019re hurt. If the child loved by everyone gets hurt like this, they\u2019ll all be sad.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201dWith the moon\u2019s glow falling down, the pale hand that was struck suddenly flashed.Aileen made a low growling sound, eyes glinting ferociously.\u201cAlways that attitude of yours, always.\u201dAileen gnashed her teeth.\u201cWhy are you acting as if you\u2019re doing well all by yourself? Just pretend to be such a lofty noble, just show how arrogant you are, just show how much you look down at people\u2026\u201dAt that, interest glimmered in Violet\u2019s eyes.The sweet, lovely young miss of the household was not here.Now in front of Aileen\u2019s true face, Violet smiled.\u201cI didn\u2019t really want to talk to you because I personally had nothing to say. But now, I\u2019m a little interested.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t pretend to be well!\u201d\u201cGo ahead, then. Say what you want to say.\u201dViolet\u2019s smile provoked Aileen once again. Clearly, it was a sneer.Without realizing it, Aileen took a step back. All her thoughts were evident in her eyes\u2014she looked exactly like a person who wanted to kill someone.\u201cIt was like that from the beginning. You\u2019ve always been so detestable! You know what? I hate you so damn much. The way you pretended to be so proud all by yourself, the way you looked at people to say that they don\u2019t deserve that position, the way you struggled so hard to be loved yet acted so prideful. I hate it all!\u201d\u201cWhat a coincidence. I hate you, too.\u201dViolet smiled as she took another step closer to Aileen.And the girl took a step back. As Violet raised one hand, Aileen flinched reflexively and covered her face with her arms.However, Violet merely removed a single leaf that was stuck in Aileen\u2019s hair.\u201cW-Why\u2026! Why are you making that face! Just swear. Swear at me! Curse at me for being dirty and vulgar, for being a fool that\u2019s eating away at the prestige of the family!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a predilection for being cursed at. Is that what you\u2019re here to say?\u201dAileen\u2019s voice was echoing throughout the forest.Violet gave the girl a haughty smirk.\u201cYou, I seriously hate you\u2026 It\u2019s supposed to be mine\u2014my place. It just, it just so happened that you were born with that blood\u2026 If my father had met someone else and lived well, that place\u2014\u201dHer anger eventually burst and led to tears. The girl shouted viciously with a poisonous look in her eyes, but nevertheless, that face of hers still looked lovely.\u201cIt was originally my place! The position of being a ducal lady, people\u2019s concern and love, those abilities, everything\u2019s supposed to be mine!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be mind. So I\u00a0made\u00a0it mine. What\u2019s the problem then? You\u2019ve lived well all this time anyway!\u201dAileen uttered the words with shrieks, and as her tears overtook, it was all swallowed by the silence of the night.Violet laughed.\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what you\u2019ve done! It\u2019s originally mine. It\u2019s mine. It was mine\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying such amusing things.\u201d\u201cAmusing? Right now, you\u2026\u201d\u201cRight. So you say that the position of ducal lady was originally yours?\u201dIt was the same arrogant smile that Aileen so abhorred. The noble grace that she could never have, even if she wanted to.Faced with the very image that she hated the most, Aileen\u2019s eyes bristled with fury.Violet whispered softly towards the girl.\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat it\u2019s originally your place.\u201dThough indifferent, the voice carried undeniable intensity.Yes, perhaps. The esteemed daughter of the Everett Duchy could have been Aileen.Violet might have been born as just a child of a branch family, and she might have been raised to be appropriately coddled. Then, she might have married into a prestigious aristocratic household.And Aileen might have been the ducal lady of Everett.But all this did not happen.What would have happened if Aileen\u2019s father had not told the former duke that he had fallen in love? If he did not choose to marry a woman of lowly status, and if he did not relinquish his position as the duchy\u2019s successor?Aileen would not have been born at all.It was a meaningless argument. Aileen\u2019s words were nothing but delusion.\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve always wondered\u2014why in the world are you doing this to me, why do you hate me so much that you feel so impatient when you couldn\u2019t drag me down.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I really liked you back then. It felt like I had a younger sister.\u201d\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t\u2014 make me laugh.\u201d\u201cRight. It\u2019s been more than ten years. It\u2019s meaningless now.\u201dIt was after you truly became my younger sister that I hated you.Saying so quietly, Violet slowly closed her eyes. Aileen\u2019s expression gradually became distorted.\u201cHa. Haha. Ahahahahaha!\u201dBeneath the moonlight, one person\u2019s laughter echoed.Laughter that carried both a hint of lunacy and relief.\u201cNow I know why\u2014 Why you hated me so much. Why you were so anxious whenever you couldn\u2019t drag me down.\u201dThud.As she took a step back, unable to stop the momentum, Aileen fell on the ground.Violet reached down slowly and caressed Aileen\u2019s cheek.\u201cYou\u2019re jealous of me, aren\u2019t you?\u201dConsidering that this was the person she hated the most, she was treating her very gently.Aileen slapped away Violet\u2019s hand.\u201cShut\u2014 Shut up. The likes of you. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m jealous of you!\u201dHer high-pitched voice was just as sharp as the accompanying sound of the hand being slapped.Their positions had become reversed. Aileen was under the impression that Violet was the cause for the change in her circumstances.That assumption was right to some extent, but on the other hand, also wrong.However, Violet continued to gently caress the girl\u2019s cheek, guessing why Aileen came to see her now.\u201cRight. That\u2019s why. You\u2019re jealous of my position. No, you envied me so much that you wanted to drag me down one way or another\u2014 to see me crash and burn\u2026 You longed to be superior compared to me, Aileen.\u201dThe disgraceful feeling brought about by a sense of inferiority\u2026 Violet was aware of the desire to be rid of that emotion.She loathed it whenever someone saw her weep or struggle as she was at her lowest. That\u2019s why, in any way she could, she wanted to prove that she was superior\u2026What use was this bloodline.The smile on Violet\u2019s face was quickly erased. In its place, a cold expression dawned upon her features, and she whispered into Aileen\u2019s ear.\u201cI won\u2019t ask you since when you started to hate me, my lovable younger sister.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cStay at the bottom forever. Because you can\u00a0never\u00a0be me. You no longer matter to me.\u201dAt every word Violet enunciated, Aileen\u2019s expression gradually became more and more distorted.Why would I be jealous of you? You\u2019re a villainess who isn\u2019t loved at all! You\u2019re a villainess who only bothers everyone each and every day!She, who endeavored to make the most noble individual a crude woman, tried to hide such ugly sentiments. But in the end, her wish did not come true.That sense of inferiority followed Aileen evermore.\u201cAileen.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou must have come here to blame me. You\u2019re in pain? You\u2019re in that situation right now? In your position right now, you can\u2019t even do or achieve anything at all.\u201dAs Violet moved away from her while asking Aileen all these things, the girl stared at her.Her hair shimmered with the moon\u2019s illumination.\u201cI hate you, Aileen. I hate you and everyone in this residence. Everything here is so horrible that it\u2019s impossible to endure.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re crazy.\u201d\u201cSo, I\u2019m leaving. No matter how hard you struggle, you can never be me. No matter how good you are at pretending, you can never be a good person\u2026 But since I\u2019m myself, I\u2019ve decided to live the life that I want.\u201dThe woman who once wept as she had been ostracized finally, after all this time, looked at peace.\u201cAs you say\u2014 I may be crazy. But one thing\u2019s for sure.\u201dViolet drew closer to Aileen once more and, again, caressed the girl\u2019s cheek.\u201cIn the end, it\u2019s all\u00a0your\u00a0doing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe situation you are in right now, your despair, your anger. Everything.\u201dYou brought it onto yourself.The girl who had collapsed hit the ground with her fist. Slightly perplexed at the girl\u2019s enraged reaction, Violet tilted her head to the side.\u201cI will claim what\u2019s rightfully mine.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Take it if you want. If you go and do that, let\u2019s see if you can change anything.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe girl on the ground cried.Violet walked forward, leaving Aileen behind her.There was no reason for her to look back.* * *A new morning had dawned.As she had not slept a wink all night, Violet\u2019s expression was dark. Stomping her feet slightly, Mary examined Violet\u2019s face and asked,\u201cMilady, by any chance, did something happen?\u201d\u201cNope, nothing at all.\u201dAfter Violet had let it all out at Aileen, sleep eluded her all night while thinking about it. She laughed.It\u2019s a good morning. It\u00a0had\u00a0to be a good morning.Because today was the day that Violet would be getting away from this endlessly tiring ducal household.\u201cUm, firstly then, here\u2019s a basin so you can wash your face, Milady. After doing so, shall I put on some make up for you?\u201d\u201cHow troublesome.\u201dThough Violet wouldn\u2019t be using this room any longer from tomorrow onwards, Mary tidied up the room.After she washed her face with rose water with some rose petals floating above the surface, Violet went on to change into a new set of clothes.Violet often shopped, but most of her recent purchases were only art materials.\u201cNow, there we go. Pretty, right?\u201d\u201cSure. Your skills are improving day by day.\u201dAs Mary tied up Violet\u2019s hair neatly, she smiled. Then, when Violet beckoned to her, Mary bowed her head.Liking the touch of her master\u2019s hand upon her, the girl smiled as Violet patted her head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Please take good care of me even when we\u2019ve moved to that place!\u201d\u201cYes. Let\u2019s go then.\u201dAt Violet\u2019s positive answer, Mary smiled brightly.As she was now dressed and done preparing for the day, Violet stood up from her seat. Her disposition had been dark earlier because she had stayed up all night, but now, she was elegantly adorned more than anyone else.\u201cAh, I almost forgot, Milady. Do you know? I heard that the Third Young Master will be coming back next week.\u201d\u201cIs that so? Well, that\u2019s one meeting I\u2019m not looking forward to.\u201d\u201cI heard that he\u2019s got quite a fiery personality.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s exactly as you say, yes.\u201dThinking about the family\u2019s youngest child, Cairn, Violet\u2019s eyes narrowed.Nevertheless, Mary smiled brightly and pretended to be an escort knight for her lady. Violet did not scold the playful girl.* * *Finally, Violet was about to escape this dreadfully exhausting ducal household.However, one way or another, her excitement was brutally shattered.Before even recalling her memories of her previous life, Violet had oft-imagined leaving her family.However, in all the scenarios she had imagined, the thought of this instance happening never crossed her mind even once.\u201c\u2026You.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA terribly haggard man\u2014more unkempt than Violet, who stayed up all night\u2014sauntered threateningly towards her with a staggering gait.At this, Violet grimaced.As the man had a heavily built physique, the pressure he exuded was enormous.\u2018Now that I think about it, today is the end of his probation.\u2019At the thought of the punishment that had been imposed upon Mikhail, Violet\u2019s eyes narrowed.But at that moment, the inebriated man raised his arm.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dIt happened in a flash.Right then and there, several knights blocked Mikhail, who then shouted with a hoarse voice, \u201cGet out of my way! How dare you all call yourselves guards when you\u2019re blocking\u00a0my\u00a0way!\u201dPressing down on the knot in the middle of his brows, Roen let out a sigh.\u201c\u2026Sorry. I should have made a countermeasure for this in advance.\u201dThere was no reason for him to do so, but Roen stepped forward and apologized to her.Violet glanced once at Roen, but nonetheless stepped forward as well.\u201cYou seem to have something to say to me, so let\u2019s hear it.\u201d\u201cBut Violet, Elder Brother is\u2026!\u201dRaising one hand, Violet cut Roen off mid-sentence.All of a sudden, Violet was struck with the impulse of not playing nice with Mikhail.As she had stayed up all night because of her confrontation with Aileen, now faced with Mikhail, Violet was just curious.Why did he hate her so much.Why did he have to denounce her to that extent.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRoen backed down.Though Mikhail was completely immobilized by the knights who had caught him, Mikhail\u2019s eyes glinted dangerously as he looked up at Violet.Recalling the memories of being hit by that large hand before, Violet smiled wryly.\u201c\u2026You.\u201dUnlike how he usually sounded, Mikhail\u2019s voice was hoarse. His green eyes, as verdant as the lush foliage, shone with such raw emotions.The eyes are the windows to the soul.As Violet gauged what kind of emotion and resentment was contained in those eyes, she beamed.However, Roen stepped in between his older brother and younger sister.\u201cYou, with Aileen\u2026 You used every little reason\u2014 Any reason at all to harass that poor child.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ha.\u201dThis was all the half-asleep voice answered.Violet was so baffled that she could not stop the brief burst of laughter.\u201cI was wondering what it is that you wanted to say to me, but you came all the way here just for\u00a0that?\u201d\u201cYou did it first, you\u2026 You harassed that child first\u2026\u201dMikhail uttered the words over and over like a madman.Violet raised one hand once again and gestured towards the knights. As they were holding him back as though he was a criminal, they reluctantly followed her unspoken order to let him go.Right then, Mikhail sprang up.He had become such a mess like this, yet he was here to fault and criticize someone else.As Mikhail glared at her ferociously with a murderous look, Violet took a step back from him.\u201cYes, sure. If you want to insist on the technicalities of it all, I was the one who harassed that girl first.\u201dViolet spoke in a tone mixed with mirth.Roen shook his head and swept a hand over his face.\u201cBut you were the ones who condemned me without making an attempt to ask me why I did that.\u201d\u201cYou! If you truly had been falsely accused, then you wouldn\u2019t have acted like that!\u201dAt this point, Roen was the only one who felt any guilt. Violet still hated Roen tremendously, but she concluded that Roen was at least better than Mikhail.Roen beckoned to the knights. They couldn\u2019t understand what was going on, and they didn\u2019t know whether to listen to the orders of the ducal lady or the household heir.\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d Violet asked.\u201cYou! Violet! You\u2019ve done something that you shouldn\u2019t have done! Your reasons don\u2019t matter at all!\u201d\u201cOh, how truly shocking to hear.\u201dSo you\u2019re saying that I\u2019m evil through and through,\u00a0Violet murmured.Mikhail took another step closer to Violet.However, in the face of that man\u2019s wrath, Roen drew out his sword.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Violet glared up at the man who she once called \u2018Brother\u2019.\u201cCountless times\u2014\u00a0Countless.\u00a0I tried to tell you, but each and every time you said that you didn\u2019t want to hear it\u2026 Yet now, you\u2019re curious about my reasons? Ah, but let me get this straight. Half of the things you told me I \u2018shouldn\u2019t do\u2019 were things I\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0even do. Why don\u2019t you try and go look for that mysterious person who\u2019s oh so jealous of this household\u2019s adopted ducal lady?\u201d\u201cYOU!\u201dWithout listening to her at all, Mikhail raised his voice once again at Violet. The hand on her shoulder continuously crushed down at her, and she winced at the pain.Roen\u2019s sword touched Mikhail\u2019s neck. But still, the man did not care.\u201cNo matter! You\u2014 You should have given a proper explanation! If you truly had been falsely accused\u2026 Right, if you were actually wronged, then how could you continue to be so cruel to that child! You shouldn\u2019t have let yourself be swept away by your emotions!\u201dYou shouldn\u2019t have acted on your own!As Mikhail continued to yell at the top of his lungs, the look in his eyes spiraled, truly like a madman.Violet took a step back. When Mikhail\u2019s hand finally loosened its grip and let go, she lightly brushed off her shoulder.\u201cFine. Yes, since I had been so wronged, I shouldn\u2019t have done that. I shouldn\u2019t have gotten furious, I shouldn\u2019t have taken out my anger in that manner, I shouldn\u2019t have screamed out\u2026\u201dViolet laughed.Roen drew his sword and lowered his gaze to the ground. The knights, on the other hand, overpowered Mikhail and made him kneel.\u201cThen, Brother, you\u2019re trying to say that what I did was bad, right?\u201dViolet\u2019s voice was quiet and soft, entirely different from how she always screamed bitterly.\u201cI was completely evil. Violet S. Everett was a villainess to the core. That\u2019s what you\u2019re saying.\u201dThe darker the smile on her face became, the more grim the people\u2019s expressions around her grew.Violet was not unaware of this fact.Mikhail\u2019s words could not be refuted. Regardless of how wronged she had been, she shouldn\u2019t have acted in that way.However.\u201cYou know, I was only eight years old.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what great things you\u2019re trying to expect from an eight-year-old child.\u201dViolet had been only eight years old back then.She was merely a child, completely lost and taken aback by the sudden malice pouring down on her.Those people refused to listen to that eight-year-old child, and all she could do was try to cling to them, to cry.Yet she was abandoned and left alone.At a period of her life when mature values had yet to be properly formed, it\u2019s only natural for a child to act like a child. She couldn\u2019t have thought deeply about how she\u00a0should have\u00a0acted.She was just a child, clumsy in her attempts to be loved.\u201cI was only eight years old when you told me I was evil, that I was wrong\u2026 You did not listen to my side. All you did was curse at me.\u201dAs everyone heard Violet\u2019s bitter words, the heavy silence blanketing the vicinity deepened even more.\u201cIt\u2019s true that I had tormented Aileen. It\u2019s true that I made a mess of her.\u201dNo one had listened to that eight-year-old girl, even when she turned nine, and then ten, and then\u2026Each year, Violet was ostracized and isolated further. And, as time marched on, no one was there to ask why she was so angry. They all disappeared.Violet S. Everett is a villainess, they thought.\u00a0She need not any reason to be so vicious.All those who stayed behind contributed to Violet\u2019s living nightmare. Not only Mikhail, but everyone who talked behind her back and mocked her.Roen, too, pretended to listen to her side. But in the end, he always only blamed Violet.And Mikhail continued to insist that Violet was evil.Ta-dak.As Violet stepped forward and drew closer to Mikhail, no one stopped her.If she was called Everett\u2019s wicked woman, then everyone present here was a sinner to her.Amongst everyone, Mikhail was the most heinous criminal, yet he failed to admit his sins. No, he\u00a0couldn\u2019t\u00a0admit it at all, so he came out here and tried to accuse Violet of being the evil one to the bitter end.\u201cBut you know what? I don\u2019t really feel any remorse for all the people I had tormented. I don\u2019t regret any of my actions. Yes, I admit that what I did was foolish. But rather than regretting it\u2026 Those people broke me first. The people I had tormented were the ones who\u00a0ruined\u00a0me.\u201dRetaliating that much was not unfair.Instead of trying to get rid of the label and stigma of being a villainess, she stepped forward and lived up to those expectations.Everett\u2019s wicked woman, vilified through and through mostly for the things she allegedly did but did not do rather than the other way around, laughed arrogantly.\u201cThat\u2019s right, I hate you all. I\u2019m sick and tired of the name \u2018Everett\u2019, sick and tired of all the damn people in this household\u2026\u201dSLAP!The stark sound echoed deafeningly.This was the older brother who hated her the most, but all that time, she couldn\u2019t give up on him just because he was her family.How powerful could Violet\u2019s strength be?Violet mustered all her pent-up resentment from all these years into this singular slap.Yet it was endlessly weak compared to how she truly felt.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The heavy silence was so stifling that even people\u2019s breathing sounded especially loud.As all the sinners were unable to raise their heads in front of the woman called villainess\u2026\u201cYou know what, Brother Mikhail? I liked you a lot. You were kind, cool and strong\u2026 I looked up to you so much for being such a nice older brother because you were like a righteous knight.\u201dCaressing Mikhail\u2019s cheek, Violet smiled and lowered her voice, now whispering in a voice only he could hear.\u201cI do hope that we won\u2019t ever meet again, dear Brother. Live like trash in a back alley and die in the most miserable way possible as your name will forever be forgotten.\u201dMy dear Brother, who is so very unchanging.Such intense words were backed by the intention of never seeing this man ever again.As such, Violet drew back from Mikhail. Her expression was exceedingly gentle.\u201cEveryone, be ready to move. Keep that fool in custody until he receives punishment.As Violet\u2019s command rang out amid the terribly deafening silence, the knights began to move according to their duties in a hurry.The knights who were meant to subdue and return Mikhail back to the main mansion were visibly conflicted.They did not dare have the right to restrain a duke\u2019s son, however Roen\u2014the one who now had the status of the duke\u2019s heir\u2014further supported Violet\u2019s command.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re all going to leave this sinner alone now?\u201dRoen dealt with the aftermath then soon returned to Violet\u2019s side.He realized once again just how harsh he had been to an eight-year-old child, and here, he could not find the right words to say to her. In the end, he chose to say nothing.* * *The only ones who went through the teleportation gate were Ducal Lady Violet, Young Duke Roen and the few elite knights escorting them.Because they had been given other tasks to do, Mary, Zylo and Leon were not present while the incident happened. They had to stay back for a little while.\u2018I wonder, will I get more notorious after this?\u2019As the carriage drew closer to the gate, the contemplative Violet slowly closed her eyes.She had thought that, if she could resolve the resentment she was feeling, she would feel better.What she felt now was not the same satisfying feeling as getting a rotten tooth pulled out. One slap on the cheek could hardly be called an act of revenge.That aside, she couldn\u2019t help but feel it was laughable how Mikhail continued to call Violet a villainess until the very end.Pain. Hatred. All the things she never wanted to see or go through again.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGoodbye, my hometown. I don\u2019t ever want to come back here again.Capturing the landscape of the duchy from the carriage window for the last time, Violet said her final farewell.* * *Ever since the day of her birth, Aileen was a girl who received love.Light pink hair that she got from her mother, and green eyes that were verdant and bright.This child was lovable and deserved to be loved.As a child who had been loved from the very day of her birth, she took for granted all the love that she received from others.Lovable lady. Adorable Aileen.However, she was always told the same thing.\u201cWhat a shame. If it weren\u2019t for that lowly bloodline\u2026\u201dSometimes, they even threw some sympathetic gazes at her.Children were more sensitive and intelligent than adults commonly thought.As a child, Aileen could feel not only the unsavory gazes directed at her, but also the jabs that those people were directing at her mother.She did not know what malice was, but she knew that it was not a good thing.\u201cYou\u2019ve got quite the looks. Well, of course, since you resemble your mother.\u201d\u201cBut for Milord to, he\u2026 Goodness. If it weren\u2019t for the child\u2026\u201dThe little girl could not understand why those people looked sad and upset whenever they talked about her mother.The eldest son of a ducal household.That man had been born in such a great noble house and he was on track to becoming the next duke, which entailed a position of power only second to the emperor.Yet he threw that all away and chose love.That man fell in love with a lowborn woman and abandoned all the honor and glory he had been born into. He stepped down all on his own.Such actions led people to call him the \u2018romanticist of the century\u2019, yet the reputation that followed him was laced with dishonor and stigma.Had he not abandoned his position as that ducal household\u2019s heir, the woman beside him would have become a duchess. From time to time, that woman fell into hysterics.Nevertheless, theirs was a harmonious family.The girl was loved by everyone. The girl was an angelic one. Even so, the girl was also sad.The world where Aileen lived was endlessly small and narrow.All this time, she thought that she was the one and only person who received love.\u201cHi. You\u2019re Aileen, right?\u201dThat notion soon shattered to pieces.Silver hair that would glitter softly as if it contained moonlight.Bright purple eyes that were like jewels, and a disposition that boasted of proud confidence.\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Violet. Violet S. Everett.\u201dThe first impression left upon Aileen was unimaginably shocking.This person was not someone who just deserved to be loved.She\u2019s\u00a0bound\u00a0to be loved.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m so happy! I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201dThe small, insignificant world wherein Aileen lived collapsed that very day.Until that moment, she did not know that it was already starting, but this was when she became aware of her inferiority complex.She did not even know what this inferiority complex was at first, and so, she admired the older girl in the beginning.That girl was someone who lived proudly with the noble and dignified appearance\u2014that Aileen could never have.But then, since when was it.\u201cMilady, you should have been the Ducal Lady\u2026\u201dThat\u2019s supposed to be my place\u2026\u201cMy poor daughter.

The love you\u2019re receiving, the attention you\u2019re getting, the position that you have.\u2018Everything\u2019s supposed to be mine.\u2019It was unknown when exactly this twisted notion had taken place in her mind, but gradually, that idea grew in size.The splendid life of a ducal lady. The variety of dishes on the fancy dinner table. Those luxurious dresses. The fact that she could get all the jewelry that she wanted, the fact that people had no choice but to admire her.That place is supposed to be mine.That place must be mine.This was the faithful day that the beloved child had lost everything.\u201cFrom now on, you\u2019re my family, too.\u201dThe child had to learn to survive in the unfamiliar world she had been thrusted into.Even if the method she had chosen was wrong.* * *The wheels of the carriage continued rolling.It\u2019s true that they had used the warp gate, but the gate itself wasn\u2019t situated in the capital, so they had to go the long way by carriage some distance more until they could reach their destination.Some distance away, the escort knights were on horseback as they guarded the entourage.Roen looked over at Violet, who looked a little pale due to the side effects of going through the warp gate. A little awkwardly, he asked if she was doing alright, but the only answer he received was a cold look.Alone together in that carriage, the two of them were silent.Violet was looking out the window blankly, resting her chin on one hand. Meanwhile, Roen could only cough in vain, unable to dissipate the awkwardness between them.The time they had together was uncomfortable. In Violet\u2019s perspective, Roen\u2019s self-conscious disposition reminded her of a puppy that needed to go potty.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe silence between them stretched on for a long time. Back when they were at the ducal residence, Roen had looked for any excuse to talk to Violet at the annex whenever he was bored. Now, however, he could not alleviate the stifling atmosphere as they were all alone.Since it\u2019s come to this, why was he so dogged in his insistence to be closer to her? Violet inwardly clicked her tongue.Eventually defeated by the awkward silence, Roen was the first to surrender and speak up.\u201cViolet, to you\u2026\u201dHearing his low voice, Violet sat up and took her chin off her hand, then looked at Roen.He faced her purple eyes, but he soon avoided his gaze before continuing to speak.\u201cAll that time\u2026 Didn\u2019t it feel unfair to you?\u201dIn the end, the topic that he brought up was a tedious one.Violet mulled over the question. Should she answer or not?While thinking, Violet looked out the window, where the roads could be seen flitting by.\u201cEven if it felt unfair to me, what could I have done?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe answer rendered him speechless.Even more, Roen could not muster the courage to look at his younger sister.He had been much too harsh to an eight-year-old.Children were prone to fighting, but Violet ended up being responsible for everything. He had assumed that it was normal for Violet to be scolded.He thought that it was natural, even if she had only been eight.Realizing now that what he thought was normal was, in fact, not normal\u2026 How did it feel?\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already lost count how many times I\u2019ve heard the same apology.\u201d\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have thought it was normal. You were only eight years old then\u2014just eight years old and yet\u2026\u201dShe had also been a child who had lost her mother only two years ago at the time.All four siblings had lost their mother, but in particular, Violet and Cairn had still been too young.They should have been taken care of, but each member of the family had been drowning in their own sorrows that they couldn\u2019t think about other people\u2019s pain.No. At the very least, he should not have hurt her.\u201cWhy are you even apologizing to me?\u201dSuddenly, Violet looked away from the sky and asked this question. Roen could feel that her subdued gaze was directly leveled at him.\u201cAre you apologizing because you truly feel remorse for me, or are you apologizing only because you loathe to leave a stain on your otherwise faultless excellence, Young Lord?\u201d\u201cVee, you\u2026\u201d\u201cDo not call me by that name.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRoen shut himself up right away. Nevertheless, Violet continued speaking, slowly and indifferently.\u201cI don\u2019t quite understand, Young Lord. Just like Br\u2026 Just like Mikhail, wouldn\u2019t it be more convenient for you if you just continue pinning the blame on me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d\u201cIs it because you wish to relieve the guilt weighing down on you somewhat? Or is it because you don\u2019t want to leave a blemish on your perfection\u2026 Really, how can I know that your alleged feelings of remorse and your apologies are actually sincere?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cI am just\u2026 I am just the same as before. The wounds I had received as a child remain the same\u2026\u201dRoen had kept on repeating the same \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 until now like a machine, but hearing these words, he could not even say it again. Violet looked out the window once again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And, even more than that fool, Mikhail\u2014 To be honest, I believe that you\u2019re even more arrogant than he is. You\u2019re the kind of man who has to have everything in the palm of your hand, easily available so that you can do whatever you want with them. Isn\u2019t that so?\u201d\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t know you paid so much attention to me.\u201d\u201cYou seem to have changed overnight, so abruptly spewing apology after apology, but how can I believe any of your words? I\u2019ve suffered through the same thing for years.\u201dAs Violet steadily cleared her trembling voice, she remained silent for a short while before she continued again.\u201cAnd regardless whether I forgive you or not, I cannot believe anything that you say. The moment you judge that I am lacking, or the moment you regard me as someone unnecessary or useless\u2026 You might just change your attitude towards me like a simple flip of the coin.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThink about the notoriety that\u2019s been inscribed to my identity all these years. Beyond being Everett\u2019s wicked woman, isn\u2019t it that I\u2019m likely to be written down in the history books as the Empire\u2019s villainess of the century? Or perhaps it would be more likely that I\u2019d disappear completely after one final trip to the gallows?\u201dThe words were spoken as if in jest, but her voice remained calm and serious. As he was reflecting on the past, Roen chewed on his lips. Hadn\u2019t he shown such changeable behavior to Aileen just a short time ago?If a person could change his attitude easily twice before, couldn\u2019t it happen for a third time as well?Despite being shown such goodwill, it\u2019s impossible for Violet to accept it sweetly because the time that she had been hurt went on for far too long.Violet would not trust anyone easily. Especially her own family.Once abandoned, it\u2019s only natural for one to be afraid to form relationships.\u201cIt\u2019s not unreasonable for you to think so. But Violet\u2026 What I\u2019m saying is\u2026\u201dAs Roen had been listening to Violet in silence for a long time, he finally, gradually opened his lips to speak. A visible mark had been left on his lips as he had chewed them for that long.\u201cYou\u2019re my younger sister. Because we\u2019re family, that\u2019s why\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dTo push down the emotions that were threatening to burst out, Violet had to purse her lips tightly.Because they\u2019re family, he said. Blood was thicker than water, and they had that connection between them\u2014that\u2019s why.With such a relationship, family members were bound to be closer to each other than anyone else. But at the same time, they were also the same people who were vulnerable to wounds inflicted upon another, vulnerable to such contempt and scorn hurled at each other.Even now, the memories of Violet\u2019s childhood still lingered incessantly, affecting her life now.She pitied herself. She felt sorry for Violet because of the life she had to live. The extent of Violet\u2019s wickedness was directly proportional to how big her wounds were.Even now that their personalities had become mixed together, there were still times that she thought it was all her fault.\u201cPeople don\u2019t change so easily, Young Lord. You won\u2019t change, and I won\u2019t change. Just as my hatred will remain, so will your arrogance.\u201dForcing someone to accept an apology was also a form of violence. Roen kept saying that she didn\u2019t have to forgive him, but at the same time, he persistently tried to apologize to her anyway.None of this meant that the time in which she suffered would disappear.\u201cIt\u2019s not because I had to be perfect\u2026 Do you remember? When we were children, Elder Brother and I favored you completely and cared about you a lot. Cairn also said that he likes only his older sister.\u201dRoen\u2019s feeble voice continued.\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 Yes. Back then, I thought that it was because of me that my younger sister had gone down the wrong path, that\u2019s why I did all that. To be honest, I felt that it wasn\u2019t right, but because everyone kept acting the same way, I copied them and didn\u2019t try to find out the real reason behind everything\u2026 I had rationalized my actions and thought that it was for you, but in fact, all those actions just hurt you more\u2026\u201dViolet just listened to him without a word.\u201cWhat I did was nothing more than self-satisfaction\u2026\u201dAs Roen continued, his voice gradually became rougher. This all just sounded like a crude excuse\u2014and Roen himself was aware of this, too.He had believed that he wasn\u2019t a bad speaker. But now, as he was finding it increasingly difficult to continue speaking, Roen tried to smile, releasing a trembling exhale full of tension.\u201cThat\u2019s why, I\u2026 I truly am sorry. You\u2019re my younger sister\u2014 You\u2019re my real younger sister, but I\u2026 I know that you\u2019ll hate hearing this, but we\u2019re still family.\u201dListening to those words, Violet\u2019s hands clenched into fists. She was still looking out the window and so Roen didn\u2019t know what kind of expression she had on now, but he continued speaking with an awkward smile.\u201cI didn\u2019t know you knew me so well. And you said that I\u2019m arrogant\u2026 I didn\u2019t know that you didn\u2019t like such arrogance. It\u2019s difficult to believe, but I will try. I will try to make up for all the times that I hurt you, and\u2026\u201dHe trailed off.Roen thought that their father was an indecisive and weak man, but he was struck with the realization that he was the same.Violet did not answer. She just continued looking out the window.Rather than answering right away, she needed time to process what Roen just said.The silence that stretched between them was brief, but it felt like an eternity to Roen.And, finally\u2014\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dHe was given a short answer.Just a single word. Devoid of resentment, devoid of condemnation, and devoid of forgiveness.But Roen was certain.Even Violet would not forget the past, and even though her anger would remain\u2026\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s get along well from now on, Vee.\u201d\u201cI never granted you permission to call me by that name, Young Lord.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d\u2026This was a turning point in their relationship.As silence once again dawned upon the carriage, it finally reached the gates of the capital.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was forced to press a hand over her forehead, hard, at the onslaught of fatigue.Spending so much alone time in an enclosed space with a person you dislike was, to put it bluntly, mentally draining.The silence between them was beyond awkward. Roen tried to talk to Violet somehow, but he failed each and every time.\u201cWe finally arrived. It\u2019s been three years since you last visited Werchen, but what do you think?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same.\u201d\u201cShall we buy some snacks on the way? Or do you want to visit a famous salon\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m tired, so I just want to rest. If you wish to go, then you may do so alone.\u201d\u201cO-Okay\u2026 But I can\u2019t leave you alone, so hang in there even if you\u2019re tired. We\u2019ll reach the townhouse soon.\u201dRoen looked like a downcast puppy who\u2019s been refused a walk. Violet deliberately pretended not to notice.Everett\u2019s wicked woman, whose dispositional and social credibility were completely shot, was truly exhausted.Violet had some memories of the capital from when she went here for her debutante three years ago, and she could see the similarities of the past and current capital here.She closed her eyes briefly. It felt like she had come back here after twenty years, not three.Was it because of what happened with Mikhail?Violet couldn\u2019t brush aside the irritation that\u2019s been plaguing her along with this fatigue. As she walked slowly, the butler of the townhouse greeted them.\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting, Milady and Young Master.\u201dViolet could remember him, too. Not showing any emotions, the butler only guided them without any more words.Rumors of Violet being the villainess of the century was prevalent in the capital. Well, it was only recently that her reputation had gotten overturned, so her notoriety must still be prevalent in this place.Nevertheless, the butler showed no sign of acknowledgement about this.Was it like this three years ago as well? Violet caught herself being conscious of other people\u2019s reactions for no reason, and she let out a slow exhale.What Violet went through three years ago in the capital for her debutante\u2026 still remained to be a nightmare she did not want to remember.As she was a ducal lady of this country, there were only a handful of people who had the same status as hers. Subtle derision collapsed under the overpowering authority of her peerage, and those who talked behind her back could only envy her.However.\u201cWow! The capital\u2019s high society isn\u2019t so different from what we have in our estate!\u201dThe problem was this: the young Aileen had followed Violet.The fourteen-year-old Aileen had expressed her willingness to stay by her older sister\u2019s side no matter what. And because the duke cared more about the lovely second ducal lady more than anyone else, he respected Aileen\u2019s wishes.Although the girl didn\u2019t officially make her debut, she had been invited to join the capital\u2019s high society, and despite proper etiquette, Aileen had followed Violet everywhere she went.\u201cEveryone is so kind. I thought this was a scary place\u2026\u201dIf she thought this was a scary place, then she just shouldn\u2019t have followed Violet.Nevertheless, whether Violet was suppressing her boiling anger from within, Aileen remained bright.The young lords of the duchy had come to the capital as well to escort the ducal lady in her debutante, however they also cared only about Aileen. It was natural that Violet\u2019s hysterics had reached its peak.\u201cShe\u2019s the one from the rumors\u2026\u201d\u201cShh, be quiet. You\u2019ll be targeted, too!\u201dSome incidents flashed through her mind, but overall, she had a lot of repressed memories of that time. She didn\u2019t want to remember them.Violet quickly buried the memories of three years ago.Those in the capital simultaneously mocked and feared Violet, the villainess. But at the same time, they envied her as she was a high aristocrat.On the other hand, they praised treated Aileen preciously as she acted as if she was living in a flower garden. But at the same time, they mocked and laughed at her.\u2018That\u2019s why she whined so much about wanting to go back home early.\u2019From what Violet could recall, Aileen had cried every single day about wanting to return home as soon as Violet\u2019s debutante was over.Aileen was no fool\u2014it\u2019s impossible for her not to notice that she was a topic of ridicule to the people of the capital.And when Aileen was finally given permission to go back to the Everett Duchy, she cried and cried about how she wanted to go back with Violet. So, regardless of Violet\u2019s will, she also went back to the estate.There were some things that became clearer as she recalled them. Violet stopped lingering on those memories.They were all unpleasant anyway.The luggage they brought with them through the servants were only few as it was judged that it\u2019s better to bring their necessary belongings separately each time.The employees of the townhouse quickly carried their luggage inside.Roen offered a hand to Violet as a sign of wanting to escort her. Violet smirked and immediately rejected him.t/n: as it was scheduled, there will be a one-week hiatus~ updates will resume by next week. i\u2019ll try to resume updates earlier if possible, but as luck would have it, my laptop died on me just today T-T i translated the newest chapter through just my ipad, so it was a grueling process, hence why it took a while to finish. hopefully i\u2019ll get my laptop back from the service center by the time updates are scheduled to be back.hope you guys have a wonderful week ahead~!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even so, a wave of nostalgia hit Violet as she raised, but at that moment\u2014\u201cMilady!\u201dWith a loud voice, someone came running to her.It was a terribly rude act to appear in such a way in front of a high noble, even more so because the person who called Violet was of a significantly lower status.However, Violet did not reproach the maid for her self-indulgence. The only reaction Violet had was that of surprise.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHeavens, it\u2019s really you, Milady. A-Ack. I\u2019m so sorry!\u201dThe newcomer maid, after realizing her mistake, let out a gasp and stopped herself from talking.When the butler quietly gave her a look, the maid stepped back and maintained proper courtesy.Violet tried to recall who she was, but there was no name that came to mind.Still, Violet could remember this maid from before. Mikhail had scolded Violet at that time, making her cry, and the maid had come to her secretly with a snack. The maid was all grown up now.The girl back then, who consoled the young ducal lady and told her she did nothing wrong, still had a little of her old self now.Ten years had passed since then. Violet looked around the mansion again, marveling at the memory.She couldn\u2019t remember all of them, but she found a few familiar faces.There were also people who just did their job, harboring not a single grain of hostility or malice for her.Gauging Violet\u2019s response, Roen smiled softly.\u201cDo you like it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Like what?\u201dIt\u2019s not like she\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0know what exactly Roen had prepared, but she pretended not to have noticed anyway. Seeing his younger sister\u2019s coy reaction, Roen just laughed.\u201cI made sure that you\u2019d be as comfortable as possible with the people here. It would be awkward if they\u2019re frightened by your notoriety, right?\u201d\u201cYou did something useless.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019re not saying that you hate it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOf course, it\u2019s just that. She didn\u2019t say she hated it.But Violet was touched. It\u2019s an emotion as small as a fingernail, but nonetheless poignant.But she didn\u2019t want to answer honestly, so she just stayed quiet.Roen\u2019s eyes curved softly, knowing that her response was not a rejection....The attendant who was guiding the ducal lady\u2019s group quickly realized how tired Violet was, and so he recommended that she should rest.According to the itinerary, she was scheduled for a long tour around the mansion. However, Violet willingly accepted the attendant\u2019s suggestion.Soon, she was shown to a room that she had never been in before.Apparently, Roen had already decided to take Violet with him to the capital long before he even asked her about it, and he had ordered for a large-scale renovation of the townhouse to prepare for their arrival.Did he even have money left to have taken up such a project, really.Violet was about to comment on it, but considering the duchy\u2019s money, of course there would still be a lot left over.Roen chattered on about the townhouse\u2019s new studio and gallery, but he was promptly kicked out of the room.Violet was so exhausted that she couldn\u2019t even talk. This was another reason she diligently had to build her stamina.It\u2019s true that mental fatigue wasn\u2019t directly connected to physical fatigue, but her poor stamina was something she inwardly resented.All she wanted right here and now was to rest. Violet\u2019s wish was quite momentary.Violet brought with her only the barest of belongings, and since the trends changed quickly, she didn\u2019t bring much clothes. That\u2019s why her closet was empty right now.With a pleasant expression, Roen suggested to Violet that, after the long nap she\u2019d have now, she should get fitted for her new clothes.Violet had a hunch that if she were to go clothes shopping with that fellow, she\u2019d essentially just be a dress-up doll.\u201cI\u2019m not here to attend social events, so I don\u2019t need such clothes.\u201d\u201cBut Violet, you at least need a few dresses that follow the current trend\u2026\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll just buy clothes when I need them. I won\u2019t go out right now either way, so it\u2019ll just be a waste.\u201d\u201cBut the Crown Prince\u2019s birthday banquet is right around the corner next month?\u201d\u201c\u2026Do I\u00a0really\u00a0have to go?\u201d\u201cMmh, well attendance isn\u2019t mandatory per se\u2026 Unless the Imperial Family directly sends you an invitation.\u201d\u201cThen, I refuse to go. I\u2019m tired, so I want to take a rest now.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dRoen was sad to receive Violet\u2019s refusal. Surely she\u2019d have to get fitted for clothes sooner or later, but she had just gotten off a long carriage ride.Not wanting to be pestered any more, Violet let out a slow sigh.She had come to the capital now, but one after another, signs were cropping up that her life wouldn\u2019t change immediately. Perhaps there was nothing she could do about this.In the end, she was a ducal lady and, all the more, she was obligated to carry with her the status of her father and brothers.Socializing was terribly exhausting, and so she hated it.Whether it was an internal feud or a political fight, she didn\u2019t need to know. There were enough women out there who could be the flower of high society. It\u2019s just such a tiring thing.Thereafter, Violet decided not to do anything for a week straight.* * *Roen was a busy man. He was already busy before he came to the capital, and he became even busier the moment he stepped foot into this place.Since he had been named as the next duke, many people wanted to meet with him.That aside, he was originally a close friend of the crown prince, but he\u2019s been ignoring the crown prince\u2019s invitation because the prince was \u2018tiresome\u2019.As Roen had come to the capital, it\u2019s only natural that he was so busy.Inevitably, Roen could no longer ignore the invitations of the imperial family and the other noble households, and while Roen was away, numerous invitations arrived for Violet as well.t/n: my laptop survived, thank goodness!! there weren\u2019t any major problems, it was just being a drama queen\u00a0>.>Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sometimes, socializing was directly tied to politics, and more often than not, it was the same vice versa as well.What\u2019s there for Violet to do in high society when she\u2019s not even going to enter the wedding market?Whether those people wanted to follow her or to mock her, the people who sent invitations and were consequently rejected all began to talk about Violet behind her back.When the person directly involved was not in the room, all the people of the country would criticize and speak ill of them, even if said person was a daughter of a duke. Furthermore, she was someone who\u2019s notorious for being a villainess, so everyone chimed in with all the rebukes.There were some people who recalled Violet from three years ago, but they were totally unaware of the new rumors about Violet that were spreading throughout the Everett estate these days.Their curiosity about her grew more and more each day, and as such, all the rumors about her soon became strangely exaggerated.But Violet did not care. She knew that her name sometimes appeared in the papers or in some magazines, but she didn\u2019t care to explain herself.As she refused all invitations citing one excuse or another, Violet also didn\u2019t do any work.Whenever she was in front of a canvas these days, brush in hand, her head would just go blank.She could always just doodle without thinking about it much, but that would just be a waste of the canvas and the pain.It was a dreadful slump.She\u2019d rather shop around and buy clothes. As she was looking through a catalogue from a famous boutique, she suddenly closed it shut.It\u2019s only natural that the capital\u2019s trends in fashion were different from that of other territories.And the biggest shift in fashion since three years ago was the focus on looking slim. Women were expected to be heavily corseted just to make one\u2019s waist look thin.It\u2019s not only that. With all the focus on making one\u2019s body practically sculpted, a woman\u2019s bust was expected to be shaped and bound as well. Violet had not a single desire to be dressed in such a style, even if it was the trend.Naturally, the maids tried to dress Violet in those kinds of clothes, but the ducal lady staunchly refused.She heard that this trend had started about a year ago, when the flower of high society\u2014the young lady of the Tolofia County\u2014had dressed in a style that showed off her body.The anecdote was of no importance to Violet as she had no intention of entering high society.However, she couldn\u2019t continue for days and days with just the simple clothes she had brought with her from the Everett Duchy, so she\u2019d have to buy clothes someday. Eventually.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m bored.\u201dAlthough there were some problems here and there, Violet lived well in her own way.\u201cViolet.\u201d\u201cVee? Violet, my lovely younger sister.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m listening, so stop it with the disgusting nonsense.\u201dCalling the name of the ducal lady who was doing well enough on her own, the duke\u2019s heir laughed.As she did nothing but read the papers or some books from time to time, the ducal lady was the very image of an unemployed individual. Well, in the first place, Roen was the one who said that his younger sister could just do as she wished.\u201cNow that I think about it, I don\u2019t think there are many clothes that would suit you. Why don\u2019t we go out together and have you measured for custom pieces?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cVee?\u201d\u201cI was thinking about that just now. Sure I\u2019ll have to get fitted, but the capital\u2019s fashion trend right now is just so tacky.\u201d\u201cTacky?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s just a style that\u2019s been brought back from two hundred years ago. Even if that\u2019s the trend right now, it\u2019s just so unbelievable how women\u2019s bodies are being twisted so ridiculously like that.\u201d\u201cAh, I see.\u201dViolet was quite serious about this.Whenever she painted, she used the style of deforma often\u2014in art, it was to distort the subjects rather than portray them realistically. However, it was bizarre to see real people transforming their bodies just like that.\u201cWell, if you say so, then so be it.\u201dAs Roen had no clue about fashion whatsoever, he was convinced that it\u2019s just as she said.\u201cBut still, you can\u2019t wear the same clothes forever. If you don\u2019t mind, why don\u2019t you go out with me today? Get fitted for clothes that you want to wear.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you just make the clothes that you wear the new trend, then that\u2019s enough. Rather, there\u2019s a limit to the rumors that I could still keep under control, so it\u2019ll be better if you can get fitted for new clothes if possible.\u201d\u201cAm I an embarrassment to you, Brother?\u201d\u201cHuh, yeah?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m asking if you\u2019re ashamed of me because I\u2019m not following the trends and just wearing old clothes.\u201d\u201cHuuuh? No, that\u2019s not what I meant!\u201dFlustered for a while after that, it was only after he composed himself a little that he noticed the expression Violet had on her face, the one that she\u2019d make whenever she was teasing him. She only ever called him \u2018Brother\u2019 whenever she was teasing him mischievously.It was a title that meant she considered him to be family, but should he be happy about that, or should he be sad that she was calling him that in jest?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s fine for you to ignore all other invitations, but you\u2019ll have to attend this particular banquet.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cOr, you don\u2019t harbor any feelings for the Crown Prince, do you?\u201d\u201cNot at all, don\u2019t worry.\u201dThinking about all the times Roen had to gnash his teeth because of that dear friend of his, Roen showed a relieved smile.Looking at the way he smiled, Violet recalled the crown prince in her memories.Certainly, not attending the crown prince\u2019s birthday banquet wouldn\u2019t be wise, so countermeasures had to be taken.Violet nodded slowly.\u201cDo you have any work to do today, Young Lord?\u201d\u201cFortunately, I don\u2019t have anything scheduled today. There won\u2019t be any problem with me accompanying you for clothes and jewelry shopping.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dAs Violet\u2019s rumination grew longer, the glimmer of anticipation in Roen\u2019s eyes brightened further.However, Violet was actually thinking in depth about something else, not about going out to shop.The crown prince, the crown prince\u2026Rajaden Elifos K. Liddell. He was born in the same year as Roen, and he was the one and only legitimate prince, so he naturally became the crown prince.In Violet\u2019s memories, Rajaden was a more brilliant man than Roen, and a glaringly irritating smart ass.As his dark blond hair looked as if each strand was woven from rays of the golden sun, it shone under any light. And the likewise golden eyes beneath his hair would glint like a wild beast\u2019s.Her recollection of him wasn\u2019t very clear, but by far, the clearest features of his that she could remember were those arrogant golden eyes.She had danced with him during her debutante, and he had been beyond obnoxious.Because all her focus was on Aileen and how angry she had been with the girl at that time, Violet\u2019s memories from then were hazy.But there\u2019s one thing he said that she distinctly remembered.\u201cYou\u2019re quite like a poisonous rose, Lady.\u201dWhat a terrible memory.As Violet\u2019s expression twisted into a scowl, Roen looked nervous.Still frowning, Violet asked,\u201cDo I really have to go to something like that prince\u2019s birthday party?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019d be great if that\u2019s the case, but our family is part of the imperial faction, so we have to go.\u201d\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dRoen flinched once again as he heard Violet sighing.Violet really didn\u2019t want to see that detestable face, but she eventually answered in a tone that obviously expressed how forced she felt.\u201cWell, since I must go, now would be the perfect time for me to get fitted for clothes. If you\u2019re not doing anything now, let\u2019s get ready to go out right away.\u201d\u201cReally? Then, give me just a moment\u2026\u201dRoen\u2019s whole face was practically glowing. However, his enthusiasm soon withered when the butler intervened into the conversation between the siblings.\u201cPardon me, Young Master. His Highness the Crown Prince has sent you an official letter.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a direct summons. He\u2019s asking for you to come right now.\u201d\u201cNow?\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cReally, right\u00a0now?\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cTo the palace?\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dIn an instant, Roen looked like he was letting out a silent scream.Looking at him like this, Violet clicked her tongue. And as she didn\u2019t have any expectations in the first place, she clicked her tongue at Roen once more when he was half-dragged out of the room.The plan to go out together was on the brink of succeeding, but in the end, it collapsed just like that.There wouldn\u2019t be any problems anyway if she just went out to buy clothes by herself. But as she assumed a number of worst-case scenarios that might just happen, Violet canceled the outing altogether.She tried to go back to painting once more, but the brush just didn\u2019t feel right in her hand. She couldn\u2019t even think of a reason why she wanted to paint now.Was this a side effect from being comfortable? Should artists always be buried in depression to produce good work?Wandering through countless thoughts, Violet sighed.If Mary was here by her side, she would at least be able to spend time listening to the girl\u2019s chatter. Everything seemed so quiet while she wasn\u2019t here.On the other hand, the servants of the townhouse found Violet quite difficult.The servants who knew how she was when she was younger laughed at her behind her back, but they didn\u2019t dare to converse directly with her.As Violet thought about distancing herself from them, she stood up from her seat. It\u2019s been a week since she started doing nothing.Seeing that she was preparing to go out of the mansion, the maids immediately tried to force her into a corset, but they all failed.If something inconvenient were to happen while she\u2019s out shopping, couldn\u2019t she just stop for the day and return home right away?With how much he had been looking forward to going out together with Violet, Roen would definitely be crushed to hear about this. Anyway, Violet got ready for her trip.As for her clothes right now, she chose to wear comfortable clothes of the middle class.Since both Mary and Zylo had yet to come to the capital, the people who would be escorting her were made up of people she didn\u2019t know. The servants also politely tried to stop her from going out, but in the end, no one could go against the ducal lady\u2019s stubbornness.It didn\u2019t sound like a bad idea to see what the streets of the capital were like.If she\u2019s lucky, she might be able to find inspiration for a new art piece.\u2018I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s going to happen anyway.\u2019It was better to do something rather than spend time doing nothing.Violet\u2019s outing was terribly impulsive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Roen\u2019s complaints couldn\u2019t leave through his mouth, and so it was impossible to vent to the very person involved.\u201cHaha. My dear, one and only close friend. Look at your face, all wrinkled up like this. Is something wrong?\u201d\u201cWho do you think is to blame, Your Highness?\u201d\u201cNot quite sure. Have you missed having teatime with me that much?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRoen put on a nice and friendly smile. An oh-so-gentle smile was necessary when cursing someone out.\u201cYou\u2019ve taken the time to welcome me despite your hectic schedule, so I am at a loss for what to say, Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.\u201d\u201cAt ease now, at ease. Good grief, should I hear such stiff politeness from my dear friend?\u201d\u201cSo why did you call me when you\u2019re so busy?\u201d\u201cTut, tut. As soon as I said it, you really went for it. Gosh.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re being fickle, Your Highness.\u201dRoen just did as he was told, yet this was the result. In vain, he felt wronged.Moreover, of all things Roen was being served a kind of tea that he hated the most, so it was obvious that the crown prince was teasing him.\u201cDoesn\u2019t the tea smell positively fragrant? This tea has come from across the sea, and I heard it takes quite a pretty penny to acquire it. Only the best tea leaves are being served to the imperial family, so drink as much as you want.\u201d\u201cWhy did you call me here?\u201dUnable to endure further, Roen only repeated the same thing.And here, Roen wiped off the full smile on his face and showed only an expression of disapproval. Right then, the crown prince burst into laughter.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we last met each other, so can\u2019t I play a little prank? You and the members of the imperial family are such dreary people.\u201dAs much as he hated it though, this duke\u2019s heir couldn\u2019t do anything against this \u2018prank\u2019.\u201cWe\u2019re both busy people, Your Highness, but don\u2019t tell me that you\u2019ve summoned me here only for a cup of tea and a short break?\u201d\u201c\u2026You know, you scare me sometimes whenever you make that expression.\u201d\u201cOh, how could I dare do any harm to you, Your Highness the Crown Prince?\u201d\u201cI-I got it. You don\u2019t have to think that way because I called you here for a reason.\u201dWhen Roen smiled again, the crown prince\u2014while clicking his tongue\u2014eventually raised the white flag.The only reaction Roen had to this was to raise his teacup to his lips and take a sip. Then, with a calm look on his face, he set the cup down.The tea tasted even worse than the tea that Violet always served him.\u201cI thought it would be alright to catch up with you a little first since we\u2019re close friends. I mean, if you came to visit me earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have been left with no choice but to summon you through the imperial decree, now would I?\u201d\u201cI was busy.\u201d\u201cBusy schmissy. You completely forgot about me.\u201d\u201cI was busy.\u201d\u201cFine, fine, I got it. I was wrong.\u201dAs the man who was to become the country\u2019s monarch had given him an apology, Roen picked up a refreshment from the table, the corners of his lips tugging up to a soft smile.Seeing this, the crown prince clicked his tongue once again.\u201cDo you know that there are strange rumors about me going around?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not very interested in Your Highness.\u201dThe bold answer induced an incredulous look on the crown prince\u2019s face. They were close friends, but they weren\u2019t close enough to have a leisurely teatime together like this.\u201cThere\u2019s a false rumor going around that I like men.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cAnd the other party involved is none other than\u00a0you.\u00a0People whisper amongst themselves, \u2018Oh, so\u00a0that\u2019s\u00a0how it is between Prince Rajaden and Lord Everett.\u2019\u201d\u201cCough\u2014!\u201dThe abrupt mental damage caused Roen to gulp down his tea the wrong way, and this made him cough heavily. The coughing fit lasted for a while.Tsk.\u00a0Rajaden handed Roen a gold-trimmed handkerchief, but Roen refused.\u201cJust why\u2014 Of all the rumors\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s actually been a while since that rumor has been going around. It started back when we were at the academy, so it\u2019s been\u2026 about six years, I believe?\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s been a while since I was aware that you were taking advantage of that rumor. But I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re bringing it up now.\u201d\u201cOh, don\u2019t be sulky. I\u2019m not particularly interested in you in that way either.\u201dUnable to figure out the crown prince\u2019s intentions, Roen scowled unpleasantly.The crown prince had long since voiced out how he wanted Roen as an aide, announcing very loudly that he would make Roen the next prime minister, however what he\u2019s talking about now with him was far from this.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking of taking in a consort.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeees.\u201dNo, perhaps not far. It was a topic that was as close as close could get.Roen briefly cast a pitying look at the crown prince, who had no friends. So he called Roen here because he had no one else to talk with about his love life.Be that as it may, the pitying look was still endlessly cold.\u201cI see. Congratulations.\u201d\u201cGosh. Yes, it\u2019s something to celebrate. I\u2019m more than happy to hear that you\u2019re congratulating me.\u201d\u201cYeees\u2026\u201dRoen was giving the crown prince the same treatment that Violet gave himself. For a moment, he was struck with an earnest realization of why Violet tended to answer him with such half-heartedness.By nature, people who were at the top treated marriage as a political tool. The fate of the nation was, quite literally, at stake when it came to the crown prince\u2019s marriage, so it was a matter to be handled with utmost care.Roen briefly recalled the candidates for the crown prince\u2019s consort. If she had already been chosen, then it\u2019s impossible that Roen hadn\u2019t heard about it yet. So far, just the candidates had been decided.Then, an ominous feeling soon took over Roen.No. It can\u2019t be.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 - Peaches at DuskYonnee6-7 minutes\u00a020.06.2023Before Roen could even narrow his eyes, Rajaden took the lead.\u201cCome to think of it, I heard that you officially became the Duke\u2019s heir. I didn\u2019t know that you\u2019d suddenly be interested in succeeding the duchy\u2014is there any special reason?\u201d\u201cDid you plant a spy inside my family\u2019s residence?\u201d\u201cHow can there be a place in this empire that I can\u2019t reach?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs the crown prince very proudly admitted that he had planted a spy, Roen\u2019s expression soured right away.The thought crossed his mind that his disposition right now would mirror that of Violet. Of course, the Everetts had also planted spies within the imperial family\u2019s fence, but he felt wronged for no reason at all.\u201cRight. You were born a man, so it\u2019s only natural that you stand high and mighty at the peak at least once. Ah, but don\u2019t aim for the throne, yes? I don\u2019t wish to be faced with the sight of detestable treason during my reign.\u201d\u201cIn our current era, women also often inherit titles, but I understand that what Your Highness said just now was a mere slip of the tongue. And I will assume that last part was just a joke.\u201d\u201cHaha. My friend is truly strict. Well, it\u2019s not like the blood of the imperial family runs in your family\u2019s veins. Except for the case of the maternal side, of course.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since that lineage has been blurred. I don\u2019t even consider myself to be related to you, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cTsk. You\u2019re really no fun.\u201dThough with the predilection of uttering frightening comments in the tone of a joke, Rajaden just clicked his tongue again.Roen desperately wanted to hit that hateful face.\u201cBut really, what\u2019s gotten into you? Didn\u2019t you reject the position of finance minister because you didn\u2019t want anything to do with a position of power? It\u2019ll only give you more work, you said. Ah, right. Since you\u2019re already the duchy\u2019s successor anyway, what do you say about taking up the position of finance minister? There\u2019s no talent in this country\u2014none at all.\u201d\u201cI refuse. The empire is filled with human resources available to you, so please lean into your eye for people even more.\u201d\u201cTsk. No fun at all, you.\u201dRepeating the same thing to Roen, the crown prince took a sip of his tea.And Roen only sighed as he watched Rajaden pleasantly drinking the unpleasant beverage.\u201cSo then, what\u2019s the reason?\u201d\u201cSince Your Highness has already planted a spy in my home, you should already know the reason. I don\u2019t understand\u00a0your\u00a0reason for calling me here just to ask.\u201d\u201cI only know about it roughly. Wouldn\u2019t things be different if I heard about it directly from my dear friend?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s simple. It was decided that Mikhail, the eldest son, is not suitable to be the next duke. The decision wasn\u2019t only for the sake of the ducal estate, but the entire country as well.\u201d\u201cHow forthright of you to say that. Sir Mikhail\u2026 is quite the maverick, yes.\u201dFinally broaching the main topic, Rajaden propped his chin on one hand and laughed. It was against court etiquette, but Roen didn\u2019t point it out.Rajaden was, by nature, an arrogant person, mentioning things like the law or etiquette would clearly not apply to him.Now that Roen thought of it, Violet also deemed him to be arrogant.Even worse than Roen, Rajaden was an arrogant man who presented the appearance of both a tyrant and a wise ruler.\u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be good for a tyrant to hear complaints from his subjects?\u2019Briefly thinking about what attributes a monarch must have to be called a wise ruler, Roen set down his teacup. It still tasted terrible.\u201cStill, Sir Mikhail was a capable man, only that he tended to speak harshly,\u201d the crown prince continued. \u201cHis personality wasn\u2019t that bad, and he gave off quite an affable impression. What a shame. He was the perfect candidate for the position of knight commander.\u201d\u201cOnce again, it\u2019s a family matter. And besides, if a man who had raised his hand against a woman could be called a knight, then numerous knights all across the country would only weep.\u201dWhile Roen spoke calmly, Rahaden smiled satisfactorily as he took a piece of dessert into his mouth. Right then, Roen flinched very slightly as he caught his own mistake, but it was too late.\u201cSee? As expected, hearing directly from the person involved yields different results. He raised his hand against a woman, you say. But you know, when it comes to criminals, they don\u2019t need to be identified as man or woman. Since it would be considered as rightful punishment for an offense, isn\u2019t it that it shouldn\u2019t matter?\u201d\u201cThe fact that raised his hand was only because the other person is a criminal\u2014 is that what Your Highness is saying?\u201d\u201cWell, correct me if I\u2019m wrong.\u201d\u201c\u2026Mikhail truly wasn\u2019t fit to become the next duke. Not only was he always swayed by his own personal feelings, but he\u2019s also much too immersed in his own beliefs.\u201d\u201cSo you think that you\u2019re not?\u201d\u201cAs long as I am human, I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m perfect. Your Highness, what is it that you want to say?\u201d\u201cI just want to have an in-depth conversation with my close friend, is that so wrong? Haha, goodness. I didn\u2019t understand before, but Father once told me how entertaining he finds it to tease Duke Everett. The members of your family are fun to tease, really.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFaced with the reality of an unlucky relationship being passed down two generations, Roen sighed deeply. Rajaden just chuckled as he munched on more snacks.\u201cSo.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt all started with the ducal lady, so it\u2019s making me wonder what kind of person she is. You came to the capital with her, right? Your younger sister.\u201dRoen choked on his tea.Cough, huck\u2014 Cough, cough!At Rajaden\u2019s subsequent words, Roen coughed as though his throat had gotten blocked.The crown prince handed over a handkerchief.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If looks could kill, well.\u201cI would never have expected that you\u2019d cover for the notorious villainess of the rumors.\u201d\u201c\u2026What exactly is it that you want to say, Rajaden.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re finally dropping the formalities now?\u201dAs Roen was finally talking to Rajaden casually, the latter smiled. And seeing that unreadable smile, Roen scowled.Rajaden said, \u201cWhen I mentioned bringing in a consort earlier, remember that?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t really want to hear the end of that, so don\u2019t bother.\u201d\u201cThat younger sister of yours. Give her to me.\u201d\u201cAre you insane?\u201dCausing the noble and graceful young lord to utter such a curse, the crown prince looked at him with satisfaction.Roen smiled as well. It was the same smile that Rajaden had said was frightening.\u201cSuch an expression would really draw out a nightmare, you know.\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t you kindly be more proper so that I don\u2019t make this expression?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m not joking either. How come you\u2019re not asking me for my reason? About why I\u2019m saying this.\u201d\u201cEven if I come to know the reason, it\u2019s something that absolutely cannot happen. With all due respect, Your Highness, did you hit your head? After all these many years, the country is at the onset of doom.\u201d\u201cLet me tell you\u2014in this entire world, there are only two people who can treat me this badly. One of them is\u00a0you.\u201d\u201cWhat an honor.\u201dRoen emptied his teacup all at once.\u00a0I\u2019ve finished my tea, so goodbye.He was about to get up while saying that, but Rajaden made him stay, holding the taunt of an imperial order above the young duke\u2019s head.From the very beginning, the crown prince\u2019s objective was Violet. So, from the very beginning, this meeting was unjust.Roen glowered at his friend, whose demeanor practically screamed cunning smugness.With an arrogant look on his face, Rajaden beamed brightly.\u201cThere\u2019s a widespread rumor going around that the peerless Roen E. Everett had fallen at the feet of his younger sister. The esteemed daughter of House Everett had turned down all invitations from each and every household that sent them, while the Young Duke is putting up with such behavior.\u201dIf Roen were to just up and leave right now, he wondered what kind of imperial order Rajaden would make. Would it be along the lines of summary execution?Knowing what kind of thoughts were going on in Roen\u2019s head, Rajaden just smiled and continued speaking.\u201cI also know of Ducal Lady Aileen. It hasn\u2019t been long since her debut, and I hear that Sir Mikhail dotes on her especially.\u201dThe golden eyes resembling that of a beast glinted sharply.\u201cBut the ducal lady who\u2019s refusing all invitations is Ducal Lady Violet, who happens to be the rumored wicked woman of House Everett. And by the way, isn\u2019t it that you care more about your cousin, Ducal Lady Aileen? I remember those times in the academy when you showed her off quite a bit.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cInteresting, isn\u2019t it? Back then, just a mere mention of the silver-haired lady made your expression distort so much that it looked like a bone got stuck in your throat. But now, you\u2019ve completely fallen at her feet.\u201d\u201cSince you planted a spy, it truly seems like you know everything. But, Your Highness. I can\u2019t quite understand how this and the matter of the crown princess could possibly be connected.\u201d\u201cI wish to take Violet S. Everett as my consort, plain and simple.\u201d\u201cIs this with politics in mind?\u201d\u201cSomething like that. But I\u2019m also personally interested in her.\u201dThis was the problem when one\u2019s close friend was, at the end of the day, one\u2019s superior.Regardless of what he\u2019d say here, this was something concerning Violet, and she would have the final say. But even still, he contemplated whether he\u2019d be able to go against his superior\u2019s will.But really. It\u2019s impossible.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not all bad for you either.\u201d\u201cRejected.\u201d\u201cIs it because I haven\u2019t sent an official proposal yet? If that\u2019s the case\u2026\u201d\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\u201cWhy are you so adamant about refusing me?\u201dWhen Roen showed no signs of budging, Rajaden\u2019s expression finally cracked. With that smile gone, the crown prince scoffed at Roen discontentedly.In response, Roen merely stared back into that gaze, not touching any of the refreshments on the table. He remained completely calm.\u201cWhy did you call me here?\u201d\u201cHave you not heard anything I\u2019ve said until now?\u201d\u201cIf you want to propose to Violet, direct your proposal to her and ask for her opinion first. This isn\u2019t something that concerns me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s imperative to respect her opinion first and foremost.\u201dThough Roen continued to speak calmly, his expression had closed up like a resolute iron wall.Suddenly finding out the reason behind the rejection, Rajaden stared blankly at the person in front of him.\u00a0Tap, tap.\u00a0Chin perched on one palm, Rajaden used one finger to tap his chin for a moment.And with a perplexed tone, he asked his friend.\u201cLet me repeat that for you. It\u2019s not a bad idea for both you and your younger sister. The stigma on her as a \u2018villainess\u2019 doesn\u2019t matter either. And about the elders of the imperial family, rather than just being affable about it, they\u2019d even welcome this marriage with open arms.\u201dThen, Rajaden added.\u201cFurthermore, becoming part of the imperial family and leaving one\u2019s name in the history books can\u2019t ever be considered dishonorable.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat Rajaden\u2019s saying was not wrong.Perhaps this would be a good opportunity for both Violet and Roen.Violet had declared that she would not be wed, but it\u2019s unknown for how long their household would be able to protect the unmarried ducal lady.No matter how much he\u2019d try to think it through, it\u2019s clear as day that the crown prince was the most ideal groom.However\u2014\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since Your Highness has planted a spy in our home, you should know that she was only framed. It wasn\u2019t true that she was an older sister who only harasses her adoptive younger sister, and nor is she truly what people call her \u2018Everett\u2019s wicked woman\u2019.\u201dRoen explained one after another.\u201cAll this time, that child had endured years of humiliation for all the things she was unwarrantedly blamed for. In the middle of suffocating throughout all this, the only thing she barely asked for was to honor her wish of not getting married. If this wish would not be honored, she would undoubtedly leave this all behind and disappear.\u201d\u201cBut as far as I know, not all of her actions were false charges\u2026\u201d\u201cHer reputation has changed now, but I don\u2019t know how things will turn out. She is still notoriously known as a \u2018villainess\u2019 here in the capital, but if she becomes a member of the imperial family\u2026 No, even if she won\u2019t become part of the imperial family\u2014 Even if she is taken in as a bride in any other noble household, she will still suffer from all those sharp gazes and negative rumors. If she is to be married, I won\u2019t be able to protect her.\u201d\u201cStill, even within your own household, she doesn\u2019t seem to be free from all the gazes and rumors you speak of.\u201d\u201c\u2026If possible, I only wish for her to act however she wants.\u201dAs Roen was explaining calmly, Rajaden tried to interrupt him. However, Roen firmly continued speaking his mind.In any case, as Roen managed to convey all that he wanted to convey, Rajaden soon understood.\u201cAnyway, I quite understand what you\u2019re trying to say.\u201d\u201cThen\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be sending a formal proposal.\u201d\u201cDid you or did you not understand a single word I said just now?\u201dRajaden gave Roen a stunning smile. All Roen wanted right now was for this damn crown prince to direct that smile not on him, but on the young ladies who tend to flock around him.\u201cThat\u2019s why I want her to be my consort. She\u2019s a ducal lady who, despite all false accusations, just wishes to be left alone. She has the ability to reverse her notoriety, and she even managed to get you on her side. I also know the first ducal lady of House Everett because we\u2019ve met before. Contrary to the rumors, she\u2019s got quite the elegant image.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThe imperial family attracts quite a few jackals. If one of those jackals takes hold of even a single member of the imperial family, that jackal would not anymore know its place and would proceed to go wild. In that respect, isn\u2019t the esteemed daughter of House Everett the perfect candidate with her ability to control the people below her?\u201d\u201c\u2026No, she\u2019s not as outstanding as you paint her out to be.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re disparaging your younger sister too much now. Really, my proposal isn\u2019t that out of the blue.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThough their interests once intersected, they now drew two parallel lines.Roen was firm in his conviction that this was not the way to go, but Rajaden continued to insist that it was.Not knowing why the crown prince was so persistent about this, Roen looked at the guy with annoyance.\u201cSo, you\u2019re telling me to put Violet in the loneliest throne just because she is the most worthy of the title of your consort.\u201d\u201cWhile it is the loneliest, it is also the throne that holds the highest power.\u201d\u201cThere is no way that she wishes to attain that power.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think so? I know that there aren\u2019t many young ladies who can be deemed worthy as the next empress, but there won\u2019t be many of them who\u2019ll reject the position either.\u201d\u201cIf she truly wishes to have power, then she will have taken the duke\u2019s seat, not the empress\u2019s throne.\u201dIt was an undeniable fact. The current Duke Everett had a particularly soft spot for his daughter, so if Violet were to mention that she wanted to become the next duke, then he would have willingly given her the position.Rajaden could understand what his friend was saying, but it was not enough to break his obstinately one-track mind.\u201cBecoming the empress or the duke are two separate things. Are you worried because the imperial family is full of jackals roaming around? There are a lot of old fogeys who wish to make their daughters my consort. However, I have no intention of bringing in a wife who\u2019s no different from an outsider\u2019s puppet. I don\u2019t want to take in any concubines either. It\u2019s not good to see the imperial family\u2019s blood being spilled elsewhere for no reason.\u201d\u201cRajaden.\u201d\u201cYou know about that, don\u2019t you? Back when the empress dowager of a few generations ago had seized the country. Or, that time when emperors of the old killed off all their siblings and their own fathers just to take the throne. Such incidents frequently appear in our history books. That\u2019s why, currently, my father has taken such actions.\u201dIt was for this reason that the current emperor had taken in only one empress, and they sired only one crown prince and one imperial princess.Rajaden also had a full mind to follow after his father\u2019s example.\u201cEven if I can\u2019t give her my love, I can be a good husband. I can even pretend to love her, if that\u2019s what she wants.\u201d\u201cRajaden!\u201dRight now, all she wanted was to stop everything and just live a normal, comfortable life. All she wanted was to be happy.As Violet\u2019s eyes flashed before Roen\u2019s gaze, he glared at the golden eyes of the crown prince.Green eyes met with those golden eyes that resembled that of a beast.\u201cI\u2014\u201dIt hadn\u2019t been that long since Roen had admitted his guilt and had apologized to his younger sister.\u201cI don\u2019t want to incur any more sins against her.\u201d\u201cThat answer is no fun at all.\u201d\u201cI will pretend I didn\u2019t hear about any of this. Please note that even if you send a formal proposal letter, it shall be returned to the sender.\u201dThank you for the tea.Roen got up from his seat on his own despite the crown prince not giving a go-ahead. Seeing this, Rajaden clicked his tongue.It\u2019s not as if Rajaden didn\u2019t expect to get this reaction at all, but he was nonetheless surprised to receive such a staunch refusal. In all honesty, he was quite taken aback.\u201cIn that case\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThis means that Her Ladyship can give me\u00a0her\u00a0permission, yes?\u201dRoen was almost out the door at this point, but the moment he heard the crown prince\u2019s words, he stopped in his tracks.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Perhaps it\u2019s because of the implicit understanding that Roen\u2019s orders took precedence over any of Violet\u2019s.With this in mind, there were some employees who tried to dissuade Violet from going out. However, they came out of this exchange defeated, taken aback by how much more persistent she was than they could have expected.Violet did not care about their shock, however. On the other hand, the few who still remember how Violet acted when she was a child could only shake their heads and murmur to themselves, \u201cOf course, of course. Our young miss is still the same.\u201dNow outside due to her own whim, Violet\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s still no fun at all.\u201d\u2026was feeling lonely again.The escort knights who came to accompany her remained at a certain distance, refusing to come any closer.Of course, as they had an employer-employee relationship, it\u2019s only right that they shouldn\u2019t be too close to each other. On the contrary, things were just strange back in the Everett estate.Feeling a rush of loneliness catching up to her, Violet sighed quietly.While the employees here didn\u2019t mock her, it\u2019s not as if they\u2019re going out of their way to speak to her with kindness.It\u2019s an employer-employee relationship, so of course\u2014what should she expect? Nevertheless, she felt regretful about it for no reason.And with this came the realization that she had become attached to the members of the annex.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe relationships that Violet had formed thus far were few and far in between, and because of this, it\u2019s natural that there were only a few people who she actually got along with.She was known to most as the high-nosed ducal lady who relentlessly stomped down and controlled all the people around her. It was inevitable that those same people now regarded her with wariness and exhaustion.There were also times when even the people who had stayed with Violet for a long time would turn around and start pointing their fingers at her, saying that she was an irredeemable villainess. It\u2019s for this reason that Violet had no substantial human connections.But what could she do about something that\u2019s out of her hands?Inwardly muttering this excuse to herself, Violet shook her head.Tired when surrounded, yet lonely when without. What a pair.But regardless, she\u2019d only be terribly tired if she were to be invited to a high society event.Since it\u2019s like this, it would be better if\u00a0she\u00a0was the one sending invitations to other people so that\u00a0they\u00a0would come to\u00a0her.\u00a0Besides, there were many nobles who wished to strengthen their ties with House Everett.It\u2019s just that Violet wasn\u2019t really inclined to do something like that, and the problem lay with Violet finding it difficult to get what she wants and establish close relationships in such a manner.\u2018I just wish there\u2019s someone beside me who I\u2019m sure is on my side.\u2019Rather, the people who she could consider as \u2018her people\u2019 were still on their way to the capital, so as of the moment, she was just being seen as isolated.Although, there\u2019s a difference from her circumstances then and now\u2014anytime she wanted, she could get out of the invisible walls of this isolation.\u201cBuy our apples! Fresh apples~!\u201dMaking her way down the lively streets of the marketplace, Violet let out a slow exhale.Truthfully, the fact that she wasn\u2019t very acquainted with the people in high society was brought upon her own sense of disconnect from this time period.Peerage, status disparity, the impoverished, the slaves, the imperial family.Whenever she\u2019d get overwhelmed by how strange these all were, she would go out to the crowded streets and feel all the life around her. Listening to their conversations was much better than whatever she\u2019d hear at parties or banquets filled with aristocrats.\u201cDid you hear? This time, His Highness the Crown Prince\u2026\u201d\u201cDangit, you rascal. Say something that makes sense, will you?\u201d\u201cIt\u00a0does\u00a0make sense though?\u201dBut regardless of whether Violet felt a sense of disconnect or not, at the end of the day, this was still the human world.Quietly listening to the rumors floating across the streets, Violet silently chucked to herself.\u201cThere\u2019s a rumor that a war\u2019s brewing.\u201d\u201cDo you have your head in the clouds or something? Just finish your work, will you.\u201d\u201cNo but, listen! You remember my cousin who lives at the Blaise estate, right?\u201dThe rumor she heard just now was random.\u2018Blaise, huh. I\u2019ve heard of it before.\u2019Feeling as though she was just on the verge of remembering something, Violet frowned slightly.The atmosphere in the capital was quite different from that of the Everett estate. It was quieter here in the capital, but there was a certain air of sophistication here. Though cold, it somehow felt mild.\u2018I never thought of the Everett estate as my hometown.\u2019Violet briefly wondered if the place she considered her hometown was a rural area.Still, compared to the capital\u2019s vibrancy, everywhere else would be considered rural. It was a meaningless concern.\u201cExtra, extra! Read all about it! We\u2019ve got the latest interview with the capital\u2019s popular celebrity! Get your copy of the magazine here!\u201dWhile looking around for a long time, one particular child caught her attention. With a bag full of magazines to be sold, the boy seemed to be good at selling them.\u201cBut that looks kind of heavy.\u201dOut of earshot, Violet murmured.He looked even younger than Mary. Curious, Violet approached the boy.But just the sight of the elegant Violet jolted the boy with shock.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A-And please speak comfortably!\u201dViolet was very obviously a noble, and the boy gasped, surprised that she was speaking respectfully towards him. It\u2019s so strange to hear someone so high above him speak formally like this.However, Violet herself spoke in this manner as a sign of respect towards the other person. She frowned slightly.After asking the boy how much a copy would cost, she gave him more than the said amount. Well, it was the smallest unit of currency she had on hand, but she also felt bad because the boy wouldn\u2019t be able to sell all the magazines that had been dropped to the ground anymore.As he received the money, the boy\u2019s mouth gaped wide open. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to earn this much even if he had managed to sell all the magazines he had.Violet laughed inwardly. Somehow, this was the type of clich\u00e9d scene that might appear in a novel.The capital had good security in place, so she didn\u2019t have to worry about the boy losing this money on his way back.Or, he might just return the gold coin to the magazine publisher and receive his wage there. Either way, it\u2019s not any of Violet\u2019s business.As this all happened, the passers-by on the street paid no attention to them. This moderate indifference was characteristic of Werchen.Settling down at a comfortable place where she could read the magazine, Violet\u2019s expression immediately soured. In turn, as the escort guards saw that the esteemed daughter of their duchy was sitting on a bench where only commoners sat, they frowned as well.Violet read through the whole magazine.It just so happened that this magazine she bought was a special edition on House Everett. Of course, this included a scoop on \u2018Violet S. Everett\u2019.She had just bought this magazine out of nowhere, but Violet could neither smile nor cry about it. She just looked at it blankly.As it turned out, the boy had been so surprised to see her because she was the main topic of the magazine he was selling.The camera had already been invented in this time period, but it wasn\u2019t yet advanced, and it was very expensive to take even a single picture. Violet\u2019s image, as it was displayed in the tabloid, was not quite a picture. It\u2019s more like someone\u2019s interpretation of how she looked.Was this what a fairytale\u2019s witch looked like? Beautiful, but filled with glacier-like coldness and ferocity of the severest kind. Feeling uncomfortable, Violet looked up at the sky.\u2018Do I look like this?\u2019This momentary concern flashed across her mind. Although she looked vicious, the image conveyed a certain beauty that\u2019s typical of a crafted sculpture. This was partly the reason that the rumors about Violet were spreading in the capital.There were various things written about House Everett in the articles.The scandal of the former duke\u2019s heir, Mikhail. The expulsion of Aileen.About the latter, it should have just been written that Aileen had been sent to study abroad, but instead the article wrote, \u2018In the end, Everett\u2019s angel was banished from the Empire due to the evil sorcery of Violet, the wicked woman.\u2019Besides those things, it\u2019s also mentioned how Roen became the new duke\u2019s heir, and how\u00a0that\u00a0Violet was dominating Werchen.Violet herself read about how she apparently became the flower of high society and was dominating over all the nobles. She clicked her tongue.This magazine\u2019s articles were full of pure lies.The most shocking part was reading about an interview with her that she never did.Unable to bear reading the words that\u00a0she\u00a0allegedly spoke, Violet clapped the magazine shut.\u2018I\u2019ll have to tell Roen to sue these people later.\u2019What about this was believable? How dare those people write such lies. Did they go ahead and write this because they think that, if they were to be sued, only House Everett\u2019s image would go down the drain?Violet realized why the boy looked at her with such fear in his eyes. He might lose his job.That\u2019s understandable. But of course, it\u2019s none of Violet\u2019s business.Intending to keep this magazine as evidence, Violet handed it over to one of the escort knights, then she looked up at the sky.Out of curiosity, the knight opened the magazine. He stared alternately between the magazine and Violet, a look of disbelief on his face.* * *The people in the capital were generally indifferent to others, but they still sometimes glanced towards Violet.Was it because of her silver hair and purple eyes? Silver hair was not common.But Violet didn\u2019t care about their gazes\u2014she just proceeded to stuff her face with street food. The escort knights made a huge fuss about checking first whether there\u2019s poison in the food, but Violet just responded to this by stuffing\u00a0their\u00a0faces with street food as well. They\u2019re her accomplices now.For a duke\u2019s daughter, she wore only simple clothes and was quite easy-going. However, it\u2019s still not enough to disguise her as a mere rich commoner; each action and gesture that she made undoubtedly exuded grace and elegance.Still, people simply thought that she\u00a0just\u00a0looked like the famous Ducal Lady Everett.Buying some fruit on the street and taking a bite out of it, Violet grimaced sharply. It\u2019s terribly sour because it wasn\u2019t ripe yet.Thinking that she had been poisoned, the knights kicked up another huge fuss. But just as before, Violet just stuffed the sour fruit into a knight\u2019s mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She also noticed that there was an art exhibition schedule posted.Walking through the streets, she found a painter\u2019s studio, she looked through various art supplies at the studio.But then, she suddenly stopped.She was hit with the realization that this was usually what a novel\u2019s female lead would usually do\u2014walking around the marketplace and all.\u201cShould I just go back now?\u201dWerchen was a well-governed city and the streets were clean. There was no need to worry about the people\u2019s security either because there were many guards going around on patrol.There\u2019s this clich\u00e9 where the female lead, who had just come up from the countryside recently, would meet a thug or something.Though the probability of that happening to Violet seemed low.With a smirk on her lips, Violet recalled the contents of the novel she had recently read while she was killing time in the past week.She didn\u2019t sneak out to go on this outing, and she also brought with her escort knights.So, what could possibly happen?\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBut in the end, something\u00a0did\u00a0happen.Walking down the street a little more, more people started coming out and she ended up getting separated from her knights. When Violet realized that she was now alone, the sun was already about to set.And as if to rub salt on the wound, Violet got herself even more lost as she was now just staring at a brook in front of her. It\u2019s only natural that Violet\u2019s starting to get more anxious.\u201cWhere am I?\u201dDid she go around without a care to the world far too much?Violet had been excited to go out for the first time in a long while, but now that she was here, she carefully gauged her situation.Breathing slowly, Violet thought about the tears that the escort knights must be shedding now.She wasn\u2019t bad with directions per se, but it was quite a serious predicament to get lost in a place where everything and everyone was unfamiliar.Should she ask someone for directions?Thinking about all the nagging that Roen was bound to give her, Violet pressed down on her temples.Roen would surely hold an inquisition as to why she had herself gotten lost.Fortunately, she bought a bunch of strange knick knacks earlier. She\u2019d be able to distract him with those gifts. If that might fail, then the last resort would be to say that she got lost while buying gifts for him.While Violet was contemplating, a gruff voice spoke from behind her.\u201cHiya, miss. Are you lost?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cGood grief, you\u2019re obviously an honorable noble lady, aren\u2019t \u2018cha? What do you say, should I show you the way?\u201dWithout even having the chance to ask for directions anymore, Violet found herself in this new conundrum.Facing the slightly rough-looking men and observing them, Violet nodded slowly.\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you could show me the way. If you need it, I shall compensate you handsomely.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great! We can be very good guides, y\u2019know. Where do you need to go?\u201dThey seemed much too sincere to be thugs, but they also looked much too hoodlum-like to be good, normal citizens. Yet here they were, claiming to be guides.Perhaps it\u2019s because they could feel that it wouldn\u2019t be wise to mess with her. Violet now showed a domineering attitude that one wouldn\u2019t ordinarily see every day.She thought that a situation like this would appear only in novels.The hoodlum-like young men approached Violet with smiles on their faces.\u201cBut may I ask, about how much is the reward?\u201dAs Violet was mulling over whether she could trust these guys, someone broke in between them.\u201cHuh? You had compan\u2014 urk!\u201d\u201cW-Who are you!\u201dIt\u2019s a black-haired man who she was meeting for the first time. Out of nowhere, he quickly overpowered the others.His form wasn\u2019t ordinary, so it was obvious that he had formally learned how to wield the sword.Violet also noticed the mark of the imperial family emblazoned on his cloak. He must be part of the imperial guard.\u201cI heard that there have been several incidents of violence, extortion and robbery around here. I\u2019ll let you off today, so just leave.\u201d\u201cI asked you who you are!\u201d\u201cW-Wait! Look at his cloak! That guy\u2019s a knight! An imperial knight!\u201d\u201cW-What?!\u201d\u201cAaack, run!\u201dViolet stared blankly as the scene unfolded right before her. Somehow, the dialogue here felt quite contrived.It\u2019s as if she was watching a theater play. It was just too contrived and unrealistic. It\u2019s as if the romance novel she read before was being presented now as a live performance.\u201cAre you hurt in any way?\u201dWhile she was thinking as such, the hoodlums ran away in a panic, and the black-haired knight turned to speak to her.Violet shook her head slowly.\u201cI\u2019ve received your help, haven\u2019t I?\u201d\u201c\u2026Um.\u201dThough the man had a large physique, his face looked surprisingly young. Was he about the same age as Cairn?Reminded of her younger brother for a moment, Violet couldn\u2019t help but grimace. And when the knight saw her change of expression, the black-haired knight looked perplexed.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA subtle exchange ensued.Did he have something to say to her? Was there something he needed from her? Since he\u2019s an imperial knight, even a probationary knight wouldn\u2019t possibly have a low wage though.The young knight opened and closed his mouth a few times, not saying anything for a while. Violet tilted her head to the side, perplexed as well.\u201cDo you\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cDo you not remember me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Looking into his pale lavender eyes, not unlike her own purple eyes, Violet asked.\u201cWhere did we meet?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOnce Violet asked this, he fell silent, and his expression changed more and more by the second.He now looked so forlorn that Violet was almost about to apologize for not remembering him.\u201cNo, if you don\u2019t remember, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou seem to be lost, but if you don\u2019t mind, may I escort you?\u201d\u201cEscort?\u201d\u201cAh, I-I mean. I\u2019m not a suspicious person.\u201dThe embarrassed knight scrambled to get something out of his inner coat pocket. Violet just said that she already knew he was a knight.Feeling awkward, he coughed briefly. He showed her his identification card, and it said there that his name was \u2018Aldin\u2019 and he belonged to the First Imperial Order of the Black Wolf.Violet wondered where she might have met him before. She rummaged through her memories.He was tall and had a robust physique, but his face was still young. His dark hair was reflecting the sunset\u2019s red hue, and, somehow, his lavender eyes contained within them the rain[1].\u2018I think I can remember him.\u2019Lavender eyes, not unlike Violet\u2019s purple eyes. Somewhere in her memories, she could remember them vaguely.However, she couldn\u2019t pull out the exact memory.\u201c\u2026If it\u2019s alright with you, then please. I\u2019m in your care.\u201dShe knew the look in his eyes.Those eyes, like serene lakes\u2014horribly subdued.Not knowing why, Violet suddenly felt awkward about staring at him. Her gaze slipped down.\u201cPlease speak comfortably, Ducal Lady.\u201d\u201cDo you know me?\u201d\u201cEveryone knows that the esteemed daughter of House Everett has come to the capital.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m asking if you know me personally. And I wish to ask as well about what you meant when you asked me if I don\u2019t remember you.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t remember, you don\u2019t have to force yourself to remember. It was just a passing encounter.\u201dThough Violet asked him straightforwardly, Aldin replied boldly as well.Surely if he was someone who was in Violet\u2019s memories, Aldin\u2019s standing couldn\u2019t be ordinary.\u201cSir Aldin, you\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re very tall.\u201dAs Violet spoke first, she eventually trailed off and avoided looking at him. It was awkward.When Violet was silent for a moment, Aldin felt a bit nervous because he didn\u2019t know what she was about to say. But when she finally spoke again, he relaxed for a moment.\u2018His is a face that I\u2019d definitely remember.\u2019Violet was once again left to her own thoughts as they continued walking forward, and she could only wonder if her memory was this bad.The man seemed to be accustomed to guarding people. Violet had a hunch that this fellow might have a high position, too.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhile their surroundings gradually changed as they walked down the streets, the two of them couldn\u2019t easily open their lips to speak again.Is he just curt?\u00a0Violet thought. Trying to gauge the man in front of her with narrowed eyes, Violet caught sight of her long-lost escort knights running straight to her. They looked frightened out of their wits.\u201cYou\u2014 Who are you!\u201dThen, they pointed their swords at Aldin.Violet was rendered speechless by the dumbfounding situation. It\u2019s as if Aldin had saved the escort knights from drowning, but here they were, asking where their lost bags were.But regardless of her reaction, the confrontation between the escort knights and the imperial knight continued.\u201cYour name, I asked! And state your affiliation!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWas his mouth glued or something?Glancing once at the man who wouldn\u2019t say anything even as several swords were mere inches away from his throat.\u201cHe is a knight of the imperial guard and he\u2019s the one who helped me when I was in trouble. Even if you don\u2019t have any manners, can you please refrain from being rude?\u201dIt was not until Violet said this that the knights fell back and returned sheathed their swords once again. What a funny turn of events.It could be said that this was Violet\u2019s fault for going around so freely, but it also made no sense for escort knights to lose track of the person they\u2019re supposed to be guarding.Regardless of how crowded it had been back then, it was their job to stay by her side no matter what.And yet, far from admitting their mistakes, it\u2019s laughable to see them pointing their swords at the person who saved their butts.These knights should undoubtedly be given more rigorous training the moment they\u2019d return to the townhouse.Still, Violet didn\u2019t want to add more to her notoriety. She would be handing over the task of scolding these knights to Roen.Anyway, it seemed like the knights still hadn\u2019t noticed the mark of the imperial family.Violet felt troubled by the apparent level of skill of her household\u2019s knights. Well, of course the imperial mark was on the cloak, which was on his back, and they were standing in front of Aldin. They wouldn\u2019t have seen it.\u201cAhem, ahem. Pardon me. If you don\u2019t mind, may I ask about your affiliation?\u201d\u201cThe Black Wolf.\u201d\u201cBlack Wolf? You mean, the first chivalric order?\u201d\u00b9 I couldn\u2019t quite capture the whole meaning of this word right here. Violet used the term \uc6b0\uc218, which could mean rain(fall), melancholy or excellence. The first meaning parallels how Violet\u2019s eyes are compared to lakes, so it somehow makes sense if Aldin\u2019s eyes are compared to the rain.Still, I\u2019m not sure which one of the three meanings Violet wanted to say. Or, perhaps she meant all of them.\u00a0\u21a9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She furtively gauged Aldin\u2019s reactions as she corrected her first impression of him.Just by the way he looked, he\u2019s clearly uncomfortable. That is, uncomfortable because of the situation itself.As Violet observed the man\u2019s cold expression, which she was seeing for the first time, she had more small doubts yet again.\u201cIn any case, thank you very much for aiding Her Ladyship. You\u2019ll be given a handsome reward.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHowever, the man did not care about the escort knight\u2019s words. Yet again, Violet had the same thought. It really was like some kind of skit\u2014both now and then, when they had faced the hoodlums.\u201cYou\u2019re Sir Aldin of the Black Wolf, so of course. If there\u2019s anything you want, we\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d\u201cNo thank you.\u201dThe man continued interacting with the knights as though he was a rock, but back when he was talking to Violet, he had been so cautious about opening the conversation. He had even looked quite resolute, too.Or perhaps it\u2019s just a case of being overly nervous? Violet mulled over that one relevant factor, being her notoriety. Knowledge of her misdeeds had become widespread enough that a person who she had barely met would most likely get nervous.\u201cIf it\u2019s alright with you, can we meet again later?\u201d Aldin asked.\u201cMeet again?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s too much\u2014\u201d\u201cAh. No, I was just surprised for a moment because you\u2019re not asking to be compensated right away. Is that really enough?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s enough.\u201dIn other words, Violet was asking if that was truly all he wanted from House Everett, yet his answer remained the same\u2014yes, it\u2019s enough to him.Hearing the man\u2019s answer, Violet thought to herself for a brief moment. She nodded.\u201cThen, I give you my word. Come and see me any time you want. I\u2019ll present to you any reward you wish to have at that time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThoroughly, Violet had misunderstood the man\u2019s intentions.At the conclusion that Violet reached, a hint of despair momentarily passed through the man\u2019s gaze. Looking at the man\u2019s subdued gaze, which so very resembled her own, Violet couldn\u2019t understand why the light in his eyes would waver like that whenever he gazed upon\u00a0her.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you then. I\u2019ll be off now.\u201dThis meeting between Violet and Aldin, the black-haired knight who\u2019s affiliated with the Order of the Black Wolf, was short.Afterwards, as they returned to the townhouse, it became an open secret that Violet was welcomed with Roen\u2019s persistent nagging, while the knights who had accompanied her not only had a salary cut, but also received punishment under the guise of \u2018extra training\u2019.* * *\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s\u00a0awkward.Inside the drawing room, no one at all spoke.Though Violet herself was somewhat aware of her own misgivings today, she didn\u2019t try to fill the silence with asinine pleasantries or useless excuses.\u201cRight, I heard that you went somewhere alone and got lost\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRoen opened the discussion with a calm smile pasted on his lips.This was the news that he received as soon as he got home. Before this, he had been looking forward to talking behind the crown prince\u2019s back with his younger sister.It\u2019s fortunate that Violet had returned home safely though, lest the entire capital would have been overturned.Either way, Violet felt wronged.\u201cI\u2019ve just been staying at home all this time, so I wanted to go outside and sightsee a little.\u201d\u201cThen you got lost. And even got separated with your escort knights.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dViolet continued to look Roen dead in the eye. Clearly, it was a gaze containing her protests, wordlessly insisting that it was all the escort knights\u2019 fault for not following her properly.But Roen dismissed her silent protests with a casual smile.\u201cIf you wanted to go out, why didn\u2019t you tell me? I would have gone with you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not your doll, Young Lord.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean, Violet.\u201dRoen sighed.Amongst everyone who was inside this drawing room, the only ones who were feeling suffocated by the tension of the two siblings\u2019 conversation were the maids waiting on them.\u201cDidn\u2019t we agree to go out to get you some clothes? I was expecting that we\u2019re going together.\u201d\u201cBy any chance, Young Lord.\u201dThere was a questioning look in Violet\u2019s eyes as she stared at Roen.\u201cAre you upset?\u201dCough.\u201cIsn\u2019t \u2018upset\u2019 too strong a word?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dViolet was incredulous.Roen wasn\u2019t upset that she nearly got in danger, just that she left him behind and did something on her own.\u201cI just went out to the streets for a little while. I didn\u2019t even stop by any boutiques.\u201d\u201cI heard you also ate street food without doubting the ingredients.\u201d\u201c\u2026Well.\u201d\u201cAnd you even fed your escort knights?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs the conversation progressed, Violet got increasingly speechless. He\u2019s seriously off the mark here.For a moment, she wondered whether or not she should point out that she only shoved the food into the escort knights\u2019 mouths, not necessarily feeding them.\u201cFine. Could you go with me when I buy some clothes later?\u201d\u201cOf course. If it\u2019s what my younger sister wishes.\u201dViolet clicked her tongue as Roen gave her a refreshing smile.In any case, after Violet \u2018offered\u2019 to go to the boutique with Roen for her clothes fitting, she just sighed openly. Roen paid her despondency no mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Besides, I really am worried about you.\u201d\u201cAh, sure\u2026\u201dRoen\u2019s endeavor at pretending to be close was a great burden.How could she possibly accept this easily? It hadn\u2019t been long since he had constantly ignored her and deceived her, yet now, all of a sudden, he was showing her such affection through these acts.Memories of the past were deeply engraved on her skin. Despite Roen\u2019s attempts at being close to her, Violet only felt more awkward with him because of how unfamiliar it all was.As the air in the drawing room was rid of its previous tension, the maids could finally breathe freely.Violet clicked her tongue once again.\u201cBy the way, Violet.

Looking at Roen, Violet tried to guess what kind of intentions he had behind that query.However, Roen\u2019s expression was so serious that Violet found herself answering him without realizing it.\u201cHe is the man who will shape the empire\u2019s future.\u201d\u201cOh? Then, are you interested in him in any way?\u201d\u201cWhat a dreadful thing to say.\u201d\u201cI knew it, you\u2019re not, right? That\u2019s a relief.\u201dOnce again, Violet started doubting Roen as she heard his somewhat vague answer.Facing each other calmly, this pair of brother and sister were blatantly casting aside the future sun of the empire who would lead the land into tomorrow.\u201cWhy do you ask all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cAh. I heard that the imperial family would like to send a formal proposal to you. I\u2019m not quite sure whether it\u2019s the imperial family as a whole who wants to take you in, or if it\u2019s just the personal wish of the crown prince.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cOf course, I turned the proposal down, but\u2014\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dStarting from when he mentioned that it might either be the imperial family or the crown prince who wanted her, the smile on Roen\u2019s lips became sharper.Violet, on the other hand, was still processing the bomb that he had just unleashed. She cut him off mid-sentence.\u201cSo you\u2019re saying, the imperial family\u2026 No, the crown prince wants\u00a0me\u00a0to be his consort?\u201d\u201cI think so? Just considering the fact that he summoned me there separately, it seems like you\u2019ve already been considered as a candidate for his bride.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why?\u201d\u201cWhat about?\u201d\u201cNo, I just don\u2019t understand. What\u2019s there to gain from taking me in as the crown prince\u2019s consort?\u201dViolet\u2019s question was reasonable. But at the same time, there was an obvious answer to that.Roen smiled at Violet.\u201cSometimes, I get sad whenever I see just how much you\u2019ve changed. For you to ask such a question, what exactly are you lacking?\u201d\u201c\u2026Young Lord.\u201d\u201cRight, to put it simply, it\u2019s a matter of politics. It\u2019s almost certain that the current crown prince will be ascending the throne.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHowever, he has many enemies. No, to be more precise, those in the aristocratic faction will constantly keep him in check, and they might somehow try to undermine him. And it\u2019s enough that the temple keeps him in check as well, so\u2014\u201d\u201cAnd what does that have to do with proposing to me?\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re an Everett, Violet S. Everett. And from two generations ago, our line of descent received the blood of the imperial family. Besides that, the power and influence of our household cannot be looked down upon. Even the household from which our mother came from\u2014\u201d\u201cCut it short and explain it directly. I\u2019m not asking you because I\u2019m completely blind of my own circumstances. I\u2019m just asking, why\u00a0me.\u201dRoen gave completely political reasons.However, Violet was asking why the crown prince wanted to marry the \u2018villainess\u2019 who was not well-received by the public.No matter how powerful House Everett was, the rumors would continue to follow her for as long as she\u2019s still stigmatized as a villainess.\u201c\u2026Well, the reason.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m honestly not sure, but perhaps it\u2019s because he\u2019s expecting that people won\u2019t be able to touch you because of the rumors of how vicious you are. If not that, maybe he\u2019s thinking that you\u2019ve created this fa\u00e7ade of a villainess and that you\u2019re not actually one.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat aside, both the duke\u2019s heir and the duke himself are on your side. And you\u2019ve sufficiently learned everything about Everett, to the extent that there would be no problem if you\u2019re to be named as the duke\u2019s heir instead of me.\u201dEven as there was not a single person on her side, Violet had proven that she could rise to the top with her skill alone.The crown prince wanted a consort who had both power and skill.Aileen was lovely, but unbearably weak. The throne of an empress could not be kept by someone who had merely \u2018goodness\u2019.\u201cCan\u2019t you just refuse?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t do anything that you don\u2019t agree with.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then just refuse, even if they send a formal proposal letter. I don\u2019t want it.\u201dAs if what popped out of Violet\u2019s lips was the answer he\u2019d been wanting to hear all this time, Roen beamed.\u201cHaha.\u00a0As expected, you don\u2019t like that snake, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cDisgusting scoundrel, that guy. He\u2019s the reason I don\u2019t like people whose intentions can\u2019t easily be read.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOne snake was speaking ill of another snake.Violet\u2019s eyes narrowed further. However, Roen didn\u2019t notice this.\u201cListen, Violet. You won\u2019t believe what I heard from that guy today!\u201dRegardless of her reaction though, Roen was obviously in high spirits as he told his younger sister about the conversation he had with the crown prince earlier today in detail.There was a trace of sadness in his expression as he told the story.But Violet wasn\u2019t fooled.As a human being who was good at hiding his true emotions like a snake, Roen\u2019s tone of voice and facial expression\u00a0must\u00a0be intentional.So, she smiled kindly.\u201cYoung Lord,\u00a0you\u2019re\u00a0disgusting.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now, he was looking at her sadly.Violet gave him an even more disgusted look.Seeing Roen be so fixated on their \u2018brother-sister bonding\u2019, Violet got up from her seat.In any case, it was a very peaceful day.* * *A few days later, Mary arrived at the townhouse. Some of the other employees came with Mary, and some of House Everett\u2019s knights came with Zylo as well.It was Mary\u2019s first time coming to the capital. Her eyes were all lit up, and she kept making a fuss while excitedly saying, \u201cThis is only the second time I\u2019ve left my hometown in my whole life!\u201dZylo wondered why she needed to be\u00a0this\u00a0excited when it was the second time after all.By the looks of his gaunt face, he was\u00a0very\u00a0tired.\u201cMilady!\u201dMary was, of course, given the position of Violet\u2019s personal maid. And, once again, Violet observed just how great Mary\u2019s socializing skills were that she couldn\u2019t say anything. The girl adjusted to her new environment very quickly.For a while, there was a subtle war of nerves between the existing employees of the townhouse and the employees who were newly joining.Between the pride of managing the household\u2019s mansion in the capital and the pride of managing the household\u2019s main mansion at the duchy, both were not to be taken lightly.Fortunately, however, the subtle war of nerves was quickly settled. It was all thanks to Violet\u2019s reception of Mary.The employees of the townhouse were stunned by the sight of Violet enjoyably listening to Mary\u2019s chatter.As they realized that Mary was Violet\u2019s favorite maid, they all saved themselves. There would be no benefit in butting heads with her for no reason.Thus, the atmosphere within the townhouse quickly mellowed out. This was perhaps because of Violet\u2019s treatment of the newly joined employees, or perhaps because they all knew that the ducal lady would not arbitrarily wield her authority whenever she wanted.Thanks to this, all of the employees no longer thought that Violet was someone from a different world as them.And Violet, who had absolutely nothing to do, started painting again.Instead of using the brush all the time, she sometimes used other mediums to scribble or draw some croquis so that her skill wouldn\u2019t fade.Her regular morning training with Zylo had also resumed. Zylo still felt regretful about how Violet\u2019s talent was being wasted, but Violet staunchly refused to train her swordsmanship in earnest.As the ducal lady consistently came to the drill hall early in the morning, training alongside her maid, Mary, all the knights in the drill hall were at a loss for words.Even if they tried not to mind her, it was a situation wherein they\u00a0couldn\u2019t\u00a0help\u00a0but be conscious of her. They all complained of what a headache it was.But still, Violet just clicked her tongue at the knights for being petty about her morning exercise.As expected, human beings should move their bodies. Violet\u2019s physical condition improved day by day, and some other people started to follow her example and started to exercise as well.Because Roen loathed moving his body, he could only watch the situation as it was unfolding.As their days passed peacefully, Roen called in a dressmaker.* * *\u201cIt is a great honor to be able to build your wardrobe, Lady Everett, esteemed daughter of the noble and magnificent ducal household~!\u201dViolet frowned as she listened to the dressmaker\u2019s ceaseless compliments. With as glib a tongue as that, it\u2019s as if he had thoroughly oiled his whole mouth. It should be known by everyone that Violet had a notorious reputation.\u201cThen, about the Laurent Boutique\u2019s clothes~\u201dThis time, the dressmaker\u2019s ceaseless bragging followed.The boutique that Roen chose was the best one in the capital, so it was surely worth bragging about. Even so, bragging about it this much seemed a step too far.For a long time, the drawing room they were in was filled with nothing but the dressmaker\u2019s recitation of the boutique\u2019s history and popularity, about what kind of dresses and designs of theirs had led the capital\u2019s trends thus far.To summarize, anyone who could book them and summon them to their manor should be very glad.Of course, as Violet heard this, her expression was far from\u00a0glad.\u201cSince Your Ladyship is tall, this design would be perfect!\u201dThe prideful dressmaker showed a design that he sketched in advance.He had only ever heard rumors about the ducal lady before this as today was his first time meeting her in person.So, while showing his designs to the ducal lady, he excitedly said, \u201cI thought that it would suit Your Ladyship better if I added more embellishments and changed this part over here!\u201dOf course, these words went through one ear and out the next with Violet.\u201cIs this a clown\u2019s costume?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cI asked if this is a clown\u2019s costume.\u201d\u201cWeeell,\u00a0ahaha.\u00a0I\u2019ll take it that you don\u2019t like this design?\u201dWhen Violet asked this question with a frown on her lips, the dressmaker felt himself sweating.Indeed, it was not an easy task to interact with the villainess of the rumors\u2014\u00a0This thought could practically be read on the dressmaker\u2019s forehead with the way he couldn\u2019t hide his expression.Violet\u2019s question could be considered rude, but actually, she was serious.Violet genuinely wondered whether the clothes that this dressmaker had designed for her were meant for a clown.The corset\u2019s obviously too tight just for the sake of making the chest and waist look more pronounced. There\u2019s also too much emphasis on the shoulders and the hips, and the frills are placed weirdly on the dress\u2026As a ducal lady who grew up surrounded by splendid extravagance, she was intuitively attracted to luxurious clothes. Even so, that didn\u2019t mean she preferred clothes that were excessively embellished with accessories and gems.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Next.\u201d\u201cAh,\u00a0hahaha\u2026\u00a0If not that, then this one. This design will most definitely accentuate Your Ladyship\u2019s charm\u2014\u201d\u201cHaving too many embellishments is worse than none at all. Next.\u201dViolet\u2019s demand was a bit tricky. Sitting on one side, Roen didn\u2019t know much about clothes, so he just watched.As the dressmaker couldn\u2019t stand it any longer, he burst out,\u201cYour Ladyship, it seems like my designs do not fit what you have in mind. Originally, a dress should highlight a woman\u2019s body in a way that fits the ideal, thus making it beautiful for everyone to see, but\u2026 it doesn\u2019t seem like Your Ladyship is satisfied with this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAt the dressmaker\u2019s nonsense, Violet just raised her chin once, a wordless gesture to make him continue speaking.So, the dressmaker opened his mouth once more.\u201cHere in Werchen, the style that women pursue is classical beauty\u2014a style in which one\u2019s natural beauty is even more enhanced as many colorful and eye-catching decorations are added. No one will be able to take their eyes off of such beauty!\u201dAfter that, the dressmaker went on another one of his long tirades about the Laurent Boutique\u2019s ideologies.Yet again, to summarize, Violet was like a country gal who just left the boonies and had just come to the capital. She did not know what\u2019s in vogue here at the empire\u2019s center, so the dressmaker\u2019s designs were in line with the ultimate standard of beauty.In the first place, this dressmaker was a man, and he was not the one who should decide what \u2018the ultimate standard of beauty\u2019 was for a woman\u2019s body.Violet frowned.She heard that the flower of the empire\u2019s high society was Lady Tolofia, but what exactly did she do to popularize a clown\u2019s costume?\u2018I think it\u2019s been a little less than three years.\u2019This was just Violet\u2019s opinion though. In fact, the designs of the Laurent Boutique weren\u2019t bad enough that they should be called clown costumes.\u201cSure, I can see what you mean.\u201d\u201cYour Ladyship! Then, as expected\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat you\u2019re saying now is that my perspective is\u00a0wrong,\u00a0hm?\u201dViolet\u2019s calm voice made the dressmaker\u2019s face bright one second, then crestfallen the next. He looked at Roen and silently tried to ask for help.However, Roen just gave him a gentle smile.\u201cThat, well, that\u2019s not what I meant. I only mean to say that the trends in Werchen that are being pursued\u2014\u201d\u201cWhy should I follow the trends?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cLet me repeat myself then. Is there any reason that\u00a0I\u00a0should follow the trends?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe ducal lady\u2019s haughty tone shut the dressmaker right up.As a matter of fact, what Violet said was not wrong. With the exception of the imperial princess, amongst all the ladies who had yet to wed, Violet was the highest noble of her peers.So, it was only right for Violet not to follow the trends and instead lead the trends.Of course, this was\u00a0if\u00a0Violet was reigning as the flower of high society.\u201cSo, um, again, about this dress\u2026\u201dFeeling overwhelmed, the dressmaker doggedly tried to explain his clothes once more. But Violet just clicked her tongue.This small action startled the dressmaker and he began to hiccup.Sitting at the side, Roen admired Violet\u2019s attitude. Indeed, she was a talent who even the crown prince could covet.Even if she didn\u2019t have Roen\u2019s protection, Violet could stand firm on her convictions and convey this with just a click of her tongue.Still though, the dressmaker didn\u2019t seem to be willing to give up on his designs.\u201cFine. You there.\u201d\u201cY-Yes?!\u201d\u201cDo you also make clothes?\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026 I work under Lord Laurent as an assistant.\u201dAs Violet continued to ignore the dressmaker\u2019s words, she beckoned at the restless girl standing at one side.Suddenly called forward, the assistant looked very taken aback. She was walking on eggshells around the dressmaker, who then glared at the assistant when she was called.\u201cYour Ladyship, that child is still not very skilled!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you. Do you have the right to cut off a duke\u2019s daughter?\u201d\u201cNo, not at all, that\u2019s not what I mean\u2014\u201d\u201cEnough. Violet has the right to decide on this. If she\u2019s not asking you for your opinion, then it would be best for you to close your mouth.\u201d\u201cE-Excuse me?\u201dRoen was just observing how things were going until now, but he soon intervened. The dressmaker then shut his trap. It\u2019s obvious to anyone that he was feeling wronged.\u201cAssistant, huh. Right, so you\u2019re an assistant. Have you ever made clothes before?\u201d\u201cY-Yes\u2026 Although I am still young, I am confident that my skills are as good as anyone else because Lord Laurent taught me well.\u201d\u201cI see. Okay.\u201dThe assistant somehow raised the dressmaker with her remarks, but Violet didn\u2019t care much about that part. The dressmaker\u2019s eyes were filled with incredulity.No. No way.\u201cYou, remain here. And you, your name\u2019s Laurent, is it? You may leave now. I\u2019ll pay you generously for your hard work of coming all the way here.\u201d\u201cE-Excuse me?\u201d\u201cHave your ears gone bad in the meantime? I said, you may leave. Now.\u201d\u201cR-Regardless of how you are a duke\u2019s daughter, you can\u2019t do this to me\u2026!\u201dFinally realizing the treatment he was getting, the dressmaker protested tenaciously.Even if someone had the money to afford it, not just\u00a0anyone\u00a0could get their hands on his clothes. The nobles of the capital were all lined up to get one of his designs somehow. He was under the impression that a high noble such as Violet of House Everett was also just as amazed by him.\u201cRegardless of how you are a duke\u2019s daughter, you can\u2019t just treat\u00a0my\u00a0boutique like\u2014!\u201d\u201cViolet has already made up her mind. Wouldn\u2019t it be better for you if you just leave on your own two feet?\u201dAs Roen said this, the despairing dressmaker was soon dragged out.\u201cUm, well, I\u2026\u201dLeft at the drawing room, the young seamstress inwardly sobbed, not knowing what to do.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her mentor got commissioned today here at House Everett, but he had gotten kicked out and she was left all alone.Meanwhile, after the ducal lady received the pen and paper she asked for from the maid, she began to draw something personally.Then, she handed that drawing to the young seamstress.\u201cYour Ladyship, this is\u2026!\u201d\u201cCan you make it?\u201d\u201cThen, it\u2019s Your Ladyship\u2019s personal desi\u2026\u201dTrailing off, the seamstress still couldn\u2019t understand her situation. She could only stare blankly at the sketch that was in her hands.The design was a simple one: lines hugging the wearer\u2019s curves, all the way down until it would spread gracefully starting from the top of the knee.It had no decorations other than the focal point at the center, which held the dress in a way that gently created pleats. Despite the design\u2019s simplicity, it did not look too modest due to the several layers of sheer fabric overlaid.Perhaps because it was a dress that embraced the body, it looked like it was difficult to move in, but the sides of the dress were given a leeway and there was fabric underneath to make it easier for the wearer to move.It was a design that even she had never imagined.In the style of a bustier, one\u2019s arms and shoulders would be exposed through this dress. However, even with a shawl and the sheer fabric, the wearer\u2019s subtle beauty would be emphasized.It wasn\u2019t just that. It was a classy, flower-like design as it\u2019s spread out at the bottom, and with the pleats beneath the chest, Violet\u2019s rough designs all looked easy to move around in compared to the Empire-style dress while still naturally showing the wearer\u2019s curves.Now that corsets were in vogue, the young seamstress was completely astounded by the feast of groundbreaking designs being shown to her. She could now understand why Violet had deemed Laurent\u2019s clothing as clownish in nature.It was not required to \u2018highlight\u2019 the body\u2019s natural beauty\u2014one could be beautiful enough even without having to tighten one\u2019s waistline or emphasize one\u2019s chest and hips.\u201cUmm, but Your Ladyship, if you wish to wear something like this, people might\u2026\u201dPeople might notice the wearer\u2019s excess weight.However, without further speaking, the young seamstress closed her mouth.Turning to Violet, who was sitting elegantly while dressed in a terribly outdated dress, the seamstress concluded that the ducal lady would definitely pull off these groundbreaking designs.\u201cThen why don\u2019t we add some embellishments like so?\u201d\u201cHmm. Not bad.\u201d\u201cI also think it would be prettier to add some lace on this part. And the color that would suit Your Ladyship would be\u2026\u201dFinally understanding the situation she was in, the young assistant began to show her talent. After she had seen some of Violet\u2019s sketches as well, she added her own ideas and started designing clothes that would suit the ducal lady.This girl was brimming with talent.\u201cPurple fabric will also suit Your Ladyship well, won\u2019t it? If we also use crushed pearls, it will give off a subtle sheen and it will make you look like a beautifully blooming flower!\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dAnd she was brimming with passion.She added decorations like this, gave out valid points here and there, and also transformed things in a certain way\u2026Violet showed several more sketches in an instant. The young assistant became a nodding machine.\u201cI don\u2019t want to wear uncomfortable garb, so I\u2019d like to order some comfortable clothes as well.\u201d\u201cAh, then shall I reconstruct some of the designs that Your Ladyship has already provided and make something out of those?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like some pants, too.\u201d\u201cPants? Uh. Uhh\u2026?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll pay you as much as you want, so do it at your own discretion.\u201dThe order was made swiftly. Roen smiled with satisfaction as he watched Violet talking to the young seamstress, casually drawing out House Everett\u2019s finances.\u201cIt\u2019s a waste that you\u2019re an assistant. What do you think about being a recipient of a sponsorship?\u201d\u201cP-Pardon? Sponsorship?\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to make all those clothes by yourself, so you\u2019ll need a team. Tell me if you need any support.\u201d\u201cI can do that?\u201dThe young seamstress then became sullen. It seemed like it\u2019s sinking in that she was taking on a major commission.But in the eyes of both Violet and Roen, her talents were sufficient.\u201cCan\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cNo, I can! I\u2019ll do my best!\u201dThough she felt fear, this didn\u2019t mean that she was scared enough that she\u2019d miss out on this opportunity.Finally, it looked like they were done building her wardrobe. Violet rolled her neck, looking tired.\u201cBy the way, Violet. How did you come up with these designs?\u201d\u201cI guess it suddenly popped up in my mind after that brush with death.\u201dViolet answered straightforwardly. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s lying.Remembering that Violet had plunged into the lake, Roen briefly fell silent. Though he was blind to fashion and design, Violet\u2019s designs were unconventional to him, too.\u201cRight. Then the matter of your clothes is done for now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d rather have coffee than tea.\u201d\u201cShall we get you fitted for your shoes?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRoen grinned.The young seamstress was still inside the drawing room, and as she listened to the conversation between the brother and sister, she also inwardly questioned it.At Roen\u2019s beckon, some more people entered the drawing room.

And he paid a great deal of money to get them here, too.\u201cI want to rest.\u201d\u201cCome now, you can do it.\u201dAs Violet voiced out her fatigue, Roen only smiled and ignored her words.What would be the point of a fitting for clothes, accessories and shoes if the person involved wasn\u2019t present?The artisans, puzzled by the situation, soon discussed the new designs with enthusiasm and earnestness with the young seamstress.\u2018Do all artisans really tend to be strange?\u2019Actually, as a \u2018painter\u2019, Violet did not deviate all that much from the scope of an artisan either, but still, she was sincerely concerned.Three artisans here did not wish to miss out on the opportunity to set their artistic spirits ablaze, and this one merchant over there did not wish to miss out on the opportunity to make some money. They all discussed fervently.The only dress she really needed to get from this fitting was a dress for a party, but it\u2019s not needed right away. So, it was decided that she\u2019d get fitted for her daily wear first, along with some pairs of shoes.Thus, the four people left the drawing room only after sunset.Just like that, Violet\u2019s tiring day drew to a close.* * *An invitation came from the Leshan Marquisate.Under normal circumstances, the invitation would have been rejected before Violet could even see it. But this time, on a rare occasion, the invitation reached Violet\u2019s hands.As she read through the invitation, which had a respectable introduction, Violet narrowed her eyes.Roen had asked her to accept the marquisate\u2019s invitation, and there was a reason behind this.Nonetheless, Violet wrote back, saying that she would attend the tea party that the marchioness would be holding\u2014just in time for the necessary clothes to be completed.* * *Meanwhile, the black-haired man who had helped Violet sent a letter as well.The man\u2019s letter almost got sorted through by the other maids, but fortunately, it was thanks to Mary\u2019s sharp eyes that the letter reached Violet safely.As addressed in the letter, the knight\u2019s full name was \u2018Aldin Aesir\u2019.Faced with a name that she wasn\u2019t expecting, Violet even checked who the letter\u2019s sender was one more time.Aldin Aesir. That man was the illegitimate son of Duke Aesir, and he was famous for a reason different from Violet.The Aesir Duchy was just as prestigious as the Everett Duchy, but although he was a child of that household, there was not a single person in the whole empire who did not know that he\u2019s an illegitimate child.He and the current duke were fifteen years apart from age, but no\u2014Aldin was the illegitimate son of the\u00a0previous\u00a0duke, and he was the evidence of the household\u2019s shame.After the mysterious death of the previous Duke Aesir, Aldin\u2019s half-brother became the household head and was now the current duke. Even so, the current duke could not erase the name of his younger brother\u2014the family\u2019s disgrace\u2014from their registry.Violet started to mull over why Aldin didn\u2019t put his last name in his identification card, but she banished the thought.\u2018Have I ever met him before?\u2019Violet rummaged through her memories, trying to recall if she had ever met anyone before who had lavender eyes.Before she had plunged into the lake, she attended numerous banquets. It wouldn\u2019t be strange to think that she might have met him in one of those events.She\u2019d be able to recall someday. Violet thought about it simply and soon wrote her reply to the letter. She did promise that she would welcome him and give him any reward he wanted.Then, Violet wondered. He was a young lord of a duchy, and he was also a knight of the imperial guard. Was there anything he wanted to get from Everett?But, well, as long as she could compensate him, Violet did not need to mull over it anymore.She didn\u2019t want her peaceful time to be disturbed by complicated thoughts.* * *Aldin sent another letter informing her that he would visit the ducal residence at the soonest possible time. Then, just as he said, he visited the mansion soon after, alone.After finding out that, of all days, he would not be there when the guest would arrive, Roen tearfully begged Violet.Although Aldin was an illegitimate child, he was still a member of a ducal household. It was quite a huge deal for a duke\u2019s son and a duke\u2019s daughter to meet like this.Roen\u2019s worries were valid, but since Violet had no intention of getting married anyway, she just brushed off those worries as inconsequential.Given that Aldin was a member of a high noble household and a son of a duke, he was indeed an important guest. However, he acted as if he did not want to reveal his surname.Violet decided not to touch the guy\u2019s painful wounds. Since he looked like he really didn\u2019t want to be connected to his family name, she was willing to respect his wishes as much as he wanted.\u201cI did not expect you to come alone. Did you run into any inconveniences on your way here?\u201d\u201cIt was alright. I am humbled that you have invited me to your abode.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble. House Everett does not treat its guests poorly. Please come this way.\u201dAs the formal greetings were over, Violet led her guest inside.Momentarily hesitating at the sight of Violet in a light indoor dress, Aldin quickly composed himself and followed her.He didn\u2019t know that the ducal lady would welcome him personally, so because of this, he was rather flustered. However, since most of the people here couldn\u2019t decode his monochromatic expressions because he was so terse, nobody noticed.\u201cI didn\u2019t get the chance to introduce myself and apologize to you properly that day because of how hectic the situation had been. In the name of Violet S. Everett, I once again thank you for coming to my rescue, and I apologize for the rudeness that my household\u2019s knights had shown you.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s fine. I, too, understand that they were only performing their duties as knights.\u201dIn the dining hall, a splendid dinner was prepared, and the hospitable treatment of the guest ensued.The sound of their silverware did not echo. Neither Violet nor Aldin spoke, so the dining hall held only silence.\u201cHave you thought of what you\u2019d like to ask of me?\u201d\u201cPainting\u2026\u201dThe person who finished their meal first was Violet, and she went straight to the point as she asked him.At Violet\u2019s question, Aldin carefully opened his lips to speak.\u201cEven if just once, I would like to see your paintings.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But if it\u2019s too difficult\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s no problem. I was only surprised to hear that rumors have spread about my paintings.\u201dAt Violet\u2019s answer, Aldin stopped talking. Seeing his reaction, she inwardly clicked her tongue.Indeed, the only people who would talk about how a ducal lady had a hobby of\u00a0painting\u00a0were those who wanted to disparage her reputation. There\u2019s no way he\u2019d want to speak more on this.This reminded her of what she had read about herself in that magazine. As the ducal lady frowned, the knight saw this and spoke again.\u201cThere isn\u2019t any other intention behind it. If Your Ladyship is uncomfortable, you may refuse\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Well, as I said, it\u2019s no problem.\u201dThere\u2019s nothing wrong with showing her paintings to someone a little earlier. She was going to hold an art exhibit sooner or later anyway.After their meal, Violet let Aldin into her gallery.The gallery itself was enough to display all of the artwork she had created thus far. She actually didn\u2019t need to rent a place for her art exhibit.Violet had only been painting without much regard to how her art would be managed, but as she entered the gallery, she was surprised to see her paintings arranged in a more orderly manner than she was expecting.As Aldin silently admired the paintings, Violet, on the other hand, was surprised. She had never come to see her own paintings here.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhile they both looked at the paintings, the taciturn knight said nothing, while Violet herself frowned.The clothes she was wearing now were in a style that used to be fashionable in the past. It was reinterpreted, and the seamstress added her own design elements to it to make it more sophisticated.But her paintings were a different story. They were much too unconventional for the people of this era.One look at Violet\u2019s paintings and they would reasonably think that they were a\u00a0witch\u2019s\u00a0paintings.\u201cI\u2019m still not good enough, so I can only paint this much.\u201dSomehow feeling anxious, Violet spoke up first. But Aldin, as he looked at her paintings for a long time, shook his head slowly.\u201cNo, it\u2019s just, I\u2026 I feel a little sad.\u201dHe spoke with slow deliberation. They were words that he chose meticulously, but they were nonetheless straightforward.Violet quickly realized what Aldin was trying to say.Violet\u2019s paintings contained such raw emotions.Through dim colors, the artwork depicted unfiltered and unrestrained depression. Most people would call these paintings bizarre, but for those who felt the same pain, they would recognize the paintings as screams of suffering.\u201cThough they emanate sadness and loneliness, I still think they\u2019re beautiful.\u201dAldin added as he was staring at the paintings, mesmerized.Hearing his old-fashioned way of showing his appreciation, Violet said nothing.\u201cLong ago, Your Ladyship once said\u2014\u201dAldin opened his lips slowly once again, but before he could finish what he was saying, a loud commotion broke out nearby.\u201cYoung Master, you can\u2019t! Please, you can\u2019t go that way!\u201d\u201cBuzz off. This is my own house and I can go wherever the hell I please.\u201dViolet grimaced. It was a voice she was ever so familiar with, yet it was the same voice that she never wanted to hear again.Roen had long since established himself as the \u2018Young Duke\u2019 here at Werchen. There\u2019s no reason for him to be called merely \u2018Young Master\u2019 now.So, it must be\u00a0him.With chills running down her spine, Violet turned to look behind her.BANG!\u00a0After kicking the gallery door unceremoniously, the young man let out an unapologetic bellow.\u201cHey! Witch! Explain what exactly this is all about, huh?!\u201dIt was Cairn P. Everett, the third son of House Everett and the very person who forced Violet to leave for the capital.* * *Among the three brothers, Cairn had the most fiery personality. Nobody could compare to how short his fuse was, and once he had decided on something, he was like a maverick who would push through his own way no matter what.He was too much of a scoundrel to be called \u2018righteous\u2019, and he was too much of a vile prick to be called a \u2018knight\u2019.The current duke and the departed duchess weren\u2019t like that. One could only wonder where this guy got it from.After plunging into the lake and waking up with memories of her past life, Violet often thought about her younger brother.Yeon Ha-yoon also had siblings, and one of them was an annoying guy who had to be called \u2018Oppa\u2019. Still, he couldn\u2019t hold a candle to Cairn.If Mikhail sometimes raised his hand against her, Cairn was the one who\u2019d outright draw his sword and point it at Violet\u2019s neck.Violet was well aware that, if the situation had become even a little more twisted at that time, the sword would have definitely lopped off her head back then.Cairn had a talent for swordsmanship, and he was\u00a0simple.Simple, if you want to put it lightly. A\u00a0simpleton, if you want to be straightforward.Whenever the younger brother would point a sword at his older sister, the older sister would do her best to grate at the younger brother\u2019s nerves as well. And because Violet\u2019s reasonings were plausible, Cairn wouldn\u2019t be able to enact his anger directly on her. Instead, he would destroy innocent objects.\u2018But that doesn\u2019t mean I never got hit.\u2019After a brief recollection, Violet stared up at Cairn, who was now holding her by the collar. He had grown taller in the time that they didn\u2019t see each other. He was clearly emitting a threatening, murderous intent.\u201cExplain it right this second, with your own mouth. What the hell is going on right now?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And why are you here, not at the Everett estate?\u201d\u201cHah.\u00a0Are you kidding me? You\u2014 Has something happened to your head? You think I\u2019m going to stay still after seeing everything that happened there? Of course I\u2019ll be right on your heels!\u201d\u201cHaa.\u201dTruly an ignorant, simple guy. Violet fled to the capital for nothing.And, look. He\u2019s doing this in front of a guest.Violet\u2019s sigh deepened. Upon hearing Violet\u2019s listless exhale, Cairn tightened his grip on her collar. Violet\u2019s clothes got stretched.\u201cIs there anything else that I can explain? You must have already heard from Father.\u201d\u201cAs if I\u2019d believe that! The first thing I heard after going home was that Elder Brother was stripped of his status as heir, Aileen was kicked out, and there are rumors going around that\u00a0you\u00a0of all people are the victim! But you want me to believe the mere drivel of a witch who went to the capital with Brother Roen?!\u201dJust the very atmosphere and force surrounding Cairn exuded chaos. One look at him like this was enough for Violet to know that nothing she\u2019d say now would go through to him.How should she solve this predicament? The knights were visibly restless, not knowing how to act in the middle of this fight between their master\u2019s children.Mary and Zylo were the only ones trying to stop Cairn.But as Violet was thinking of whether Zylo would be able to stop Cairn\u2014\u201cThat temper of yours hasn\u2019t changed at all.\u201dShiiing.\u00a0A silver blade was pointed at Cairn.Even though it\u2019s true that this situation was terribly urgent, Cairn was House Everett\u2019s third son. He was a duke\u2019s son, and after his graduation from the academy, he would have the duchy\u2019s chivalric order under his command.Thus, was there anyone in this mansion owned by Everett who could actually point a sword at him?\u201cHah?\u00a0Aldin? What the hell are you doing here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve come as an invited guest. Wouldn\u2019t it be better for you to stop now before any word gets out that House Everett treats their guests so poorly that it\u2019s a\u00a0wreck, Cairn?\u201dIt was Aldin Aesir who took up the position of stopping Cairn. Although he was an illegitimate child, Aldin Aesir was, too, the son of a duke and was House Everett\u2019s guest.\u201cOn top of that damn annoying face of yours, you\u2019ve even got that insufferable goody-two-shoes act up and going, huh.\u00a0Guest?\u00a0You\u2019re a guest of this damn witch? How fun, this situation!\u201dWhile spouting one harsh word after another, Cairn let go of Violet\u2019s collar. Even so, Aldin did not stop pointing his sword at Cairn.The knights who were hesitating to stop Cairn were now wary of the guest who was serving as a threat to the third young master.It felt as if everything would blow up in everyone\u2019s faces at any given moment, with just one wrong move. However, even as Cairn was the one who had a blade pointed at him, he was the only one at ease.\u201cMind staying out of our family matter? Damn obnoxious prick. And\u00a0you,\u00a0Violet. If you don\u2019t explain everything to me\u00a0right now, just know that this will be your last day.\u201d\u2018Even if I explain it properly, you\u2019ll just go straight for my throat anyway.\u2019Violet replied inwardly.With the situation coming to this, Violet could feel an oncoming migraine already, the moment she was about to let out a sigh\u2014Tak.\u201cHave you seriously lost your goddamn marbles?\u201d\u2014Aldin threw a glove at Cairn\u2019s face.\u201cIf you really want a conversation, you look like you need to cool off your head first. And you don\u2019t seem like you can do it on your own, so I\u2019ll give you a hand.\u201d\u201cHa. Haha\u2026\u00a0What is\u00a0this\u00a0now? Are you serious? You two are\u00a0together?\u00a0If not that, are you seriously feeling sorry for this witch\u2014\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe you of all people can say that, considering that your entire worth hinges only on your position as a duke\u2019s son. Isn\u2019t that why you still haven\u2019t graduated, only skulking around at the academy until now?\u201d\u201cWhat? You goddamn prick! Just because you graduated at the top of your class! You know what? Fine, follow me. I\u2019ll knock you right off your damn high horse!\u201dThe situation began to change urgently.Absolutely furious, Cairn took off the thrown glove from his face and stomped out the gallery, heading straight towards the sparring area of the knights\u2019 drill hall.Simpletons were quick to change their attitudes, of course.As she was in the presence of her guest and savior, Violet could not comprehend how things had gotten to this point. Mary came running, and she was utterly clueless as to what had happened, but she quickly arranged Violet\u2019s clothes.\u201cMilady, Milady! What\u2019s going on?!\u00a0Uhh\u2014\u00a0Is that really the Third Young Master?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re asking me whether that\u00a0idiot\u00a0is Cairn, then the answer is yes. If you\u2019re asking me what exactly is going on, then I have no clue at all.\u201dAfter her dress\u2019s collar was presentable again, Violet rushed towards the drill hall.If Everett\u2019s reputation would take a hit, it\u2019s a problem. If Aldin, a guest who Violet had invited, were to take a hit, it\u2019s still a problem.In this situation where everything\u2019s a problem, Violet\u2019s anxiety further deepened.* * *Clash, claaang. Clash!The duel, which produced nothing but problems\u2014against everyone\u2019s expectations\u2014went on in a fair manner.Violet came here with the intention of stopping them at once. However, without realizing it, she stopped and watched the serious duel.\u201cThey\u2019re from the same alma mater.\u201dThe sociable Mary came back to report what she had gleaned from someone else. Violet wasn\u2019t interested in her younger brother at all, but she was surprised to hear this new information.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It seemed like they had become quite close because they were at first and second place in terms of practical skills.\u201cThe Third Young Master was one-sidedly jealous of Sir Knight\u2019s skills. That\u2019s why they had gotten famous at the academy\u2014\u201d\u201cIt was never like that, you pumpkin!\u201dCairn had been focusing on the duel for a long time, but he suddenly shouted as he heard Mary\u2019s words. He was a bit far away, but he had good ears.Frightened, Mary hid behind Violet.\u201cMilady, am I in trouble?\u201dViolet shook her head and patted Mary\u2019s hair a couple of times. Feeling relieved, Mary peeped out from behind Violet.In Violet\u2019s eyes, those two didn\u2019t seem close at all. In turn, it seemed like Cairn had one-sided enmity against the other man.As Aldin remained indifferent to the hostility and anger right in front of him, Violet shook her head slowly.Clang. Shiiik. Clash!Their swords danced and met each other in the air over and over again. Escaping Cairn\u2019s sword as it swept right next to his face, Aldin took a step back and twisted his wrist to meet Cairn\u2019s sword once more.Violet and the employees, who were not overly familiar with swordsmanship, simply watched in awe as the duel went on. The knights, on the other hand, who were knowledgeable about the matter, were all astonished as the fight progressed.\u201cI was wondering what kind of monster he\u2019d be since he\u2019s in the First Imperial Order, but really, for him to have all that skill at that age.\u201dAs Violet\u2019s escort knight, Zylo was right by her side. He nodded in admiration.Mary asked innocently.\u201cIs he that great?\u201d\u201cYes, he is. The Young Master isn\u2019t being pushed back as well, so he\u2019s also great to that degree. But the match is going to end soon.\u201d\u201cThen, who\u2019s going to win?\u201d\u201cI believe\u2026\u201dCLANG!The moment Zylo and Mary talked about it, the match was decided.It was Aldin\u2019s victory.\u201cHa. You\u2019ve improved more in the time we didn\u2019t see each other.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the same. You haven\u2019t just been playing at the academy.\u201dStrangely enough, the atmosphere between the two duelists had become warm. The beginning of the match was terrible, but now that the conflict was over, it somehow felt like a strong bond had formed between them.The maids rushed forward and handed water and towels. Violet, Mary and Zylo could do nothing but stare in disbelief as those two smiled at each other.Everyone was bewildered.A guest had come and he was supposed to be given a warm welcome. Instead, the third young master had barged right in and refused to abide by proper conduct. Because of this, the guest challenged the third young master to a duel, but the result of it all was this: the friendship between the two had become as strong as titanium.Sighing, Violet tried to organize the series of events in her mind, but she still couldn\u2019t understand what just happened.In any case, it was time for Violet to step up and do her part. Cairn\u2019s head had finally cooled down.* * *\u201cAnd you\u2019re telling me to\u00a0believe\u00a0that?\u201d\u201cI never told you to believe it. At the very least, I\u2019d like it if you don\u2019t show an appalling sight to the guest.\u201d\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you insisting that I believe you! Does that mean you\u2019re just lying, huh?!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand how you connected the two notions.\u201dViolet calmly explained things to Cairn, who had finally calmed down. Of course, Cairn still protested.Violet tried to send Aldin back, but he said that something might come up again, so he was here for the entire duration of the brother and sister\u2019s conversation.As much as possible, Violet didn\u2019t want to delve into such a personal story and admit her misfortune in front of others, so she tried again and again to dissuade Aldin from staying. However, he was politely adamant about staying. \u201cI\u2019m the only one who can stop that guy,\u201d he said.Thus, Violet had no choice but to tell the truth in front of him.Violet\u2019s explanation was merely an abridged version of everything that happened, but Cairn doubted even that.The other employees and knights who didn\u2019t know the full story remained expressionless, but Mary looked like she had a lot to say as Violet spoke.\u201c\u2026Ha. So what you\u2019re saying now is that Aileen is a terrible person.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been jumping to conclusions since earlier. I never said she\u2019s terrible.\u201dBut, yes. She\u2019s a terrible person I\u2019ll never have to see again.Violet said to herself, not voicing her thoughts.Visibly irritated, Cairn muttered thoughtlessly.\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between this and that? To summarize what you\u2019ve just said, she\u2019s been pretending to be nice, but all this time she\u2019s been painting you out to be the bad person, and she\u2019s only been showing her true colors in front of you. If that\u2019s not terrible, then what is?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dListening to Cairn\u2019s simple conclusion to everything, Violet stared at him, rendered speechless. After everything that he heard, she couldn\u2019t believe that this was just how it\u2019s all summed up.Still, as she had no intention of excusing her past malicious deeds, Violet only sighed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Instead, she sighed quietly as she pressed down on the emotions rising within her.We wouldn\u2019t have been able to communicate anyway, so not bringing it up was one way of dealing with it.\u201cWhat did you say? Did you just laugh at me? Answer me, why didn\u2019t you say anything?!\u201d\u201c\u2026If I did.\u201d\u201cIf something like that happened, you should have told me earlier. All you did was get angry recklessly, so you\u2026!\u201d\u201cIf I said anything, would you have believed me?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf I had told you about it before,\u00a0would you have believed me?\u201d\u201cWhat are you even\u2014\u201d\u201cCairn Paris Everett.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dCairn fell silent as he was called by his full name. Realizing that Violet\u2019s mood had turned unusual, he glanced around.Mary was staring at him with great intensity, and Aldin, who was listening as well, shook his head.\u201cNo, I mean. Shi\u2014! What I mean to say is, um\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I had spoken up, do you think that anything would have\u00a0changed\u00a0if someone believed me?\u201d\u201cWhat, did you say.\u201d\u201cNo matter how simple you are, Cairn, there\u2019s no way that you don\u2019t know. Mikhail, or Lord Roen, and most certainly you. Let me ask you this\u2014would\u00a0you\u00a0have believed me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs Cairn could say nothing in response, Violet laughed at him.This younger brother of hers, as simple as he was, always believed everything would be as easy as one, two, and three. However, there were times when things wouldn\u2019t work no matter how hard he would try.\u201cRight. I\u2019ve already said my piece today, but you still can\u2019t find it in you to believe me. But even if you don\u2019t believe a word I say, Cairn, the fact of the matter is this\u2014Mikhail has already been stripped of his title as the Duke\u2019s heir, and Aileen is no longer in Everett.\u201dThen, Violet coldly uttered,\u201cSo, you too. Leave.\u201d\u201cAh, damn it, I just\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s pretend today never happened and go our separate ways. And I\u2019ll say this again:\u00a0leave.\u201d\u201c\u2026I, just. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI said I\u2019m sorry! So, um. What. You\u2019re Father\u2019s favorite after all, and in the end, I also, with you\u2026 No, I mean, Sister! I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve been misunderstanding you, Sister. I just, um, no, I\u2019m not trying to blame you\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cUgh,\u00a0shit, I mean. I was just hoping that you\u2019d behave better! No, I mean\u2026\u00a0Haa.\u00a0Anyway, I just want to apologize, too. I was terrible to you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe tension in the air further disintegrated. Violet was hoping that what she\u2019s hearing was merely an auditory hallucination. But unfortunately, the situation she was now faced with was neither an illusion nor was it welcome to her.\u201cHaa.\u00a0I never said I didn\u2019t believe you. I,\u00a0uh\u2026\u00a0I mean, if you just acted properly, then I would have\u2026\u201dCairn was a simpleton. As simple as he was, he was quick on the uptake when it came to these things. No, it would be right to say that he was quick to understand this particular situation.\u201cBut, well, anyway. If everything you said is true! \u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201dWith genuine anger lacing her words, Violet answered.\u201cGet out.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cGet out of my sight right\u00a0now,\u00a0Cairn P. Everett.\u201d\u201cH-Huh?\u201dTherein lies the problem.There was no way that long-standing resentment could be solved with a simple apology.\u201cThere are times when I even envy your simplicity,\u201d Aldin bluntly murmured.It had come to a point that he had to say it, even when he\u2019d just been watching things unfold quietly at the sidelines until now.Still not understanding what the problem was, Cairn raised his voice as though he was completely innocent.\u201cNo. Wait. Why? I already apologized. But why? Why are you mad at me now\u2014\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to leave, then I will. Don\u2019t ever show yourself in front of me again.\u201dWhether Cairn was flustered or not, Violet\u2019s response was as cold as ever.As Violet rose to her feet, Mary sprang up as well, glancing at Cairn.\u201cYou are at fault, Cairn.\u201d\u201cThen why? I did something wrong, that\u2019s why I apologized, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWatching as the situation got sorted out, Aldin let out a slow sigh.While ignoring Cairn, Violet walked forward and approached Aldin.\u201cIt was my intention to treat you today, but I sincerely apologize that you\u2019ve been met with such a commotion instead. If you don\u2019t mind, would it be alright if you pretend that today never happened?\u201d\u201cOf course. As you please, Your Ladyship.\u201d\u201cYou can just call me by my name comfortably. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to ask of me?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t call you by your name yet\u2026 No, never mind. I have also unsheathed my sword today, so I\u2019m not in the position to receive any apologies from you.\u201dEven when it was his friend and his older sister who were talking, Cairn had been effectively excluded from the conversation. He protested as though he felt wronged.Nevertheless, both Violet and Aldin continued as though he wasn\u2019t there.\u201cThen, if you don\u2019t mind me asking\u2026 May I humbly ask to be your partner in the next imperial ball?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Please write to me about the ball later.\u201dViolet courteously took care of her guest.On the other hand, Cairn yet again attempted to go wild. Instead of being treated as House Everett\u2019s third young master, he was treated as an uninvited guest and was forced to be seen off together with Aldin....After Violet returned order to the townhouse with her commands, she immediately headed towards her room. As Cairn was dragged down the long hallways of the mansion beside Aldin, he continuously expressed how unfair he found this all to be.\u201cI already apologized, so what\u2019s the problem?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll leave that up to you. Still, in this world, I guess it\u2019s better that there\u2019s an apology rather than none at all.\u201d\u201cIf someone does something wrong, isn\u2019t it only right to apologize?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s something that can be said only by people who\u2019ve never been wronged. Cairn,\u00a0anyone\u00a0can utter the word \u2018sorry\u2019.\u201d\u201cUuugh,\u00a0damn it. What the hell. What are you even talking about\u2026\u201dThat day, Aldin left the mansion on his own two feet, whereas Cairn was properly kicked out of the place.And he had no other choice but to squat shabbily in front of the main gates of the Everett townhouse until Roen returned.* * *\u201cWhat are you doing here? No, do I even\u00a0want\u00a0to ask what you\u2019re doing here?\u201d\u201cDunno. What\u00a0am\u00a0I doing here?\u201dCatching sight of Cairn, who was pathetically sitting on the dirt ground, Roen asked this, and Cairn merely answered with a helpless tone.It was perhaps luck alone that Roen found Cairn at the main gates when his carriage drove by.If he hadn\u2019t, then Cairn would have definitely spent the night, crouching down right there, at the outskirts of his family\u2019s property. It would be an added bonus that he\u2019d most likely make it on the front page of the papers.\u201cLet\u2019s head inside first. How many people have seen you here?\u201d\u201cDunno.\u201d\u201cHaa.\u201dRoen immediately grasped the situation after just the meager exchange. With a deep sigh, Roen took Cairn and headed in.At this moment, he realized that yet another new headache would have to be added to his already packed schedule.* * *Violet wanted Cairn out of her sight, but it was henceforth decided that he would remain in Werchen until the start of the next semester. Whether Violet wanted this or not, there was nothing she could do since Cairn got the duke\u2019s approval.Besides that, Cairn took a leave of absence from the academy without telling anyone. Nonetheless, Roen found out. He grabbed his younger brother on the back of his collar and asked why he did this, but the only answer was\u2026\u201cI was told that just anyone can say sorry. So I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201dWith this, Roen surmised what Cairn was trying to say. He cradled his throbbing forehead once again.Roen could understand Cairn\u2019s feelings. But at the same time, Roen could also understand Violet\u2019s resentment.This younger brother of theirs was a very simple guy. Even so, he was righteous and he loathed injustice.Was it because of how simple he was? The tendency of being a maverick was owned not only by Mikhail, but also Cairn. While blinded by prejudice, any actions sprouted from those intentions could not be said to be\u00a0just.\u201cViolet is going to hate it.\u201d\u201cDid\u00a0you\u00a0receive her forgiveness, Brother?\u201d\u201c\u2026No.\u201dCairn narrowed his eyes. Sensing the unsaid words of, \u2018What the hell, you too,\u2019 Roen coughed in vain.Cairn had assumed that Roen had already been forgiven, so he was here to ask what the secret to getting it was. In the end, he clicked his tongue.Reflecting on how they were as siblings, Roen asked while pressing down his fingers on one temple.\u201cLet me ask you a question. I know you don\u2019t like thinking all that deeply, but are you really taking Violet\u2019s word without any hesitation?\u201d\u201cYou think I\u2019m an idiot, don\u2019t you?\u201dIndeed, Roen viewed his younger brother in that manner. He said nothing. Thinking that he might get angry, Cairn also didn\u2019t respond.It\u2019s not as if he couldn\u2019t understand what his older brother meant.He saw and heard one thing for such a long time until now, but how could he so easily change his attitude like a simple flip of a hand?Roen, too. It was only after his own personal investigation and the duke\u2019s thorough investigation as well that Roen finally managed to understand Violet\u2019s side. No matter how much of a simpleton Cairn was, it\u2019s impossible for someone to change one\u2019s attitude so easily.\u201cBrother, you should try going back home even just once. Look at the state of things there. Besides, Father\u2019s not an idiot, so can\u2019t I believe\u00a0his\u00a0word? Mikhail\u2019s the real moron here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dRoen narrowed his eyes once more. He\u2019s saying that he heard about the situation from the duke, yet he ran wild anyway. Who was he to say that\u00a0he\u2019s\u00a0not an idiot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He held back a sigh that was about to slip through his lips.It wasn\u2019t for no reason that Cairn wasn\u2019t aiming for the position of the duke\u2019s heir.\u201cFine. I\u2019m sure things have already been explained to you, but I have a feeling you need an additional explanation.\u201d\u201cAh, sure, yeah. I do need an explanation. Father only gave me a pile of documents that were too difficult to read, and while Sister is the person directly involved, she explained it like dogshit.\u201d\u201cLanguage.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no one else besides us anyway?\u201dCairn, the source of Roen\u2019s stress at this moment, laughed out loud. Roen had a hunch that Cairn would never be accepted by Violet.* * *Since then, as Roen explained things thoroughly, Cairn\u2019s simmering anger slowly grew and grew.Roen\u2019s explanation was strongly self-reflective. He spoke calmly, but his eyes were filled with shame.\u201cYou did that, yet you\u2019re still the older brother here?\u00a0Hah.\u00a0Seriously, this family\u2026\u201d\u201cAccording to the report, you drew your sword and pointed it at Violet on several occasions. You even shoved her\u2026 You don\u2019t have the right to say anything.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because she hit Aileen first!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dCairn\u2019s excuse once again made Roen narrow his eyes. Still, Cairn wasn\u2019t blind to his own wrongdoings. He sat down calmly.Then, as Roen\u2019s explanation was complete, Cairn ground his teeth audibly.\u201cFor the empire\u2019s Everett Duchy to have been played in the hands of that damn head maid, seriously\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say that it\u2019s surprising. The signs were all there. Anyway, Cairn, if you really want to apologize, you\u2019d better straighten up your attitude.\u201d\u201cHah.\u00a0Even if you\u2019re not cursing me out, just shut it! So, did you slash open that head maid\u2019s throat?\u201d\u201cLanguage.\u201dIn any case, Roen had already dealt with the head maid. He sneered.The brothers chatted all night.* * *\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to piss off?\u201d\u201cFather gave me permission to be here though, so what say do you have about it, Sister?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe morning after their fateful meal yesterday was filled to the brim with tension. Having no choice but to take upon the guilty conscience of a sinner, Roen killed his presence as much as possible.\u201cHa.\u00a0No, wait, that\u2019s not what I wanted to say.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBut yeah, I\u2019m sorry! My words are completely sincere, so what gives! Brother\u2019s also bending over backwards to get your forgiveness, so why can\u2019t I do it too?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAs her younger brother continued to spout nonsense, Violet remained silent. Cairn scratched his head a few times and picked up the gauntlet in front of him to moisten his throat.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve realized that I was wrong. I mean,\u00a0um\u2026 At least give me a chance. Isn\u2019t it too much to say that I can never appear in front of you again?\u201dClatter.\u00a0As Violet had only been eating quietly while ignoring Cairn\u2019s pleas, she set down her fork. Hearing the stark sound, Roen flinched.\u201cCairn.\u201d\u201c\u2026Y-Yeah?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say the same thing before? \u2018Don\u2019t ever show yourself in front of me again. Not in front of Aileen either. Unless you\u2019re a brainless schmuck, you\u2019ll understand, won\u2019t you?\u2019 That\u2019s what you told me.\u201d\u201cDid I?\u201d\u201cLet me give you another example then. The first time you pulled out a sword and pointed it at my neck, it was because I poured cold water at Aileen and left her outside for two hours in the middle of winter.\u201d\u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not as if I\u2019m making excuses for my actions, but yes, I had slapped Aileen across the face because she was breaching proper etiquette, but you pulled out your sword and pointed it at me once again. I clearly said that it was Aileen who crossed me first, but you were utterly unyielding.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dCairn fell silent.Wearing a thin smile, Roen scooted away from Cairn as far as he could. On the other hand, the employees carried on with their duties, expressionless as always.\u201cTell me, what did you say each and every time?\u201d\u201cUm, I\u2026\u201dAs Violet\u2019s interrogation continued, Cairn\u2019s voice became smaller and smaller.\u201c\u2019I don\u2019t want to look at your face. At the very least, let me be comfortable, will you?\u2019\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cFor what?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou keep apologizing, but you don\u2019t seem to have a clue as to why you\u2019re spouting such a thing. You don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re sorry about.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLet me ask you again. What exactly are you apologizing to me about?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if you come to realize what your wrongdoings are, will the past change?\u201dAs Violet asked, Cairn could not answer.\u201cSure, like you said, I can at least give you a chance. But if I don\u2019t, people will look at me and deem me to be \u2018a villainess who can\u2019t even accept someone\u2019s sincere apologies\u2019.\u201d\u201cSister, I\u2014\u201d\u201cDo as you please. You won\u2019t listen to whatever I have to say anyway.\u201dViolet rose from her seat. Despite having dropped truth bombs one after another, she left without regard to those who remained, and she walked out of the dining hall with only Mary.\u201cCairn.\u201d\u201c\u2026Uuurgh.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Besides, he\u2019d have to go back to the academy by the new semester.Complacently thinking like so, Violet left her seat with her chin raised\u2014a wordless taunt for Cairn to do as he would please.All the while, she had no clue that Cairn had already taken a leave of absence.* * *Perhaps overly eager, Cairn offered to be Violet\u2019s escort knight as part of his apology. Perhaps overly tired of it by now, Violet repeatedly rebuffed him.Though his actions were referred to as an \u2018escort mission\u2019, it was actually closer to \u2018stalking\u2019, and thus Violet kept having to see that detestable face every minute of the day. It had come to a point that Violet just resigned herself to her bedroom, not going out.\u201cI told you to keep things moderate.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t until Roen stepped up and mediated the situation that Cairn finally let Violet reclaim her personal space.From Cairn\u2019s point of view though, it was only natural to give his all on this escort mission.Because of her notoriety, there would definitely be quite a lot of people who mocked and tried to pick a fight with the ducal lady.If any of that happened on his watch, Cairn would punish those people right away.It was a relationship formed under a simple understanding, but with all this talk about reputation and stigma, Violet was hearing all about this for the first time.She never paid it any mind before. Who exactly was out there who\u2019d pick a fight with her or try to sully her reputation?The juvenile knight, who had yet to step away from adolescence and into adulthood, was just trying to get things to go back to the way it had been, before any of this happened.Thinking in simple terms about everything, this was the best conclusion that he arrived at.However, Werchen was not the Everett estate, and Violet was in the kind of position where\u2014even if Cairn was not by her side\u2014nobody would try to pick a fight with her.Violet was the ducal lady especially cherished by Young Duke Roen, who was going to be the next household head of the duchy.No matter the extent of her notoriety, it was inevitably going to be a problem if anyone would mess with her.As a result, Cairn\u2019s actions were nothing but useless. Roen could only acknowledge his younger brother\u2019s strong will.\u201cI recommend that you do a rotation for the escort mission from now on, and in your free time, go ahead and train. Ah, and since you\u2019re here at the townhouse, I\u2019ve called in a tutor who you\u2019ll have culture classes with. I know you must have learned your fair share of liberal arts at the academy, but honestly, you need to retake those classes. It was really hard to get a hold of a tutor.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dIt was because of this that Violet finally had time off from looking at Cairn\u2019s face.Thank goodness for that.In any case, now that Violet was rid of that source of stress, she quickly got out of bed.Life afterwards was straightforward. Amongst the many letters and invitations that Violet received, she had to sift through only a small fraction. Most had already been filtered out by the servants, then the rest were further filtered by Roen himself.Thus, her days were occupied by sleeping, eating and exercising. She drew and painted once in a while, and she went people watching, too. She had a couple conversations here and there as well.She often went on outings and was friendly to the people on the streets. As Cairn followed Violet one step away, he couldn\u2019t help but be surprised by how much his older sister had truly changed.Normally, when one person would like to approach someone else, they should know how to keep a proper, safe distance first.Cairn did not know this, so he drew Violet\u2019s anger more times than one.The boy had never been conscious of other people\u2019s feelings in his whole life, but now, he was finally beginning to learn how to.Violet\u2019s anger was silent\u2014like the ashes of an already extinguished flame. Even so, this anger still proved to be detrimental as scorching embers still remained.One wrong move, and you\u2019d be left with severe burns on your hands.That aside, Cairn realized anew that it was possible to be hurt by just one glance.It had only been a few days, but this was enough time for people to get to know one another.Violet knew Cairn well enough, but Cairn did not know much about Violet. Before this, he thought that his older sister only knew how to be angry and how to punish people with corporeal means.Now, however, he found out that, rather than being surrounded by noise, she preferred quietude.And, she did not get angry easily unless someone was rude to her first.Wasn\u2019t it that she nearly drowned to death in a lake?\u00a0Cairn thought.Cairn had no idea that Violet started changing since the day she died and lived again. While staring at the back of his older sister, he scratched his head, perplexed.\u2018Have I been misunderstanding her until now?\u2019As the days went on and the boy\u2019s self-reflection deepened, Violet suddenly prepared to go out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Perhaps it was a side effect of her near death experience, or perhaps it\u2019s because her memories of her past life had mixed everything up. Maybe it was because of both.Violet realized that she mostly recalled only unpleasant things whenever she would try to look through her memories. It\u2019s annoying.Cairn insisted that he should follow her to the tea party as well, but Roen thankfully blocked him. Not only Violet would be uncomfortable, but also the person who invited her. It would be quite awkward if an uninvited son of a duke were to come.* * *It didn\u2019t take long to reach the marquis\u2019s mansion.Violet was the only one invited.Starting from the moment she alighted her carriage, the employees of the marquisate did their best to serve Violet with great care and attention.Somehow having this ticklish feeling within her, Violet schooled her features into a neutral expression.\u201cSalutations, Lady of the Everett Duchy. It\u2019s been three years, hasn\u2019t it? I hope you\u2019ll have an enjoyable time today.\u201d\u201cThank you for the invitation, Madam. And thank you for not forgetting me even after these three years.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, how can I forget you? Now, this way.\u201dTheir formal greetings, as dictated by courtesy, were now out of the way. And, the role of guiding Violet went from the butler and to the marchioness.Marchioness Leshan was a brunette beauty who looked younger than how old she actually was. Her hair was a light shade of brown.With Violet and the marchioness walking side by side, they seemed to be the picture of cordial regard.\u201cToday\u2019s tea party will take place in this garden. I was going to call my daughter as well, but you might not have preferred that. You\u2019ll only be talking to this old lady, but I hope you\u2019ll feel at ease.\u201d\u201cOf course, Madam. Please feel free to talk to me comfortably as well.\u201dThe marchioness led Violet to a well-maintained garden. It was relatively small, but it was very different compared to the Everett household\u2019s garden. There was a yellow glow everywhere, and somehow, it felt like a fairy garden.\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful garden. It\u2019s so pretty that I even have the urge to draw it.\u201d\u201cOh my, truly?\u00a0Fufu,\u00a0I personally oversee its upkeep. Isn\u2019t it a relief that you like it, Lady?\u201dThe marchioness laughed pleasantly once more. The atmosphere was amicable. When the neatly dressed attendant came forward to pour them some tea, a refreshing scent wafted through the air.The fresh scent of tea mixed with the lush scent of the greenery around them filled the air. The refreshments prepared alongside the tea were also carefully handpicked to suit Violet\u2019s preferences.Once again, Violet realized just how considerate the marchioness was towards her.\u201cBy the way, Lady, you have quite the unique outfit. I don\u2019t know much about what type of fashion the young ladies prefer these days, but still.\u201d\u201cAh. It\u2019s just that I found the capital\u2019s style of dress to be very cumbersome. It\u2019s difficult to breathe in those clothes.\u201d\u201cOf course, I know that as well. My daughter truly dislikes it as well, I believe? As expected, going back to the classics is still the best. Your clothes are very unique and sophisticated\u2014 May I know where you acquired them tailored?\u201dThough the marchioness admitted that she wasn\u2019t versed in the current fashion trends, she nonetheless looked very interested in clothes.Violet paused for a moment, gathering her thoughts. She decided to answer with a moderate mixture of the truth, and as the marchioness listened, she looked very pleased.\u201cIndeed! It\u2019s important to seek out talented people. I see that Everett\u2019s Young Duke already has that kind of eye for people. I must quickly get a hold of the young seamstress and make some orders before her name gets out there.\u201dAnyone\u2019s first impression of the marchioness was just how elegant she was, but she was also a woman of wit and humor.Was this also how Violet viewed Marchioness Leshan three years ago? As she smiled, she tried to wade through her memories.\u201cFufu,\u00a0I\u2019m glad to see that you seem to have changed quite a bit, Lady. You were already pretty three years ago, but you\u2019ve become even prettier now.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Thank you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not just talking about your outward appearance. You seem more at ease now, and compared to back then, you express yourself more freely with such a natural smile. Really, how very pretty.\u201dThe marchioness was endlessly comfortable with Violet. No one had ever treated her with such affability before, so she didn\u2019t know how to react. Even so, the marchioness continued.\u201cYou resemble your maternal grandmother so much. You remember her, yes? Countess Blaise. She had already become a star before you were born, Lady, but she truly was such a beautiful person.\u201d\u201cMy maternal grandmother?\u201d\u201cYes, your maternal grandmother. And, Lily\u2019s mother! Whenever I went to Lily\u2019s house before, your grandmother welcomed me so kindly.\u201d\u201cLily?\u201d\u201cGoodness, look at me reminiscing. It\u2019s the nickname I had for your mother. You know, it\u2019s an exclusive nickname of mine that not even Duke Everett is allowed to use.\u201dWith a smile, the marchioness winked. Understanding the meaning behind it, Violet quietly responded with a smile of her own.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Painting of the Villainess as a Young LadyCH 95Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNovel InfoNovel InfoA+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cThank you for allowing me to hear such a pleasant story. I rarely ever get to hear about my mother and my extended family on her side.\u201d\u201cOh, am I the only one who mentioned them? What to do. The older I get, the more I become a chatterbox.\u201d\u201cNo, really, I appreciate it because I don\u2019t hear much about her in Everett. If you don\u2019t mind, may I hear more about my mother?\u201d\u201cOf course! I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ll be surprised to hear what Lily was like when she was young.\u201dTheir teatime continued amidst this friendly mood.The marchioness mainly told stories of the late duchess, who was her close friend. The Lady of Blaise had a weak constitution, but she was very active. And, as she was also more confident than anyone else, people thought of her as a very unusual person.The marchioness had exchanged letters with the late duchess up until just before her demise. As she spoke of these stories, her eyes moistened.\u201cI remember getting a letter from her once that said, \u2018I didn\u2019t know that I\u2019d have so many worries as a mother now. My own mom told me before how she thinks I should have a daughter who resembles\u00a0you, but really\u2014 little does she know, my daughter turned out to be more like me!\u201dFeeling a bit embarrassed for no reason, Violet only sipped her tea and said nothing.\u201cShe really was a good friend. She was such a good person who cared about many people, even though she had been clearly ill. Even now, I still miss her a lot.\u201dBecause the marchioness told many stories of her mother before marriage, Violet happened to hear the love story between her mother and father.As she listened, she busily munched on the refreshments.In Violet\u2019s memories, the duchess was always sick.She couldn\u2019t remember much of her mother, but she remembered feeling warm and cozy around her.As Violet was now the version of herself who could recall her past life\u2019s memories, even that of Yeon Ha-yoon\u2019s mother, she raised her head as the marchioness uttered the next words.\u201cThat\u2019s why I was so worried. When I was your chaperone three years ago, I heard a lot of rumors.\u201d\u201cAh. I was immature back then, so it\u2019s natural.\u201d\u201cYou heard about them too?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOhoho.\u00a0I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s bad. You were as prickly as a thorn three years ago, but you had behaved very well. I couldn\u2019t tell you this before because the thorns around you were much too sharp.\u201dEmbarrassed again, Violet sipped her tea.Marchioness Leshan smiled gracefully.\u201cSo, I do feel that it\u2019s really nice to meet you again now. I\u2019m not just saying that. You know that, yes?\u201d\u201c\u2026Of course.\u201dFeeling all choked up for no reason, Violet slowly answered with a smile.And the marchioness smiled back warmly.* * *Violet had no trust in people.She had been hurt by those people, and she always put up thorn-like walls around her because she did not want to get hurt. After having been betrayed over and over again, her heart barely managed to heal, yet she still remained to be closed off to others.Truthfully, it\u2019s not as if there had been no one at her side at all. It\u2019s just that\u2014 Violet S. Everett did not trust anyone.There were many people around Violet who wanted to talk to her, but she never noticed.Recalling this, Violet quickly sorted through her feelings and put on a smile. It\u2019s impossible for the marchioness not to know of her inner thoughts. With her hands clasped together, she placed her elbows on the table and set her chin upon the back of her fingers.\u201cIt\u2019s very, very nice to see you again, really. Lily must also be feeling relieved of her worries now.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cI heard that you\u2019re getting along with your family these days? And, oh! Is it true that the Third Young Master was sitting like a homeless man in front of Everett\u2019s townhouse recently?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHohoho.\u00a0It must be true, but it\u2019s alright. Growing children naturally get into fights.\u201dBut if I get into a fight twice, I\u2019ll surely die.\u00a0Violet did not add that thought. Marchioness Leshan looked really happy.The marchioness\u2019s merry chatter continued. Violet listened to her stories with a smile.While they talked for a long time, the marchioness suddenly asked a question.\u201cBy the way, is there a reason you started painting?\u201d\u201cA reason?\u201d\u201cYes, I heard that you\u2019ve taken to creating art these days. I can\u2019t help but feel that you\u2019re much brighter now due to your new hobby.\u201dWhen asked by the marchioness, Violet felt her pupils starting to quiver, but she soon smiled.The marchioness was truly quick on the uptake. Except, Violet was in a terrible slump right now.Contemplating what to answer for a long while, Violet replied.\u201cBecause I want to run away.\u201d\u201cTo run away?\u201d\u201cI needed something that I could do freely. Something that I could do, where I can be myself without being intruded upon by others.\u201d\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you turned to painting.\u201dThe moment she answered the marchioness\u2019s question, it\u2019s as if Violet was given the solution to a problem that\u2019s been bothering her for a long time.Now that she didn\u2019t have to run away, it\u2019s only natural that she now felt at ease. In both her past life and present life, there were still countless reasons why she started painting, but that one particular reason had served to be the most important.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNovel InfoNovel Info",
